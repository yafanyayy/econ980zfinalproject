As always, I hope our comments today find you and your loved ones healthy and safe. 
As we put 2020 behind us, we've unfortunately experienced a tumultuous start to 2021, highlighted by the political and ideological divide in our nation as well as ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic across the U.S., U.K., and other countries around the world. Even so, I remain optimistic about the year ahead and to improvements in our geopolitical, macroeconomic and pandemic-related situations, and I'm confident in VF's plan to accelerate growth, continue advancing our business model transformation and deliver on our commitments to our shareholders and stakeholders around the world. VF's performance during the third quarter was largely ahead of expectations despite additional COVID-related disruption to our business. Consumer engagement with our brands remain strong, and we have conviction that the secular trends related to casualization, health, and wellness and the desire to get outdoors will be enduring. Our business is on track to return to growth in the fourth quarter, and I am confident that the strategy we have in place positions us well to accelerate growth as we head into fiscal 2022. 
I'd like to begin my prepared remarks today with a brief recap of where we left things on our October call. At that time, our business had essentially fully reopened across the globe, and the underlying business trends had continued to stabilize. We saw strong momentum in China and across our digital platform, which we continue to view as leading indicators for our business. Confidence from this momentum as well as early signs of stability and recovery across our portfolio more broadly, supported our preliminary outlook for fiscal 2021 and the decision to raise our dividend. Further, in early November, we announced the acquisition of Supreme. Our willingness to execute the transaction during the pandemic was a function of the resiliency of Supreme's business model, our early and decisive actions to ensure liquidity as well as our increased confidence in the trajectory of our organic portfolio. Fast forward to today, our business has continued to perform ahead of expectations and are confident in visibility heading into fiscal 2022 continues to improve. While the environment has proven to be somewhat more difficult than expected, the performance of our business demonstrates the resilience of our portfolio. 
While the full extent of these headwinds was not contemplated in our initial fiscal 2021 outlook, we were able to more than absorb these impacts as a result of the continued strength of our digital and China businesses as well as better-than-expected performance from our North Face and Timberland brands globally. As a result of the momentum, we see building across our portfolio, fueled by our business model transformation, coupled with the closing of the Supreme transaction, we are raising our fiscal 2021 outlook. Scott will impact the details in a moment. 
Before getting into the highlights for the quarter, I'd like to provide an update on our progress against our business model transformation. Understanding and focusing on our consumer connectivity is at the heart of our transformation journey. Our teams continue to activate capabilities to better understand and build more intimate relationships with our consumers, digitize the go-to-market process and enhance and integrate the online and off-line consumer experience. The continued impact of the pandemic has forced an ongoing reaffirmation of our priorities, and we remain committed to both the near-term brand-specific initiatives and long-term enterprise-wide platform investments. Continued investment behind our transformation is critical to our success and long-term growth aspirations. I'm pleased with the significant progress we've made throughout 2020, as evidenced by the resiliency of our performance during this past holiday season, and the momentum that is building across our portfolio as we head into fiscal 2022. 
A recent proof point of these accelerated initiatives has been enabling our brands to build omnichannel consumer journeys and optimize supply chain efficiency. On our last call, we shared that ship-from-store functionality was activated across the majority of our Vans and North Face full-price stores ahead of the holiday season. Specifically within our EMEA platform, our teams engineered homegrown solutions to deliver buy online, pickup in store, ship from store and reserve online, buy in store right before lockdown measures applied across the region. These businesses were able to utilize retail inventories and leverage ship-from-store capabilities when the stores were forced to shut down, supporting an 81% increase in digital revenue. Phase 2 of this project is currently underway with the plan to go live in the coming months, including save the sale functionality, which will allow our brands to leverage retail inventory when an item is out of stock online. 
Turning to our brand highlights from the quarter. Vans' revenue continued to sequentially improve, declining 8% as 48% growth in digital was more than offset by brick-and-mortar store reclosures in the Americas and EMEA markets. The brand accelerated to 9% growth in APAC, led by 58% digital growth and 21% growth in China. From a product standpoint, all-weather MTE styles increased at a double-digit rate, and the ultra range increased high single digits as Vans' consumers turn to more outdoor- and active-oriented franchises. Vans ranked #1 among the largest brands during the Singles day on Tmall, gaining 700,000 new consumers. Also in November, Vans Customs launched on Tmall, becoming the first global brand offering a full customization engine on this platform. The collaboration with Bape drove the launch, generating 870,000 unique visitors on the customs site that day. The Vans family member base continued to grow globally with membership approaching 14 million consumers. Although the headline number for Vans reflects the challenging brick-and-mortar operating environment in the U.S. and Europe, we remain confident in the underlying trajectory of the business and expect at least low double-digit growth in the fourth quarter on a reported basis. Continued momentum in China and across the digital platform, normalized inventory levels across all regions and strong consumer growth and engagement to support the brand's return to growth beginning in the fourth quarter. 
Moving on to the North Face. Revenue declined 2% with continued sequential improvement in the Americas and double-digit growth in Europe and Asia. Europe remains a bright spot for the brand with 17% growth, including 112% digital growth, offsetting the impact of significant store closures in the region. Global TNF digital increased 61%, with accelerated growth across all regions, driving a return to positive growth in D2C. In North America, the VIP loyalty program grew 840,000 sign-ups, a more than 90% increase versus last year. TNF continued to drive a significant increase in consumer engagement through authentic and purpose-led marketing activations. Core off-mountain icons, such as the NUPS franchise performed well. And the TNF-Gucci collab generated tremendous brand energy with over 15 billion media impressions since its December launch. Yes, you heard that right, over 15 billion media impressions since its December launch. On-mountain product also performed well, highlighted by future light expansion deeper into the product assortment, leading to triple-digit growth versus the prior year. The new footwear platform, [ Vective ], has been well received, exceeding our initial sell-in targets for this spring's launch. We are pleased with the performance of the North Face and encouraged by the brand's strong momentum heading into next year. On a reported basis, we now expect fiscal 2021 revenue for the North Face to decline less than 10%, including greater than 20% growth during the fourth quarter. 
Timberland revenue declined 17%. Relative strength from apparel and positive growth in both outdoor footwear and the Pro business were more than offset by softness in classic footwear, which was significantly impacted by limited inventory availability. Timberland continues to drive brand energy with key influencers and retailers through high-profile collaborations and the launch of new franchises. The new Work Summit Boot was launched this quarter, contributing to record traffic to Timberland Pro's digital site, which saw more than 100% growth. We're encouraged by the opportunity for TrueCloud, a new innovative, eco-friendly franchise made from renewable and recycled materials. And Green Stride, a new franchise anchored in outdoor. While still early, I'm pleased with Timberland's progress in the evolution and diversification of Timberland's new and innovative product portfolio. Continued momentum from Timberland Pro, apparel and nonclassic footwear, coupled with improving demand and inventory levels for core classics, position the Timberland brand for continued progress heading into fiscal 2022. 
Dickies' revenue increased 7%, with strong demand across all regions, and growth across all channels. The work-inspired lifestyle product portfolio continues to develop at a rapid pace, increasing at a double-digit rate across all 3 regions. Work-inspired lifestyle product now represents about 1/3 of global brand revenue. Brand interest accelerated in the quarter, over-indexed towards the key 18- to 24-year old consumer demographic supported by the United by Dickies global campaign and focus on the brand's ICON stories. 
Finally, we are thrilled to have closed on the acquisition of Supreme. This move is further validation of the actions we've taken over the past 4 years to position our portfolio into those parts of the market where there is strong consumer engagement and demand. We are confident that the Supreme transaction will serve as a spark for another layer of transformative growth and value creation for VF and our stakeholders. 
In early January, we announced a transformation plan for APAC operations. This represents the first significant action under project enable. Highlights include the following: We will transition our brand center of operations to Shanghai; we will transition the Asia product supply hub to Singapore, while also redeploying some of the product supply talent and resources throughout primary sourcing countries to work more closely with key suppliers and drive greater efficiency; we will establish an additional shared services center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to serve as the home for essential activities within our enterprise functions. As you would expect, we will take great care as we move through the transition process during the next 12 to 18 months. And as always, we are committed to supporting the personal needs of all impacted and relocating associates and their families. 
So to close, I want to thank our people for their incredible efforts throughout 2020 as we balance navigating the dynamic near-term environment, while remaining focused on our long-term priorities and business transformation. I'm encouraged by the recent performance and resilience of our business and optimistic about the growth outlook for our brands as we move into fiscal 2022 and beyond. As we said from the onset of the pandemic, with great change comes great opportunity. I am confident VF will emerge from this pandemic in an even stronger position, ready to build upon our storied history and established track record of delivering strong returns to all stakeholders. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Scott."

What a year. Beginning with the unprecedented enterprise preservation actions at the onset of the pandemic, to the acquisition of Supreme, this has been an unbelievable period for VF, and I'm grateful for the work that's been done by our teams around the globe to position us for growth and success moving forward. 
To recap, our quick and decisive actions to ensure liquidity have allowed us continued investing throughout this disruptive period, highlighted by our ability to acquire Supreme, a perfect complement to our portfolio and accelerant to our long-term strategy and transformation agenda. Our aggressive control of inventory, while prioritizing newness, has allowed us to maintain brand momentum while positioning us for a return to profitable growth from the beginning of the fourth quarter and into the next fiscal year. And our sharp control on discretionary spending and the launch of Project Enable presents a tailwind toward operating leverage moving forward and the ability to direct more dollars to our highest priority growth investments. 
So while the near-term environment remains noisy, including lockdowns, store closures and inventory constraints, I could not be more pleased with the overall health of our enterprise and the composition of our portfolio heading into next year. 
I'll open with a quick update on Supreme, which I know is of interest to many of you. As announced on December 28, we closed the acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion, subject to customary adjustments. We expect Supreme to contribute about $125 million of revenue and $0.05 of adjusted earnings to the fourth quarter fiscal 2021. As disclosed at announcement, we expect Supreme to contribute at least $500 million of revenue and at least $0.20 of adjusted earnings in fiscal 2022. We're now moving into the integration phase and carefully onboarding Supreme into the VF family, focused on applying the appropriate amount of governance and oversight where needed while maintaining a light touch approach in other areas to avoid overburdening the brand. We're committed to keeping it business as usual for the brand and its teams while, at the same time, understanding how we can begin to enable the brand's growth and strategic vision while activating synergy opportunities where appropriate. While it's early days, there's a lot of excitement about the future among both the VF and Supreme teams, and we're off to a great start. 
Moving on to an overview of the operating environment across the regions. Starting with the Americas, continued virus-related lockdowns and disruption present near-term challenges. With that said, the Outdoor and active categories continue to outpace overall apparel performance and demand trends have remained resilient. Retailer inventories appear to be well positioned exiting the holiday season but do remain abnormally low in certain categories and channels. Despite continued traffic headwinds, our Americas business sequentially improved with nearly 50% digital growth, offset by store closure headwinds. 
Moving on to the EMEA region, where we've seen a second wave of the virus introduced more severe lockdown measures than previously anticipated. As a result, the broader EU economy has been among the hardest hit by the pandemic this quarter. As the vaccine rollout is starting across Europe, the region is bracing for another wave of COVID-19, and the U.K. recently extended more restrictive lockdowns until February. There are reasons for optimism, however, with digital acceleration continuing throughout the region, as we've seen across our own brands and with our digital partners, such as Zalando and ASOS. VF's EMEA digital business grew more than 80% in the quarter. Despite half of our brick-and-mortar stores being closed for a large portion of the quarter, the EMEA region saw meaningful sequential improvement and returned to positive growth on a reported basis. 
Finally, the APAC region continues to offer greater stability than any other, even as the effects of the pandemic leaner. China has seen a pickup in consumer spending with positive growth in apparel and footwear categories. We continue to view APAC as the leading indicator of the larger macroeconomic environment. Our Mainland China business grew 15%, led by strength at Vans, which grew 21%. The D2C business in Mainland China accelerated to 20% growth, led by 24% growth in digital. China retail partner inventory continues to improve, and our partner comp sales returned to growth this quarter. We're excited by the continued momentum in China and have high confidence in our outlook of 20% growth this year. 
Now turning to highlights from the quarter. Total VF revenue declined 8%, in line with our expectations. International declined 4% as a 4% decline in EMEA was offset by 1% growth in APAC, including 11% growth in Greater China. Our D2C business also declined 4%, driven by store closures and continued soft traffic in the Americas and EMEA. Our digital business grew 49% with strong performance across virtually every brand in the portfolio. Including our pure-play digital wholesale partners, our total digital business represented about 1/3 of total revenue in the quarter. We now expect D2C digital revenue growth to exceed 50% for fiscal 2021 on a reported basis. And including our digital wholesale business, we expect total digital penetration to approach 30% for the year. 
Gross margin contracted 150 basis points to 55.7%, the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement aided by moderating promotional activity. The decline versus last year was primarily driven by higher levels of promotion and 90 basis points from FX transaction, partially offset by 90 basis points of favorable mix benefit. While the promotional environment remains a headwind, it has evolved slightly better than our expectations. As we move into the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2022, we expect the impact of promotions and discounting to continue to moderate. 
Our SG&A spending declined about 4% relative to last year as we returned to more normalized levels of strategic investment spending, including demand creation approaching historical levels of investment. As expected, we did experience cost pressure from higher freight and distribution expenses, although these were more than offset by reductions in discretionary spending and leverage elsewhere throughout the cost base. We expect to continue to invest in our strategic priorities in the fourth quarter as we return to growth. 
Inventories were down 14% at the end of the third quarter. Consistent with our prior expectations, we expect to exit our fiscal year in March with inventories at equilibrium in support of our forward growth outlook. We also see relatively clean inventory levels at retail globally, positioning our brands for a return to more profitable growth heading into next year. As expected, service and in-stock levels improved as COVID-related disruptions had less of an impact in the quarter. 
Our liquidity position remains strong. We ended Q3 with approximately $3.9 billion of cash and short-term investments, in addition to roughly $2 billion remaining undrawn on our revolver. After funding the Supreme acquisition, we expect to exit fiscal 2021 with more than $1.5 billion in cash and nearly $2 billion remaining undrawn on our revolver. 
Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent, supported by our robust liquidity position. We remain fully committed to growing our dividend, which continues to be an integral part of our TSR model. Our share repurchase program remains on hold as we focus on deleveraging the balance sheet following the acquisition of Supreme. 
So now turning to our updated outlook. We are raising our fiscal 2021 outlook and now expect full year revenue to be between $9.1 billion and $9.2 billion and full year EPS of approximately $1.30. The increase in our outlook includes the accretion from Supreme in the fourth quarter results, implying a modestly higher outlook for the organic business. We're also raising our free cash flow outlook to approximately $650 million. 
I know many of you are eager to understand our initial expectations for fiscal 2022. While it's too early to provide a preliminary outlook at this time, I will provide a few high-level comments to help you understand how we're thinking about the evolution of our business as we head into next year. Overall, we see an improving consumer backdrop, particularly in our core categories, along with brand momentum across our largest properties globally. The accelerated shift towards digital in China are beneficial to our fundamentals and recent portfolio actions are immediately accretive to our revenue growth and margin profile. We continue to see encouraging signs of stabilization in the retail marketplace and a normalization of inventory flows from a healthier supply chain. We intend to continue to distort investment towards our strategic priorities and business model transformation in support of our powerful brand portfolio. Taken together, I remain optimistic about the strength of our growth algorithm going forward, and I'm confident in our ability to emerge from this crisis in an advantaged position. The portfolio actions we've taken over the last 5 years have left us well positioned to continue delivering superior returns to our shareholders. 
So now, I'll turn the call back to the operator, and we'll take your questions."

I think today, you said you'd be looking for some areas of synergy where appropriate. Obviously, you continue to mention to us. You want to leave that business alone as it's doing a nice job. But I'm trying to think of how best to think about what the size of Project Enable efficiencies could be. Do you envision flowing that through at all as you start to roll that project out?

Yes, relative to Enable, we talked about $125 million of benefit over roughly a 3-year period. Today, you saw in the comments, the first major action under Project Enable related to our Asia Pacific business.",555,"Sure, Michael. And thanks for the 2 questions. Yes, relative to Enable, we talked about $125 million of benefit over roughly a 3-year period. Today, you saw in the comments, the first major action under Project Enable related to our Asia Pacific business. The 2 components of that are building on our already present Shanghai front-end business focused on China and moving most of the remaining jobs from Hong Kong to Shanghai. And then on the supply chain, really 2 things strategically, moving into country more closer to the sourcing locations, which has a labor arbitrage benefit, in addition to being just better able to manage the business and then moving to Singapore, which obviously, in Kuala Lumpur, which also has financial benefits. 
But I guess, Michael, the way that I think in my prepared remarks, I said, Enable is not about cost, it's fundamentally about transformation and realigning our business, but it does have a cost benefit. Obviously, the $125 million. And so the way I would think about this modeling going forward is while we've got a lot of incremental investments around the transformation, specifically around digital and some capabilities around consumer data, et cetera, rather than those being incremental and being a drain, we're looking at redeploying cost and offsetting many of those so that we can see leverage in the SG&A base over time. 
Another question related to this that you might have. This is some big actions that we just announced today, what does that mean from a cash flow standpoint going forward? Well, the -- both the restructuring and some of the outgoing costs will happen over time as well the benefits. So we don't see a material impact in any particular quarter from a cash-on-cash basis. So hopefully, that gives you some color there. We really see this as a way to maintain leverage in the SG&A base and redeploy costs so that we can offset the transformational investments that we see coming and have been investing in, frankly, over time. 
As it relates to Supreme, yes, we -- the point that I think you're referring to at the time of acquisition, the modeling that we put out really assumes very, very limited and essentially no synergies. We said that doesn't mean that we don't see the opportunity, but it also is recognizing this is a beautiful, simple machine. And we don't want to mess it up, frankly. And we -- this business -- this acquisition was based on strategy and opportunity and a new growth vector. They have beautiful fundamentals already. And we don't need synergies to make the deal work economically. That was really the intent of the earlier comments. Having said that, as we engage with the team, and they're going to lead this, where they have opportunities for growth, think new geographies, for example, where they're not present, we absolutely see opportunities to reduce friction and create some leverage with our strong platforms in these new geographies. The point we were making is that wasn't factored into the deal economics. So as we get further down this integration path, and we're just starting, my expectation is we'll find those areas of synergies. And when we do, we'll talk about that and update the -- any guidance that we have relative to the accretion there."

So 90 days ago, we didn't -- we were essentially open for business in all geographies, and we didn't anticipate that we would have these reclosures and you're seeing the impact of that. So as it relates just to the guide this year, that's really the primary driver. Remember also, I mean, you have wholesale doors in the same regions as well.

Yes, the -- first of all, just to bring you back and remind you of the glide path that we expected on gross margin. And generally, notwithstanding the the Vans brick-and-mortar comment that I just mentioned. Generally, we're seeing that develop, in fact, in the third quarter. We said promotional activity was slightly better than we had anticipated. And as we look to the fourth quarter, we really don't see any material change in the pace of markdowns or the promotional activity. What we do see is, and expect, is a modest decline in gross margin from previous expectations, think about maybe 100 basis points or so. And that's really driven by mix -- the difference in mix, right? So as you see less direct-to-consumer, you're going to see a little bit lower gross margin in the fourth quarter. 
Maybe to give you some confidence. As we look forward, we're not giving guidance in 2022, but I can give you a few data points that maybe will help you think about the go-forward picture. From a margin standpoint, we would expect 2022 margins to be back to historical peak levels, think about the organic business, 55.5%, plus some accretion from Supreme. So a little better -- we would expect margins -- gross margins to be a little better than even where we were pre-pandemic in the 2020 time frame, which I think is really kind of underneath what your question is. The other thing I would say is, remember, the actions that we took, while we're sure that it had some impact in terms of sales and some of the relative performance this year, constraining inventory, et cetera, the goal there was to emerge in a clean position and in a position to strength going into next year. So just remember, there's 2 sides to those impacts. The short-term disruption, but we believe we're setting ourselves up well for next year."

I'll go ahead and start. Scott, fill in if I miss anything here. I think we're very excited about the impact of our decisions the last few years to really invest behind our transformation and build this consumer-first mentality. We committed to get our digital to about 20% of our business when we met with everybody back in Beaver Creek, it seems like eons ago. And as we've gotten through this year, we've exceeded that number, about 23%, and combined with our U.S. wholesale, our digital penetration is about 30%. So I think what's important for us is really the penetration percent, but more about building these seamless connections between the virtual and the physical, and building those optimized consumer journeys that allow us to really meet our consumer where they are. So thinking about through a mobile-first mindset, the UX CX aspect of our platforms, thinking about the services required within our stores to be able to, not only optimize service, but optimize use of inventory. And I would just tell you that the store element of our direct-to-consumer strategy, long-term, is a very critical role on how we connect with consumers, but also how we bring technology. The store we've opened recently in Milan or Fiji is really a test case of blending technology with physical and building a higher level of engagement experience. So long answer, Alex, but it's really less about penetration, and it's more about these optimized consumer journeys through the seamless integration of both environments."

We see, I would say, improving sentiment going forward and continued constructive support from the wholesale channels, but still a conservative environment. So that's just general, right? And I would say our position hasn't materially changed either. We talked about in the early days of COVID, we're pretty darn aggressive on inventories. We now are getting to the point where we're normalizing, and we expect by the end of the year, I think we used the word equilibrium in terms of inventory positions versus forward sales, and that's both the retail comment and our own inventories. So our posture, Bob, is kind of, as we've said, and developing as we expected. We're still not in a normal environment, again, from an overall posture, but it continues to be more constructive. And again, we're super pleased with the way that our key retailers and partners have worked with us. Again, they're not canceling orders. Orders are sticky.

Our success there and how we balance between our own environments and their environments is really very critical. In Asia, we think of Ali as a wholesale partner. And comments we made about Vans being the #1 large brand during 11/11 and the first to launch a customs platform on the Ali customs environment, those types of opportunities come based on the strength of the relationships. And then if you think about our Dickies business here in the U.S. and their ability to service essential retail that has been opened throughout the pandemic, bring needed products to their consumers through those strong relationships, I would say this is one of our core go-to-market elements of our strategy, and it's always been a big part of VF's toolkit on how we really partner with and service those wholesale partners in the very best way."

First of all, as you look at the implied guidance, take the full year and back into the fourth quarter, I'd just remind you guys, there's a lot of noise here. We had a COVID quarter last year. We got a COVID quarter this year. Just one little sound bite for you to think about. We're trending very positive a year ago and then unwound our incentive comp as COVID dramatically changed the picture in the fourth quarter a year ago, and that's about a $50 million delta year-on-year that you're up against. And I just point that out just to remind you all, there's a lot of noise, and you got to be careful about making big assumptions on flow-through going forward without our guide here. And I know you're looking for that guide, John. So maybe this will help. 
Let me give you a little more shaping on 2022. First of all, just starting at the top of the P&L, we expect to get back to pre-COVID quarterly peak revenues at some point during next year, 2022. It could even happen as quickly as midyear, but there's uncertainty on what this glide path looks like exactly, but we do see getting back to those earnings. That's been a question that many of you have been asking us for quite a while and just wanted to give you that picture. I already talked about gross margin, what our expectations are for next year. As it relates to operating margin, one thing that we've seen this year that we -- I'll just own this myself, personally, we're not giving guidance. We don't have all the answers yet. But I would expect operating margin to be a little stickier in terms of the recovery. And the reason I say that is primarily in brick-and-mortar. We don't see a light switch here where all of a sudden, you're open and everything goes back to the kind of levels and the productivity that we saw previously. Vans is a good example of that, what we're seeing in this year's guide, right? The closures and reopenings, they're encouraging. Our brick-and-mortar is really profitable, but it was even more profitable at its peak. And the productivity that we saw based on traffic patterns pre-COVID versus when we reopen, people are nervous, right? And they're slower to come back. Every indication is they're going to come back and that we're going to see a longer-term path, that we're as confident as ever in brick-and-mortar, and it's an important part of our overall consumer delivery. But I would expect productivity in brick-and-mortar to lag a little bit in its recovery, and that probably puts a little drag. Really, that shows up in SG&A, but that will put a little drag into next year. So no from an LRP and long term earnings. The fact that we're seeing revenue -- line of sight on revenue, the fact that our gross margins are healthy, and we see a line of sight to get back to peak levels, we know that structural. Mix benefit is there. You see that this quarter. You'll see that in the fourth quarter. 90 basis points or so this quarter in mix. Our fastest-growing businesses are our highest gross margin. So that structural margin is there. Those are the factors. When the top line and margin is there, that gives me the confidence that, coupled with the optionality in the model, that we have a lot of confidence in our long-range plan. 
What could make that happen quicker or slower? It really is the consumer and how we emerge from this. And are people comfortable what happens with the vaccine, there's just a lot of uncertainties. And that's why we can't give you more granularity at this point on 2022. But as time goes on, a quarter from now when we report and give our guidance, our expectation is we'll have even better visibility and be able to give you a little more shaping on what 2022 should look like. So hopefully, that will help you. It's not exactly the full picture, but as you think about modeling, hopefully, that gives you some color there."

But I would say that we have a really constructive key partner base there. We have some unique partners there with Zalando and ASIS, for example, the digital titans, which really been resilient through this COVID period and been just wonderful partners with the brand, and that didn't happen by accident. Obviously, that's been cultivated over many years by Martino and our leadership in the Europe region. But it's been really resilient. And while order books are impacted by the shutdowns and whatnot, as people are bringing their inventories in line, our performance has really been exceptional and our inventories are in good shape.

It's been a really good story. And unfortunately, we haven't talked much about it. So that's what I would point out, and we have optimism. 
I mentioned the Outdoor brands the perspective -- my own personal perspective here is we've been on a journey on both Timberland and the North Face, and we, I think, have been very transparent in terms of what we see as the opportunities. It's really encouraging to see social media heat and the performance. I think we're leaving a little on the table is not a bad thing as we set up for next year. And that's encouraging. And as it relates to Vans, it's been high single -- or high-teen performer since our acquisition. And we have periods we have the noise, and we -- quarter-to-quarter, and I get it. You guys are looking at that, and it's a big part of the algorithm, but this is a powerful machine with many vectors. So as I look at the long term, I try to separate the short-term noise from what I believe is the long-term opportunity.

Vans and their connection to their consumers being one of their greatest strengths. We know the issues that have impacted our Vans business this next -- this year. We're extremely well positioned to gain momentum. Our optimism continues to be strong. 
In our emerging brands, our Ultra business, though small, has really had a good year, and we'll continue to build momentum as well SmartWool and Icebreaker, our Napa business, as we think about opportunities beyond its core markets in Europe. So I think every one of our business is extremely well positioned. The business model transformation that we have in place to really take that consumer understanding and apply that to our go-to-market set of choices and really proactively engage across those -- all those different touch points.

As always, I hope our comments today find you and your loved ones healthy and safe.  
As we put 2020 behind us, we've unfortunately experienced a tumultuous start to 2021, highlighted by the political and ideological divide in our nation as well as ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic across the U.S., U.K., and other countries around the world. 
Even so, I remain optimistic about the year ahead and to improvements in our geopolitical, macroeconomic and pandemic-related situations, and I'm confident in VF's plan to accelerate growth, continue advancing our business model transformation and deliver on our commitments to our shareholders and stakeholders around the world. 
VF's performance during the third quarter was largely ahead of expectations despite additional COVID-related disruption to our business. Consumer engagement with our brands remained strong, and we have conviction that the secular trends related to casualization, health and wellness and the desire to get outdoors will be enduring. Our business is on track to return to growth in the fourth quarter, and I am confident that the strategy we have in place positions us well to accelerate growth as we head into fiscal 2022.
I'd like to begin my prepared remarks today with a brief recap of where we left things on our October call. At that time, our business had essentially fully reopened across the globe, and the underlying business trends had continued to stabilize. We saw strong momentum in China and across our digital platform, which we continue to view as leading indicators for our business. 
Confidence from this momentum, as well as early signs of stability and recovery across our portfolio more broadly, supported our preliminary outlook for fiscal 2021 and the decision to raise our dividend. 
Further, in early November, we announced the acquisition of Supreme. Our willingness to execute the transaction during the pandemic was a function of the resiliency of Supreme's business model, our early and decisive actions to ensure liquidity as well as our increased confidence in the trajectory of our organic portfolio. 
Fast forward to today, our business has continued to perform ahead of expectations, and our confidence and visibility heading into fiscal 2022 continues to improve. While the environment has proven to be somewhat more difficult than expected, the performance of our business demonstrates the resilience of our portfolio.  
While the full extent of these headwinds was not contemplated in our initial fiscal 2021 outlook, we were able to more than absorb these impacts as a result of the continued strength of our digital and China businesses as well as better-than-expected performance from our North Face and Timberland brands globally. 
As a result of the momentum we see building across our portfolio, fueled by our business model transformation, coupled with the closing of the Supreme transaction, we are raising our fiscal 2021 outlook. Scott will unpack the details in a moment.  
Before getting into the highlights for the quarter, I'd like to provide an update on our progress against our business model transformation. Understanding and focusing on our consumer connectivity is at the heart of our transformation journey. Our teams continue to activate capabilities to better understand and build more intimate relationships with our consumers, digitize the go-to-market process and enhance and integrate the online and off-line consumer experience. 
The continued impact of the pandemic has forced an ongoing reaffirmation of our priorities, and we remain committed to both the near-term, brand-specific initiatives and long-term, enterprise-wide platform investments. 
Continued investment behind our transformation is critical to our success and long-term growth aspirations. I'm pleased with the significant progress we've made throughout 2020, as evidenced by the resiliency of our performance during this past holiday season and the momentum that is building across our portfolio as we head into fiscal 2022. 
A recent proof point of these accelerated initiatives has been enabling our brands to build omnichannel consumer journeys and optimize supply chain efficiency. On our last call, we shared that ship from store functionality was activated across the majority of our Vans and North Face full-price stores ahead of the holiday season. 
Specifically within our EMEA platform, our teams engineered homegrown solutions to deliver buy online, pickup in store, ship from store and reserve online, buy in store right before lockdown measures applied across the region. These businesses were able to utilize retail inventories and leverage ship from store capabilities when the stores were forced to shut down, supporting an 81% increase in digital revenue. 
Phase 2 of this project is currently underway with the plan to go live in the coming months, including save the sale functionality, which will allow our brands to leverage retail inventory when an item is out of stock online.  
Turning to our brand highlights from the quarter. Vans' revenue continued to sequentially improve, declining 8% as 48% growth in digital was more than offset by brick-and-mortar store reclosures in the Americas and EMEA markets. The brand accelerated to 9% growth in APAC, led by 58% digital growth and 21% growth in China. 
From a product standpoint, All Weather MTE styles increased at a double-digit rate, and the UltraRange increased high single digits as Vans' consumers turn to more outdoor- and active-oriented franchises. Vans ranked #1 among the largest brands during the Singles' Day on Tmall, gaining 700,000 new consumers. 
Also in November, Vans Customs launched on Tmall, becoming the first global brand offering a full customization engine on this platform. The collaboration with BAPE drove the launch, generating 870,000 unique visitors on the Customs site that day. 
The Vans family member base continued to grow globally, with membership approaching 14 million consumers. Although the headline number for Vans reflects the challenging brick-and-mortar operating environment in the U.S. and Europe, we remain confident in the underlying trajectory of the business and expect at least low double-digit growth in the fourth quarter on a reported basis. 
Continued momentum in China and across the digital platform, normalized inventory levels across all regions and strong consumer growth and engagement support the brand's return to growth beginning in the fourth quarter.  
Moving on to The North Face. Revenue declined 2%, with continued sequential improvement in the Americas and double-digit growth in Europe and Asia. Europe remains a bright spot for the brand with 17% growth, including 112% digital growth, offsetting the impact of significant store closures in the region. Global TNF digital increased 61%, with accelerated growth across all regions, driving a return to positive growth in D2C. In North America, the VIP loyalty program drew 840,000 sign-ups, a more than 90% increase versus last year. 
TNF continued to drive a significant increase in consumer engagement through authentic and purpose-led marketing activations. Core off-mountain icons, such as the Nuptse franchise performed well. And the TNF-Gucci collab generated tremendous brand energy, with over 15 billion media impressions since its December launch. Yes, you heard that right, over 15 billion media impressions since its December launch. 
On-mountain product also performed well, highlighted by FutureLight expansion deeper into the product assortment, leading to triple-digit growth versus the prior year. The new footwear platform, VECTIV, has been well received, exceeding our initial sell-in targets for this spring's launch. 
We are pleased with the performance of The North Face and encouraged by the brand's strong momentum heading into next year. On a reported basis, we now expect fiscal 2021 revenue for The North Face to decline less than 10%, including greater than 20% growth during the fourth quarter.  
Timberland revenue declined 17%. Relative strength from apparel and positive growth in both outdoor footwear and the PRO business were more than offset by softness in classic footwear, which was significantly impacted by limited inventory availability. 
Timberland continues to drive brand energy with key influencers and retailers through high-profile collaborations and the launch of new franchises. The new Work Summit boot was launched this quarter, contributing to record traffic to Timberland PRO's digital site, which saw more than 100% growth. We're encouraged by the opportunity for TrueCloud, a new innovative, eco-friendly franchise made from renewable and recycled materials. And Green Stride, a new franchise anchored in outdoor. 
While still early, I'm pleased with Timberland's progress in the evolution and diversification of Timberland's new and innovative product portfolio. Continued momentum from Timberland PRO, apparel and nonclassic footwear, coupled with improving demand and inventory levels for core classics, position the Timberland brand for continued progress heading into fiscal 2022.  
Dickies' revenue increased 7%, with strong demand across all regions and growth across all channels. The work-inspired lifestyle product portfolio continues to develop at a rapid pace, increasing at a double-digit rate across all 3 regions. Work-inspired lifestyle product now represents about 1/3 of global brand revenue. Brand interest accelerated in the quarter, over-indexed towards the key 18- to 24-year old consumer demographic supported by the United by Dickies global campaign and focus on the brand's Icons stories.  
Finally, we are thrilled to have closed on the acquisition of Supreme. This move is further validation of the actions we've taken over the past 4 years to position our portfolio into those parts of the market where there is strong consumer engagement and demand. We are confident that the Supreme transaction will serve as a spark for another layer of transformative growth and value creation for VF and our stakeholders.  
In early January, we announced a transformation plan for APAC operations. This represents the first significant action under Project Enable. Highlights include the following: We will transition our brand center of operations to Shanghai; we will transition the Asia product supply hub to Singapore, while also redeploying some of the product supply talent and resources throughout primary sourcing countries to work more closely with key suppliers and drive greater efficiency; we will establish an additional shared services center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to serve as the home for essential activities within our enterprise functions. 
As you would expect, we will take great care as we move through the transition process during the next 12 to 18 months. And as always, we are committed to supporting the personal needs of all impacted and relocating associates and their families.  
So to close, I want to thank our people for their incredible efforts throughout 2020 as we balance navigating the dynamic near-term environment, while remaining focused on our long-term priorities and business transformation. I'm encouraged by the recent performance and resilience of our business and optimistic about the growth outlook for our brands as we move into fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
As we said from the onset of the pandemic, with great change comes great opportunity. I am confident VF will emerge from this pandemic in an even stronger position, ready to build upon our storied history and established track record of delivering strong returns to all stakeholders.  
And now, I'll turn it over to Scott."

Our aggressive control of inventory, while prioritizing newness, has allowed us to maintain brand momentum while positioning us for a return to profitable growth from the beginning of the fourth quarter and into the next fiscal year. And our sharp control on discretionary spending and the launch of Project Enable presents a tailwind toward operating leverage moving forward and the ability to direct more dollars to our highest priority growth investments. 
So while the near-term environment remains noisy, including lockdowns, store closures and inventory constraints, I could not be more pleased with the overall health of our enterprise and the composition of our portfolio heading into next year. 
I'll open with a quick update on Supreme, which I know is of interest to many of you. As announced on December 28, we closed the acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion, subject to customary adjustments. We expect Supreme to contribute about $125 million of revenue and $0.05 of adjusted earnings to the fourth quarter fiscal 2021. 
As disclosed at announcement, we expect Supreme to contribute at least $500 million of revenue and at least $0.20 of adjusted earnings in fiscal 2022. 
We're now moving into the integration phase and carefully onboarding Supreme into the VF family, focused on applying the appropriate amount of governance and oversight where needed, while maintaining a light touch approach in other areas to avoid overburdening the brand. 
We're committed to keeping it business as usual for the brand and its teams, while at the same time understanding how we can begin to enable the brand's growth and strategic vision while activating synergy opportunities where appropriate. While it's early days, there's a lot of excitement about the future among both the VF and Supreme teams, and we're off to a great start. 
Moving on to an overview of the operating environment across the regions. Starting with the Americas, continued virus-related lockdowns and disruption present near-term challenges. With that said, the Outdoor and Active categories continue to outpace overall apparel performance and demand trends have remained resilient. Retailer inventories appear to be well positioned exiting the holiday season but do remain abnormally low in certain categories and channels. 
Despite continued traffic headwinds, our Americas business sequentially improved with nearly 50% digital growth, offset by store closure headwinds. 
Moving on to the EMEA region, where we've seen a second wave of the virus introduce more severe lockdown measures than previously anticipated. As a result, the broader EU economy has been among the hardest hit by the pandemic this quarter. As the vaccine rollout is starting across Europe, the region is bracing for another wave of COVID-19, and the U.K. recently extended more restrictive lockdowns until February. 
There are reasons for optimism, however, with digital acceleration continuing throughout the region, as we've seen across our own brands and with our digital partners, such as Zalando and Asos. 
VF's EMEA digital business grew more than 80% in the quarter. Despite half of our brick-and-mortar stores being closed for a large portion of the quarter, the EMEA region saw a meaningful sequential improvement and returned to positive growth on a reported basis. 
Finally, the APAC region continues to offer greater stability than any other, even as the effects of the pandemic's leaner. China has seen a pickup in consumer spending with positive growth in apparel and footwear categories. We continue to view APAC as the leading indicator of the larger macroeconomic environment. Our Mainland China business grew 15%, led by strength at Vans, which grew 21%. 
The D2C business in Mainland China accelerated to 20% growth, led by 24% growth in digital. China retail partner inventory continues to improve, and our partner comp sales returned to growth this quarter. We're excited by the continued momentum in China and have high confidence in our outlook of 20% growth this year. 
Now turning to highlights from the quarter. Total VF revenue declined 8%, in line with our expectations. International declined 4% as a 4% decline in EMEA was offset by 1% growth in APAC, including 11% growth in Greater China. Our D2C business also declined 4%, driven by store closures and continued soft traffic in the Americas and EMEA. 
Our digital business grew 49%, with strong performance across virtually every brand in the portfolio. Including our pure-play digital wholesale partners, our total digital business represented about 1/3 of total revenue in the quarter. We now expect D2C digital revenue growth to exceed 50% for fiscal 2021 on a reported basis. And including our digital wholesale business, we expect total digital penetration to approach 30% for the year. 
Gross margin contracted 150 basis points to 55.7%, the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement aided by moderating promotional activity. The decline versus last year was primarily driven by higher levels of promotion and 90 basis points from FX transaction, partially offset by 90 basis points of favorable mix benefit. 
While the promotional environment remains a headwind, it has evolved slightly better than our expectations. As we move into the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2022, we expect the impact of promotions and discounting to continue to moderate. 
Our SG&A spending declined about 4% relative to last year as we returned to more normalized levels of strategic investment spending, including demand creation approaching historical levels of investment. As expected, we did experience cost pressure from higher freight and distribution expenses, although these were more than offset by reductions in discretionary spending and leverage elsewhere throughout the cost base. We expect to continue to invest in our strategic priorities in the fourth quarter as we return to growth. 
Inventories were down 14% at the end of the third quarter. Consistent with our prior expectations, we expect to exit our fiscal year in March with inventories at equilibrium in support of our forward growth outlook. We also see relatively clean inventory levels at retail globally, positioning our brands for a return to more profitable growth heading into next year. As expected, service and in-stock levels improved as COVID-related disruptions had less of an impact in the quarter. 
Our liquidity position remains strong. We ended Q3 with approximately $3.9 billion of cash and short-term investments, in addition to roughly $2 billion remaining undrawn on our revolver. After funding the Supreme acquisition, we expect to exit fiscal 2021 with more than $1.5 billion in cash and nearly $2 billion remaining undrawn on our revolver. 
Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent, supported by our robust liquidity position. We remain fully committed to growing our dividend, which continues to be an integral part of our TSR model. Our share repurchase program remains on hold as we focus on deleveraging the balance sheet following the acquisition of Supreme. 
So now turning to our updated outlook. We are raising our fiscal 2021 outlook and now expect full year revenue to be between $9.1 billion and $9.2 billion, and full year EPS of approximately $1.30. The increase in our outlook includes the accretion from Supreme in the fourth quarter results, implying a modestly higher outlook for the organic business. We're also raising our free cash flow outlook to approximately $650 million. 
I know many of you are eager to understand our initial expectations for fiscal 2022. While it's too early to provide a preliminary outlook at this time, I will provide a few high-level comments to help you understand how we're thinking about the evolution of our business as we head into next year. 
Overall, we see an improving consumer backdrop, particularly in our core categories, along with brand momentum across our largest properties globally. The accelerated shift towards digital in China are beneficial to our fundamentals and recent portfolio actions are immediately accretive to our revenue growth and margin profile. 
We continue to see encouraging signs of stabilization in the retail marketplace and a normalization of inventory flows from a healthier supply chain. We intend to continue to distort investment towards our strategic priorities and business model transformation in support of our powerful brand portfolio. 
Taken together, I remain optimistic about the strength of our growth algorithm going forward, and I'm confident in our ability to emerge from this crisis in an advantaged position. The portfolio actions we've taken over the last 5 years have left us well positioned to continue delivering superior returns to our shareholders. 
So now, I'll turn the call back to the operator, and we'll take your questions."

I guess 2 changes I heard were that Project Enable should add some efficiency on the cost base. And I know before when we initially got your look at Supreme, you assumed no synergies in the guidance you gave us out of the gate. I think today, you said you'd be looking for some areas of synergy where appropriate. Obviously, you continue to mention to us you want to leave that business alone as it's doing a nice job. 
But I'm trying to think of how best to think about what the size of Project Enable efficiencies could be. Do you envision flowing that through at all as you start to roll that project out? Or is the plan to reinvest that in full? I'll just leave it there. I'd love to hear your thoughts on those."
191328,700595991,2182281,"V.F. Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","V.F. Corporation","Executives","Sure, Michael. And thanks for the 2 questions. Yes, relative to Enable, we talked about $125 million of benefit over roughly a 3-year period. Today, you saw in the comments, the first major action under Project Enable related to our Asia Pacific business.",554,"Sure, Michael. And thanks for the 2 questions. Yes, relative to Enable, we talked about $125 million of benefit over roughly a 3-year period. Today, you saw in the comments, the first major action under Project Enable related to our Asia Pacific business. The 2 components of that are building on our already present Shanghai front-end business focused on China and moving most of the remaining jobs from Hong Kong to Shanghai. 
And then on the supply chain, really 2 things strategically, moving into country more, closer to the sourcing locations, which has a labor arbitrage benefit in addition to being just better able to manage the business; and then moving to Singapore, which obviously -- in Kuala Lumpur, which also has financial benefits. 
But I guess, Michael, the way that I think in my prepared remarks I said, Enable is not about cost, it's fundamentally about transformation and realigning our business. But it does have a cost benefit, obviously the $125 million. And so the way I would think about this modeling going forward is while we've got a lot of incremental investments around the transformation, specifically around digital and some capabilities around consumer data, et cetera, rather than those being incremental and being a drain, we're looking at redeploying cost and offsetting many of those so that we can see leverage in the SG&A base over time. 
Another question related to this that you might have, this is some big actions that we just announced today, what does that mean from a cash flow standpoint going forward. Well, the -- both the restructuring and some of the outgoing costs will happen over time, as well the benefits. So we don't see a material impact in any particular quarter from a cash-on-cash basis. 
So hopefully, that gives you some color there. We really see this as a way to maintain leverage in the SG&A base and redeploy costs so that we can offset the transformational investments that we see coming and have been investing in, frankly, over time. 
As it relates to Supreme, yes, the point that I think you're referring to at the time of acquisition, the modeling that we put out really assumed very, very limited and essentially no synergies. We said that doesn't mean that we don't see the opportunity, but it also is recognizing this is a beautiful, simple machine and we don't want to mess it up, frankly. And we -- this business -- this acquisition was based on strategy and opportunity and a new growth vector. They have beautiful fundamentals already. And we don't need synergies to make the deal work economically. That was really the intent of the earlier comments. 
Having said that, as we engage with the team, and they're going to lead this, where they have opportunities for growth, think new geographies, for example, where they're not present, we absolutely see opportunities to reduce friction and create some leverage with our strong platforms in these new geographies. The point we were making is that wasn't factored into the deal economics. So as we get further down this integration path, and we're just starting, my expectation is we'll find those areas of synergies. And when we do, we'll talk about that and update the -- any guidance that we have relative to the accretion there."

And so they punch above their weight from -- they're disproportionate in terms of the relative impact on the overall brand. 
So 90 days ago, we didn't -- we were essentially open for business in all geographies and we didn't anticipate that we would have these reclosures, and you're seeing the impact of that. So as it relates just to the guide this year, that's really the primary driver. Remember also, I mean, you have wholesale doors in the same regions as well. But the biggest issue for us was, frankly, around the brick-and-mortar stores."

All of our businesses are experiencing episodic impacts due to the COVID pandemic. Vans is certainly impacted based on the heavy concentration of stores with the brick-and-mortar closures. But we've also -- they've had to endure how to recover from our early moves on mitigating inventory and pulling back on marketing. And just getting their rhythm and choreography of new products married with appropriate stories to drive that engagement that ultimately drive the conversion, just getting back into that rhythm. And we're seeing that today. And as we move into spring 2021, you'll really see that optimized level come back to what we have historically been accustomed to."

Yes, the -- first of all, just to bring you back and remind you of the glide path that we expected on gross margin. And generally -- notwithstanding the Vans brick-and-mortar comment that I just mentioned, generally, we're seeing that develop. In fact, in the third quarter, we said promotional activity was slightly better than we had anticipated. And as we looked to the fourth quarter, we really don't see any material change in the pace of markdowns or the promotional activity. 
What we do see is -- and expect, is a modest decline in gross margin from previous expectations. Think about maybe 100 basis points or so. And that's really driven by mix -- the difference in mix, right? So as you see less direct-to-consumer, you're going to see a little bit lower gross margin in the fourth quarter. 
Maybe to give you some confidence. As we look forward, we're not giving guidance in 2022, but I can give you a few data points that maybe will help you think about the go-forward picture. From a margin standpoint, we would expect 2022 margins to be back to historical peak levels, think about the organic business, 55.5%, plus some accretion from Supreme. So a little better -- we would expect margins -- gross margins to be a little better than even where we were pre-pandemic in the 2020 time frame, which I think is really kind of underneath what your question is. 
The other thing I would say is, remember, the actions that we took, while we're sure that it had some impact in terms of sales and some of the relative performance this year, constraining inventory, et cetera, the goal there was to emerge in a clean position and in a position to strength going into next year. So just remember, there's 2 sides to those impacts. The short-term disruption, but we believe we're setting ourselves up well for next year."

I'll go ahead and start. Scott, fill in if I miss anything here. I think we're very excited about the impact of our decisions the last few years to really invest behind our transformation and build this consumer-first mentality. We committed to get our digital to about 20% of our business when we met with everybody back in Beaver Creek, it seems like eons ago. And as we've gotten through this year, we've exceeded that number, about 23%, and combined with our U.S. wholesale, our digital penetration is about 30%. 
So I think what's important for us isn't really the penetration percent, but more about building these seamless connections between the virtual and the physical, and building those optimized consumer journeys that allow us to really meet our consumer where they are. So thinking about through a mobile-first mindset, the UX/CX aspect of our platforms, thinking about the services required within our stores to be able to not only optimize service, but optimize use of inventory. 
And I would just tell you, I think, the store element of our direct-to-consumer strategy long term is a very critical role on how we connect with consumers, but also how we bring technology. The store we've opened recently in Milan or Fiji is really a test case of blending technology with physical and building a higher level of engagement and experience. So long answer, Alex, but it's really less about penetration and it's more about these optimized consumer journeys through the seamless integration of both environments."

Order books, as we've said now multiple times, have been conservative versus historical levels. We see, I would say, improving sentiment going forward and continued constructive support from the wholesale channels, but still a conservative environment. So that's just general, right? 
And I would say our position hasn't materially changed either. We talked about -- in the early days of COVID, we were pretty darn aggressive on inventories. We now are getting to the point where we're normalizing. And we expect by the end of the year -- I think we used the word equilibrium in terms of inventory positions versus forward sales, and that's both the retail comment and our own inventories. So our posture, Bob, is kind of as we've said and developing as we expected. 
We're still not in a normal environment, again, from an overall posture, but it continues to be more constructive. And again, we're super pleased with the way that our key retailers and partners have worked with us. Again, they're not canceling orders. Orders are sticky.

And I would tell you the key accounts that our business is focused on, we continue to just build stronger and stronger and more productive relationships. If you think about our EMEA business, the relationships we have with the pure-play digital partners like Zalando, Asos, and even what we see with JD in U.K., in store and online. Our success there in how we balance between our own environments and their environments is really very critical. 
In Asia, we think of Ali as a wholesale partner. And the comment we made about Vans being the #1 large brand during 11/11 and the first to launch a customs platform on the Ali customs environment, those types of opportunities come based on the strength of the relationships. 
And then if you think about our Dickies business here in the U.S. and their ability to service essential retail that has been opened throughout the pandemic, bring needed products to their consumers through those strong relationships, I would say this is one of our core go-to-market elements of our strategy, and it's always been a big part of VF's toolkit on how we really partner with and service those wholesale partners in the very best way."

Remember, too, our highest and best presentation of the brand is in our own digital and our D2C. So we're going to build to what we believe our best estimates of what demand is, and we would expect a more constructive environment generally next year and less conservatism. 
The last thing is one of the reasons we took the aggressive postures that we did this year is knowing that it was going to be uncertain, and that's why we keep saying we -- our intent is to emerge in an advantaged position. So has there been some demand buildup, we needed to see some of that in a brand like the Timberland, sorry, in terms of the sell-through and create some unmet demand? That's not a bad thing for these brands as we look forward.

We got a",713,"Yes. Let me -- I'll make a couple of comments there. First of all, as you look at the implied guidance, take the full year and back into the fourth quarter, I'd just remind you guys, there's a lot of noise here. We had a COVID quarter last year. We got a COVID quarter this year. Just one little sound bite for you to think about. We're trending very positive a year ago and then unwound our incentive comp as COVID dramatically changed the picture in the fourth quarter a year ago, and that's about a $50 million delta year-on-year that you're up against. 
And I just point that out just to remind you all, there's a lot of noise, and you got to be careful about making big assumptions on flow-through going forward without our guide here. And I know you're looking for that guide, John. So maybe this will help. Let me give you a little more shaping on 2022. 
First of all, just starting at the top of the P&L, we expect to get back to pre-COVID quarterly peak revenues at some point during next year, 2022. It could even happen as quickly as midyear, but there's uncertainty on what this glide path looks like exactly, but we do see getting back to those earnings. That's been a question that many of you have been asking us for quite a while and just wanted to give you that picture. I already talked about gross margin, what our expectations are for next year. 
As it relates to operating margin, one thing that we've seen this year that we -- I'll just own this myself, personally, we're not giving guidance. We don't have all the answers yet. But I would expect operating margin to be a little stickier in terms of the recovery. And the reason I say that is primarily in brick-and-mortar. We don't see a light switch here where all of a sudden you're open and everything goes back to the kind of levels and the productivity that we saw previously. 
Vans is a good example of that, what we're seeing in this year's guide, right, the closures and reopenings, they're encouraging. Our brick-and-mortar is really profitable, but it was even more profitable at its peak. And the productivity that we saw based on traffic patterns pre-COVID versus when we reopen, people are nervous, right, and they're slower to come back. 
Every indication is they're going to come back and that we're going to see a longer-term path, that we're as confident as ever in brick-and-mortar and it's an important part of our overall consumer delivery. But I would expect productivity in brick-and-mortar to lag a little bit in its recovery, and that probably puts a little drag. Really, that shows up in SG&A, but that will put a little drag into next year. 
So no -- from an LRP and long-term earnings, the fact that we're seeing revenue -- line of sight on revenue, the fact that our gross margins are healthy and we see a line of sight to get back to peak levels; we know that structural mix benefit is there and you see that this quarter and you'll see that in the fourth quarter, 90 basis points or so this quarter in mix; our fastest-growing businesses are our highest gross margin, so that structural margin is there, those are the factors. When the top line and margin is there, that gives me the confidence that, coupled with the optionality in the model, that we have a lot of confidence in our long-range plan. 
What could make that happen quicker or slower? It really is the consumer and how we emerge from this and are people comfortable what happens with the vaccine. There's just a lot of uncertainties. And that's why we can't give you more granularity at this point on 2022. But as time goes on, a quarter from now when we report and give our guidance, our expectation is we'll have even better visibility and be able to give you a little more shaping on what 2022 should look like. So hopefully, that will help you. It's not exactly the full picture, but as you think about modeling, hopefully that gives you some color there."

It's really encouraging to see social media heat and the performance. I think we're leaving a little on the table is not a bad thing as we set up for next year, and that's encouraging.

But yes, the relative upside is in the 3 other organic brands that we have, in terms of margin expansion, there's a lot of room to run. And as we start to see the traction that we just talked about, the leverage and opportunity for that margin expansion is absolutely there. We already have amazing margins at Vans. So yes, that's one of the advantages of a portfolio and diverse offering, right, is we have multiple levers to pull. 
And again, to the earlier comment on Supreme, beautiful fundamentals, right, and a lot of optionality there. So this will be an important and big profit and top line driver for VF over time. What we don't know yet is exactly what are those investments and how do we balance and what flows through. We owe you that. We'll come back and give you more granularity. But the beauty is it's a pristine brand with wonderful fundamentals, and it will be a very important growth driver for this company over the next foreseeable future."

This has been quite a year for each and every one of us. I couldn't be more proud of our people. The work that everyone has put in to be able to navigate what has been a very challenging environment just makes me extremely proud. 
We have great conviction about the transformation that we've been undergoing for the last 2 years and how it's positioning us to really optimize the connections we have with our consumers and build those seamless, frictionless consumer journeys to service them where they are at. The portfolio that we've -- we're continuing to evolve has positioned us to really, I think, capture an important part of the marketplace as we look at the TAM that we've positioned ourselves into. 
We remain cautious, but we are extremely optimistic. There are still some waves to navigate as we emerge from the pandemic, but we're so extremely well positioned. To Scott's point, we do see ourselves returning to our peak levels as we move through fiscal '22 and extremely positive about the opportunities ahead. 
So thank you, and we look forward to talking to you in a few months, and closing out fiscal '21 and positioning ourselves to move into a much more positive and dynamic fiscal '22."

As always, I hope our comments today find you and your loved ones healthy and safe. 
As we conclude our fiscal '21 year, I'm proud of the way both VF and our people navigated what turned out to be one of the most disruptive years in our company's 122-year history. We didn't know how the pandemic would unfold, and we didn't know how long it would last. But we did know one thing. We were determined not just to survive the situation, but to capitalize on the moment, emerge even stronger and position VF and our brands for the next chapter of growth and value creation. 
Thanks to the incredible resilience and agility of our people, combined with our early actions to preserve liquidity and protect our balance sheet, today, I can say with confidence that VF is indeed emerging from this crisis as a stronger, smarter and more focused enterprise. Throughout fiscal '21, our teams remain sharply focused on executing their plans, and we continued to invest in our brands' greatest opportunities to drive growth. 
As you all know, our organic portfolio had strong momentum heading into this crisis, delivering 9% revenue and 19% earnings growth through the first 9 months of fiscal '20. All of the actions we've taken throughout fiscal '21 have been squarely focused on regaining the strong organic momentum as we exit the pandemic. 
We also remain focused on driving inorganic growth by evolving our portfolio to align with near- and long-term market opportunities. This is exactly what we did by acquiring Supreme in late 2020, which we believe will deliver significant value creation for VF shareholders in the years to come. In addition, we announced late last month that we've entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Occupational Workwear businesses. The sale of this business will provide greater financial flexibility to fuel the long-term strategic growth initiatives for our remaining portfolio. 
The continued effects of the pandemic forced an ongoing reaffirmation of our priorities. We've been actively working to accelerate our hyper digital journey in fiscal '21 with continued focus on a central consumer data platform that's accessible to our brands and that enables them to understand consumers more deeply and to engage them in more meaningful and personal ways. And we leverage new technologies and processes to further digitize our go-to-market approach with advancements in 3D design and development, virtual product reviews and digital printing capabilities that shorten production calendars and accelerate our ability to flow newness and innovation. 
We also kicked off Project Enable, a multiyear initiative to evolve our organizational design to ensure we have the right capabilities, resources and talent in place to propel us forward. This work includes upskilling and reskilling parts of our workforce to equip them with the know-how to thrive in a digital-first world. Project Enable will help us accelerate our business model transformation and reduce our global cost structure by about $125 million over 3 years. 
Along with our focus on business performance and advancing our strategy, we have remained determined to continue building our reputation as a purpose-led company that leads by example. We continue to activate our people-first approach through fiscal '21. We prioritize the health and safety of our people worldwide and went to great lengths to support their financial well-being. I'm extremely proud to say that even during the darkest days of the crisis, when nearly all our stores around the world were closed for months on end, not one of our retail associates was laid off or furloughed because of the pandemic. 
We also continue to meet our commitments to the communities we serve and the planet we all share. Last year was a year of tremendous progress in our efforts around the world to advance environmental sustainability. We allocated the net proceeds from our [ EUR ] 500 million green bond, the first in the apparel footwear industry, toward VF's eligible sustainable projects worldwide. Collectively, these projects are helping to deliver meaningful environmental benefits. 
In addition, we announced our goal to eliminate all single-use plastic packaging, including poly bags by 2025. Going forward, all remaining nonplastic packaging used by VF and our brands will originate from sustainable sources and be designed for reuse or recyclability. 
We also published our first human rights report in alignment with the United Nations guiding principles on business and human rights. We're very proud of this work, and we aim to continuously improve as we uphold human rights in all our operations and across our global supply chain. Beyond the global pandemic, other events of last year laid bare the pervasive racial and social economic and justices that plague our world, especially as they impact people of color. In response, the F&R brands took action to build on our inclusion and diversity work by establishing the counsel to advance racial equity, CARE. Although CARE is still young, We believe it will be a galvanizing force for our entire company as we take collective actions in the years ahead to fight for racial equity and social justice. 
Operating as a purpose-led company is not just the right thing to do. It is what our employees and our consumers expect. Brands are more than businesses which deliver product. They have the ability to influence positive movements within their communities. This builds deeper connectivity and engagement between our brand and their consumers, supporting long-term profitable relationships. We are a purpose-led and performance-driven organization. 
Transitioning to our financial results. I want to start with a few highlights from this past year. By any measure, the collective work of our associates to navigate fiscal '21 was nothing short of remarkable. Despite unprecedented challenges from rolling virus surges and lockdowns globally, we were able to deliver global revenues of $9.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.31, in line with our outlook shared in January. Throughout the year, digital in China propelled our business forward. Our D2C digital business delivered 55% organic growth. And when combined with pure-play digital wholesale, our total digital business grew over 40% and accounted for nearly 30% of total revenue. These figures demonstrate how quickly the world turned online and how well our teams adapted to the new reality with incredible speed and agility. In fact, during a 5-month period, our digital technology teams engineered homegrown solutions to enhance our e-commerce platform and stand up a new omnichannel capabilities, including buy online, pick up in store; ship from store; and reserve online, buy in-store programs. These new offerings further simplify the shopping experience for our consumers and enabled us to utilize retail inventory through our digital channels when stores were closed, all of which helped to generate around $50 million of incremental revenue this year. 
Our China business also remained consistently strong throughout fiscal '21, growing 20% and surpassing $1 billion in revenue and exceeding our long-term plan targets. We bolstered our China operations by appointing VF's first-ever President of Greater China. And we're in the process of restructuring our Asia-Pacific operations by moving our brands' regional center from Hong Kong to Shanghai. This will enable our brands to strengthen their in-country presence and gain even deeper insights into our Chinese consumers. 
VF generated approximately $1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '21, a testament to the resiliency of our portfolio and strong execution from our global teams. While many of our peers were forced to pause their dividend commitments, our strong balance sheet and command over free cash flow supported our ability to modestly raise our dividend this year, returning $760 million to shareholders. 
A key objective throughout this year was to exit fiscal '21 in a clean inventory position. I'm pleased to say that we ended this year with owned inventories down 18%. And our disciplined brand and marketplace management approach globally has resulted in clean inventory positions across channels. 
Turning to our outlook. As you saw in this morning's release, we expect fiscal '22 revenue to be about $11.8 billion, representing more than 25% growth. Excluding Supreme, this represents high single-digit organic revenue growth above prior peak fiscal 2020 levels. Said differently, we expect our big 4 brands to not only fully recover revenue loss during the pandemic but to deliver strong growth relative to prior peak levels. 
Before getting into our fiscal '22 plan, I want to take a moment to address a specific question, which always is top of mind with this audience. What gives me confidence in Vans' ability to reaccelerate and deliver on its forward growth commitments? 
Throughout the past year, the Vans conversation has been focused on the disruption caused by supply delays, the outsized impact of store closures and the cumulative impact of inventory and marketing investment constraints. As we have consistently discussed, these issues are all short term and episodic, which have no impact on the long-term runway for this brand. As we enter fiscal '22, there are several near-term catalysts, which give me confidence in Vans' ability to regain momentum and return to the low double-digit growth path we laid out in 2019. 
First, we know that the deep connectivity of Vans' stores and associates are a distinct competitive advantage for the brand. Our stores drive higher loyalty member enrollment, greater purchase frequency and higher average order value. A return to in-store shopping will restore this advantage, growing the Vans community while driving a higher annual spend per consumer. 
Second, a return to normal social usage occasions will accelerate purchases from depressed levels the brand experienced during the pandemic. This is not just a return to in-person schooling for younger consumers. This is a return to seeing family and friends, dining out, attending concerts and sporting events and traveling. We know Vans has remained top of mind for its core consumers who are ready to reengage with the brand as they return to a normal cadence of lifestyle activities. 
And lastly, beginning next month, Vans will initiate a globally coordinated weekly drop cadence that marries both product and experiential demand creation to drive energy, excitement and brand heat. A key learning from the past year has been the importance of flowing new product and associated storytelling to deepen engagement with existing consumers and attract new consumers to the brand. This will be accompanied by an elevated vans.com experience to enhance the consumer journey around these exciting drops. While Vans is our largest brand, I don't want to lose sight of the momentum we're seeing across the remainder of our portfolio. 
As Matt will unpack shortly, our recovery this quarter and the strength of our fiscal '22 plan is broad-based. There is tremendous momentum at The North Face and Dickies, which we expect to accelerate. We believe Timberland has reached an important inflection point, and Supreme is off to a strong start, and its path for sustainable long-term growth and value creation could not be more clear. 
Taken together, I'm entering this year with a strong sense of optimism. We have a best-in-class portfolio of brands with momentum, a leadership team across our brands and enterprise that possesses the skills and capabilities to lead our teams and to deliver on our commitments. There are tailwinds from both the strengthening consumer across the globe and in the categories where we are most present, and inventory levels are in good shape. Each of our brands are uniquely positioned to thrive in the coming year and return to their respective long-range plans as we emerge from this crisis as a stronger company. 
And now I'll turn it over to Matt."

And first, Steve, let me say how honored, excited and appreciative I am to have the opportunity to serve as CFO of this amazing 122-year-old company. And to Scott, thank you for the many years of mentoring and encouraging and supporting my professional development. Rest assured, you've had an impact on VF that is immeasurable, and you will be missed by all but by none, more than me. Best wish is my friend. 
So let me start with an overview of the operating environment across geographic regions. Starting with the Americas, the U.S. environment continues to improve with vaccine distribution, easing lockdown measures and a strengthening consumer. We started Q4 with about 15% of our doors closed in the region, mostly in California. As we sit today, virtually all of these doors have reopened. While store traffic remains depressed, conversion and AUR have been strong, and we have seen sequential improvement across the brick-and-mortar fleet with a notable acceleration in March. Each of our largest brands returned to double-digit growth in the Americas, and our total D2C business increased 16%, led by 57% growth from digital. Wholesale channel inventories remained clean, particularly across Outdoor categories, which will provide a strong backdrop to the U.S. wholesale business as we progress through fiscal 2022. 
In EMEA, the region has been impacted by rolling store closures throughout the entirety of fiscal '21, and our teams continued to navigate this disruption during Q4. We started the quarter with about half of our doors closed and finished the quarter with about 60% of doors closed. Key markets such as the U.K. and Germany were basically fully closed throughout the fourth quarter. Lockdowns are expected to ease beginning in May for most countries, except Germany and France, although a slower start to vaccine rollouts will likely hinder the pace of recovery in the coming months. Despite this choppier brick-and-mortar recovery, our teams have continued to leverage digital, driving 99% growth in that channel during the period with broad-based strength across the portfolio, and digital increased 92%; The North Face, 118%; and Timberland, 122%. Our strong partnerships with digital partners such as ASOS and Zalando also delivered impressive growth accelerating in the quarter. We expect strong underlying digital momentum to translate into accelerated growth in fiscal 2022. 
The APAC region has demonstrated incredible resiliency throughout the past year, led by Greater China and a strong consumer. Our Greater China business surpassed the $1 billion milestone in fiscal '21, growing 20%, capped off by 70% growth in Q4. Congratulations to our teams in the region for this important milestone. This represents nearly 25% growth over our fiscal 2019 Q4 revenue, the prior peak before the impact of COVID. All VF brands achieved growth in the region, led by 93% growth at The North Face and 107% growth at Dickies. We continue to view China as the leading indicator of the broader recovery in our business. And as our largest growth opportunity, we remain focused on maintaining momentum and continuing with investments focused toward our Distort to Asia strategy. The transition of our brand leadership teams and commercial operations to Shanghai is on track, which includes standing up a digital hub and establishing a consumer-centric structure that will help us transform and advance our capability serving Greater China and the region. 
Globally, our supply chain teams continue to navigate port congestion, capacity constraints, transitory cost pressures and elevated volatility across the network. Our teams are working tirelessly to minimize the impact of these challenges. However, we expect volatility and certain headwinds to continue for the foreseeable future. Fortunately, we have one of the strongest supply chains in the industry and are prepared for this challenge having successfully navigated the unprecedented disruption over the past year. 
Now moving into our fourth quarter highlights. As you may have seen in this morning's release, our Q4 results benefited from a 53rd week in fiscal 2021. The impact of this was contemplated in our 2021 outlook shared in January. This benefit was magnified relative to Q4 due to the low base in the prior year and supply chain disruptions resulting from COVID-19. Importantly, this dynamic is reflected in the fiscal 2022 planned growth rates we will cover shortly. 
VF delivered 19% growth in Q4 or 12% organic growth despite headwinds from supply chain disruptions and more extended lockdowns throughout Europe. The strength of our business was broad-based, with 16% growth from the big 4 brands and acceleration from many of our emerging brands, highlighted by 53% growth from Ultra. In its first quarter with VF, the Supreme brand contributed over $140 million of revenue, exceeding our expectations. As expected, Vans inflected positively, delivering 10% global growth as strength in the Americas and APAC regions more than offset larger-than-expected headwinds from store closures in Europe. Globally, Vans is seeing balanced momentum and performance across heritage and progression footwear. 
During Q4, Skate High, authentic and old-school heritage styles each grew double digits, while the Pro Skate and MTE progression lines each grew more than 30%. Apparel also performed well, including mid-teens growth in women's. 
Vans digital growth accelerated to 52%, including a growing contribution from omnichannel sales, which represented over 10% of digital revenue in the Americas. Vans stores also returned to growth globally after sequential quarterly improvement throughout fiscal 2021. Vans D2C consumers returned strongly during March. both in stores and online and across both existing and new consumers. The Vans Family loyalty program added 1.2 million members in the U.S. in the last 4 months and now has nearly 15 million enrolled globally. With the reopening of Vans store fleet, new membership growth has accelerated in March and April. 
The North Face delivered 23% growth, led by 56% growth in digital. TNF achieved double-digit growth across all regions and channels as outdoor category tailwinds remain robust globally. From a product standpoint, the brand experienced relative strength from several on-mountain categories. including Outerwear, led by our future light offering; and footwear, led by our new VECTIV line. We see continued validation of the brand's innovation engine, recently highlighted an Outside Magazine's 2021 Summer Buyer's Guide, which features 6 products from The North Face, including Gear of the Year awards for 2 VECTIV products awarded the Best Trail Running and Hiking Shoes of 2021. 
Momentum at The North Face also extends to the brand's off-mountain product portfolio with strength from logo wear and iconic franchises such as -- which increased more than 75%. 
The brand also wrapped up the Gucci Co lab with the largest earned media campaign in The North Face's history with more than 17 billion impressions, yielding worldwide 100% sell-through of all collaboration outerwear. 
And lastly, due partially to an exceptionally strong first-responder program throughout fiscal 2021, The North Face's digital business increased 63%, including 49% growth in new paid customers by adding 1.6 million in new loyalty members in the Americas. 
Timberland increased 19% with continued momentum behind Outdoor footwear, Apparel, Timberland Pro and an accelerating Classics business. Digital increased 96% with additional strength from key digital retail partners. The brand successfully rolled out several new product stories, including Green Stride, which has garnered strong early read. Timberland delivered 54% global digital growth in fiscal 2021 and is entering this year with broad-based momentum across the product portfolio. 
Finally, Dickies increased 19% with continued strength across regions, channels and categories. The brand continued its strong performance in APAC, highlighted by more than 120% growth in Greater China. Work-inspired lifestyle product increased at a double-digit rate across all regions and represented 40% of total revenue. Despite headwinds from the pandemic, the brand delivered 7% growth in fiscal 2021 through strong execution against the strategic pillars of digital, China and work-inspired product categories. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.27, including a $0.06 contribution from Supreme, representing 89% organic growth and a strong start to our earnings recovery. Our liquidity remains strong as we ended the year with approximately $1.45 billion in cash and short-term investment and approximately $2.2 billion remaining undrawn on our revolver. As Steve referenced earlier, we've entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Occupational Workwear business to Redwood Capital Investments, which is expected to close in late Q1. We This will provide an additional source of liquidity and further reduce our net leverage position. 
Moving now to our outlook for fiscal 2022. We expect total VF revenue to approximate $11.8 billion, representing about 28% growth from fiscal '21 and a low double-digit increase relative to our prior peak revenue in fiscal 2020. This includes approximately $600 million of Supreme revenue. Excluding the Supreme business, our fiscal 2022 outlook implies growth of about 23%, representing high single-digit growth relative to fiscal 2020. 
By brand, we expect Vans to generate between 26% and 28% growth, representing a 7% to 9% increase relative to prior peak revenue. The North Face is expected to increase between 25% and 27%, representing 14% to 16% growth relative to fiscal 2020 and surpassing $3 billion in global brand revenue. We expect Timberland to increase between 16% and 18%, which implies revenue in line with prior peak levels. Lastly, we expect continued strength from Dickies with growth accelerating to between 10% and 12%, which implies revenue up about 20% from fiscal 2020. 
By region, excluding Supreme, we expect Europe to increase about 30%, representing about 15% growth relative to prior peak revenue. We expect continued momentum in APAC with close to 20% organic growth, led by ongoing strength in China, where we expect growth to exceed 20%. In the Americas, we expect organic revenue growth of greater than 20%. 
By channel, again, excluding Supreme, we expect our D2C business to increase between 28% and 30%, including about 15% growth in digital. We expect approximately half of total VF revenue to come from D2C this year. And including pure-play digital wholesale, we expect our total digital penetration in fiscal 2022 to exceed 30%. 
Finally, our wholesale business is expected to grow at a high-teen rate, essentially recovering revenue lost over the past year and returning to prior peak levels. 
Moving down the P&L, we expect gross margin in excess of 56%, representing organic margins above prior peak levels. We expect an operating margin of about 12.8%, which implies high single-digit organic growth in our SG&A spend relative to fiscal 2020 levels. 
Now let me take a moment and unpack our expected SG&A growth relative to those prior peak levels. A large piece of the growth relates to continued investment against our growth-focused strategic priorities. Relative to fiscal '20, our fiscal '22 plan assumes over $150 million of incremental investments in demand creation and our business model transformation to be more consumer-minded, retail-centric and hyper digital, which supports the strong growth commitments covered today. 
Other large drivers within SG&A are episodic to this year. A large piece of the growth is simply from foreign currency. Foreign currency translation represents about 20% of the expected dollar growth in SG&A. Another episodic piece of our SG&A growth relates to elevated distribution and freight. We are confident in our ability to mitigate these cost pressures over time in addition to the strong pricing power our brands enjoy globally. However, higher costs will be a near-term headwind to profitability. 
Moving forward, we see a path to SG&A leverage as we exit fiscal 2022. And given the composition of our portfolio today, we see, at minimum, a return to our long-term earnings algorithm from our 2024 plan, with strong gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage supporting investment optionality. 
To wrap up our fiscal 2022 P&L outlook, we expect our tax rate to approximate 15%, which brings us to earnings per share of about $3.05, including an expected $0.25 per share contribution from the Supreme brand. Finally, we expect to generate over $1 billion in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures are planned to approximate $350 million. This includes the impact of growth investments as well as deferred capital spending from fiscal 2021 as a result of COVID. 
There are no changes to our capital allocation priorities moving forward. Our strong balance sheet will continue to be a focus, and we expect to end fiscal 2022 with net leverage between 2.5x and 3x. We remain committed to growing our dividend. And as always, we will remain opportunistic with M&A and other capital allocation alternatives, which we will explore as appropriate. 
So in summary, we could not be more pleased with how VF has navigated fiscal 2021. We fully executed on our plans in a challenging environment, driving digital growth, managing free cash flow and investing in our organic business, while evolving our portfolio to best position us for long-term value creation. As a result of the hard work throughout fiscal '21, we're exiting this year with broad-based momentum across the portfolio. And I'm very confident in VF's ability to drive accelerated growth into fiscal '22 and beyond.

So Vans, Clearly, I hope through our -- my remarks in my script, you all noted just the confidence that we have and the momentum that we see building coming out of March into this year. We talked a lot about last year at the outsized impact that Vans incurred, from the store closures, but also the disruption in inventory early and the impact on marketing and the ability to really tell those stories. As we think about this year, as those stores reopen, the upside could be very significant. And we know that these are a very powerful part of their connection to their consumers. 
This is where we really have, I think, a distinct competitive advantage. We have a higher loyalty member engagement. We see higher purchase frequency and a higher order value when our stores are up and running, and that is paying off as we see the acceleration coming out of March and April. But you can't discount at all this -- kind of this return to some normal usage occasions and the impact that, that will have on consumers' desire to purchase. We see that today. And then this moved to a 50-week drop -- 52-week drop cadence that it's -- I think what's significant about that, Erinn, is it could be less about the products that we're putting on in front of you every week because it could be just a story, but it's an engagement moment for us to reach out to our current consumers, attract new consumers and really engage them in the brand's family and drive that long-term consumer loyalty. 
The digital growth has been very, very important, clearly, in this last year, and it will continue to be. For us, as we -- it will moderate for sure. We're not sure where that will land. But I think the critical part for us is how we seamlessly connect our stores with our e-commerce environments and really create that engagement method that we're able to connect with you, communicate with you wherever you are and however you choose to engage with us. 
And we have a new store in Milan, the Orifice store is a test environment for us on a VF standpoint using greater digital connectivity, in-store opportunities to engage not only with content, but how we're able to service the consumer with a single view of inventory. We think that, going forward, will be a big advantage as well as we're able to prove it and then roll it out across our fleet. And clearly, Vans would be a big user of that new concept."

I'll add one thing to Steve's comment about Vans that I think the group probably understands. But if you think about the opportunity to see the business come back a little more quickly, especially in brick-and-mortar, we continue to remain disciplined as it relates to how we're supporting the business from an inventory standpoint. But the good news, certainly for Vans is we've got the ability to get back in the inventory pretty quickly there. So if we see that begin to move a little faster, especially the recovery of the brick-and-mortar side of the business, we'll be able to support that we able to support some level of upside there given the capabilities that we have relative to lead-time and some of the quick term things that we could do in Vans. 
So I think we're really confident in the plan we've laid out, but also if that looks to see a little bit more momentum than maybe what we've initially called, then we'll have the opportunity to get after that as well."

And then just as we look ahead to get a little bit of sense of the confidence you have in the gross margin that you guided to for '22, maybe you could just give us a couple of thoughts on the components that build to it, geography channel, which I think would be headwinds. 
And then just a quick one on the SG&A. You said there's opportunity for leverage as you get back on your algorithm. I think the September '19 plan embedded no SG&A leverage. That did sound like a bit of a change to me. If so, maybe just any thoughts on what changed there."

In terms of gross margin, I think first off, I'll take you back to where we started this year. We went into the year, and we said we were going to be really aggressive to end the year in a clean position and end the year in a position of strength. And we've done that. We've executed on our plan really, really well in that regard. 
What we saw play out in the fourth quarter from a rate perspective as well, honestly, as we've seen play out through the year has been right in line with our expectations. You have to remember, some of the choices that we made even last summer to emerge clean are impacting what you saw play out in the fourth quarter, and we certainly expected that. So no 1 brand, no 1 channel driving that. But certainly, the aggressive approach that we took to ending the year clean is a big element of that. 
The piece that has been more difficult for us to call through the year, honestly, has been the mix. We did end the year with our sort of normal kind of 50 basis point impact on a full year basis from mix, but we've seen some puts and takes there across the year because this has been obviously a really unique year in terms of trying to project and predict the mix of the business, in particular, the brick-and-mortar component of our business as we've seen that be continually disruptive by store closures throughout the year. 
So I think what you can take away from that is we executed on our plan just as we intended to. And certainly, there's been some variability because of the mix side. But in the end, we ended the year with inventories really clean, both our own inventories, but also with our retail partners, back down about 20% organically inventory for us. And that's really the thing that gives us the most confidence about gross margins next year. 
When we look at the mix of the business next year, and returning back to a more typical and normal type of mix, a little more consistency in the business in terms of in terms of how that will play out sort of quarter-over-quarter through the year. We're confident in the mix benefit that we've seen historically will be there. It will be there more consistently as we move through the year. And then so what you're going to see is a really nice snapback in terms of the right side of the equation as we're really going to be really, really clean and really, really lean in terms of managing the business, really starting right out of the gate here in the first quarter. We do expect actually a gross margin expansion in Q1. And as we said in our prepared comments, we expect gross margins on a full year basis organically to be slightly above prior peak levels. 
In terms of SG&A, I think what we wanted to indicate there with the forward look is that yes, we have the ability to see some leverage coming out of fiscal '22. 
You may remember at Beaver Creek, we talked a lot about optionality, and that's really still the point. We'll have -- that leverage will give us the optionality to continue to invest to support our biggest growth opportunities, whether it be demand creation or continue driving our transformation. So I think that's really the -- I don't think it's really any difference. It's just sort of maybe a nuance in terms of how you think about leverage opportunity in parts of the SG&A model and creating optionality to invest if we see opportunity to do so."

You won't see anything this year. It will come in probably next year and the year after is where that work will be done. 
I think the key here, Camilo, is the Supreme's team ability to travel to the marketplace. They spend a tremendous amount of time understanding the consumer, finding their specific consumer and then the store location, which is how we enter markets is such a critical part of how they think about new market penetration. They need to be able to get in market. They need to be able to partner with our teams to begin to understand those key consumer markets and where best to put that first store. And that is one of the big drivers of why it won't be this year, but it will be the years to come."

So North Face is really gaining momentum. They're certainly benefiting here from the outdoor trend, but they're also benefiting from the work being done over the last few years to strengthen our product pipeline, strengthen our ability to engage consumers with stronger demand creation. And I think what you see here is really a strong momentum globally, and it's really not just one thing. On Mountain is really setting the tone, and the performance product has seen really good sell-through. And that's driving that off-mountain lifestyle franchise growth that we see building, has been growing nicely in Europe. We've seen that now really move its way into Asia, really significant growth in China as that consumer becomes more engaged with the outdoors and the Winter Olympics becomes a big part of of the China focus, and we're right in the middle and being able to benefit from that. But we're seeing really strong return to growth here in the U.S. market and really witnessed with the strong holiday sell-through we saw here not only in our own channels, but in wholesale. 
The disciplined market management, as we clean up distribution, strengthen key wholesale partner relationships and balance the use of our own stores, our own digital platform to drive that on-mountain, off-mountain story. 
But I would tell you, we're set up really well for fiscal '22. And we're expecting mid-teen growth in fiscal '22 versus prior peak revenue. But even more importantly, we're seeing mid-teen profitability opportunity."

I think just in terms of, again, some of the other pieces, you think about, I think we all recognize and acknowledge that bringing Supreme into the equation and taking Occupational Work out of the equation is a benefit. We also know that outsized growth in digital, outsized growth in China in a back again are going to be a benefit to us. 
We're in the midst of a COVID recovery. Everything is -- not everything is equal in that regard. We will see a continual improvement in our brick-and-mortar business over time and probably even extending into fiscal '23. So there are puts and takes in there. But when you stack it all up, we feel really good about -- as we begin to emerge fully over the next several quarters and looking beyond '22 into '23 and '24, we're really confident in the overall algorithm and comfortable saying that we're committed to that at a minimum. And I will say, we recognize that there's a need to update our LRP, our long-range plan, and we'll do that in the context of the full Investor Day at some point in next calendar year."

And what you see here is an opportunity for them to take a very deliberate and coordinated effort to pull those stories together.

And how we'll do that, Bob, in some -- often times, it will be a weekly new product story. It could be a new style. It could be a co-lab. It could be a color of an existing franchise, but they'll be very coordinated global launches of these product stories. But there will also be important moments is to engage the consumer, things like we've done with foot-to-bill type engagements where revenue is supporting specialty stores and enforcing the local community connections to advance ads with their consumers. I think how you'll -- how we'll really drive that marketing will certainly be heavily focused towards online, through our own direct engagement, through social channels, through e-mail marketing, the power of the loyalty program that now is [ above ] 15 million people and really engaging on opportunities that are unique to that particular consumer that they're able to access due to their loyalty membership will be a very important part. But I think the in-store piece as well, both our stores and our key wholesale partners that coordinated in-store element of the demand creation and the experience linked to that online piece is that really a seamless integration that you hear us talk about and our teams are working diligently on, being able to really sequence that appropriately."

And it's in a pretty significant way in the first half of the year as we pulled way back and then began to build back in Q3 and then back in Q4, we're back above prior year levels and pretty much in line with historical ratios. 
We talked about the SG&A increase from '20 to '22 and the investments that we're making, $150 million cumulatively, a big piece of that is demand creation. And we're actually returning to levels that are in line and actually probably modestly, slightly higher from a ratio standpoint than what we ran in fiscal '20. 
We remain focused on the highest ROI activities, very disciplined in our management of the marketing. As we've shifted more towards digital, the good news there is you get really quick reads in terms of the effectiveness of that marketing and the returns that it's driving and the ability to be much more dynamic in your ability to move and move those dollars around against things that are really driving returns. And you can see that certainly much quicker than maybe you could previously. So we're confident, that confident that the marketing we spend is going to drive returns.

Welcome to our fourth quarter call. As always, I hope our comments today find you and your loved ones healthy and safe. As we conclude our fiscal '21 year, I'm proud of the way both VF and our people navigated",1939,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter call. As always, I hope our comments today find you and your loved ones healthy and safe. 
As we conclude our fiscal '21 year, I'm proud of the way both VF and our people navigated what turned out to be one of the most disruptive years in our company's 122-year history. We didn't know how the pandemic would unfold, and we didn't know how long it would last. But we did know one thing. We were determined not just to survive the situation, but to capitalize on the moment, emerge even stronger and position VF and our brands for the next chapter of growth and value creation. 
Thanks to the incredible resilience and agility of our people, combined with our early actions to preserve liquidity and protect our balance sheet, today, I can say with confidence that VF is indeed emerging from this crisis as a stronger, smarter and more focused enterprise. Throughout fiscal '21, our teams remain sharply focused on executing their plans, and we continued to invest in our brands' greatest opportunities to drive growth. 
As you all know, our organic portfolio had strong momentum heading into this crisis, delivering 9% revenue and 19% earnings growth through the first 9 months of fiscal '20. All of the actions we've taken throughout fiscal '21 have been squarely focused on regaining the strong organic momentum as we exit the pandemic. 
We also remain focused on driving inorganic growth by evolving our portfolio to align with near- and long-term market opportunities. This is exactly what we did by acquiring Supreme in late 2020, which we believe will deliver significant value creation for VF shareholders in the years to come. 
In addition, we announced late last month that we've entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Occupational Workwear businesses. The sale of this business will provide greater financial flexibility to fuel the long-term strategic growth initiatives for our remaining portfolio. 
The continued effects of the pandemic forced an ongoing reaffirmation of our priorities. We've been actively working to accelerate our hyper-digital journey in fiscal '21, with the continued focus on a central consumer data platform that's accessible to our brands and that enables them to understand consumers more deeply and to engage them in more meaningful and personal ways. And we leveraged new technologies and processes to further digitize our go-to-market approach, with advancements in 3D design and development, virtual product reviews and digital printing capabilities that shorten production calendars and accelerate our ability to flow newness and innovation. 
We also kicked off Project Enable, a multiyear initiative to evolve our organizational design to ensure we have the right capabilities, resources and talent in place to propel us forward. This work includes upskilling and reskilling parts of our workforce to equip them with the know-how to thrive in a digital-first world. Project Enable will help us accelerate our business model transformation and reduce our global cost structure by about $125 million over 3 years. 
Along with our focus on business performance and advancing our strategy, we have remained determined to continue building our reputation as a purpose-led company that leads by example. We continue to activate our people-first approach through fiscal '21. 
We prioritize the health and safety of our people worldwide and went to great lengths to support their financial well-being. I'm extremely proud to say that even during the darkest days of the crisis, when nearly all our stores around the world were closed for months on end, not one of our retail associates was laid off or furloughed because of the pandemic. 
We also continue to meet our commitments to the communities we serve and the planet we all share. Last year was a year of tremendous progress in our efforts around the world to advance environmental sustainability. We allocated the net proceeds from our EUR 500 million green bond, the first in the apparel footwear industry, toward VF's eligible sustainable projects worldwide. Collectively, these projects are helping to deliver meaningful environmental benefits. 
In addition, we announced our goal to eliminate all single-use plastic packaging, including pol bags by 2025. Going forward, all remaining nonplastic packaging used by VF and our brands will originate from sustainable sources and be designed for reuse or recyclability. 
We also published our first human rights report in alignment with the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights. We're very proud of this work, and we aim to continuously improve as we uphold human rights in all our operations and across our global supply chain. 
Beyond the global pandemic, other events of last year laid bare the pervasive racial and social economic and justices that plague our world, especially as they impact people of color. In response, VF and our brands took action to build on our inclusion and diversity work by establishing the Council to Advance Racial Equity, CARE. Although CARE is still young, We believe it will be a galvanizing force for our entire company as we take collective actions in the years ahead to fight for racial equity and social justice. 
Operating as a purpose-led company is not just the right thing to do, it is what our employees and our consumers expect. Brands are more than businesses which deliver product. They have the ability to influence positive movements within their communities. This builds deeper connectivity and engagement between our brand and their consumers, supporting long-term profitable relationships. We are a purpose-led and performance-driven organization. 
Transitioning to our financial results, I want to start with a few highlights from this past year. By any measure, the collective work of our associates to navigate fiscal '21 was nothing short of remarkable. Despite unprecedented challenges from rolling virus surges and lockdowns globally, we were able to deliver global revenues of $9.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.31, in line with our outlook shared in January. 
Throughout the year, Digital and China propelled our business forward. Our DTC Digital business delivered 55% organic growth. And when combined with pure-play digital wholesale, our total Digital business grew over 40% and accounted for nearly 30% of total revenue. These figures demonstrate how quickly the world turned online and how well our teams adapted to the new reality with incredible speed and agility. 
In fact, during a 5-month period, our digital technology teams engineered homegrown solutions to enhance our e-commerce platform and stand up a new omnichannel capabilities, including buy online, pickup in store; ship from store; and reserve online, buy in store programs. These new offerings further simplify the shopping experience for our consumers and enabled us to utilize retail inventory through our digital channels when stores were closed, all of which helped to generate around $50 million of incremental revenue this year. 
Our China business also remained consistently strong throughout fiscal '21, growing 20% and surpassing $1 billion in revenue and exceeding our long-term plan targets. We bolstered our China operations by appointing VF's first-ever President of Greater China. And we're in the process of restructuring our Asia Pacific operations by moving our brands' regional center from Hong Kong to Shanghai. This will enable our brands to strengthen their in-country presence and gain even deeper insights into our Chinese consumers. 
VF generated approximately $1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '21, a testament to the resiliency of our portfolio and strong execution from our global teams. While many of our peers were forced to pause their dividend commitments, our strong balance sheet and command over free cash flow supported our ability to modestly raise our dividend this year, returning $760 million to shareholders. 
A key objective throughout this year was to exit fiscal '21 in a clean inventory position. I'm pleased to say that we ended this year with owned inventories down 18%. And our disciplined brand and marketplace management approach globally has resulted in clean inventory positions across channels. 
Turning to our outlook. As you saw in this morning's release, we expect fiscal '22 revenue to be about $11.8 billion, representing more than 25% growth. Excluding Supreme, this represents high single-digit organic revenue growth, above prior peak fiscal 2020 levels. Said differently, we expect our Big 4 Brands to not only fully recover revenue loss during the pandemic, but to deliver strong growth relative to prior peak levels. 
Before getting into our fiscal '22 plan, I want to take a moment to address a specific question, which always is top of mind with this audience. What gives me confidence in Vans' ability to reaccelerate and deliver on its forward growth commitments? Throughout the past year, the Vans conversation has been focused on the disruption caused by supply delays, the outsized impact of store closures and the cumulative impact of inventory and marketing investment constraints. 
As we have consistently discussed, these issues are all short term and episodic, which have no impact on the long-term runway for this brand. As we enter fiscal '22, there are several near-term catalysts, which give me confidence in Vans' ability to regain momentum and return to the low double-digit growth path we laid out in 2019. 
First, we know that the deep connectivity of Vans stores and associates are a distinct competitive advantage for the brand. Our stores drive higher loyalty member enrollment, greater purchase frequency and higher average order value. A return to in-store shopping will restore this advantage, growing the Vans community, while driving a higher annual spend per consumer. 
Second, a return to normal social usage occasions will accelerate purchases from depressed levels the brand experienced during the pandemic. This is not just a return to in-person schooling for younger consumers. This is a return to seeing family and friends dining out, attending concerts and sporting events and traveling. We know Vans has remained top of mind for its core consumers who are ready to reengage with the brand as they return to a normal cadence of lifestyle activities. 
And lastly, beginning next month, Vans will initiate a globally coordinated weekly drop cadence that marries both product and experiential demand creation to drive energy, excitement and brand heat. A key learning from the past year has been the importance of flowing new product and associated storytelling to deepen engagement with existing consumers and attract new consumers to the brand. This will be accompanied by an elevated vans.com experience to enhance the consumer journey around these exciting drops. 
While Vans is our largest brand, I don't want to lose sight of the momentum we're seeing across the remainder of our portfolio. As Matt will unpack shortly, our recovery this quarter and the strength of our fiscal '22 plan is broad based. 
There is tremendous momentum at The North Face and Dickies, which we expect to accelerate. We believe Timberland has reached an important inflection point. And Supreme is off to a strong start, and its path for sustainable long-term growth and value creation could not be more clear. 
Taken together, I'm entering this year with a strong sense of optimism. We have a best-in-class portfolio of brands with momentum, a leadership team across our brands and enterprise that possesses the skills and capabilities to lead our teams and to deliver on our commitments. 
There are tailwinds from both the strengthening consumer across the globe and in the categories where we are most present, and inventory levels are in good shape. Each of our brands are uniquely positioned to thrive in the coming year and return to their respective long-range plans as we emerge from this crisis as a stronger company. 
And now I'll turn it over to Matt."

And first, Steve, let me say how honored, excited and appreciative I am to have the opportunity to serve as CFO of this amazing 122-year-old company. And to Scott, thank you for the many years of mentoring and encouraging and supporting my professional development. Rest assured, you've had an impact on VF that is immeasurable, and you will be missed by all, but by none more than me. Best wishes, my friend. 
So let me start with an overview of the operating environment across geographic regions, starting with the Americas. The U.S. environment continues to improve with vaccine distribution, easing lockdown measures and a strengthening consumer. We started Q4 with about 15% of our doors closed in the region, mostly in California. As we sit today, virtually all of these doors have reopened. 
While store traffic remains depressed, conversion and AUR have been strong, and we have seen sequential improvement across the brick-and-mortar fleet, with a notable acceleration in March. Each of our largest brands returned to double-digit growth in the Americas, and our total DTC business increased 16%, led by 57% growth from Digital. Wholesale channel inventories remain clean, particularly across outdoor categories, which will provide a strong backdrop to the U.S. Wholesale business as we progress through fiscal 2022. 
In EMEA, the region has been impacted by rolling store closures throughout the entirety of fiscal '21, and our teams continued to navigate this disruption during Q4. We started the quarter with about half of our doors closed and finished the quarter with about 60% of doors closed. Key markets such as the U.K. and Germany were basically fully closed throughout the fourth quarter. Lockdowns are expected to ease beginning in May for most countries, except Germany and France, although a slower start to vaccine rollouts will likely hinder the pace of recovery in the coming months. 
Despite this choppier brick-and-mortar recovery, our teams have continued to leverage Digital, driving 99% growth in that channel during the period, with broad-based strength across the portfolio, and Digital increased 92%; The North Face, 118%; and Timberland, 122%. Our strong partnerships with digital partners such as Asos and Zalando also delivered impressive growth, accelerating in the quarter. We expect strong underlying Digital momentum to translate into accelerated growth in fiscal 2022. 
The APAC region has demonstrated incredible resiliency throughout the past year, led by Greater China and a strong consumer. Our Greater China business surpassed the $1 billion milestone in fiscal '21, growing 20%, capped off by 70% growth in Q4. Congratulations to our teams in the region for this important milestone. This represents nearly 25% growth over our fiscal 2019 Q4 revenue, the prior peak before the impact of COVID. All VF brands achieved growth in the region, led by 93% growth at The North Face and 107% growth at Dickies. 
We continue to view China as the leading indicator of the broader recovery in our business. And as our largest growth opportunity, we remain focused on maintaining momentum and continuing with investments focused toward our Distort to Asia strategy. The transition of our brand leadership teams and commercial operations to Shanghai is on track, which includes standing up a digital hub and establishing a consumer-centric structure that will help us transform and advance our capability serving Greater China and the region. 
Globally, our supply chain teams continue to navigate port congestion, capacity constraints, transitory cost pressures and elevated volatility across the network. Our teams are working tirelessly to minimize the impact of these challenges. However, we expect volatility and certain headwinds to continue for the foreseeable future. Fortunately, we have one of the strongest supply chains in the industry and are prepared for this challenge, having successfully navigated the unprecedented disruption over the past year. 
Now moving into our fourth quarter highlights. As you may have seen in this morning's release, our Q4 results benefited from a 53rd week in fiscal 2021. The impact of this was contemplated in our 2021 outlook shared in January. This benefit was magnified relative to Q4 due to the low base in the prior year and supply chain disruptions resulting from COVID-19. Importantly, this dynamic is reflected in the fiscal 2022 planned growth rates we will cover shortly. 
VF delivered 19% growth in Q4 or 12% organic growth despite headwinds from supply chain disruptions and more extended lockdowns throughout Europe. The strength of our business was broad based, with 16% growth from the Big 4 Brands and acceleration from many of our emerging brands, highlighted by 53% growth from Ulta. In its first quarter with VF, the Supreme brand contributed over $140 million of revenue, exceeding our expectations. 
As expected, Vans inflected positively, delivering 10% global growth as strength in the Americas and APAC regions more than offset larger-than-expected headwinds from store closures in Europe. Globally, Vans is seeing balanced momentum and performance across heritage and progression footwear. During Q4, Sk8-Hi, Authentic and Old Skool heritage styles each grew double digits, while the Pro Skate and MTE progression lines each grew more than 30%. Apparel also performed well, including mid-teens growth in women's. 
Vans' Digital growth accelerated to 52%, including a growing contribution from omnichannel sales, which represented over 10% of Digital revenue in the Americas. Vans stores also returned to growth globally after sequential quarterly improvement throughout fiscal 2021. 
Vans' DTC consumers returned strongly during March, both in stores and online and across both existing and new consumers. The Vans Family loyalty program added 1.2 million members in the U.S. in the last 4 months and now has nearly 15 million enrolled globally. With the reopening of Vans' store fleet, new membership growth has accelerated in March and April. 
The North Face delivered 23% growth, led by 56% growth in Digital. TNF achieved double-digit growth across all regions and channels as outdoor category tailwinds remain robust globally. From a product standpoint, the brand experienced relative strength from several on-mountain categories, including outerwear, led by our FUTURELIGHT offering; and footwear, led by our new VECTIV line. 
We see continued validation of the brand's innovation engine, recently highlighted in Outside Magazine's 2021 Summer Buyers' Guide, which features 6 products from The North Face, including Gear of the Year awards for 2 VECTIV products, awarded the Best Trail Running and Hiking Shoes of 2021. Momentum at The North Face also extends to the brand's off-mountain product portfolio, with strength from logowear and iconic franchises such as the Nuptse, which increased more than 75%. 
The brand also wrapped up the Gucci collab with the largest earned media campaign in The North Face's history, with more than 17 billion impressions, yielding worldwide 100% sell-through of all collaboration outerwear. And lastly, due partially to an exceptionally strong first-responder program throughout fiscal 2021, The North Face's Digital business increased 63%, including 49% growth in new paid customers, by adding 1.6 million in new loyalty members in the Americas. 
Timberland increased 19%, with continued momentum behind outdoor footwear, apparel, Timberland Pro and an accelerating classics business. Digital increased 96%, with additional strength from key digital retail partners. The brand successfully rolled out several new product stories, including Green Stride, which has garnered strong early read. Timberland delivered 54% global Digital growth in fiscal 2021, and is entering this year with broad-based momentum across the product portfolio. 
Finally, Dickies increased 19%, with continued strength across regions, channels and categories. The brand continued its strong performance in APAC, highlighted by more than 120% growth in Greater China. Work-inspired lifestyle product increased at a double-digit rate across all regions and represented 40% of total revenue. Despite headwinds from the pandemic, the brand delivered 7% growth in fiscal 2021 through strong execution against the strategic pillars of Digital, China and Work-inspired product categories. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.27, including a $0.06 contribution from Supreme, representing 89% organic growth and a strong start to our earnings recovery. Our liquidity remains strong as we ended the year with approximately $1.45 billion in cash and short-term investment and approximately $2.2 billion remaining undrawn on our revolver. 
As Steve referenced earlier, we've entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Occupational Workwear business to Redwood Capital Investments, which is expected to close in late Q1. This will provide an additional source of liquidity and further reduce our net leverage position. 
Moving now to our outlook for fiscal 2022. We expect total VF revenue to approximate $11.8 billion, representing about 28% of growth from fiscal '21 and a low double-digit increase relative to our prior peak revenue in fiscal 2020. This includes approximately $600 million of Supreme revenue. Excluding the Supreme business, our fiscal 2022 outlook implies growth of about 23%, representing high single-digit growth relative to fiscal 2020. 
By brand, we expect Vans to generate between 26% and 28% growth, representing a 7% to 9% increase relative to prior peak revenue. The North Face is expected to increase between 25% and 27%, representing 14% to 16% growth relative to fiscal 2020 and surpassing $3 billion in global brand revenue. We expect Timberland to increase between 16% and 18%, which implies revenue in line with prior peak levels. Lastly, we expect continued strength from Dickies, with growth accelerating to between 10% and 12%, which implies revenue up about 20% from fiscal 2020. 
By region, excluding Supreme, we expect Europe to increase about 30%, representing about 15% growth relative to prior peak revenue. We expect continued momentum in APAC, with close to 20% organic growth led by ongoing strength in China, where we expect growth to exceed 20%. In the Americas, we expect organic revenue growth of greater than 20%. 
By channel, again, excluding Supreme, we expect our DTC business to increase between 28% and 30%, including about 15% growth in Digital. We expect approximately half of total VF revenue to come from DTC this year. And including pure-play digital wholesale, we expect our total digital penetration in fiscal 2022 to exceed 30%. Finally, our Wholesale business is expected to grow at a high-teen rate, essentially recovering revenue lost over the past year and returning to prior peak levels. 
Moving down the P&L, we expect gross margin in excess of 56%, representing organic margins above prior peak levels. We expect an operating margin of about 12.8%, which implies high single-digit organic growth in our SG&A spend relative to fiscal 2020 levels. 
Now let me take a moment and unpack our expected SG&A growth relative to those prior peak levels. A large piece of the growth relates to continued investment against our growth-focused strategic priorities. Relative to fiscal '20, our fiscal '22 plan assumes over $150 million of incremental investments in demand creation and our business model transformation to be more consumer-minded, retail-centric and hyper-digital, which supports the strong growth commitments covered today. 
Other large drivers within SG&A are episodic to this year. A large piece of the growth is simply from foreign currency. Foreign currency translation represents about 20% of the expected dollar growth in SG&A. 
Another episodic piece of our SG&A growth relates to elevated distribution and freight. We are confident in our ability to mitigate these cost pressures over time, in addition to the strong pricing power our brands enjoy globally. However, higher costs will be a near-term headwind to profitability. 
Moving forward, we see a path to SG&A leverage as we exit fiscal 2022. And given the composition of our portfolio today, we see, at minimum, a return to our long-term earnings algorithm from our 2024 plan, with strong gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage supporting investment optionality. 
To wrap up our fiscal 2022 P&L outlook, we expect our tax rate to approximate 15%, which brings us to earnings per share of about $3.05, including an expected $0.25 per share contribution from the Supreme brand. Finally, we expect to generate over $1 billion in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures are planned to approximate $350 million. This includes the impact of growth investments as well as deferred capital spending from fiscal 2021 as a result of COVID. 
There are no changes to our capital allocation priorities moving forward. Our strong balance sheet will continue to be a focus, and we expect to end fiscal 2022 with net leverage between 2.5x and 3x. We remain committed to growing our dividend. And as always, we will remain opportunistic with M&A and other capital allocation alternatives, which we will explore as appropriate. 
So in summary, we could not be more pleased with how VF has navigated fiscal 2021. We fully executed on our plans in a challenging environment, driving digital growth, managing free cash flow and investing in our organic business, while evolving our portfolio to best position us for long-term value creation. As a result of the hard work throughout fiscal '21, we're exiting this year with broad-based momentum across the portfolio. And I'm very confident in VF's ability to drive accelerated growth into fiscal '22 and beyond. 
We will now turn the call over to the operator and take your questions."

So Vans, clearly, I hope through our -- my remarks in my script, you all noted just the confidence that we have and the momentum that we see building coming out of March into this year. We talked a lot about last year at the outsized impact that Vans incurred from the store closures, but also the disruption in inventory early and the impact on marketing and the ability to really tell those stories. 
As we think about this year, as those stores reopen, the upside could be very significant. And we know that these are a very powerful part of their connection to their consumers. This is where we really have, I think, a distinct competitive advantage. We have a higher loyalty member engagement. We see higher purchase frequency and a higher order value when our stores are up and running, and that is paying off as we see the acceleration coming out of March and April. 
But you can't discount at all this -- kind of this return to some normal usage occasions and the impact that, that will have on consumers' desire to purchase. We see that today. And then this move to a 50-week drop -- 52-week drop cadence that it's -- I think what's significant about that, Erinn, is it could be less about the products that we're putting on in front of you every week because it could be just a story, but it's an engagement moment for us to reach out to our current consumers, attract new consumers and really engage them in the brand's family and drive that long-term consumer loyalty. 
The Digital growth has been very, very important, clearly, in this last year, and it will continue to be. For us, as we -- it will moderate, for sure. We're not sure where that will land. But I think the critical part for us is how we seamlessly connect our stores with our e-commerce environments and really create that engagement method that we're able to connect with you, communicate with you, wherever you are and however you choose to engage with us. 
And we have a new store in Milan, the Orefici store is a test environment for us on a VF standpoint, using greater digital connectivity, in-store opportunities to engage, not only with content, but how we're able to service the consumer with a single view of inventory. We think that, going forward, will be a big advantage as well as we're able to prove it and then roll it out across our fleet. And clearly, Vans would be a big user of that new concept."

I'll add one thing to Steve's comment about Vans that I think the group probably understands. But if you think about the opportunity to see the business come back a little more quickly, especially in brick-and-mortar, we continue to remain disciplined as it relates to how we're supporting the business from an inventory standpoint. 
But the good news, certainly for Vans, is we've got the ability to get back in the inventory pretty quickly there. So if we see that begin to move a little faster, especially the recovery of the brick-and-mortar side of the business, we'll be able to support that. We'll be able to support some level of upside there given the capabilities that we have relative to lead times and some of the quick-turn things as we continue to remain [ in shape ]. 
So I think we're really confident in the plan we've laid out, but also, if that looks to see a little bit more momentum than maybe what we've initially called, then we'll have the opportunity to get after that as well."

And then just as we look ahead to get a little bit of sense of the confidence you have in the gross margin that you guided to for '22, maybe you could just give us a couple of thoughts on the components that build to it, geography, channel, which, I think, would be headwinds.

In terms of gross margin, I think, first off, I'll take you back to where we started this year. We went into the year, and we said we were going to be really aggressive to end the year in a clean position and end the year in a position of strength. And we've done that. We've executed on our plan really, really well in that regard. 
What we saw play out in the fourth quarter from a rate perspective as well, honestly, as we've seen play out through the year, has been right in line with our expectations. You have to remember, some of the choices that we made even last summer to emerge clean are impacting what you saw play out in the fourth quarter, and we certainly expected that. So no one brand, no one channel driving that. But certainly, the aggressive approach that we took to ending the year clean is a big element of that. 
The piece that has been more difficult for us to call through the year, honestly, has been the mix. We did end the year with our sort of normal kind of 50 basis point impact on a full year basis from mix, but we've seen some puts and takes there across the year. Because this has been, obviously, a really unique year in terms of trying to project and predict the mix of the business, in particular, the brick-and-mortar component of our business, as we've seen that be continually disrupted by store closures throughout the year. 
So I think what you can take away from that is we executed on our plan, just as we intended to. And certainly, there's been some variability because of the mix side. But in the end, we ended the year with inventories really clean, both our own inventories, but also with our retail partners, back down about 20% organically inventory for us. And that's really the thing that gives us the most confidence about gross margins next year. 
When we look at the mix of the business next year, and returning back to a more typical and normal type of mix, a little more consistency in the business in terms of how that will play out sort of quarter-over-quarter through the year. We're confident in the mix benefit that we've seen historically will be there. It will be there more consistently as we move through the year. 
And then so what you're going to see is a really nice snapback in terms of the right side of the equation as we're really going to be really, really clean and really, really lean in terms of managing the business, really starting right out of the gate here in the first quarter. We do expect actually a gross margin expansion in Q1. And as we said in our prepared comments, we expect gross margins on a full year basis, organically, to be slightly above prior peak levels. 
In terms of SG&A, I think what we wanted to indicate there with the forward look is that, yes, there's been -- we have the ability to see some leverage coming out of fiscal '22. You may remember, at Beaver Creek, we talked a lot about optionality, and that's really still the point. We'll have -- that leverage will give us the optionality to continue to invest, to support our biggest growth opportunities, whether it be demand creation or continue driving our transformation. 
So I think that's really the -- I don't think there's really any difference. It's just sort of maybe a nuance in terms of how you think about leverage opportunity in parts of the SG&A model and creating optionality to invest if we see opportunity to do so."

However, we've got comforted by the fact that we've got the best supply chain in the industry, and they're working incredibly hard to mitigate and navigate some of the challenges, as they have been, honestly, for the last 12 months. It's been really an interesting time in the supply chain, as we all understand. 
But we've got a lot of confidence in what we're doing. And right now, as we sit here today, not without some challenges, for sure, and some headwinds and even some cost pressures, as I mentioned. But our ability to support back-to-school and ultimately the holiday selling season, we're really confident in what we're doing, and we feel that we'll be well positioned there from a marketplace perspective."

Just the rigor and deep, deep experience behind the management of the brand and the coordinated effort across the globe, which is what gives us confidence as they begin to understand the VF model and the VF capabilities, that international component that they'll now be able to reach into and leverage against their international growth strategies. 
Yes, we recently opened the Milan store, and you saw just great, great response from consumers despite limited tourist traffic. They're meeting the normal expected volumes on a weekly basis.

The boot trend, I think there is a boot trend for sure, but I think more importantly, there's an outdoor trend, and we're seeing that represented in our sell-through. But the nice thing, Laurent, is our growth has been very balanced. And we are not planning to see our Classics business have outsized growth. And I think, in fact, between fiscal '20 and fiscal '22, we're planning it to be about flat.

On-mountain is really setting the tone and the performance product has seen really good sell-through, and that's driving that off-mountain lifestyle franchise growth that we see building. It has been growing nicely in Europe. We've seen that now really move its way into Asia, really significant growth in China, as that consumer becomes more engaged with the outdoors and the Winter Olympics becomes a big part of the China focus. And we're right in the middle and being able to benefit from that. 
But we're seeing really strong return to growth here in the U.S. market and really witnessed, with the strong holiday sell-through we saw here, not only in our own channels, but in wholesale. The disciplined market management, as we clean up distribution, strengthened key wholesale partner relationships and balanced the use of our own stores, our own digital platform to drive that on-mountain, off-mountain story.

It could be a color of an existing franchise, but they'll be very coordinated global launches of these product stories.

I think how you'll -- how we'll really drive that marketing will certainly be heavily focused towards online, through our own direct engagement, through social channels, through e-mail marketing, the power of the loyalty program, that now is above 15 million people, and really engaging on opportunities that are unique to that particular consumer, that they're able to access due to their loyalty membership will be a very important part.

In the first half of the year, as we pulled way back, and those began to build back in Q3 and then back in Q4, we're back above prior year levels and pretty much in line with historical ratios. 
We talked about the SG&A increase from '20 to '22 and the investments that we're making, $150 million cumulatively, a big piece of that is demand creation. And we're actually returning to levels that are in line and actually, probably, modestly slightly higher from a ratio standpoint than what we ran in fiscal '20. We remain focused on the highest ROI activities, very disciplined in our management of the marketing. 
As we've shifted more towards digital, the good news there is you get really quick reads in terms of the effectiveness of that marketing and the returns that it's driving and the ability to be much more dynamic in your ability to move and move those dollars around and against things that are really driving returns. And you can see that certainly much quicker than maybe you could previously. So we have confidence -- we're confident that the marketing we spend is going to drive returns. And -- but certainly, we're leaning back in to support the strong revenue recovery assumptions we have in our outlook."

We are encouraged by the strong start to our fiscal 2022 year. Our teams delivered an outstanding first quarter, powering VF back to pre-pandemic revenue levels while driving an earnings recovery well ahead of our initial expectations. We continued to see broad-based momentum across the portfolio, which furthers my confidence in our ability to accelerate growth through fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
While the near-term environment remains somewhat clouded by virus surges in Southeast Asia, uncertainties in other regions brought on by the impact of new variants and further pressures on the global supply chain, our teams are executing. We remain focused on the things that we can control, in winning in the parts of our business, with the consumers coming back strong. And we remain confident in our ability to continue driving this sharp recovery across our business. 
Matt will walk you through our results in detail, but I'll start this off with some Q1 highlights. 
VF revenue has surpassed pre-pandemic levels, growing 96% or 83% organically to $2.2 billion, with momentum across brands, regions and channels. Our global D2C business delivered high single-digit growth relative to prior peak levels, driven by a strong acceleration from our brick-and-mortar stores in the U.S. and continued strength in our digital. Our organic D2C digital business is now 72% above fiscal 2020 levels, including the growing benefit of our omnichannel capabilities as we serve our consumers seamlessly across their choice of channel. 
We've seen a sharp recovery in our wholesale business, which grew over 100% organically in Q1, approaching prior peak fiscal 2020 levels. Strong sell-through trends and clean channel inventory levels from the past year are now translating into stronger fall '21 and spring '22 order books, supporting an improving outlook for our wholesale business for this year and beyond. 
We've seen a strong recovery in our gross margin, which grew 260 basis points to 56.7% in Q1. This represents organic gross margin expansion relative to prior peak fiscal 2020 levels despite a 30 basis point headwind from a more challenging logistics and freight environment. VF drove organic earnings growth of 133%, delivering $0.27 in Q1, essentially doubling our plan. We're pleased to see our top line momentum and strong gross margin expansion translate into better-than-anticipated SG&A leverage and earnings flow-through, an indication of the upside potential of our model as our recovery accelerates. 
Now turning to our brand highlights from the quarter. 
The Vans brand has returned to pre-pandemic revenue levels, growing 102% in Q1. The recovery has been led by global D2C business, which drove double-digit growth relative to fiscal 2020, led by 73% growth in digital. This D2C strength has been broad-based, with each region recording positive D2C growth relative to pre-pandemic levels. More Vans consumers have returned to in-person shopping experiences earlier than expected, and we see encouraging trends in our D2C KPIs and with consumers buying more frequently and spending more per purchase relative to historic levels. 
In EMEA, despite the continued impact of lockdowns and supply chain disruptions, the Vans business grew 125% this quarter, representing 30% growth relative to fiscal 2020, with strength across all major markets as stores reopened throughout the region. Vans APAC business grew 19% in Q1, led by 22% growth in China. June marked a milestone for the brand in China with the soft launch of the Vans Family program. While the official launch will be celebrated with the Super brand on Tmall tomorrow, we have already registered over 1 million new loyalty members following the initial launch, bringing Global Vans Family membership to nearly 17 million consumers. 
Vans kicked off its 52-week drop calendar this quarter, seeking to create a consistent, predictable, globally aligned and focused approach to drive brand energy and consumer engagement. 7 weeks into the program, we are encouraged by the initial consumer reads and the instant sellout of several early drops. Internally, the Vans team has increased its focus, energy and resources around driving newness and compelling storytelling, which we believe will unlock further long-term value for the brand. The team is on track to more formally market the Vans drop list in fiscal Q3, ahead of the fall holiday season. 
We remain bullish on the setup for Vans moving through fiscal 2022 and are encouraged by the early reads from the back-to-school season underway. We are raising our full year outlook to growth of 28% to 29%, representing growth of 9% to 10% relative to fiscal 2020. 
Moving on to The North Face. Global Brand revenues increased 83%, representing 6% growth above pre-pandemic levels. All regions rebounded sharply in Q1, highlighted by continued exceptional performance in EMEA, which grew 142% versus the prior year and 58% relative to fiscal '20, despite the impact of door closures over the period. The APAC business grew 22% in Q1, highlighted by 80% growth in digital relative to fiscal 2020 levels. 
The North Face's spring sell-through rates were some of the highest in years, reflecting strong progress on the brand's ability to drive 365-day relevancy. TNF continues to drive energy in on mountain categories with the future life franchise as well as the new Vecta footwear rollout, further establishing its legitimacy in outdoor footwear. We also see outsized growth from the casual categories such as logowear, which grew over 100% in Q1, as consumers show strong engagement with the brand of Mountain. TNF's loyalty program, the Explore Pass, has grown to over 7 million consumers, adding nearly 300,000 new members in Q1, driven by exclusive member experiences enriching the consumer journey. 
We continue to be encouraged by the broad-based global momentum at The North Face, and now expect the brand to deliver 26% to 27% growth this year, representing [Audio Gap] 
ahead of plan. We are encouraged by high-teens growth in the Americas and 87% growth in digital relative to fiscal 2020 levels. We continue to see outsized growth from outdoor, apparel and TimberlandPRO, each growing over 75% in the quarter. Momentum behind core iconic product also continues, with heritage styles seeing strong demand despite historically low inventories. Our Timberland team remains committed to its purpose-led vision highlighted by the recently announced global product take-back program in partnership with Recircle. Beginning this fall, U.S. consumers will be able to return any Timberland product to a brand [Audio Gap] a positive impact on nature by 2030. We're encouraged by Timberland's strong start to the year. And as a result, we now expect the brand to deliver modest growth relative to fiscal 2020, surpassing pre-pandemic revenues beginning in Q2. 
Dickies delivered another exceptional quarter, growing 58% in Q1, well ahead of our plan. As the brand has kicked off several new campaigns and inventories become more available, we've been pleasantly surprised by the intensity of sell-through performance across all wholesale partners in the U.S. This acceleration continues to be driven by both work-inspired lifestyle products, which reported strong growth across all 3 regions as well as core work items. Work-inspired lifestyle now represents about 40% of global brand revenue. Importantly, the Dickies brand has begun to deliver meaningful [Audio Gap] to mid-teen growth in fiscal 2022, representing over 25% growth relative to fiscal 2020 levels. 
A quick update on Supreme. We continued to be happy with the integration process. The VF supply chain organization continues to advance engagement with the Supreme teams, with particular leverage opportunities and logistics capabilities, scale and relationships, which couldn't come at a more opportune time. One quarter into our fiscal year, we remain confident in our outlook of $600 million and $0.25 from the brand. 
Before I turn the call over to Matt, I want to thank our associates from around the world, across our brands and enterprise functions, with a particular call out to our supply chain teams who have been working tirelessly over the past 18 months to minimize disruption against the backdrop of unprecedented volatility. Our strong results are a reflection of the consistent execution, hard work and inspiring dedication of our teams around the world. This continued passion and energy alongside the broad-based nature of VF's acceleration give me great confidence in our ability to continue driving the strong recovery underway. While the first quarter represents a small portion of our total year, we're starting off fiscal 2022, building up the great momentum which began in February of this year. 
And now I'll turn it over to Matt."

We're encouraged by the continued broad based growth across geographic regions. 
In the Americas, less than 5% of our stores were closed at the beginning of the quarter and all stores are currently operational. A strong U.S. consumer, easing U.S. restrictions and increased vaccination rates have encouraged a gradual recovery in foot traffic, alongside continued strength in conversion [Audio Gap]. 
Low inventories and strong sell-through trends continue to drive down promotional activity and improve quality of sales across the marketplace, which is resulting in stronger-than-expected order books for the upcoming fall and spring season. 
Moving on to the EMEA region. While lockdown measures continued to affect economic activity, our business has remained resilient, growing 97% organically in Q1, representing 13% growth relative to fiscal 2020. Both wholesale and D2C channels returned to growth relative to 2020, as continued strength from both our direct to digital channel and from digital Titan partners helped more than offset the impact of brick-and-mortar store closures. About 60% of our EMEA stores were closed to start the first quarter. As we sit here today, all of those doors have now reopened. The consumer confidence is improving as restrictions eased. And we've seen strong performance from our brick-and-mortar fleet following reopening. For example, our U.K. business delivered triple-digit growth from open doors following 3 months of lockdowns, representing growth of nearly 30% relative to fiscal 2020. 
Finally, our APAC region continues to deliver double-digit growth despite sporadic resurgence of the virus across many markets. Our China business grew 12% in Q1, which was impacted by a wholesale timing shift of revenues from Q1 into Q2. Excluding this impact, China would have delivered mid-teen growth this quarter. We continue to see digitally-led growth in the region, particularly with our Titan partners, and remain confident in our ability to deliver greater than 20% growth in China in fiscal 2022. 
While we remain pleased with our APAC performance to date, we are observing most Southeast Asian markets facing various degrees of lockdowns and travel [Audio Gap] of expedited shipping and dual sourcing where appropriate. 
While we remain confident in our ability to service our strong growth plan, there is a financial implication of these actions. For example, we expect to spend more than $35 million in incremental expedited freight charges relative to fiscal 2020. 
We view our supply chain as a key competitive advantage at VF, and our teams are proving this now more than ever. I want to echo Steve's appreciation for the supply chain team's incredible execution over the past 18 months. As a result of their tireless and tremendous efforts, I remain confident in our ability to continue navigating this dynamic environment. 
Now moving into our Q1 financial results. 
Total VF revenue increased 96% or 83% organically to $2.2 billion, reaching pre-pandemic levels one quarter ahead of our initial expectations. Our Q1 digital business is 72% above fiscal 2020 levels organically, representing a 31% 2-year CAGR. We also continue to see strength from key digital partners globally, with pure-play digital wholesale growth of over 70% relative to fiscal 2020. VF's total digital penetration was roughly 1/4 of our Q1 revenues, which represents about 2x our penetration from the first quarter of 2020. 
Gross margin expanded 260 basis points to 56.7%, representing organic expansion from Q1 peak gross margin levels in fiscal 2020. Relative to last year, this strong expansion was driven by greater full-price selling, partially offset by the expedited freight costs and business mix as our wholesale business rebounded sharply in the quarter. When compared to fiscal 2020 gross margin, we generated a strong mix benefit, partially offset by the incremental air freight costs and FX. 
Operating margin expanded meaningfully to 6.8%, driven by the strong gross margin performance and SG&A leverage relative to the prior year. We delivered EPS of $0.27 in Q1, representing 133% organic growth, driven by a stronger top line and earnings flow-through relative to our initial expectations. 
Following the strong broad-based performance in Q1, we are raising our full year fiscal 2022 outlook. Our outlook today assumes no significant changes to the environment, including increased disruption to our supply chain operations. VF revenue is now expected to be at least $12 billion, representing at least 30% growth from fiscal 2021 and a mid-teen increase relative to our prior peak revenue in fiscal 2020. Excluding the Supreme business, our fiscal 2022 outlook implies organic growth of at least 25%, representing at least 9% organic growth relative to fiscal 2020. 
As Steve covered, the increase to our revenue guidance is broad-based across the portfolio, with stronger outlooks for each of our top 4 brands and sizable increases in 2 of our emerging brands, Ultra and SmartWorld. Specifically, the improved outlooks are supported by stronger-than-anticipated order books and the accelerating D2C trends we've observed over the past 5 months. 
Moving down the P&L. We still expect gross margin to exceed 56% despite a 20 to 30 basis point headwind from additional airfreight that wasn't assumed in our initial outlook. We now expect operating margin to be at least 13%, an improvement of over 20 basis points from our initial outlook, a signal to the upside potential of our model as our top line accelerates. Fiscal 2022 EPS is now expected to be at least $3.20, including a $0.25 per share contribution from the Supreme brand, representing at least 20% earnings growth relative to fiscal 2020. We continue to expect to generate over $1 billion in operating cash flow this year, with planned capital expenditures of about $350 million, including the impact of growth investments as well as deferred capital spending from fiscal 2021. 
As announced on June 28, we closed the sale of the occupational work business this quarter, providing roughly $615 million of additional liquidity. These proceeds are reflected in our fiscal 2022 outlook for total liquidity to exceed $4 billion. 
We expect to exit this year with net leverage between 2.5x and 3x, providing us meaningful near-term optionality to deploy excess capital moving forward. 
So to conclude our prepared remarks. I'm extremely pleased with the broad-based strength we're seeing across our portfolio as we begin fiscal 2022. We took bold decisive actions last year to position our brands and the enterprise with a strong recovery currently underway. And the balanced broad-based nature of this recovery along with the continued optionality that our model provides gives me confidence in our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth moving forward.

But you talked about a $35 million impact from incremental freight, 20, 30 bps on the GM. Can you talk about the shape of the gross margin between the first half and second half? And I think remind [Audio Gap] Matt. I think during the Q&A last call, asked about how do we think about first half EPS, and I think it was about $1.20. Just due to the size of the impact of -- or just the magnitude of the beat, how do we think about first half EPS?"

So let me -- first of all, we're not going to give specific Q2 outlook today. But certainly, as evidenced by our outlook, we're confident in taking the year up and as we begin to really load up things on the wholesale side for fall and holiday. And just given the supply chain pressures, it's really hard to call the puts and takes between quarters. And to some degree, I think we can expect that quarter-to-quarter volatility will continue in the near term. However though, with what we know today, while some of the flow may not be perfectly optimized, as we begin the season in particular, we don't expect a meaningful impact on our ability to ultimately deliver the fall holiday season. And I'll remind you that as we have continually done, we expect that we'll perform relatively better than the competitive set. 
As it relates to gross margin, what I would say is, certainly, we're holding the year at greater than 56. We talked about the fact that we're absorbing some higher freight, particularly air freight and other forms of expedited freight. I think we said 20 to 30 basis points in the prepared remarks so -- versus our original outlook. So in a meaningful amount, I will tell you that the vast majority of that actually sits in our second quarter, is the way we would expect that to play out. 
The other thing I would remind you is, we have currency headwinds that we're up against. That will begin to abate a little bit as we move later in the year. And probably the last point I would make around gross margin, we talked about the fact that our pricing actions, which have been relatively limited through spring '21 and fall '21, you'll see the impact of more significant pricing activity as we move into spring '22. So the Q4 window will benefit a little bit more from that perspective as well."

China continues to be really strong, but you got to remember, rest of Asia is pretty volatile at the moment given flare-ups and virus. So it's not an enormous part of our business, but when you look at that total region, there is some impact across what I'll call rest of Asia. Think about Korea, even Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, et cetera. So on the Asia side, there's some puts and takes there, I think, in terms of how we think about that business. The Europe business continues to be quite strong. And probably what's at play here a little bit too is when we laid out our initial guidance in May and talked about the opportunity, it could be a little bit conservative. I think that was predominantly in Americas related comment. So I think we're seeing the Americas business in the U.S. consumer come back strong. And that's playing out across our businesses, by the way. That's a broad-based comment across all of our big businesses and really across our portfolio as we see the U.S. consumer coming back strong. And certainly, that's important from a go-forward standpoint. And obviously, it's critical to the Vans business, I think, in particular, given the size of that business in the U.S. as well as the size of the brick-and-mortar business here as well. So that's obviously really encouraging for us. 
And remember, the last thing I would say, we still are maintaining a fairly cautious approach from a year-to-go perspective. In our direct-to-consumer business, we've got sequential improvement coming as our expectation. We saw a stronger result in Q1. As I said, we've extrapolated that a bit into Q2, but we remain careful there in terms of how that will play out over time. So hopefully, that answers your question."

So this team over the last 2 years has really simplified their approach to the business, focusing on their core icons, building out the lifestyle piece of the business, while really respecting that core workwear. We have channel expansion opportunities that we see going on beyond just the core work points of sale. We're growing into sporting goods. The recent launch of the Skate collection is accessing a whole host of new specialty skate accounts, which is just a great brand-building image component. It's also giving them permission to elevate some of the offer. We've recently launched the Signature Collection, which is an elevated higher price point, better gross margin. Collection of items really built off those core icons. So I just -- I think it's -- I think the point here is they've focused the business. It's broad-based across all 3 regions.

From a margin standpoint, I think you said mid-teens for this year, which is an impressive recovery. Where does Vans fit in the overall margin profile relative to where it was back in Beaver Creek in pre-fiscal '20? It was significantly higher from a margin -- contribution margin than every other brand in the portfolio. Just curious where that sits now and where you think it's going to go in fiscal '22 and beyond."

It sits well above most of our brand portfolio from a profitability standpoint. Really strength in the gross margins, strength driven from the direct-to-consumer business, a really, really profitable brick-and-mortar franchise. As you think about -- I mean, the one thing I would say, versus pre-COVID levels, there's still a little bit of a headwind there, primarily because of 2 things. One, the freight side of things that they're dealing with, as all of our brands are. But remember too, that's the one business where brick-and-mortar is really significant. And while we're seeing sequential improvement, and while, fortunately, we're seeing that even be a little stronger than we thought, we're still modeling brick-and-mortar to be down across the year and not really fully recover until early fiscal '23. That was my point earlier about we remain fairly conservative in our outlook there as we move through, and particularly the back half of the year. So there's a little bit of overhang there in the short term. But yes, Vans profitability that you would have seen in Beaver Creek and [Audio Gap] creation."

What we have done, we haven't -- we've been pretty cautious still in our actual assumptions from a revenue perspective in the back half of the year. We haven't really changed those, just to be frank. But what we have done, in particular in Vans, and this is the point that Steve was making, we are leaning in a little bit from an inventory perspective to create some additional capacity there for upside, whether that be in our own stores or potentially even in terms of wholesale reorders.

This is an exciting development for Vans. It's something they pivoted and moved on very quickly. Just remind everybody, this idea of a 52-week drop model was to really think and act like a true retail operator and bring a more predictable, a more visible understanding of the product flow, and use this to create brand heat. And we've seen that play out extremely well. We're only about 7 weeks in. They're learning every week about just how to really manage the offer for the week, how to marry the content and the storytelling, how to lever broad-based global drops that could be available across multiple channels of distribution versus various select vault type products. But the point here is they're providing visibility. And they're giving visibility in enough time for consumers to learn about it, build the excitement. And that frenzy demand that we've seen really reflect itself into some of the key collections that have dropped this year. Bodega, from a specialty Vault collection to the broad-based Sponge Bob Square pants, and most recently, the Metallica drop. What you're going to see us do or our Vans team do is they get just refining the model. They'll start to publish the drop list. And we think that's something that will be possible by Q3. So they'll give the consumer visibility of what's coming and begin to allow themselves to be positioned to capture the product if it's a limited drop or be in the queue if it's a broader-based drop. So I think this is just a really thoughtful evolution to what was already a well-designed go-to-market model. But this is about driving brand heat and increasing consumer demand, and ultimately, consumer loyalty."

Welcome to our first quarter call.
We're encouraged by the strong start to our fiscal 2022 year. Our teams delivered an outstanding first quarter, powering VF back to pre-pandemic revenue levels, while driving an earnings recovery well ahead of our initial expectations. We continue to see broad-based momentum across the portfolio, which furthers my confidence in our ability to accelerate growth through fiscal 2022 and beyond.
While the near-term environment remains somewhat clouded by virus surges in Southeast Asia, uncertainties in other regions brought on by the impact of new variants and further pressures on the global supply chain, our teams are executing. We remain focused on the things that we can control, in winning in the parts of our business, with the consumers coming back strong. And we remain confident in our ability to continue driving this sharp recovery across our business.
Matt will walk you through our results in detail, but I'll start this off with some Q1 highlights.
VF revenue has surpassed pre-pandemic levels, growing 96% or 83% organically to $2.2 billion, with momentum across brands, regions and channels. Our global D2C business delivered high single-digit growth relative to prior peak levels, driven by a strong acceleration from our brick-and-mortar stores in the U.S. and continued strength in our digital. Our organic D2C digital business is now 72% above fiscal 2020 levels, including the growing benefit of our omni-channel capabilities as we serve our consumers seamlessly across their choice of channel.
We've seen a sharp recovery in our wholesale business, which grew over 100% organically in Q1, approaching prior peak fiscal 2020 levels. Strong sell-through trends and clean channel inventory levels from the past year are now translating into stronger fall '21 and spring '22 order books, supporting an improving outlook for our wholesale business for this year and beyond.
We've seen a strong recovery in our gross margin, which grew 260 basis points to 56.7% in Q1. This represents organic gross margin expansion relative to prior peak fiscal 2020 levels despite a 30 basis point headwind from a more challenging logistics and freight environment.
VF drove organic earnings growth of 133%, delivering $0.27 in Q1, essentially doubling our plan. We're pleased to see our top line momentum and strong gross margin expansion translate into better-than-anticipated SG&A leverage and earnings flow-through, an indication of the upside potential of our model as our recovery accelerates.
Now turning to our brand highlights from the quarter. The Vans brand has returned to pre-pandemic revenue levels, growing 102% in Q1. The recovery has been led by global D2C business, which drove double-digit growth relative to fiscal 2020, led by 73% growth in digital. This D2C strength has been broad-based, with each region recording positive D2C growth relative to pre-pandemic levels. More Vans consumers have returned to in-person shopping experiences earlier than expected, and we see encouraging trends in our D2C KPIs, with consumers buying more frequently and spending more per purchase relative to historic levels.
In EMEA, despite the continued impact of lockdowns and supply chain disruptions, the Vans business grew 125% this quarter, representing 30% growth relative to fiscal 2020, with strength across all major markets as stores reopened throughout the region.
Vans APAC business grew 19% in Q1, led by 22% growth in China. June marked a milestone for the brand in China with the soft launch of the Vans Family program. While the official launch will be celebrated with the Super Brand Day on Tmall tomorrow, we have already registered over 1 million new loyalty members following the initial launch, bringing Global Vans Family membership to nearly 17 million consumers.
Vans kicked off its 52-week drop calendar this quarter, seeking to create a consistent, predictable, globally aligned and focused approach to drive brand energy and consumer engagement. 7 weeks into the program, we are encouraged by the initial consumer reads and the instant sellout of several early drops.
Internally, the Vans team has increased its focus, energy and resources around driving newness and compelling storytelling, which we believe will unlock further long-term value for the brand. The team is on track to more formally market the Vans drop list in fiscal Q3, ahead of the fall holiday season.
We remain bullish on the setup for Vans moving through fiscal 2022 and are encouraged by the early reads from the back-to-school season underway. We are raising our full year outlook to growth of 28% to 29%, representing growth of 9% to 10% relative to fiscal 2020.
Moving on to The North Face. Global brand revenues increased 83%, representing 6% growth above pre-pandemic levels. All regions rebounded sharply in Q1, highlighted by continued exceptional performance in EMEA, which grew 142% versus the prior year and 58% relative to fiscal '20, despite the impact of door closures over the period. The APAC business grew 22% in Q1, highlighted by 80% growth in digital relative to fiscal 2020 levels.
The North Face's spring sell-through rates were some of the highest in years, reflecting strong progress on the brand's ability to drive 365-day relevancy. TNF continues to drive energy in on-mountain categories with the FUTURELIGHT franchise as well as the new VECTIV footwear rollout, further establishing its legitimacy in Outdoor footwear. We also see outsized growth from the casual categories such as logowear, which grew over 100% in Q1, as consumers showed strong engagement with the brand off-mountain. TNF's loyalty program, the Explore Pass, has grown to over 7 million consumers, adding nearly 300,000 new members in Q1, driven by exclusive member experiences enriching the consumer journey.
We continue to be encouraged by the broad-based global momentum at The North Face, and now expect the brand to deliver 26% to 27% growth this year, representing 15% to 17% growth relative to fiscal 2020. Alongside this significant top line recovery, we're seeing strong improvements in profitability, and continue to expect mid-teen profitability for TNF in fiscal 2022.
The Timberland brand delivered a 63% growth in Q1, tracking ahead of plan. We're encouraged by high-teens growth in the Americas and 87% growth in digital, relative to fiscal 2020 levels. We continue to see outsized growth from Outdoor, Apparel and Timberland PRO, each growing over 75% in the quarter. Momentum behind core iconic product also continues, with heritage styles seeing strong demand despite historically low inventories.
Our Timberland team remains committed to its purpose-led vision, highlighted by the recently announced global product take-back program in partnership with ReCircled. Beginning this fall, U.S. consumers will be able to return any Timberland product to a brand store to either be refurbished for resale or recycled into future products. This program supports the brand's bold vision announced last fall for products to have a net positive impact on nature by 2030. We're encouraged by Timberland's strong start to the year. And as a result, we now expect the brand to deliver modest growth relative to fiscal 2020, surpassing pre-pandemic revenues beginning in Q2.
Dickies delivered another exceptional quarter, growing 58% in Q1, well ahead of our plan. As the brand has kicked off several new campaigns and inventories become more available, we've been pleasantly surprised by the intensity of sell-through performance across all wholesale partners in the U.S. This acceleration continues to be driven by both work-inspired lifestyle products, which reported strong growth across all 3 regions as well as core work items.
Work-inspired lifestyle now represents about 40% of global brand revenue. Importantly, the Dickies brand has begun to deliver meaningful profitability improvements, driven by both gross margin expansion and SG&A efficiencies. Q1 represented a strong start to our goal of returning to double-digit profit margins in the Work segment in fiscal 2022.
Following a strong Q1 performance and accelerating demand signals across channels, we are confident raising the full year outlook for the Dickies brand to mid-teen growth in fiscal 2022, representing over 25% growth relative to fiscal 2020 levels.
A quick update on Supreme. We continue to be happy with the integration process. The VF supply chain organization continues to advance engagement with the Supreme teams, with particular leverage opportunities and logistics capabilities, scale and relationships, which couldn't come at a more opportune time. One quarter into our fiscal year, we remain confident in our outlook of $600 million and $0.25 from the brand.
Before I turn the call over to Matt, I want to thank our associates from around the world, across our brands and enterprise functions, with a particular call out to our supply chain teams who have been working tirelessly over the past 18 months to minimize disruption against the backdrop of unprecedented volatility.
Our strong results are a reflection of the consistent execution, hard work and inspiring dedication of our teams around the world. This continued passion and energy alongside the broad-based nature of VF's acceleration give me great confidence in our ability to continue driving the strong recovery underway. While the first quarter represents a small portion of our total year, we're starting off fiscal 2022, building up the great momentum which began in February of this year.
And now I'll turn it over to Matt."

I'm really happy to update you on our strong Q1 results and revised outlook for the year. We're encouraged by the continued broad-based momentum across our business and a setup for each of our big brands heading into",1353,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'm really happy to update you on our strong Q1 results and revised outlook for the year. We're encouraged by the continued broad-based momentum across our business and a setup for each of our big brands heading into the heart of our fiscal year.
Despite additional pressures throughout the global supply chain, I remain confident in our team's ability to execute and to build on the strong earnings recovery delivered in Q1. Let me start with an overview of the operating environment across geographic regions.
In the Americas, less than 5% of our stores were closed at the beginning of the quarter, and all stores are currently operational. A strong U.S. consumer, easing U.S. restrictions and increased vaccination rates have encouraged a gradual recovery in foot traffic, alongside continued strength in conversion.
Our Americas D2C business grew 84% organically in Q1, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, led by our sharper-than-expected recovery in our brick-and-mortar business. Consumer appetite for athletic, athleisure and outdoor categories remain strong, benefiting our direct business as well as the performance of our key accounts.
Low inventories and strong sell-through trends continue to drive down promotional activity and improve quality of sales across the marketplace, which is resulting in stronger-than-expected order books for the upcoming fall and spring season.
Moving on to the EMEA region. While lockdown measures continued to affect economic activity, our business has remained resilient, growing 97% organically in Q1, representing 13% growth relative to fiscal 2020. Both wholesale and D2C channels returned to growth relative to 2020, as continued strength from both our direct digital channel and from Digital Titan partners helped more than offset the impact of brick-and-mortar store closures.
About 60% of our EMEA stores were closed to start the first quarter. As we sit here today, all of those doors have now reopened. The consumer confidence is improving as restrictions eased. And we've seen strong performance from our brick-and-mortar fleet following reopening. For example, our U.K. business delivered triple-digit growth from open doors following 3 months of lockdowns, representing growth of nearly 30% relative to fiscal 2020.
Finally, our APAC region continues to deliver double-digit growth despite sporadic resurgence of the virus across many markets. Our China business grew 12% in Q1, which was impacted by a wholesale timing shift of revenues from Q1 into Q2. Excluding this impact, China would have delivered mid-teen growth this quarter. We continue to see digitally-led growth in the region, particularly with our Titan partners, and remain confident in our ability to deliver greater than 20% growth in China in fiscal 2022.
While we remain pleased with our APAC performance to date, we are observing most Southeast Asian markets facing various degrees of lockdowns and travel restrictions. And while only about 5% of our stores are currently closed, commercial activity has been impacted across most APAC markets outside of China and Hong Kong. This latest rate also presents additional near-term uncertainty for our global supply chain.
In recent weeks, more widespread virus outbreaks in key sourcing countries with lower levels of vaccinations have resulted in temporary factory lockdowns and manufacturing capacity constraints. Our supply chain also continues to be impacted by port delays, equipment availability and other logistics challenges. Essentially, every link in the supply chain has been impacted to varying degrees over the last 18 months.
And while we're not immune to this, we believe we've managed these challenges relatively better than most. Our teams remain focused on delivering the products to satisfy increasing demand signals in the most cost-effective and efficient way. Some of the actions include using airfreight, other means of expedited shipping and dual sourcing where appropriate.
While we remain confident in our ability to service our strong growth plan, there is a financial implication to these actions. For example, we expect to spend more than $35 million in incremental expedited freight charges relative to fiscal 2020.
We view our supply chain as a key competitive advantage at VF, and our teams are proving this now more than ever. I want to echo Steve's appreciation for the supply chain team's incredible execution over the past 18 months. As a result of their tireless and tremendous efforts, I remain confident in our ability to continue navigating this dynamic environment.
Now moving into our Q1 financial results. Total VF revenue increased 96% or 83% organically to $2.2 billion, reaching pre-pandemic levels one quarter ahead of our initial expectations. Our Q1 digital business is 72% above fiscal 2020 levels organically, representing a 31% 2-year CAGR.
We also continue to see strength from key digital partners globally, with pure-play digital wholesale growth of over 70% relative to fiscal 2020. VF's total digital penetration was roughly 1/4 of our Q1 revenues, which represents about 2x our penetration from the first quarter of 2020.
Gross margin expanded 260 basis points to 56.7%, representing organic expansion from Q1 peak gross margin levels in fiscal 2020. Relative to last year, this strong expansion was driven by greater full-price selling, partially offset by the expedited freight costs and business mix as our wholesale business rebounded sharply in the quarter. When compared to fiscal 2020 gross margins, we generated a strong mix benefit, partially offset by the incremental airfreight costs and FX.
Operating margin expanded meaningfully to 6.8%, driven by the strong gross margin performance and SG&A leverage relative to the prior year. We delivered EPS of $0.27 in Q1, representing 133% organic growth, driven by a stronger top line and earnings flow-through relative to our initial expectations.
Following the strong broad-based performance in Q1, we are raising our full year fiscal 2022 outlook. Our outlook today assumes no significant changes to the environment, including increased disruption to our supply chain operations. VF revenue is now expected to be at least $12 billion, representing at least 30% growth from fiscal 2021 and a mid-teen increase relative to our prior peak revenue in fiscal 2020. Excluding the Supreme business, our fiscal 2022 outlook implies organic growth of at least 25%, representing at least 9% organic growth relative to fiscal 2020.
As Steve covered, the increase to our revenue guidance is broad-based across the portfolio, with stronger outlooks for each of our top 4 brands and sizable increases in 2 of our emerging brands, Ulta and SmartWool. Specifically, the improved outlooks are supported by stronger-than-anticipated order books and the accelerating D2C trends we've observed over the past 5 months.
Moving down the P&L. We still expect gross margin to exceed 56% despite a 20 to 30 basis point headwind from additional airfreight that wasn't assumed in our initial outlook. We now expect operating margin to be at least 13%, an improvement of over 20 basis points from our initial outlook, a signal to the upside potential of our model as our top line accelerates.
Fiscal 2022 EPS is now expected to be at least $3.20, including a $0.25 per share contribution from the Supreme brand, representing at least 20% earnings growth relative to fiscal 2020. We continue to expect to generate over $1 billion in operating cash flow this year, with planned capital expenditures of about $350 million, including the impact of growth investments as well as deferred capital spending from fiscal 2021.
As announced on June 28, we closed the sale of the occupational work business this quarter, providing roughly $615 million of additional liquidity. These proceeds are reflected in our fiscal 2022 outlook for total liquidity to exceed $4 billion.
We expect to exit this year with net leverage between 2.5x and 3x, providing us meaningful near-term optionality to deploy excess capital moving forward.
So to conclude our prepared remarks, I'm extremely pleased with the broad-based strength we're seeing across our portfolio as we begin fiscal 2022. We took bold decisive actions last year to position our brands and the enterprise with a strong recovery currently underway. And the balanced broad-based nature of this recovery along with the continued optionality that our model provides gives me confidence in our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth moving forward.
We'll now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions."

As you laid out there, we're really happy with the result that we saw. Certainly, sequential improvement, in particular, in our direct-to-consumer business, and also in the Americas, in particular, from a D2C perspective. So that was really encouraging. There was some timing impact in the quarter from a wholesale shipping standpoint. So we can -- and by the way, that's all sort of caught up in terms of that in July. That was about $30 million. So a few points of growth on a global basis impacted the results in Q1.
So as it relates to our outlook, basically, what we're doing here is we're flowing through the Q1 beat from a D2C perspective. Again, that was primarily in the Americas. We're partially extrapolating that into Q2 based on the trends that we've seen. And by the way, July is off to a good start. And we're dialing in some stronger wholesale order book that we're seeing, again, most of that all in the Americas.
I would -- what I would say in terms of -- to your point about first half, second half, I'd really just point you to the fact that our year-to-go outlook now implies about 12% to 13% growth versus fiscal '20. So hopefully, that I think -- did I get everything you asked there in terms of the -- some of the details?"

So let me -- first of all, we're not going to give specific Q2 outlook today. But certainly, as evidenced by our outlook, we're confident in taking the year up. Remember, I would remind you that the September, October time frame is always the hardest",360,"Yes. So let me -- first of all, we're not going to give specific Q2 outlook today. But certainly, as evidenced by our outlook, we're confident in taking the year up. Remember, I would remind you that the September, October time frame is always the hardest to call from a shipment timing perspective. I mean there's a significant amount of activity during that period of time as we begin to really load up things on the wholesale side for fall and holiday.
And just given the supply chain pressures, it's really hard to call the puts and takes between quarters. And to some degree, I think we can expect that quarter-to-quarter volatility will continue in the near term. However, though, with what we know today, while some of the flow may not be perfectly optimized, as we begin the season, in particular, we don't expect a meaningful impact on our ability to ultimately deliver the fall holiday season. And I'll remind you that as we have continually done, we expect that we'll perform relatively better than the competitive set.
As it relates to gross margin, what I would say is, certainly, we're holding the year at greater than 56%. We talked about the fact that we're absorbing some higher freight, particularly airfreight and other forms of expedited freight. I think we said 20 to 30 basis points in the prepared remarks so -- versus our original outlook. So in a meaningful amount, I will tell you that the vast majority of that actually sits in our second quarter, is the way we would expect that to play out.
The other thing I would remind you is we have currency headwinds that we're up against. That will begin to abate a little bit as we move later in the year. And probably, the last point I would make around gross margin, we talked about the fact that our pricing actions, which have been relatively limited through spring '21 and fall '21, you'll see the impact of more significant pricing activity as we move into spring '22. So the Q4 window will benefit a little bit more from that perspective as well."

But certainly, happy to see that play out as anticipated in the underlying margins in terms of the organic business actually above prior peak levels in our first quarter.
And so -- and I think what you could -- I -- think about relative to the outlook raised up to at least 13% operating margin. Given the airfreight headwind that at play and that we're calling out, I think, it really speaks to our confidence in seeing that SG&A leverage beginning to play out. We said even in our last call that if we saw some earnings opportunity, which obviously, we're seeing that come to pass a bit and calling the year up, you'd expect the strong earnings flow-through as a result of that.
So I think, again, seeing that play out despite the fact that we've got some headwinds on the supply chain side relative to freight that we didn't anticipate in May."

China continues to be really strong, but you got to remember, rest of Asia is pretty volatile at the moment given flare-ups in virus. So it's not an enormous part of our business, but when you look at that total region, there is some impact across what I'll call rest of Asia. Think about Korea, even Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, et cetera. So on the Asia side, there's some puts and takes there, I think, in terms of how we think about that business.
The Europe business continues to be quite strong. And probably, what's at play here a little bit, too, is when we laid out our initial guidance in May and talked about the opportunity, it could be a little bit conservative. I think that was predominantly in Americas-related comment.
So I think we're seeing the Americas business and the U.S. consumer come back strong. And that's playing out across our businesses, by the way. That's a broad-based comment across all of our big businesses and really across our portfolio as we see the U.S. consumer coming back strong. And certainly, that's important from a go-forward standpoint. And obviously, it's critical to the Vans business, I think, in particular, given the size of that business in the U.S. as well as the size of the brick-and-mortar business here as well. So that's obviously really encouraging for us.
And probably, the last thing I would say, we still are maintaining a fairly cautious approach from a year-to-go perspective in our direct-to-consumer business. We've got sequential improvement coming as our expectation. We saw a stronger result in Q1. As I said, we've extrapolated that a bit into Q2, but we remain careful there in terms of how that will play out over time. So hopefully, that answers your question."

I think we specifically see that in some of the freight costs, some of the freight out costs where we've seen a pretty significant increase.
I think a lot of that's around supply and demand, as well as in distribution. We've got some onetime costs that we're navigating here in the short term as we bring on board some new distribution capabilities, the new capacity in a couple of places in the U.S. as well as our new distribution center in the U.K. So we'll quickly sort of lap that and move past that and sort of grow through that. So certainly, I think there's some transitory headwinds.
As it relates to the longer-term view, what we said is that we expect -- and first of all, really happy to see our Q1 results, right, and the leverage that we saw there versus our original expectations. Now I will say some of that is timing related, certainly in terms of the spend shift -- or the spend timing, some of that's shifting out a little bit. But happy to see that kind of progress.
We've said that we expect to exit the year with SG&A leverage. And we said we expect to see next year, we'll be sort of right on track with the long-range algorithm. And sort of the path towards that mid-teens overall operating margin that we laid out in Beaver Creek will be back on that path.

And as you know, the order windows are a little tighter in Vans. Meaning we're order -- we're taking orders about 4 to 5 months out based on our shorter lead times there.

Here in the United States, we're seeing a really nice acceleration in the Work lifestyle component. That's now about 40% of our total revenue.
So this team over the last 2 years has really simplified their approach to the business, focusing on their core icons, building out the lifestyle piece of the business, while really respecting that core Workwear.
We have channel expansion opportunities that we see going on beyond just that -- those core Work points of sale. We're growing in the sporting goods. The recent launch of the skate collection is accessing a whole host of new specialty skate accounts, which is just a great brand-building image component. It's also giving them permission to elevate some of the offer. We've recently launched the Signature Collection, which is an elevated higher price point, better gross margin. Collection of items really built off those core icons.
So I just -- I think it's -- I think the point here is they've focused the business. It's broad-based across all 3 regions, building against the traditional channels.

So we've had some fits and starts there in the early days. But we're really now starting to see the benefits in the supply chain from some of the integration activities around demand planning, as an example, which ultimately allows us to service the business in a better way, too.

As you think about -- I mean, the one thing I would say, versus pre-COVID levels, there's still a little bit of a headwind there, primarily because of 2 things. One, the freight side of things that they're dealing with, as all of our brands are. But remember, too, that's the one business where brick-and-mortar is really significant.
And while we're seeing sequential improvement, and while, fortunately, we're seeing that even be a little stronger than we thought, we're still modeling brick-and-mortar to be down across the year and not really fully recover until early fiscal '23. That was my point earlier about we remain fairly conservative in our outlook there as we move through, and particularly, the back half of the year. So there's a little bit of overhang there in the short term. But yes, Vans profitability that you would have seen in Beaver Creek and what we've talked about historically, that remains.

And the strength of our performance last year from a sellout perspective and the order book profile as a result of that, both in the U.S. and in Europe, so that's a big part of the growth as we see that wholesale business bouncing back sharply, and as we see our direct-to-consumer business continue to recover sequentially as we talked about in Vans, similar kind of comments there."

This is an exciting development for Vans. It's something they pivoted and moved on very quickly. Just to remind everybody, this idea of a 52-week drop model was to really think and act like a true retail operator and bring a more predictable, a more visible understanding of the product flow, and use this to create brand heat. And we've seen that play out extremely well. We're only about 7 weeks in. They're learning every week about just how to really manage the offer for the week, how to marry the content and the storytelling, how to lever broad-based global drops that could be available across multiple channels of distribution versus various select vault-type products.
But the point here is they're providing visibility. And they're giving visibility in enough time for consumers to learn about it, build the excitement and that frenzy demand that we've seen really reflect itself in some of the key collections that have dropped this year. Bodega, from a specialty vault collection to the broad-based SpongeBob SquarePants, and most recently, the Metallica dropped.
What you're going to see us do or our Vans team do as they get just refining the model, they'll start to publish the drop list. And we think that's something that will be possible by Q3. So they'll give the consumer visibility of what's coming and begin to allow themselves to be positioned to capture the product if it's a limited drop or be in the queue if it's a broader-based drop. So I think this is just a really thoughtful evolution to what was already a well-designed go-to-market model. But this is about driving brand heat and increasing consumer demand, and ultimately, consumer loyalty."

Welcome to our second quarter call. As we move through the halfway point of our fiscal year, I remain encouraged by the underlying momentum across the portfolio, and the broad-based nature of this strength gives me confidence that we are driving the right strategy to accelerate growth in the quarters ahead. 
Looking through pandemic-related disruption and near-term headwinds in China. We continue to see a healthy retail landscape, a strong consumer outlook and accelerating demand signals across our business. While the recovery has not been as linear as we had anticipated for some parts of our business, I'm proud of how our teams continue to deliver through the volatility. This is certainly where we excel. We are focused on what we can control. And despite a more challenging environment than we had envisioned, we were able to reaffirm our fiscal '22 revenue and earnings outlook, a clear testament to the resiliency and optionality of our model. We see our business emerging in an even stronger place than before the pandemic. We've accelerated our strategy to be a more digitally enabled enterprise while driving significant investment behind key capabilities to connect with our consumers. We are driving organic growth as we elevate direct channels, distort to Asia, led by China and accelerate our consumer-minded, retail-centric, hyper-digital business model transformation. 
On top of that, our #1 strategic priority to drive and optimize our portfolio has netted us significant benefits. Over the past 5 years, we have strategically evolved and simplified our portfolio from 32 brands to 12 brands, each with significant D2C and international opportunity squarely focused on large, growing addressable markets. The macro trends around outdoor and active lifestyles, health and wellness, casualization and sustainability have only strengthened over the past 20 months, and our current portfolio is well positioned to benefit from these accelerating tailwinds. 
Active portfolio management remains an evergreen process, and M&A remains our top capital allocation priority. This is a differentiator and a competitive advantage for VF as we continue to refine our portfolio mix to maximize exposure to the most attractive parts of the marketplace. We are confident that we have the right strategy, and our continued execution on each of these key strategic pillars positions VF for a stronger emergence. 
Now moving into our Q2 results. While noisy, our second quarter results highlight ongoing progress against our strategy and reflect a healthy accelerating underlying business with broad-based strength across our portfolio. 
I'll start with Vans, which delivered 7% growth in Q2 despite meaningful wholesale shipments pushed into Q3, representing sequential improvement in underlying demand despite a more challenging-than-anticipated operating environment. The EMEA business has accelerated meaningfully during the quarter. However, in the U.S., encouraging brick-and-mortar recovery trends, which had been building into July, were impacted by the Delta surge and its implications across our most important markets. This led to sharp shifts in store traffic trajectory during the peak back-to-school window. Additionally, the brand faced headwinds in Asia Pacific with virus disruption across the region and a more challenging near-term consumer environment in China. While Vans Americas Q2 recovery did not meet our expectations, I'm pleased with our team's response. We're focused on what we can control. Our retail associates are driving best-in-class conversion, up 20% relative to pre-pandemic peaks, this quarter in the Americas. And despite the impact of expedited freight, the Vans Americas team has brought full-priced DTC gross margins above fiscal 2020 levels, supported by discounting below pre-COVID levels. At the same time, leveraging our strong inventory position, we've secured additional shelf space at several key wholesale accounts for the second half. So despite a more challenging operating backdrop than anticipated, we are able to hold on to the low end of our prior outlook for Vans and now expect 7% to 9% growth relative to fiscal 2020. We're confident in Vans' strategic choices as evidenced by improving demand signals and strong consumer engagement. The September Vans Core Collection launch supported the fifth highest sales day on record for our Americas D2C digital business achieving 100% sell-through within days. We're encouraged by the ongoing strength from Progression Footwear lines, up 15% relative to fiscal 2020, led by UltraRange and MTE, and are pleased with the continued growth in Vans Family membership reaching 18.5 million consumers globally. 
Our confidence in the long-term runway for Vans remains unchanged. The brand came into this disruptive period exceptionally strong, and consumer engagement has remained healthy. The active space remains a large and growing TAM, and the casualization trend continues to present a long-term tailwind for Vans. And although Vans remains a very important part of our story, we must remember that VF is not just one brand. We have a diversified portfolio of global brands, each with exposure to attractive TAMs with enduring tailwinds. We have significant shared platforms of expertise, highlighted by our international platforms and global supply chain, which are enabling broad-based profitable growth. And as a result, our model drives ongoing capital allocation optionality to further enhance VF's growth and shareholder return profile. Matt will build on many of these themes shortly, but I'd like to start with an overview of the broad-based momentum we're seeing across the portfolio. 
Starting with The North Face, which delivered 29% growth in Q2 despite significant wholesale shipments pushed into Q3, representing a sharp acceleration of underlying demand alongside meaningful margin improvement. Our international businesses are gaining share, while the underlying U.S. business has accelerated meaningfully this quarter on tight inventories, driving high-quality sales. We remain encouraged by the strength across categories as TNF has been successful at balancing on- and off-mountain messaging to its consumers. On-mountain platforms like FUTURELIGHT, VECTIV and the recently launched Advanced Mountain Kit continued to drive strong sell-through and reinforce TNF's performance credibility. Off-mountain lifestyle apparel and equipment are delivering outsized growth, a strong 365-day demand persisted, led by logowear, daypacks and duffels. We also saw strong performance from more versatile athletic-inspired product highlighted by the Wonder franchise. We are raising the outlook for TNF to 27% to 29% growth in fiscal 2022. We continue to believe this moment for TNF is underappreciated. This will be a $3 billion business delivering high-teen growth relative to fiscal 2020 levels, with strong margin expansion underway. 
Looking into next year, The North Face will continue to benefit from broad-based brand momentum fueled by innovation, extremely clean distribution channels, increasing year-round relevancy and ongoing tailwinds from the outdoor marketplace, supported by growing consumer interest in active outdoor lifestyles. We, therefore, expect The North Face to be at least within its long-term plan range of high single-digit growth in fiscal 2023. 
Moving on to Dickies, which continues to build upon its incredible run, delivering 19% growth in the quarter. The brand is driving their integrated marketplace strategy, supporting growth horizontally across work and work-inspired categories as well as vertically as they focus on higher tiers of distribution and bring new consumers into the brand. Sell-through remains elevated, and demand signals continue to be strong. Across the globe, the Dickies team remains focused on the key drivers of their business, expanding core workwear beyond traditional channels and leveraging the brand's authenticity to accelerate the lifestyle segment. Icons have been a focus for the marketing and sales teams, and the results are compelling, highlighted by the accelerated growth of the 874 work pants. There are several versions of this 50-year-old icon, supported by ongoing innovation, which collectively have delivered over 100% growth year-to-date. 
In addition to the strong growth trajectory at Dickies, we remain encouraged by the significant margin expansion runway, which accelerated in Q2 on the back of strong full-price selling and SG&A leverage. We're proud of the continued success at Dickies, which we feel is another underappreciated part of the story. We are raising the outlook for Dickies to at least 20% growth in fiscal '22, representing at least 30% growth relative to fiscal '20. We expect the brand will approach $1 billion next year as Dickies celebrates its 100-year anniversary. 
Next, Timberland delivered 25% growth in Q2 despite significant wholesale shipments pushed into Q3, representing an acceleration of underlying demand over the quarter. The PRO business remains a consistent growth driver for the brand, supported by a new campaign celebrating the skilled trades to inspire the next generation of worthy workers. Despite historically low inventory levels, core boots and outdoor footwear continue to show strength as we head into the holiday, each growing over 40% in Q2. Timberland continues to create an own boot culture, with the September introduction of Green Stride ECO innovation in boots for the first time. The Solar Ridge Hiker launched with much fanfare in New York City and posted 50% sell-through in North America. 2 more Green Stride drops will hit in October, driving further momentum behind this important franchise. At the same time, the True Cloud collection, another Eco leadership story drove strong traffic and social engagement across all regions. We believe the Timberland brand is in a much healthier position today relative to where it was before COVID. This leadership team has a sharpened focus on the brand's product architecture, getting back to Timberland's core, work and outdoor, sustainability and craftsmanship while increasing energy and newness. They have refocused strategic clarity around the target consumer and on executing the right go-to-market set of choices. The brand is demonstrating strong marketplace discipline, reducing discounts and thoughtfully rebuilding depleted inventory while driving significant improvements in profitability. 
The integration of Supreme continues to move according to plan, and our teams are learning from this highly productive business, including how they manage product creation, building energy ahead of drops and optimizing assortment and product flow across regions with great agility. Looking forward, we remain confident in the significant whitespace opportunity for this brand across geographies, with a clear opportunity to leverage VF platforms. Supreme remains on track to become VF's fifth $1 billion brand in the coming years. 
And lastly, when speaking to the broad-based strength across our portfolio, I'd like to briefly shine a light on our 3 outdoor emerging brands: SmartWool, Icebreaker and Altra. This group collectively represents nearly $550 million in revenue with a mid- to high-teen growth profile longer term. While smaller today, these brands are all profitable and are exposed to the attractive tailwinds around health and wellness, active outdoor lifestyles and sustainability. And we're seeing it in their results. 
SmartWool brand is up nearly 60% year-to-date, representing high teens growth relative to fiscal 2020. We have accelerated investment in brand awareness campaigns, highlighting the high performance and versatility of this product while targeting an active younger consumer. We're seeing this pay off with broad-based strength across categories, led by apparel and outsized growth from new consumers. 
Our other natural fiber brand, Icebreaker, has successfully relocated the core leadership team from New Zealand to our Stabio headquarters, further integrating into our EMEA platform, which will accelerate the brand's global reach. The brand has grown nearly 30% year-to-date, with balanced growth across its largest markets in Europe and the U.S. Base layers, tees and underwear represent about 70% of Icebreaker global revenue, confirming the consumer appeal of 100% natural product next-to-skin categories. 
And lastly, Altra, the fastest-growing brand in our portfolio, is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year by establishing its legendary Lone Peak franchise as the #1 trail running business in the U.S. The brand has continued to build accolades from the running community with awards from Runner's World, Self Magazine, Women's Health and Outside magazine across multiple franchises. Through the first half of the year, the brand has grown over 60% relative to fiscal 2020. And we expect this to accelerate in the back half of the year as the brand continues to expand its presence in road running with innovative new styles and designs. We see tremendous opportunity for Altra to expand distribution domestically and internationally, leveraging its differentiated product and continued strong tailwinds for this category. 
I see significant potential for each of these brands to deliver outsized growth in the years to come. We have demonstrated the ability to scale brands into big businesses, and I have confidence that over time these outdoor emerging brands will become another strong component of VF's financial algorithm. 
As I conclude my prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that before the pandemic our portfolio was on track to deliver high single-digit revenue growth and high teens earnings growth in fiscal 2020. While we remain in a disruptive environment, I believe VF's long-term prospects are even more attractive today. We've accelerated our transformation strategy. We have further optimized our portfolio. And importantly, this portfolio today is capable of delivering greater broad-based strength relative to where we were before the pandemic. This gives us even greater confidence in our ability to drive high single-digit top line and low teens earnings growth at a minimum as we emerge as an even stronger company. 
And now I'll turn it over to Matt."

And importantly, I'm encouraged by the resiliency of our business during the first half of fiscal 2022. The environment has clearly evolved differently than we had planned in May. However, our teams remain focused on what we can control, and they are delivering. The underlying top line recovery across the majority of our business has exceeded our plan, offsetting new challenges in the APAC region and ongoing disruptions across the supply chain network. 
Through thoughtful allocation of investment, we've been able to drive continued strategic investment spending while leveraging other parts of our SG&A base to protect earnings. As a result, I'm proud of our ability to hold on to our fiscal 2022 earnings outlook of about $3.20 despite a more challenging-than-anticipated operating environment, including an incremental headwind of about $0.09 from expedited freight. This should be a strong signal that this management team is committed to leveraging the significant optionality in our model to deliver on our earnings commitment. 
Before unpacking our Q2 results, I want to quickly run through the operating environment across the region and share the latest outlook for our global supply chain. 
Starting with the Americas region. Product delays and reduced traffic during virus surges impacted the business during our highest-volume period this quarter. However, the region was able to deliver 22% organic growth in Q2, representing continued sequential underlying improvement. Retailers remain bullish on the upcoming holiday season, and we are focused on delivering products in time to support strong demand signals. Cancellation rates remain historically low due to tight inventories. Conversion remains exceptionally strong, and we see continued reductions in promotions compared to last year, driving strong average selling prices. 
Next, the EMEA region delivered mid-teen organic growth in Q2 despite meaningful supply chain disruption, particularly for The North Face. The underlying business continues to perform above the overall market, supported by strong performance with key digital titans. This region was strong before the pandemic and has shown incredible resiliency throughout this disruptive period. Stores are showing continuous recapture volumes despite softer street traffic in large metro areas. We are encouraged to see the brick-and-mortar DTC business for both The North Face and Vans inflect meaningfully this quarter, each returning to positive growth relative to fiscal year '20. Recovery momentum and sustained growth are expected to accelerate throughout the year as vaccine rollouts progress. 
Finally, the APAC region delivered low single-digit organic growth despite a more challenging backdrop than anticipated for part of our portfolio. Due to a resurgence of COVID-19 across the region, economic growth and consumer confidence has softened since July. Parts of our business in China have been further impacted by weaker digital traffic for nondomestic brands. This has been more impactful for Active brands relative to outdoor. Across the portfolio, we believe we are performing better in our respective categories versus other international brands. And while we remain bullish on the long-term opportunity in the region, these pressures have impacted our near-term outlook. We now expect low-teen growth in China in fiscal 2022. 
Moving on to our global supply chain. The environment remains challenging and has continued to deteriorate following our Q1 call in late July. The resurgence of COVID-19 lockdowns in key sourcing countries like Vietnam have resulted in more impactful production delays, and the logistics network continues to face unprecedented challenges. We are experiencing increasing product delays from the supply chain disruption, which is creating meaningful quarter-to-quarter volatility in our results. 
Let me unpack all of this in a little more detail. Due to VF's large and strategically diversified sourcing footprint, our overall production capacity has remained better positioned than most, with about 85% of production operational throughout the quarter. Pressures have generally concentrated in the southern region of Vietnam, which represents about 10% of VF's overall sourcing mix. We remain confident in our ability to navigate the production environment. However, the logistics network remains under increasing pressure. Ports are generally open, but operations remain severely impacted by labor and equipment availability, servicing significantly higher ship volumes. As a result, our dwell times at point of destination have increased significantly. In aggregate, supply delays are pervasive and, in some cases, have extended 8 to 10 weeks. As a result, in the most recent quarter, we had a material shift of revenue from Q2 into Q3, with more than half of this tied to Vietnam. 
Despite these delays, cancellation rates have remained below historical levels, signaling strong demand and tight channel inventories. However, delays ultimately impact product availability across the marketplace. Virtually all of our brands are experiencing delayed collections, styles and, in some cases, insufficient size assortment, limiting their ability to fully meet strong demand. For example, the Supreme brand has experienced around 30% less inventory around drops. So despite strong sell-through trends, we are losing volume from limited supply. 
This environment is where our world-class supply chain differentiates itself, highlighting the significant competitive advantage VF has created with this platform. We have always maintained a diversified sourcing footprint to provide resiliency against unforeseen changes in the operating or geopolitical environment. For example, our largest market, Vietnam, only represents about 1/4 of our sourcing mix. And within Vietnam, we work with multiple partners, have a presence in multiple provinces, both between the northern and southern regions of the country, and maintain access to multiple ports. Our teams are leveraging VF's scale and relationships to navigate the challenging logistics environment in the most cost-effective way. We continue to utilize expedited freight across a large number of air providers. We have doubled our network of ocean carriers and significantly expanded the number of ports utilized across the globe. 
Our commercial and supply chain teams are working closely with our key wholesale partners, increasingly using direct shipping. And our work indicates we're doing better than most of the competitive set at keeping product on the shelves. Our relationship with these key wholesale partners continues to strengthen with our open, transparent and timely communication throughout this dynamic situation. So despite the unprecedented level of disruption across the global supply chain, our teams have been able to keep product flowing, supporting our strong holiday growth plan and allowing VF to effectively hold our revenue guide for fiscal 2022. 
Moving into some additional highlights on our second quarter. Total VF revenue increased 21% to $3.2 billion despite a significant amount of orders shifted from Q2 into Q3, implying continued sequential underlying improvement for the portfolio. For context, we estimate this shift represented a mid- to high single-digit impact to VF's Q2 growth rate relative to fiscal 2020. Our adjusted gross margin expanded 300 basis points to 53.9% due to higher full-price realization, lower markdowns, favorable mix and around 20 basis points contribution from Supreme. When compared to prior peak gross margins in fiscal 2020, our current year gross margin was impacted by about 180 basis points headwind from incremental expedited freight and FX. Excluding these 2 items, our organic gross margin in Q2 is over 100 basis points above prior peak levels, driven by favorable mix and strong underlying margin rate improvement. And as a reminder, our Q2 2020 gross margin was very strong. So our ability to deliver this level of underlying expansion against fiscal year '20 margins is a strong testament to the health of our brands in the marketplace. 
Our SG&A ratio improved in Q2, down 100 basis points organically to 37.2% despite elevated distribution spend and continued growth in strategic investment. This strong underlying leverage was driven by discretionary choices and is a clear reflection of the optionality within our model, supporting organic EPS growth of 60%. I am proud of our team's ability to deliver earnings of $1.11 in Q2 despite incremental expedited freight expense and significant wholesale shipment timing headwinds in the quarter, reflecting the strong underlying earnings momentum of the portfolio. 
Now a few comments on our revised fiscal 2022 outlook. We are holding our revenue guidance to be about $12 billion despite a weaker China outlook in the near term and a lower-than-expected back-to-school performance at Vans in the U.S. and ongoing supply chain challenges. All of this highlighting the broad-based strength across our brands and geographies. Our gross margin outlook is now about 56%, including 40 basis points of incremental freight cost relative to what we had expected in July, implying an improving underlying gross margin outlook. And adjusting for incremental freight and FX, our fiscal 2022 outlook implies over 100 basis points of underlying gross margin expansion relative to peak gross margins in fiscal 2020, driven by favorable mix and clean full-price sell-through. 
We are holding our operating margin outlook to around 13% for fiscal 2022 despite the incremental freight costs covered. As Steve said, we're focused on what we can control. And for me, SG&A control is clearly top of mind. We are offsetting supply chain and distribution cost headwinds with spend reduction actions while protecting strategic investment and demand creation. The business is driving impressive underlying leverage, and our confidence is strong that we can continue to accelerate this over time. 
Finally, as discussed, we are reaffirming our full year earnings outlook of around $3.20, despite about $0.09 of incremental costs directly attributed to the supply chain disruption, a strong testament of portfolio resiliency and the optionality of our model. 
Steve introduced an important concept that VF is not just one brand, and I want to reiterate this as I conclude our prepared remarks. Before the pandemic, VF was more reliant on the Vans brand. Today, however, we have a much larger portion of our business performing at or above our expectations. There is broad-based momentum across the portfolio. VF also has powerful enterprise platforms, highlighted by our world-class supply chain, which provides a significant competitive advantage to our business. 
And lastly, VF has the capacity to drive meaningful incremental shareholder value through capital allocation optionality. We've demonstrated this over the course of the pandemic by maintaining our dividend and trading our Occupational Work business for the Supreme brand. And as you may have noticed in this morning's release, our share repurchase program has been reinstated, with remaining authorization to repurchase up to $2.8 billion of common stock. As we have line of sight to our leverage threshold, we have this additional optionality, and we'll be opportunistic on share repurchases moving into the balance of this fiscal year. 
VF is not just one brand. We are a diversified portfolio of strong brands, supported by world-class enterprise platforms, which we believe, at minimum, can drive high single-digit revenue growth, low teens earnings growth and provide meaningful capital allocation optionality moving forward.

We see nothing in the Vans strategy that would tell us that we cannot grow double digits long term. This brand sits in an active TAM with a very attractive on a day to day, and we think only growing as this casualization mega trend accelerates. We've grown high teens since the acquisition. That's over a decade of high teens growth, and we continue to see significant international whitespace in China, in Europe, but continue to see growth here in the U.S. I think what gives us confidence as we look forward is we have a renewed focus on our icon management strategy. A proof point this quarter was the 25% growth that we saw in our Skate High as they leaned into marketing that particular icon. And as we come through Q3 towards the back half, you'll see us begin to elevate the icons in general and really getting back into the systematic cycle of pushing the 5 key icons, while we also continue to support our progression, which is where the Altra sits, MTE, where we've seen very strong sell-through as well as leveraging the growth in apparel, which is really opening up those multiple wear occasions that the brand can enjoy. We'll continue to leverage the in-store experience. That is a core element of how this brand connects with its consumers. And we'll continue to lean into growth here in the U.S. and Europe and look to really support our Asia teams as we focus on that China growth trajectory and getting the brand back in sync with what we know is very possible as the brand pushes the notion of creative self-expression in a very brand right, but local consumer relevancy to elevate the brand there in China."

And this is a true statement across all of our brands. But certainly, there's a significant inflection in the wholesale business based on the order books. And we've talked about the differences in the spring order books versus the fall order books and the time that those order books were placed has impacted that pretty significantly. 
And just to give you an example, for Vans on a global basis, our wholesale business was down, call it, high single digits in the first half. We expect it's going to be up sort of low double digits in the second half. And again, that's supported by the order books that we have. And we've really got visibility at this point pretty much all the way through the end of our fiscal year. So that's one thing I think it's worth understanding. And certainly, again, it's relevant for all of our brands. 
The other thing is our demand creation efforts will accelerate from a spend standpoint in the back half of the year. That's always been our plan. And you'll see that we've got that built into our modeling from the beginning. We did have a bit of an acceleration through back-to-school versus what we saw in the first half of the calendar year, but even more so as we move into the holidays. So strong demand creation investments and strong programs coming to support the business. 
And then probably the last thing, as we've said all along, we expect some continued improvement in our traffic into our large and highly productive brick-and-mortar base of business. And we've generally seen that. We did see a little bit of a -- a little bit lower than our expectations in the month of August, in particular, here in the U.S. in terms of the traffic build. And we think that was certainly tied in some ways to the Delta variant and some of the new restrictions that were placed back on consumers there in that period of time. 
But generally, from the beginning of this calendar year all the way through September, setting aside August, we've seen the business sequentially improve. From a traffic standpoint, September was our best month of the quarter. October has actually started off good. We're actually on track. And honestly, we're slightly ahead of our expectations in the Americas region from a D2C perspective during the month of October. So just a few more data points there for you relative to really what's supporting the acceleration implied in the outlook."

As it relates to some shaping in the second half, what I would say about gross margin is we expect Q3 to be about 57% with organic expansion a little bit stronger than what we saw in Q2.

What we've seen is certainly an issue building here in China. I mean there's a number of factors that are impacting our China business. First is the resurgence of COVID across the Greater China region. It really has had an impact on economic growth and, more importantly, consumer confidence. And we've seen that in our store traffic coming into brick-and-mortar. And we've also seen that challenging some of the digital titan platform traffic, where we have a big presence from a digital standpoint. And some of our legacy marketing tools, specifically key opinion leader marketing, are no longer available and having a short-term impact. It doesn't mean long term that we won't adjust. And in fact, we are, but that did have a short-term impact. 
But I think, importantly, what we do expect to see is a re-acceleration. And I think there's 3 really key reasons here. From our decision to establish an even stronger structure and presence in Shanghai, something we've been working on now for many months allows us to better understand the marketplace variables and to speak to the local consumer in a more relevant and authentic way for each one of our brands. 
Our decision to hire our leader in China and expand Winnie's scope beyond just Greater China is having a very outsized impact. Her confidence and experience in understanding the local market, local consumers, how to engage with our key strategic partners, is certainly elevating our brands and our business' ability to understand the consumer and navigate some of these new variables that we see. 
As we stand up our brand teams in Shanghai, that local market knowledge is going to help us really bring our brand purpose, our VF purpose for our associates to bear. And we're seeing that as a really important element today as we focus on the health and well-being of our associates. There's a notion here in our brand marketing. We see it coming to life in North Face. We're really putting our purpose in place and really elevating our messaging and our connections and delivery of value around health and well-being to the Chinese consumer and really looking to improve their life through engaging with our brands, the experiences that our brands enable and connecting in a much more one-to-one way. We think these strategic shifts that we've been really driving over the last 12 to 18 months position us in a very strong way to navigate these new variables and get that re-acceleration back into the business."

And then the rest is sort of the comment that Steve made about the consumer and what we've seen here in the short term. And then as you said, there's certainly some COVID-related impacts across the rest of the region as we saw some lockdown measures and closed stores and just generally consumer confidence in some of those other countries that waned a bit during the quarter.
Maybe last thing I would say because I think it's important, from a VF perspective, we certainly -- we didn't really change our guidance. We did soften the language slightly. I can tell you that's all really driven by China. Without that, you wouldn't have seen any change.

And certainly inventories continue to be really lean across the marketplace. That's the case for our brands and, I would say, for most. So we expect a really clean and lack of promotional kind of environment certainly versus historical. 
And as we think about moving into spring next year and even beyond, certainly, our view will be that the promotional environment is going to continue to be quite good. I'll remind you that our business historically is clean. We don't promote a lot in our brands. And that's been one of the things we've been trying to help everyone understand when you look at the 2-year compares versus some of the peer set. Our business was really clean and healthy 2 years ago. It's that way now. We expect it will be next year. 
As you think about gross margins next year, we expect margins will expand bottom line. I think we expect margins will expand probably at least 0.5 point in line with our LRP. Certainly, there's some headwinds, input cost inflationary pressures, the elevated freight costs that are certainly going to continue for a period of time. but there's tailwinds as well. As I said, promotional environment remained clean. We certainly would expect we're not going to see the same level of expedited freight that we've seen this year. Our mix benefit will be intact. We've got continued momentum in some of the brands we've had opportunities to strengthen gross margins on the back of stronger brand equity. Timberland and Dickies are examples of that. 
And then last but certainly not least, the biggest, I think, tool in the toolbox here is pricing. And we certainly expect -- and we've talked about we're going to start to see meaningful impacts from pricing as early as our fiscal Q4 and as we think about spring '22 and even more so fall '22 of next year."

Bob, to Supreme, Supreme has had a disproportionate impact to the supply chain disruptions that we're talking about. They've got an exposure into Vietnam. And if you think about the model, due to the nature of how they flow products, they don't carry forward inventory. So when a particular drop is not able to be delivered on time -- yes, they have an agile model and they're able to move around. But the impacts that they've seen this quarter were such that it had a pretty material impact on what we were able to do in Q2. The good news is sell-through trends continue to be very strong. And we saw a decrease in inventory. We did see a continued strong interest and a clear opportunity for the brand to continue to grow. But I think the supply chain interruptions are helping us all see the further benefit of the supply chain integration that is in place that will help us help our Supreme team really diversify their footprint and focus in areas where we can help them maintain better flow. 
As we think about longer term and coming into the second half, we have line of sight to delivery, the inventory required for the weekly drops. And that wasn't true 6 weeks ago. So I think there's a lot of confidence here that we can recapture that momentum. And we really start to recapture that lost volume. In some of the most recent drops, we've seen a really strong evidence of that demand. So I think, in light of this disruption, the plan that this group operates with the agility to be able to flex continues to be a competitive advantage. And as they integrate into our supply chain, it will help be able to mitigate some of these impacts. 
To your European question, our international expansion, COVID had an impact on our team's ability to travel, begin to meet and work with our European and international team. So that work is continuing virtually. Our Supreme team needs to get into market. The model by which they look for new stores that really anchors the brand in new cities has been slowed based on COVID. That work with our team certainly will help them speed up that knowledge base to hit market. But we're certainly a few months off of what would have been a plan that we were ready to execute into fiscal '23. But the geographic expansion potential remains very strong, a key part of our growth, and you'll see us continue to open stores both in Europe and Asia as the teams were able to get into market."

So from a -- first of all, this is why we didn't provide guidance for the quarter, if I try to call the split there between Q2 and Q3 as we knew it was going to be a pretty volatile environment, and it certainly played out that way. 
From a timing -- shipment timing perspective, we said mid- to high single-digit impact to VF's organic growth in the quarter relative to fiscal '20. So -- and that's really impactful across all of our businesses, certainly several points of growth for the Big 3 brands. And also, as Steve just described, pretty impactful for Supreme in the quarter as well. And this was especially true, I would say, in the U.S. and Europe and to a lesser degree to some degree in Asia, all those small impacts there. 
At a brand level, Vans would have been sort of at pre-pandemic levels in the quarter. And TNF and Timberland in particular would show meaningful acceleration versus where we were in Q1, adjusting for the impact of the wholesale shipment timing. 
And I think in terms of what we expect, we expect virtually all of that's going to get out the door and ship here in Q3.

But I think the confidence that we have in our portfolio, which we spent a lot of time strategically evolving to where we are today, each one of our brands has the potential of achieving this long-range plan. And you see that happening this year with many of our brands. 
Specifically to Vans, we see them getting back to low double-digit growth and being able to deliver that on a consistent basis. Our North Face business is building momentum. You've heard us really begin to talk with a lot of confidence. The work that's been done to really strengthen that team, tighten up our merchandising strategies, get the flow between the on-mountain and off-mountain product collections, raising our outlook for the year on a 2-year basis to 16% to 18%, I think, is a proof point of that confidence. 
Timberland is inflecting. We see them really owning and driving that boot culture. And as we really drive our integrated marketplace strategy and the merchandise flow, the new products coming with Green Stride through cloud, some of the things you see going on in the women's business, give us confidence that this business is inflecting and has great potential.

We saw this with -- at the point of acquisition.

As we move through the halfway point of our fiscal year, I remain encouraged by the underlying momentum across the portfolio. And the broad-based nature of this strength gives me confidence that we are driving the right strategy to accelerate growth in the quarters ahead.  
Looking through pandemic-related disruption and near-term headwinds in China. We continue to see a healthy retail landscape, a strong consumer outlook and accelerating demand signals across our business. While the recovery has not been as linear as we had anticipated for some parts of our business, I'm proud of how our teams continue to deliver through the volatility. This is certainly where we excel. We are focused on what we can control. And despite a more challenging environment than we had envisioned, we were able to reaffirm our fiscal '22 revenue and earnings outlook, a clear testament to the resiliency and optionality of our model. 
We see our business emerging in an even stronger place than before the pandemic. We've accelerated our strategy to be a more digitally enabled enterprise while driving significant investment behind key capabilities to connect with our consumers. We are driving organic growth as we elevate direct channels; distort to Asia, led by China; and accelerate our consumer-minded, retail-centric, hyper-digital business model transformation. 
On top of that, our #1 strategic priority to drive and optimize our portfolio has netted us significant benefits. Over the past 5 years, we have strategically evolved and simplified our portfolio from 32 brands to 12 brands, each with significant D2C and international opportunity squarely focused on large, growing addressable markets. The macro trends around outdoor and active lifestyles, health and wellness, casualization and sustainability have only strengthened over the past 20 months, and our current portfolio is well positioned to benefit from these accelerating tailwinds.  
Active portfolio management remains an evergreen process, and M&A remains our top capital allocation priority. This is a differentiator and a competitive advantage for VF as we continue to refine our portfolio mix to maximize exposure to the most attractive parts of the marketplace. We are confident that we have the right strategy, and our continued execution on each of these key strategic pillars positions VF for a stronger emergence.
Now moving into our Q2 results. While noisy, our second quarter results highlight ongoing progress against our strategy and reflect a healthy, accelerating underlying business with broad-based strength across our portfolio. 
I'll start with Vans, which delivered 7% growth in Q2 despite meaningful wholesale shipments pushed into Q3, representing sequential improvement in underlying demand despite a more challenging-than-anticipated operating environment. The EMEA business has accelerated meaningfully during the quarter. However, in the U.S., encouraging brick-and-mortar recovery trends, which had been building into July, were impacted by the Delta surge and its implications across our most important markets. This led to sharp shifts in store traffic trajectory during the peak back-to-school window. Additionally, the brand faced headwinds in Asia Pacific with virus disruption across the region and a more challenging near-term consumer environment in China. 
While Vans Americas Q2 recovery did not meet our expectations, I'm pleased with our team's response. We're focused on what we can control. Our retail associates are driving best-in-class conversion, up 20% relative to pre-pandemic peaks, this quarter in the Americas. And despite the impact of expedited freight, the Vans Americas team has brought full-priced DTC gross margins above fiscal 2020 levels, supported by discounting below pre-COVID levels. At the same time, leveraging our strong inventory position, we've secured additional shelf space at several key wholesale accounts for the second half. 
So despite a more challenging operating backdrop than anticipated, we are able to hold on to the low end of our prior outlook for Vans and now expect 7% to 9% growth relative to fiscal 2020. We're confident in Vans' strategic choices as evidenced by improving demand signals and strong consumer engagement. 
The September Vans core collection launch supported the fifth highest sales day on record for our Americas D2C digital business, achieving 100% sell-through within days. We're encouraged by the ongoing strength from Progression footwear lines, up 15% relative to fiscal 2020, led by UltraRange and MTE, and are pleased with the continued growth in Vans Family membership, reaching 18.5 million consumers globally.  
Our confidence in the long-term runway for Vans remains unchanged. The brand came into this disruptive period exceptionally strong, and consumer engagement has remained healthy. The active space remains a large and growing TAM, and the casualization trend continues to present a long-term tailwind for Vans. 
And although Vans remains a very important part of our story, we must remember that VF is not just one brand. We have a diversified portfolio of global brands, each with exposure to attractive TAMs with enduring tailwinds. We have significant shared platforms of expertise, highlighted by our international platforms and global supply chain, which are enabling broad-based profitable growth. And as a result, our model drives ongoing capital allocation optionality to further enhance VF's growth and shareholder return profile. Matt will build on many of these themes shortly, but I'd like to start with an overview of the broad-based momentum we're seeing across the portfolio.  
Starting with The North Face, which delivered 29% growth in Q2 despite significant wholesale shipments pushed into Q3, representing a sharp acceleration of underlying demand alongside meaningful margin improvement. Our International businesses are gaining share, while the underlying U.S. business had accelerated meaningfully this quarter on tight inventories, driving high-quality sales. 
  
We remain encouraged by the strength across categories as TNF has been successful at balancing on- and off-mountain messaging to its consumers. On-mountain platforms like FUTURELIGHT, VECTIV and the recently launched Advanced Mountain Kit, continued to drive strong sell-through and reinforce TNF's performance credibility. Off-mountain lifestyle apparel and equipment are delivering outsized growth. A strong 365-day demand persisted, led by logowear, daypacks and duffels. We also saw strong performance from more versatile athletic-inspired product highlighted by the Wander franchise. 
We are raising the outlook for TNF to 27% to 29% growth in fiscal 2022. We continue to believe this moment for TNF is underappreciated. This will be a $3 billion business delivering high-teen growth relative to fiscal 2020 levels, with strong margin expansion underway.  
Looking into next year, The North Face will continue to benefit from broad-based brand momentum fueled by innovation, extremely clean distribution channels, increasing year-round relevancy and ongoing tailwinds from the outdoor marketplace, supported by growing consumer interest in active, outdoor lifestyles. We, therefore, expect The North Face to be at least within its long-term plan range of high single-digit growth in fiscal 2023.
Moving on to Dickies, which continues to build upon its incredible run, delivering 19% growth in the quarter. The brand is driving their integrated marketplace strategy, supporting growth horizontally across work and work-inspired categories as well as vertically as they focus on higher tiers of distribution and bring new consumers into the brand. Sell-through remains elevated, and demand signals continue to be strong. 
Across the globe, the Dickies team remains focused on the key drivers of their business, expanding core workwear beyond traditional channels and leveraging the brand's authenticity to accelerate the lifestyle segment. Icons have been a focus for the marketing and sales teams, and the results are compelling, highlighted by the accelerated growth of the 874 work pant. There are several versions of this 50-year-old icon, supported by ongoing innovation, which collectively have delivered over 100% growth year-to-date.  
In addition to the strong growth trajectory at Dickies, we remain encouraged by the significant margin expansion runway, which accelerated in Q2 on the back of strong full-price selling and SG&A leverage. We're proud of the continued success at Dickies, which we feel is another underappreciated part of the story. We are raising the outlook for Dickies to at least 20% growth in fiscal '22, representing at least 30% growth relative to fiscal '20. We expect the brand will approach $1 billion next year as Dickies celebrates its 100-year anniversary.  
Next, Timberland delivered 25% growth in Q2 despite significant wholesale shipments pushed into Q3, representing an acceleration of underlying demand over the quarter. The Pro business remains a consistent growth driver for the brand, supported by a new campaign celebrating the skilled trades to inspire the next generation of worthy workers. Despite historically low inventory levels, core boots and outdoor footwear continue to show strength as we head into the holiday, each growing over 40% in Q2. 
Timberland continues to create and own boot culture, with the September introduction of GreenStride eco-innovation in boots for the first time. The Solar Ridge Hiker launched with much fanfare in New York City and posted 50% sell-through in North America. Two more GreenStride drops will hit in October, driving further momentum behind this important franchise. At the same time, the TrueCloud collection, another eco leadership story drove strong traffic and social engagement across all regions. 
We believe the Timberland brand is in a much healthier position today relative to where it was before COVID. This leadership team has a sharpened focus on the brand's product architecture, getting back to Timberland's core of work and outdoor, sustainability and craftsmanship while increasing energy and newness. They have refocused strategic clarity around the target consumer and on executing the right go-to-market set of choices. The brand is demonstrating strong marketplace discipline, reducing discounts and thoughtfully rebuilding depleted inventory while driving significant improvements in profitability.
The integration of Supreme continues to move according to plan, and our teams are learning from this highly productive business, including how they manage product creation, building energy ahead of drops and optimizing assortment and product flow across regions with great agility. Looking forward, we remain confident in the significant whitespace opportunity for this brand across geographies, with a clear opportunity to leverage VF platforms. Supreme remains on track to become VF's fifth billion-dollar brand in the coming years.  
And lastly, when speaking to the broad-based strength across our portfolio, I'd like to briefly shine a light on our 3 Outdoor emerging brands: Smartwool, Icebreaker and Altra. This group collectively represents nearly $550 million in revenue with a mid- to high-teen growth profile longer term. While smaller today, these brands are all profitable and are exposed to the attractive tailwinds around health and wellness; active, outdoor lifestyles and sustainability. And we're seeing it in their results. 
Smartwool brand is up nearly 60% year-to-date, representing high teens growth relative to fiscal 2020. We have accelerated investment in brand awareness campaigns, highlighting the high performance and versatility of this product while targeting an active, younger consumer. We're seeing this pay off with broad-based strength across categories, led by apparel and outsized growth from new consumers. 
Our other natural fiber brand, Icebreaker, has successfully relocated the core leadership team from New Zealand to our Stabio headquarters, further integrating into our EMEA platform, which will accelerate the brand's global reach. The brand has grown nearly 30% year-to-date, with balanced growth across its largest markets in Europe and the U.S. Base layers, tees and underwear represent about 70% of Icebreaker global revenue, confirming the consumer appeal of 100% natural product in next-to-skin categories.  
And lastly, Altra, the fastest-growing brand in our portfolio, is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year by establishing its legendary Lone Peak franchise as the #1 trail running business in the U.S. The brand has continued to build accolades from the running community with awards from Runner's World, SELF magazine, Women's Health and Outside magazine across multiple franchises. 
Through the first half of the year, the brand has grown over 60% relative to fiscal 2020. And we expect this to accelerate into the back half of the year as the brand continues to expand its presence in road running with innovative new styles and designs. We see tremendous opportunity for Altra to expand distribution domestically and internationally, leveraging its differentiated product and continued strong tailwinds for this category. 
I see significant potential for each of these brands to deliver outsized growth in the years to come. We have demonstrated the ability to scale brands into big businesses, and I have confidence that over time, these Outdoor emerging brands will become another strong component of VF's financial algorithm.  
As I conclude my prepared remarks, I'd like to remind everyone that before the pandemic our portfolio was on track to deliver high single-digit revenue growth and high teens earnings growth in fiscal 2020. While we remain in a disrupted environment, I believe VF's long-term prospects are even more attractive today. 
We've accelerated our transformation strategy. We have further optimized our portfolio. And importantly, this portfolio today is capable of delivering greater broad-based strength relative to where we were before the pandemic. This gives us even greater confidence in our ability to drive high single-digit top line and low teens earnings growth at a minimum as we emerge as an even stronger company.  
And now I'll turn it over to Matt."
191328,1683615281,2409907,"V.F. Corporation, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2021",2021-10-22,"Earnings Calls","V.F. Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'm happy to give an update on our progress as we navigate the recovery. And importantly, I'm encouraged by the resiliency of our business during the first half of fiscal 2022. The environment has clearly evolved d",1797,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'm happy to give an update on our progress as we navigate the recovery. And importantly, I'm encouraged by the resiliency of our business during the first half of fiscal 2022. 
The environment has clearly evolved differently than we had planned in May. However, our teams remain focused on what we can control, and they are delivering. The underlying top line recovery across the majority of our business has exceeded our plan, offsetting new challenges in the APAC region and ongoing disruptions across the supply chain network. 
Through thoughtful allocation of investment, we've been able to drive continued strategic investment spending while leveraging other parts of our SG&A base to protect earnings. As a result, I'm proud of our ability to hold on to our fiscal 2022 earnings outlook of about $3.20 despite a more challenging-than-anticipated operating environment, including an incremental headwind of about $0.09 from expedited freight. This should be a strong signal that this management team is committed to leveraging the significant optionality in our model to deliver on our earnings commitment.
Before unpacking our Q2 results, I want to quickly run through the operating environment across the region and share the latest outlook for our global supply chain. 
Starting with the Americas region. Product delays and reduced traffic during virus surges impacted the business during our highest-volume period this quarter. However, the region was able to deliver 22% organic growth in Q2, representing continued sequential underlying improvement. Retailers remain bullish on the upcoming holiday season, and we are focused on delivering products in time to support strong demand signals. 
Cancellation rates remain historically low due to tight inventories. Conversion remains exceptionally strong, and we see continued reductions in promotions compared to last year, driving strong average selling prices.
Next, the EMEA region delivered mid-teen organic growth in Q2 despite meaningful supply chain disruption, particularly for The North Face. The underlying business continues to perform above the overall market, supported by strong performance with the key digital titan. This region was strong before the pandemic and has shown incredible resiliency throughout this disruptive period. 
Stores are showing continuous recapture of volumes despite softer street traffic in large metro areas. We are encouraged to see the brick-and-mortar DTC business for both The North Face and Vans inflect meaningfully this quarter, each returning to positive growth relative to fiscal year '20. Recovery momentum and sustained growth are expected to accelerate throughout the year as vaccine rollouts progress. 
Finally, the APAC region delivered low single-digit organic growth despite a more challenging backdrop than anticipated for parts of our portfolio. Due to a resurgence of COVID-19 across the region, economic growth and consumer confidence has softened since July. Parts of our business in China have been further impacted by weaker digital traffic for nondomestic brands. This has been more impactful for Active brands relative to Outdoor. Across the portfolio, we believe we are performing better in our respective categories versus other international brands. And while we remain bullish on the long-term opportunity in the region, these pressures have impacted our near-term outlook. We now expect low-teen growth in China in fiscal 2022.  
Moving on to our global supply chain. The environment remains challenging and has continued to deteriorate following our Q1 call in late July. The resurgence of COVID-19 lockdowns in key sourcing countries, like Vietnam, have resulted in more impactful production delays. And the logistics network continues to face unprecedented challenges. We are experiencing increasing product delays from the supply chain disruption, which is creating meaningful quarter-to-quarter volatility in our results.
Let me unpack all of this in a little more detail. Due to VF's large and strategically diversified sourcing footprint, our overall production capacity has remained better positioned than most, with about 85% of production operational throughout the quarter. Pressures have generally concentrated in the southern region of Vietnam, which represents about 10% of VF's overall sourcing mix. 
We remain confident in our ability to navigate the production environment. However, the logistics network remains under increasing pressure. Ports are generally open, but operations remain severely impacted by labor and equipment availability servicing significantly higher ship volumes. As a result, our dwell times at points of destination have increased significantly. In aggregate, supply delays are pervasive and, in some cases, have extended 8 to 10 weeks. As a result, in the most recent quarter, we had a material shift of revenue from Q2 into Q3, with more than half of this tied to Vietnam. 
Despite these delays, cancellation rates have remained below historical levels, signaling strong demand and tight channel inventories. However, delays ultimately impact product availability across the marketplace. Virtually all of our brands are experiencing delayed collections, styles, and in some cases, insufficient size assortment, limiting their ability to fully meet strong demand. For example, the Supreme brand has experienced around 30% less inventory around drops. So despite strong sell-through trends, we are losing volume from limited supply. 
This environment is where our world-class supply chain differentiates itself, highlighting the significant competitive advantage VF has created with this platform. We have always maintained a diversified sourcing footprint to provide resiliency against unforeseen changes in the operating or geopolitical environment. For example, our largest market, Vietnam, only represents about 1/4 of our sourcing mix. And within Vietnam, we work with multiple partners, have a presence in multiple provinces, both between the northern and southern regions of the country, and maintain access to multiple ports. 
Our teams are leveraging VF's scale and relationships to navigate the challenging logistics environment in the most cost-effective way. We continue to utilize expedited freight across a large number of air providers. We have doubled our network of ocean carriers and significantly expanded the number of ports utilized across the globe.  
Our commercial and supply chain teams are working closely with our key wholesale partners, increasingly using direct shipping. And our work indicates we're doing better than most of the competitive set at keeping product on the shelves. Our relationship with these key wholesale partners continues to strengthen with our open, transparent and timely communication throughout this dynamic situation. So despite the unprecedented level of disruption across the global supply chain, our teams have been able to keep product flowing, supporting our strong holiday growth plan and allowing VF to effectively hold our revenue guide for fiscal 2022.  
Moving into some additional highlights on our second quarter. Total VF revenue increased 21% to $3.2 billion despite a significant amount of orders shifted from Q2 into Q3, implying continued sequential underlying improvement for the portfolio. For context, we estimate this shift represented a mid- to high single-digit impact to VF's Q2 growth rate relative to fiscal 2020. Our adjusted gross margin expanded 300 basis points to 53.9% due to higher full-price realization, lower markdowns, favorable mix and around 20 basis points contribution from Supreme. When compared to prior peak gross margins in fiscal 2020, our current year gross margin was impacted by about 180 basis points headwind from incremental expedited freight and FX. Excluding these 2 items, our organic gross margin in Q2 is over 100 basis points above prior peak levels, driven by favorable mix and strong underlying margin rate improvement. 
And as a reminder, our Q2 2020 gross margin was very strong. So our ability to deliver this level of underlying expansion against fiscal year '20 margins is a strong testament to the health of our brands in the marketplace.  
Our SG&A ratio improved in Q2, down 100 basis points organically to 37.2% despite elevated distribution spend and continued growth in strategic investment. This strong underlying leverage was driven by discretionary choices and is a clear reflection of the optionality within our model, supporting organic EPS growth of 60%. I am proud of our team's ability to deliver earnings of $1.11 in Q2 despite incremental expedited freight expense and significant wholesale shipment timing headwinds in the quarter, reflecting the strong underlying earnings momentum of the portfolio.  
Now a few comments on our revised fiscal 2022 outlook. We are holding our revenue guidance to be about $12 billion despite a weaker China outlook in the near term and a lower-than-expected back-to-school performance at Vans in the U.S. and ongoing supply chain challenges, all of this highlighting the broad-based strength across our brands and geographies. Our gross margin outlook is now about 56%, including 40 basis points of incremental freight cost relative to what we had expected in July, implying an improving underlying gross margin outlook. And adjusting for incremental freight and FX, our fiscal 2022 outlook implies over 100 basis points of underlying gross margin expansion relative to peak gross margins in fiscal 2020, driven by favorable mix and clean, full-price sell-through.  
We are holding our operating margin outlook to around 13% for fiscal 2022 despite the incremental freight costs covered. As Steve said, we're focused on what we can control. And for me, SG&A control is clearly top of mind. We are offsetting supply chain and distribution cost headwind with spend reduction actions while protecting strategic investment and demand creation. The business is driving impressive underlying leverage, and our confidence is strong that we can continue to accelerate this over time.  
Finally, as discussed, we are reaffirming our full year earnings outlook of around $3.20, despite about $0.09 of incremental costs directly attributed to the supply chain disruption, a strong testament of portfolio resiliency and the optionality of our model.  
Steve introduced an important concept, that VF is not just one brand, and I want to reiterate this as I conclude our prepared remarks. Before the pandemic, VF was more reliant on the Vans brand. Today, however, we have a much larger portion of our business performing at or above our expectations. There is broad-based momentum across the portfolio. VF also has powerful enterprise platforms, highlighted by our world-class supply chain, which provides a significant competitive advantage to our business.
And lastly, VF has the capacity to drive meaningful incremental shareholder value through capital allocation optionality. We've demonstrated this over the course of the pandemic by maintaining our dividend and trading our Occupational Work business for the Supreme brand. And as you may have noticed in this morning's release, our share repurchase program has been reinstated, with remaining authorization to repurchase up to $2.8 billion of common stock. 
As we have line of sight to our leverage threshold, we have this additional optionality, and we'll be opportunistic on share repurchases moving into the balance of this fiscal year. 
VF is not just one brand. We are a diversified portfolio of strong brands, supported by world-class enterprise platforms, which we believe, at minimum, can drive high single-digit revenue growth, low teens earnings growth and provide meaningful capital allocation optionality moving forward.

We see nothing in the Vans strategy that would tell us that we cannot grow double digits long term. This brand sits in an active TAM with a very -- with attractive on a day to day, and we think only growing as this casualization megatrend accelerates. We've grown high teens since the acquisition. That's over a decade of high teens growth. And we continue to see significant international whitespace in China, in Europe, but continue to see growth here in the U.S. 
I think what gives us confidence as we look forward is we have a renewed focus on our icon management strategy. A proof point this quarter was the 25% growth that we saw in our SK8-Hi as they leaned into marketing that particular icon. And as we come through Q3 towards the back half, you'll see us begin to elevate the icons in general and really getting back into the systematic cycle of pushing the 5 key icons, while we also continue to support our Progression, which is where the Altra sits, MTE, where we've seen very strong sell-through as well as leveraging the growth in apparel, which is really opening up those multiple-wear occasions that the brand can enjoy. 
We'll continue to leverage the in-store experience. That is a core element of how this brand connects with its consumers. And we'll continue to lean into growth here in the U.S. and Europe and look to really support our Asia teams as we focus on that China growth trajectory and getting the brand back in sync with what we know is very possible as the brand pushes the notion of creative self-expression in a very brand right, but local consumer relevancy to elevate the brand there in China."

And this is a true statement across all of our brands. But certainly, there's a significant inflection in the wholesale business based on the order books. And we've talked about the differences in the spring order books versus the fall order books. And the time that those order books were placed has impacted that pretty significantly.  
And just to give you an example. For Vans on a global basis, our wholesale business was down, call it, high single digits in the first half. We expect it's going to be up sort of low double digits in the second half. And again, that's supported by the order books that we have. And we've really got visibility at this point pretty much all the way through the end of our fiscal year. So that's one thing I think it's worth understanding. And certainly, again, it's relevant for all of our brands. 
The other thing is our demand-creation efforts will accelerate from a spend standpoint in the back half of the year. That's always been our plan. And you'll see that we've got that built into our modeling from the beginning. We did have a bit of an acceleration through back-to-school versus what we saw in the first half of the calendar year, but even more so as we move into the holidays. So strong demand creation investments and strong programs coming to support the business.
And then probably the last thing, as we've said all along, we expect some continued improvement in our traffic into our large and highly productive brick-and-mortar base of business. And we've generally seen that. We did see a little bit of a -- a little bit lower than our expectations in the month of August, in particular, here in the U.S. in terms of the traffic build. And we think that was certainly tied in some ways to the Delta variant and some of the new restrictions that were placed back on consumers there in that period of time.
But generally, from the beginning of this calendar year all the way through September, setting aside August, we've seen the business sequentially improve from a traffic standpoint. September was our best month of the quarter. October has actually started off good. We're actually on track. And honestly, we're slightly ahead of our expectations in the Americas region from a D2C perspective during the month of October. So just a few more data points there for you relative to really what's supporting the acceleration implied in the outlook."

Though there have been some Delta impacts in some of the smaller markets, what we've seen is certainly an issue building here in China. I mean there's a number of factors that are impacting our China business. First is the resurgence of COVID across the Greater China region. It really has had an impact on economic growth and, more importantly, consumer confidence. And we've seen that in our store traffic coming into brick-and-mortar. And we've also seen that challenging some of the digital titan platform traffic, where we have a big presence from a digital standpoint. 
And some of our legacy marketing tools, specifically key opinion leader marketing, are no longer available and having a short-term impact. It doesn't mean long term that we won't adjust. And in fact, we are, but that did have a short-term impact. 
But I think, importantly, what we do expect to see is a reacceleration. And I think there's 3 really key reasons here. Our decision to establish an even stronger structure and presence in Shanghai, something we've been working on now for many months, allows us to better understand the marketplace variables and to speak to the local consumer in a more relevant and authentic way for each one of our brands. 
Our decision to hire our leader in China and expand Winnie's scope beyond just Greater China is having a very outsized impact. Her confidence and experience in understanding the local market, local consumers, how to engage with our key strategic partners, is certainly elevating our brands and our business' ability to understand the consumer and navigate some of these new variables that we see. 
As we stand up our brand teams in Shanghai, that local market knowledge is going to help us really bring our brand purpose, our VF purpose for our associates to bear. And we're seeing that as a really important element today as we focus on the health and well-being of our associates. 
There's a notion here in our brand marketing. We see it coming to life in North Face. We're really putting our purpose in place and really elevating our messaging and our connections and delivery of value around health and well-being to the Chinese consumer and really looking to improve their life through engaging with our brands, the experiences that our brands enable and connecting in a much more one-to-one way. We think these strategic shifts that we've been really driving over the last 12 to 18 months position us in a very strong way to navigate these new variables and get that reacceleration back into the business."

I mean a little bit of supply challenges there, but primarily demand. And then the rest is sort of the comment that Steve made about the consumer and what we've seen here in the short term. And then as you said, there's certainly some COVID-related impacts across the rest of the region as we saw some lockdown measures and closed stores and just generally consumer confidence in some of those other countries that waned a bit during the quarter.
Maybe last thing I would say, because I think it's important, from a VF perspective, we certainly -- we didn't really change our guidance. We did soften the language slightly. I can tell you that's all really driven by China. Without that, you wouldn't have seen any change. And I would also tell you, without what we saw occur in China, we would have not changed our Vans outlook."

And certainly inventories continue to be really lean across the marketplace. That's the case for our brands and, I would say, for most. So we expect a really clean and lack of promotional kind of environment certainly versus historical.
And as we think about moving into spring next year and even beyond, certainly, our view will be that the promotional environment is going to continue to be quite good. Yes, I'll remind you that our business historically is clean. We don't promote a lot in our brands. And that's been one of the things we've been trying to help everyone understand when you look at the 2-year compares versus some of the peer set. Our business was really clean and healthy 2 years ago. It's that way now. We expect it will be next year. 
As you think about gross margins next year, we expect margins will expand, bottom line. I think we expect margins will expand probably at least 0.5 point in line with our LRP. Certainly, there's some headwinds: input cost inflationary pressures, elevated freight costs that will certainly going to continue for a period of time. But there's tailwinds as well. As I said, promotional environment remained clean. We certainly would expect we're not going to see the same level of expedited freight that we've seen this year. Our mix benefit will be intact. We've got continued momentum in some of the brands. We've had opportunities to strengthen gross margins on the back of stronger brand equity. Timberland and Dickies are examples of that. 
And then last but certainly not least, the biggest, I think, tool in the toolbox here is pricing. And we certainly expect -- and we've talked about we're going to start to see meaningful impacts from pricing as early as our fiscal Q4 and as we think about spring '22 and even more so fall '22 of next year."

So Supreme, Supreme has had a disproportionate impact to the supply chain disruptions that we're talking about. They've got an exposure into Vietnam. And if you think about the model, due to the nature of how they flow products, they don't carry forward inventory. So when a particular drop is not able to be delivered on time -- yes, they have an agile model and they're able to move around. But the impacts that they've seen this quarter were such that it had a pretty material impact on what we were able to do in Q2. 
The good news is sell-through trends continue to be very strong. And we -- while we saw a decrease in inventory, we did see a continued strong interest and a clear opportunity for the brand to continue to grow. But I think the supply chain interruptions are helping us all see the further benefit of the supply chain integration that is in place, that will help us help our Supreme team really diversify their footprint and focus in areas where we can help them maintain better flow.
As we think about longer term and coming into the second half, we have line of sight to delivery, the inventory required for the weekly drops. And that wasn't true 6 weeks ago. So I think there's a lot of confidence here that we can recapture that momentum, and we really start to recapture that lost volume. In some of the most recent drops, we've seen a really strong evidence of that demand. So I think, in light of this disruption, the plan that this group operates with, the agility to be able to flex continues to be a competitive advantage. And as they integrate into our supply chain, it will help be able to mitigate some of these impacts.
To your European question, our international expansion, COVID's had an impact on our team's ability to travel, begin to meet and work with our European and international team, though that work is continuing virtually. Our Supreme team needs to get into market. The model by which they look for new stores, that really anchors the brand in new cities, has been slowed based on COVID. They've worked with our team, certainly will help them speed up that knowledge base as to hit market. But we're certainly a few months off of what would have been a plan that we were ready to execute going to fiscal '23. But the geographic expansion potential remains very strong, a key part of our growth, and you'll see us continue to open stores, both in Europe and Asia as the teams were able to get into market."

So from a -- first of all, this is why we didn't provide guidance for the quarter. If I try to call the split there between Q2 and Q3 as -- we knew it was going to be a pretty volatile environment, and it certainly played out that way. 
From a timing, shipment timing perspective, we said mid- to high single-digit impact to VF's organic growth in the quarter relative to fiscal '20. So -- and that's really impactful across all of our businesses, certainly several points of growth for the Big 3 Brands. And also, as Steve just described, pretty impactful for Supreme in the quarter as well. And this was especially true, I would say, in the U.S. and Europe and to a lesser degree, to some degree in Asia, all those small impacts there.
At a brand level, Vans would have been sort of at pre-pandemic levels in the quarter. And TNF and Timberland in particular would show meaningful acceleration versus where we were in Q1, adjusting for the impact of the wholesale shipment timing. 
And I think in terms of what we expect, we expect virtually all of that's going to get out the door and ship here in Q3. And as a result, it's one of the reasons that we've been comfortable in essentially holding our full year revenue outlook and then coupled with what we see in terms of the strong underlying momentum from a sell-through perspective."

To your question on fiscal '23, clearly, it's early for us to be able to talk about how we're looking at that. But I think the confidence that we have in our portfolio, which we spent a lot of time strategically evolving to where we are today, each one of our brands has the potential of achieving its long-range plan. And you see that happening this year with many of our brands.
Specifically to Vans, we see them getting back to low double-digit growth and being able to deliver that on a consistent basis. Our North Face business is building momentum. You've heard us really begin to talk with a lot of confidence. The work that's been done to really strengthen that team, tighten up our merchandising strategies, get the flow between the on-mountain and off-mountain product collections, raising our outlook for the year on a 2-year basis to 16% to 18%, I think, is a proof point of that confidence. 
Now Timberland is inflecting. We see them really owning and driving that boot culture. And as we really drive our integrated marketplace strategy and the merchandise flow, the new products coming with GreenStride, TrueCloud, some of the things you see going on in the women's business, give us confidence that this business is inflecting and has great potential. 
And I'll take one more point. Our Dickies business, raising our outlook as we did this year, just now to greater than 30% on a 2-year stack. This business is very unique. We saw this with -- at the point of acquisition and the way our team is really looking at, horizontally, playing out that work and work-inspired piece, but also been thinking on a vertical axis against the different distribution opportunities and moving into higher tiers of distribution with higher -- with product -- with a little bit more style, a little bit more quality of materials and opening up that lens and grabbing new consumers on a global basis.

And we've said that business is growing around sort of 30% or north of 30%. And as we look into sort of the near-term view, no reason to think we're not going to continue to see this brand grow certainly north of 20% to 25% over the next several years."

Jim, it has such a unique position in the market from it -- how it thinks about the foot and how the athlete's foot needs to really move through the different motions of running and trail running. And I think that -- we're seeing that really play out. 
The Lone Peak, it's no secret that it's been called out as the #1 trail running shoe here in the U.S. marketplace by multiple publications and it's the team's understanding, building on that 10-year history. But we're playing in a very significant TAM with a very unique brand that is scaling at a very rapid rate. 
And I'm glad you picked this up because we talked about our Outdoor emerging brands, over $550 million in revenue. They're profitable. They're growing high teens. And each one of them are in significant TAMs. If you think about that in context of some -- what's going on in the broader marketplace and some of the IPOs that we see, we have had a history of growing brands. What we've done with The North Face and Vans is -- we have the potential of doing with brands like an Altra and helping them achieve their full potential by leveraging the skills and capabilities and leveraging those aspects of our model to really help them drive their growth. So I appreciate you asking the question. We're excited about Altra and what it means, not just for the team, but for broader VF."

But Dickies' growth is broad-based. It's happening across both work and as they talk about the work-inspired or the lifestyle component of the brand, really leveraging that work element more broadly. It's growing across all regions. And it's growing vertically beyond its core work, but looking for new points of distribution, even into Tier 1 and Tier 0-type distribution channels. 
The brand had a really interesting pop-up shop with Fred Segal during the quarter and saw significant sell-through and energy just validating this team's approach to harnessing the elements of the brand anchored to Work, extending it into that maker economy, but really building a strong community around all the aspects of creative self-expression, certainly moving into the maker piece. 
There's a SK8 element to this brand. It's always been there with the 874 work pant and really acknowledging that, speaking to that consumer, helping stretch into a new concentric circle. But it's really just looking at the integrated marketplace opportunity and really leveraging the core work heritage, driving those icons. But you'll continue to see us evolve our product offer, higher price points, higher-quality materials and make into those higher tiers of distribution, but continuing to expand internationally in Europe and Asia and really leveraging that core work heritage that comes from the U.S. marketplace."

And that's all, I think, fairly straightforward and consistent with what the industry would do by and large. 
But I think it's worth recognizing, as we've evolved our portfolio over time to be more focused on Outdoor and Active, cotton is probably less in terms of, say, the component parts of our product than it would have been historically. It's about 10% of VF's product cost today. And based on what we know about the pricing as well as, again, our forward contracts, et cetera, we expect this to negatively impact our product cost somewhere between 0.5 point and 1 point in fiscal '23, very limited impact this year, really sort of immaterial. And we're planning overall product cost inflation next year to be, let's call it, somewhere around a mid-single-digit headwind sort of in total."
