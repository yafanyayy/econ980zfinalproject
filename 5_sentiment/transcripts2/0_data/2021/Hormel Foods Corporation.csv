As we approach the 1-year mark of the pandemic, I want to express my gratitude to our plant professionals for their continued dedication, energy and focus. They continue to be the true heroes of our company during this time. 
On our last earnings call in November, we were witnessing an increase of COVID-19 cases in the United States. Our #1 priority has been to keep our team members safe, and we have been very focused on our best-in-class preventative measures and on educating our employees through our awareness campaign KEEP COVID OUT! As the pandemic evolves and the vaccine becomes more widely available to our team members, we'll continue to keep the health and safety of our team members as the top priority. 
We were among the first to offer a COVID pay program to allow those who were ill or had symptoms to stay home from work and still be paid. Additionally, we paid $11 million in fiscal 2020 in unconditional bonuses to our team members to provide further financial security. Our program has resulted in minimizing the spread of COVID in our workplaces and our communities. 
Recently, we've been encouraged to see cases decline, and the number of team members on our COVID pay program drastically decreased. This gives us increased optimism as we head into the second quarter. 
We are pleased to announce the entry into a definitive agreement to acquire the Planters business last Thursday. We have many leading brands at Hormel, and the acquisition of the Planters Snack Nut business will be an excellent addition to our company. 
Over the past 10 years, we've made numerous acquisitions, all of which are meeting our strategic objectives. The performances of MegaMex, Wholly, SKIPPY. Applegate, Justin's, Sriracha, Fontanini, Columbus and Sadler's give us a high level of confidence in our ability to successfully integrate operate and grow the Planters business. 
The acquisition of Planters is the perfect strategic fit. The addition of this iconic, branded, high-margin business continues our evolution as a global branded food company, moving us further away from a commodity-oriented, meat-centric company. As one of our biggest brands, we will give it a high level of focus and attention. Our core competency and brand stewardship will be key to our success in unlocking the power of the Planters brand. We know how to manage brands, and Planters is right in our sweet spot as we know, Planters is more than simply peanuts in a jar. 
Planters also perfectly complements, enhances and expands our existing snacking business, joining brands like Hormel Gatherings, Columbus, Wholly and Herdez. There are numerous opportunities to leverage the consumer insights from both portfolios to drive further innovation and improve growth for our entire snacking business. The Planters business gives us another iconic brand to grow and increases our scale in key areas such as center store and convenience stores. Integration into our direct sales force is a high priority, and we know there are immediate opportunities to improve distribution and drive sales growth. 
Another priority for us is to integrate the business into our One Supply Chain and Project Orion platforms. We expect synergies from this integration for the Planters business and for our existing business. There's a lot to love about this acquisition, and I'm excited for the transaction to close so we can begin to give the Planters business the attention and focus it needs to grow. 
Now turning to our first quarter. Our team generated strong top line growth, with sales increasing 3% to a record $2.5 billion. All 4 segments delivered sales growth, an achievement that hasn't been accomplished since 2016. Incremental supply chain costs related to COVID-19 of $15 million were the primary reason for a $13 million decline in pretax earnings. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share declined 9% due primarily to incremental supply chain costs and higher tax expense. 
As in prior quarters, we continue to strike a balance between the consumer demand we are seeing and our supply chain's ability to meet that demand. We increased production levels this quarter through a combination of improving efficiencies, bringing on new capacity and further leveraging our strategic supply chain partners. We expect this steady improvement to continue throughout the year. We have been successful in a number of critical categories, and we will continue to make progress across the portfolio. 
Our retail business continued to perform extremely well, with sales increasing 13% for the quarter. Brands such as SPAM, SKIPPY, Hormel Chili, Hormel Black Label, Applegate, Hormel Pepperoni, Lloyd's, Hormel Fully Cooked entrees and Justin's all delivered very strong growth. 
Most encouraging was the sales growth we saw from the Jennie-O brand. Every major retail category, including Jennie-O lean ground turkey burgers, oven-ready items, bacon and marinated meats grew. The Jennie-O brand continues to resonate with consumers, and the efforts we have made on gaining back customer distribution are paying off. 
Our e-commerce business continues to be a bright spot as it almost doubled in the last 12 weeks according to IRI. We grew share in several key categories and have a high level of momentum in online grocery pickup, delivery and direct-to-consumer. 
Our deli channel sales increased 7% this quarter. Columbus-branded products led the way with exceptional growth from grab-and-go items. The opening of our new plant in Omaha this quarter, which produces Columbus charcuterie products, will provide much-needed capacity for this business. While the Columbus brand was the clear leader for us this quarter in the deli, our team generated growth in every deli segment they compete in, including grab-and-go, prepared foods behind-the-glass and fresh sliced deli meats. 
Our Party Tray business also grew volume and sales over the holiday season despite fewer group gatherings, a testament to our team's ability to keep this brand relevant. We saw positive signs of recovery in foodservice this quarter, even as the business declined 17% compared to last year due to the continued impacts of the pandemic on the industry. We continue to see strength in our business within important segments such as pizzerias, QSRs and convenience stores. 
Our direct sales force also made excellent progress pivoting to high-growth areas such as commissaries and ghost kitchens as they secured new distribution with both distributors and operators. 
Turning to the segments. Grocery Products delivered very impressive results this quarter. We saw top line strength across many of our brands, including SPAM, SKIPPY, HORMEL COMPLEATS and Herdez, which led to volume increases of 4% and sales increases of 7%. 
We implemented a price increase for our SKIPPY business this quarter, once again demonstrating our ability to price in our categories. We are also encouraged with the performance of our recent innovative new items, including SKIPPY Squeeze, SKIPPY No Sugar and SKIPPY with added protein spreads. 
Our MegaMex joint venture had a strong performance this quarter as well, with equity and earnings increasing by 31%. This growth was led by our retail brands such as Wholly, Herdez, CHI-CHI'S and La Victoria. In addition to the MegaMex results, the 35% increase in segment profit was driven by higher sales and a favorable mix. 
Refrigerated Foods volume declined 2%, and sales increased 1%. Our retail and deli teams overcame see year-over-year declines in our foodservice business to deliver growth for our value-added business. 
Applegate had a particularly strong quarter, with growth fueled by both category momentum and share gains across core categories such as frozen breaded chicken, breakfast sausage, bacon and hotdogs. I continue to be optimistic about the momentum we are building in the Applegate business. 
We also delivered excellent results in our Hormel Pepperoni business both in foodservice and retail. Our teams continue to optimize the brand by focusing on our core products in the category and simultaneously leaning into our new Cup N' Crisp innovation, planning to maintain our advertising efforts for Hormel Pepperoni to ensure we retain the households we gained during the initial pandemic buying. 
Refrigerated Foods segment profit declined by 16% due to lower foodservice sales, a significant decline in commodity profitability and increased supply chain expenses due to COVID-19. Profitability was also impacted by onetime start-up expenses related to our new plant in Omaha. 
Jennie-O volume decreased 2%, and sales increased 1%. We saw exceptionally strong retail and whole bird sales, which overcame significant declines in foodservice and commodity. Our retail business grew double digits this quarter, with growth coming from almost every category in which we compete. We have taken price increases across our portfolio and expect those to be effective late in the second quarter. Whole bird volumes increased by strong double digits due to a very positive holiday season. 
Our foodservice business was impacted by lower K-12 and college and university business in addition to continued weakness in the foodservice industry. Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit declined 30%. Lower foodservice sales increased supply chain cost related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher freight expenses were key drivers to the lower profitability. Grain prices increased significantly during the quarter but only had a modest effect on earnings. We expect the primary impact of higher grain prices to affect the coming quarters. In addition to pricing action, we have taken additional actions to manage higher corn and soybean meal costs. 
International volume decreased 5%. Sales increased 13%, and segment profit increased 61%. Once again, the strong sales and earnings performance was led by our retail and foodservice business in China. SPAM, SKIPPY and Beef Jerky were all key drivers to growth in China. We remain very positive about the short- and long-term prospects of our China business. We also saw strong branded exports for brands like SKIPPY and SPAM. Similar to prior quarters, our affiliated businesses in the Philippines, South Korea and Europe continue to show high levels of growth. 
Looking to the balance of the year. I am increasingly optimistic about delivering sales and earnings growth. As such, we are establishing fiscal 2021 guidance for the full year at $1.70 to $1.82 per share. As a reminder, this guidance range does not include the impact of the acquisition of Planters. 
Similar to prior quarters, we believe there are 3 key drivers to our near-term and long-term performance: retail dynamics, the recovery in the foodservice industry and the performance of our supply chain. Our retail, deli and international teams need to maintain their momentum and outperform their respective categories. Our brands continue to gain new households, and our repeat rates remain very strong. The depth of repeat, those consumers purchasing our brands multiple times, is incredibly positive with almost all new buyers for our brands making 2-or-more repeat purchases during the first quarter. 
As a whole, our brands continue to make household penetration gains with brands like Herdez, La Victoria and Columbus increasing household penetration by 20%. For the foodservice channel, we are optimistic about a foodservice recovery and confident in our ability to gain share during the recovery. During the pandemic, operators have been looking for products to simplify their food preparation, save time and minimize labor, all while preserving the flexibility to add their own unique touch to a menu item. 
Our direct sales force continues to meet their needs with products like Hormel Fire Braised meats, Sadler's authentic smoked barbecue and Hormel Bacon 1. The recent trends we are seeing in our foodservice businesses are positive. We have been able to react quickly to increased demand as cities and states have eased dining restrictions, allowing patrons to return to their favorite restaurants. We also anticipate our noncommercial business such as K-12 schools, colleges and universities and health care to recover as the pandemic subsides. 
The most encouraging signs we are seeing are in our supply chain. We made excellent progress on increasing capacity to meet the high levels of demand from our customers. Steady week-over-week improvements, lower levels of absenteeism, new capacity and a continued vaccine rollout are all reasons we have a positive outlook. 
Our supplying team hit 2 major milestones this quarter: with the opening of our new dry sausage production facility in Omaha, Nebraska; and the opening of our pizza toppings expansion at Burke. Both projects were on time and on budget, which is truly amazing considering both projects were constructed primarily during the pandemic. 
Our plant teams have made progress on labor availability and in almost every location, our labor situation has improved. We expect that trend to continue into the second quarter and beyond as the vaccine becomes widely available for our team members. We now have a higher level of visibility into the coming quarters and remain confident in our team's ability to deliver our sales and earnings guidance this year. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter, give an update on our financial position and provide commentary regarding key input cost markets."

COVID-related direct expenses of $15 million were the primary driver to pretax earnings declining $13 million or 5%. Absent the COVID expenses, pretax earnings would have increased. Total COVID expenses have started to decline from the prior quarterly run rate of $20 million. This was driven by higher volumes through our production facilities and improved efficiencies in our logistics network. 
Earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.41 compared to $0.45 last year. On an after-tax basis, first quarter results reflected approximately $0.04 per share in incremental COVID-related costs and higher tax expense. SG&A excluding advertising was 6.6% of sales, down slightly compared to the prior year. Advertising spend for the quarter was $34 million compared to $35 million last year. 
We continue to invest in our leading brands, including SPAM, SKIPPY, Hormel Pepperoni, Black Label and Jennie-O. Operating margins for the quarter were 10.9% compared to 11.8% last year. The decline was driven by COVID-related expenses and the continued impact from lower foodservice earnings. Unallocated expenses included deferred compensation, expenses related to tax settlement and deal fees. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%. Last year's rate of 16.3% was affected by the large volume of stock options exercised in the quarter. Excluding the impact from the Planters acquisition, we expect the full year tax rate to be between 20% and 21.5%. Cash from operations was $206 million during the quarter, a 9% increase. 
Even with record sales, inventory levels continue to gradually improve throughout the quarter due to improvements in operations, labor availability, internal capacity expansions and increased use of strategic manufacturing partners. We expect inventories to continue to build throughout the second quarter. 
There is a risk for inflationary pressure on freight expense both domestically and internationally. However, we expect improved efficiency factors to offset some of the higher freight costs. We paid our 370th consecutive quarterly dividend effective February 16 at an annual rate of $0.98, a 5% increase over the prior year. During the quarter, the company repurchased 200,000 shares for $9 million. 
Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter. We opened the pizza topping expansion of Burke and the new dry sausage facility in Omaha. Work is also underway to expand our pepperoni capacity. The company's target for capital expenditures in 2021 is $260 million. 
Last Thursday, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire the Planters Snack Nut portfolio for an effective purchase price of $2.79 billion. The transaction was structured as an asset purchase and included a $560 million tax benefit. The adjusted 2020 EBITDA multiple on the effective purchase price of $2.79 billion was 12.5x. 
This acquisition is financially attractive. Our disciplined approach to valuation allowed us to secure a leading brand at a multiple below the industry average, take advantage of historically low rates, increase our company sales by 10%, improve the profitability of the portfolio with accretive margins and responsibly leverage our balance sheet. 
We expect to finance the transaction with cash on hand and a combination of long-term and short-term debt. We will be able to borrow the funds at approximately 1.5% and expect to be able to significantly deleverage the debt in 18 to 24 months. We are targeting a 1.5x leverage by 2023 and are very focused on retaining a strong investment-grade rating. The cash flows from our existing business along with Planters allows us to maintain our long-term capital allocation strategy. 
We will continue to prioritize returning cash to shareholders in the form of annual dividend growth. Industry operating efficiencies, labor availability and production levels continued to improve during the first quarter, driving less volatility in the hog market compared to the back half of 2020. Hog weights are currently at historically high levels, which have led to balanced market conditions. In 2021, the USDA is projecting pork production to increase 1%. 
With an expected recovery in the foodservice industry and higher grain prices for the balance of the year, we anticipate hog cost to increase. Our balanced mix of hog and pork supply contracts will help us manage the risk of higher prices. The USDA composite cutout was in line with last year during the first quarter. Recently, we have seen strength in the cutout, supported by strong demand for pork domestically and internationally. 
We continue to monitor export demand and ASF in China, Southeast Asia and Europe. ASF continues to be a risk in the pork industry. We have seen the disease could be successfully managed in areas with modern agricultural practices. We expect higher prices for pork with less volatility than last year. The strength of our brands and balanced approach to procurement continue to be a competitive advantage. 
Pork trim markets are expected to remain higher during the second quarter of 2021 and decline in the back half as labor availability and processing plants improves. Beef trim prices are expected to be lower in 2021. We anticipate belly prices to be volatile in the near term driven by strong demand and foodservice industry growth. 
Strong Chinese demand and drought conditions in South America continue to generate higher grain prices, which is expected to negatively impact Jennie-O Turkey Store. Like the pork industry, we are closely watching the fundamentals for grain. The primary factor we are watching are global demand, planting intentions for the coming season and weather conditions in South America. 
We manage freight costs through a combination of spot buying, derivatives and adjusting feed formulas. Additionally, we have announced pricing action across all Jennie-O products to protect our profitability. We are prepared to take additional actions as conditions change. 
Fundamentals in the turkey industry remain mixed. Egg sets, hold placements and cold storage are below year ago levels, while prices for commodity breast and thigh meat remain depressed. Poult placements have been declining recently, which will likely lead to lower levels of supply. Because the foodservice industry is a key outlook for breast meat, as the foodservice industry recovers, breast meat pricing is expected to improve. 
We are finalizing the implementation plans for the Planters business. We will have the HR and payroll functions integrated by the closing date. The finance and supply chain will be fully implemented within 1 year of closing. 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Obviously, the rationale that we have in terms of what's happened in the grain market supports -- very strong underlying support. So the team has done a nice job there. 
And as we go forward, the idea of elasticity with pricing is something that has been difficult to measure given the pandemic. What we do know is we've continued to see exceptional demand for the Jennie-O Turkey Store retail products.

So really, there's multiple approaches we've taken to mitigate the risk around these increases. Jim talked about a very effective approach on price increases, along with the shifting of the feed formula and the positions that we've taken.

And so because of that, we've had some higher freight costs and haven't had the opportunity to optimize our loads like we typically do. So we have seen some higher freight costs. 
And while there are expectations that freight rates will increase, we see a pretty significant opportunity for us to be able to offset a good portion of those as our supply chain continues to pick up momentum and we're able to fill trucks in a more optimized manner. 
So yes, there'll be some flip freight inflation. But again, we think there's going to be a really good opportunity for us to offset that with some internal efficiencies."

When we think about private label, when we across our existing categories, private label shares can range across the board. And right now, what we're seeing is the average center store range is about 20%. And the Planters brand, as they face private label, they're seeing about the same percentage of private label. And again, that's across the board. There's different subcategories. So the idea of a private label being a risk, a threat, a competitor, not new to us at all. So obviously, we're prepared to manage our business accordingly. 
From a gross margin perspective, I think what we had talked about last week was probably a little lower down in terms of profitability. But without giving too many specifics, it's safe to say that Planters' gross margins are -- they're well above our total company average, and they're also above our Grocery Products average. 
So -- and then the other thing, just in terms of the category, we know how to manage brands. We've said that multiple times. And so when we think about commodities and pricing and price elasticities, this brand is very similar to all of our other large brands. So yes, not new to us. We know how to manage it. 
And when you roll all those things up, from our perspective, this business is not a commodity business. I would go so far to say, again, from our perspective, we know a commodity business when we see one. And this is not a commodity business. So hopefully, that's helpful."

We know in the second quarter, we saw the significant run-up in Grocery Products. But we also saw the significant collapse of our foodservice business. 
And so -- and then in Q4, if you recall, we talked about the difficulties we were having in our supply chain and meeting the absolute demand that we are getting from our customers. So there's a lot of give and take for the remaining 3 quarters. As we've laid out the business with our business units and reviewed how we think the business is going to 
[Audio Gap] 
part of the optimism is we're far less capacity-constrained. Clearly, we're not out of the woods. We've got to meet customer demand. But I think everything that we said we were going to do and that we knew that we needed to do in Q4 has happened.

So as we look at it from a financial standpoint, the first area that we should talk about is foodservice. We've seen some very interesting trends in the last, let's say, few weeks on foodservice. And we have idle capacity in foodservice. So we have no problem filling that foodservice need. So any growth in the foodservice category is unrestrained and a great opportunity for us is that business. So we're confident it's going to continue to improve. 
In the Grocery Products category, we talked about a tremendous Q2 that we had. But Q3 and Q4, I think it's safe to say, were crippled by supply chain challenges that really are not existing anymore. The availability of labor is much better than it was last year. And so that's going to be able to allow us to grow Grocery Products in the back half of the year. 
Jim talked about Refrigerated Foods, how we've had some constraints in the pepperoni business and that we have additional capacity that's come online there, and we're doing a very nice job of recovering the pepperoni business and actually seeing some very significant growth in pepperoni in the foodservice category. 
So I think it's hard to underestimate how much of an impact the constraint had in 2020 and the opportunity that we have in 2021. And one of the other things that we haven't talked a lot about is that during this time of constraint, we've found some very significant efficiencies in our operations that have helped us produce product even in a difficult time period. Now as we increase it, we'll be able to take those efficiencies and actually drive cost issues and efficiency issues throughout the operations."

In terms of what inventories look like. I mean, clearly, a lot of breast meat. Turkey breast meat is used in the foodservice industry. And so that collapse has had a dramatic impact. And obviously, there are implications to that across the entire industry. What we have seen is continued strength in the retail business, some recent increase in our Jennie-O foodservice business.

We expect these these prices for the full year to run in the mid-1.40s, somewhere in that range, which is above last year's levels. 
One of the other things that you're seeing, though, is that you're going to have some probably pressure taken off of certain markets. Trim markets are in the 90s right now, and I still think that's a component of the fact that there's not enough labor to do the boning.

As we approach the 1-year mark of the pandemic, I want to express my gratitude to our plant professionals for their continued dedication, energy and focus. They continue to be the true heroes of our company during this time.
On our last earnings call in November, we were witnessing an increase of COVID-19 cases in the United States. Our #1 priority has been to keep our team members safe, and we have been very focused on our best-in-class preventative measures and on educating our employees through our awareness campaign KEEP COVID OUT! As the pandemic evolves and the vaccine becomes more widely available to our team members, we'll continue to keep the health and safety of our team members as the top priority.
We were among the first to offer a COVID pay program to allow those who were ill or had symptoms to stay home from work and still be paid. Additionally, we paid $11 million in fiscal 2020 in unconditional bonuses to our team members to provide further financial security. Our program has resulted in minimizing the spread of COVID in our workplaces and our communities. Recently, we've been encouraged to see cases decline, and the number of team members on our COVID pay program drastically decreased. This gives us increased optimism as we head into the second quarter.
We are pleased to announce the entry into a definitive agreement to acquire the Planters business last Thursday. We have many leading brands at Hormel, and the acquisition of the Planters snack nut business will be an excellent addition to our company.
Over the past 10 years, we've made numerous acquisitions, all of which are meeting our strategic objectives. The performances of MegaMex, Wholly, SKIPPY, Applegate, Justin's, Ceratti, Fontanini, Columbus and Sadler's give us a high level of confidence in our ability to successfully integrate, operate and grow the Planters business.
The acquisition of Planters is the perfect strategic fit. The addition of this iconic, branded, high-margin business continues our evolution as a global branded food company, moving us further away from a commodity-oriented, meat-centric company. As one of our biggest brands, we will give it a high level of focus and attention. Our core competency and brand stewardship will be key to our success in unlocking the power of the Planters brand. We know how to manage brands, and Planters is right in our sweet spot as we know Planters is more than simply peanuts in a jar.
Planters also perfectly complements, enhances and expands our existing snacking business, joining brands like Hormel Gatherings, Columbus, Wholly and Herdez. There are numerous opportunities to leverage the consumer insights from both portfolios to drive further innovation and improve growth for our entire snacking business. The Planters business gives us another iconic brand to grow and increases our scale in key areas such as center store and convenience stores. Integration into our direct sales force is a high priority, and we know there are immediate opportunities to improve distribution and drive sales growth.
Another priority for us is to integrate the business into our One Supply Chain and Project Orion platforms. We expect synergies from this integration for the Planters business and for our existing business. There's a lot to love about this acquisition, and I'm excited for the transaction to close so we can begin to give the Planters business the attention and focus it needs to grow.
Now turning to our first quarter. Our team generated strong top line growth, with sales increasing 3% to a record $2.5 billion. All 4 segments delivered sales growth, an achievement that hasn't been accomplished since 2016. Incremental supply chain costs related to COVID-19 of $15 million were the primary reason for a $13 million decline in pretax earnings. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share declined 9% due primarily to incremental supply chain costs and higher tax expense.
As in prior quarters, we continue to strike a balance between the consumer demand we are seeing and our supply chain's ability to meet that demand. We increased production levels this quarter through a combination of improving efficiencies, bringing on new capacity and further leveraging our strategic supply chain partners. We expect this steady improvement to continue throughout the year. We have been successful in a number of critical categories, and we will continue to make progress across the portfolio.
Our retail business continued to perform extremely well, with sales increasing 13% for the quarter. Brands such as SPAM, SKIPPY, Hormel chili, Hormel Black Label, Applegate, Hormel pepperoni, Lloyd's, Hormel fully cooked entrees and Justin's all delivered very strong growth.
Most encouraging was the sales growth we saw from the Jennie-O brand. Every major retail category, including Jennie-O lean ground turkey burgers, oven-ready items, bacon and marinated meats, grew. The Jennie-O brand continues to resonate with consumers, and the efforts we have made on gaining back customer distribution are paying off.
Our e-commerce business continues to be a bright spot as it almost doubled in the last 12 weeks according to IRI. We grew share in several key categories and have a high level of momentum in online grocery pickup, delivery and direct-to-consumer.
Our deli channel sales increased 7% this quarter. Columbus-branded products led the way with exceptional growth from grab-and-go items. The opening of our new plant in Omaha this quarter, which produces Columbus charcuterie products, will provide much-needed capacity for this business. While the Columbus brand was the clear leader for us this quarter in the deli, our team generated growth in every deli segment they compete in, including grab-and-go, prepared foods, behind-the-glass and fresh sliced deli meats.
Our Party Tray business also grew volume and sales over the holiday season despite fewer group gatherings, a testament to our team's ability to keep this brand relevant. We saw positive signs of recovery in foodservice this quarter, even as the business declined 17% compared to last year due to the continued impacts of the pandemic on the industry. We continue to see strength in our business within important segments such as pizzerias, QSRs and convenience stores. Our direct sales force also made excellent progress pivoting to high-growth areas such as commissaries and ghost kitchens as they secured new distribution with both distributors and operators.
Turning to the segments. Grocery Products delivered very impressive results this quarter. We saw top line strength across many of our brands, including SPAM, SKIPPY, Hormel Compleats and Herdez, which led to volume increases of 4% and sales increases of 7%.
We implemented a price increase for our SKIPPY business this quarter, once again demonstrating our ability to price in our categories. We are also encouraged with the performance of our recent innovative new items, including SKIPPY Squeeze, Skippy No Sugar and SKIPPY with added protein spreads.
Our MegaMex joint venture had a strong performance this quarter as well, with equity and earnings increasing by 31%. This growth was led by our retail brands such as Wholly, Herdez, CHI-CHI'S and La Victoria. In addition to the MegaMex results, the 35% increase in segment profit was driven by higher sales and a favorable mix.
Refrigerated Foods volume declined 2%, and sales increased 1%. Our retail and deli teams overcame steep year-over-year declines in our foodservice business to deliver growth for our value-added business.
Applegate had a particularly strong quarter, with growth fueled by both category momentum and share gains across core categories such as frozen breaded chicken, breakfast sausage, bacon and hotdogs. I continue to be optimistic about the momentum we are building in the Applegate business.
We also delivered excellent results in our Hormel pepperoni business, both in foodservice and retail. Our teams continue to optimize the brand by focusing on our core products in the category and simultaneously leaning into our new Cup N' Crisp innovation. We plan to maintain our advertising efforts for Hormel pepperoni to ensure we retain the households we gained during the initial pandemic buying.
Refrigerated Foods segment profit declined by 16% due to lower foodservice sales, a significant decline in commodity profitability and increased supply chain expenses due to COVID-19. Profitability was also impacted by onetime start-up expenses related to our new plant in Omaha.
Jennie-O volume decreased 2%, and sales increased 1%. We saw exceptionally strong retail and whole bird sales, which overcame significant declines in foodservice and commodity. Our retail business grew double digits this quarter, with growth coming from almost every category in which we compete. We have taken price increases across our portfolio and expect those to be effective late in the second quarter. Whole bird volumes increased by strong double digits due to a very positive holiday season.
Our foodservice business was impacted by lower K-12 and college and university business in addition to continued weakness in the foodservice industry. Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit declined 30%. Lower foodservice sales increased supply chain cost related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher freight expenses were key drivers to the lower profitability.
Grain prices increased significantly during the quarter but only had a modest effect on earnings. We expect the primary impact of higher grain prices to affect the coming quarters. In addition to pricing action, we have taken additional actions to manage higher corn and soybean meal costs.
International volume decreased 5%. Sales increased 13%, and segment profit increased 61%. Once again, the strong sales and earnings performance was led by our retail and foodservice business in China. SPAM, SKIPPY and Beef Jerky were all key drivers to growth in China. We remain very positive about the short- and long-term prospects of our China business. We also saw strong branded exports for brands like SKIPPY and SPAM. Similar to prior quarters, our affiliated businesses in the Philippines, South Korea and Europe continue to show high levels of growth.
Looking to the balance of the year. I am increasingly optimistic about delivering sales and earnings growth. As such, we are establishing fiscal 2021 guidance for the full year at $1.70 to $1.82 per share. As a reminder, this guidance range does not include the impact of the acquisition of Planters.
Similar to prior quarters, we believe there are 3 key drivers to our near-term and long-term performance: retail dynamics, the recovery in the foodservice industry and the performance of our supply chain. Our retail, deli and international teams need to maintain their momentum and outperform their respective categories. Our brands continue to gain new households, and our repeat rates remain very strong. The depth of repeat, those consumers purchasing our brands multiple times, is incredibly positive, with almost all new buyers for our brands making 2-or-more repeat purchases during the first quarter. As a whole, our brands continue to make household penetration gains with brands like Herdez, La Victoria and Columbus increasing household penetration by 20%. 
For the foodservice channel, we are optimistic about a foodservice recovery and confident in our ability to gain share during the recovery. During the pandemic, operators have been looking for products to simplify their food preparation, save time and minimize labor, all while preserving the flexibility to add their own unique touch to a menu item. Our direct sales force continues to meet their needs with products like Hormel Fire Braised meats, Sadler's authentic smoked barbecue and Hormel Bacon 1.
The recent trends we are seeing in our foodservice businesses are positive. We have been able to react quickly to increased demand as cities and states have eased dining restrictions, allowing patrons to return to their favorite restaurants. We also anticipate our noncommercial business such as K-12 schools, colleges and universities and health care to recover as the pandemic subsides.
The most encouraging signs we are seeing are in our supply chain. We made excellent progress on increasing capacity to meet the high levels of demand from our customers. Steady week-over-week improvements, lower levels of absenteeism, new capacity and a continued vaccine rollout are all reasons we have a positive outlook.
Our supply chain team hit 2 major milestones this quarter with the opening of our new dry sausage production facility in Omaha, Nebraska and the opening of our pizza toppings expansion at Burke. Both projects were on time and on budget, which is truly amazing considering both projects were constructed primarily during the pandemic.
Our plant teams have made progress on labor availability and in almost every location, our labor situation has improved. We expect that trend to continue into the second quarter and beyond as the vaccine becomes widely available for our team members. We now have a higher level of visibility into the coming quarters and remain confident in our team's ability to deliver our sales and earnings guidance this year.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter, give an update on our financial position and provide commentary regarding key input cost markets."

Record sales for the first quarter were $2.5 billion, an increase of 3%. COVID-related direct expenses of $15 million were the primary driver to pretax earnings declining $13 million or 5%. Absent the COVID expenses, pretax e",1072,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Record sales for the first quarter were $2.5 billion, an increase of 3%. COVID-related direct expenses of $15 million were the primary driver to pretax earnings declining $13 million or 5%. Absent the COVID expenses, pretax earnings would have increased. Total COVID expenses have started to decline from the prior quarterly run rate of $20 million. This was driven by higher volumes through our production facilities and improved efficiencies in our logistics network.
Earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.41 compared to $0.45 last year. On an after-tax basis, first quarter results reflected approximately $0.04 per share in incremental COVID-related costs and higher tax expense. SG&A excluding advertising was 6.6% of sales, down slightly compared to the prior year. Advertising spend for the quarter was $34 million compared to $35 million last year. We continue to invest in our leading brands, including SPAM, SKIPPY, Hormel pepperoni, Black Label and Jennie-O.
Operating margins for the quarter were 10.9% compared to 11.8% last year. The decline was driven by COVID-related expenses and the continued impact from lower foodservice earnings. Unallocated expenses included deferred compensation, expenses related to tax settlement and deal fees.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%. Last year's rate of 16.3% was affected by the large volume of stock options exercised in the quarter. Excluding the impact from the Planters acquisition, we expect the full year tax rate to be between 20% and 21.5%. Cash from operations was $206 million during the quarter, a 9% increase.
Even with record sales, inventory levels continue to gradually improve throughout the quarter due to improvements in operations, labor availability, internal capacity expansions and increased use of strategic manufacturing partners. We expect inventories to continue to build throughout the second quarter. There is a risk for inflationary pressure on freight expense, both domestically and internationally. However, we expect improved efficiency factors to offset some of the higher freight costs.
We paid our 370th consecutive quarterly dividend effective February 16 at an annual rate of $0.98, a 5% increase over the prior year. During the quarter, the company repurchased 200,000 shares for $9 million.
Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter. We opened the pizza topping expansion of Burke and the new dry sausage facility in Omaha. Work is also underway to expand our pepperoni capacity. The company's target for capital expenditures in 2021 is $260 million.
Last Thursday, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire the Planters snack nut portfolio for an effective purchase price of $2.79 billion. The transaction was structured as an asset purchase and included a $560 million tax benefit. The adjusted 2020 EBITDA multiple on the effective purchase price of $2.79 billion was 12.5x.
This acquisition is financially attractive. Our disciplined approach to valuation allowed us to secure a leading brand at a multiple below the industry average, take advantage of historically low rates, increase our company sales by 10%, improve the profitability of the portfolio with accretive margins and responsibly leverage our balance sheet.
We expect to finance the transaction with cash on hand and a combination of long-term and short-term debt. We will be able to borrow the funds at approximately 1.5% and expect to be able to significantly deleverage the debt in 18 to 24 months. We are targeting a 1.5x leverage by 2023 and are very focused on retaining a strong investment-grade rating. The cash flows from our existing business, along with Planters, allows us to maintain our long-term capital allocation strategy. We will continue to prioritize returning cash to shareholders in the form of annual dividend growth.
Industry operating efficiencies, labor availability and production levels continued to improve during the first quarter, driving less volatility in the hog market compared to the back half of 2020. Hog weights are currently at historically high levels, which have led to balanced market conditions. In 2021, the USDA is projecting pork production to increase 1%.
With an expected recovery in the foodservice industry and higher grain prices for the balance of the year, we anticipate hog cost to increase. Our balanced mix of hog and pork supply contracts will help us manage the risk of higher prices. The USDA composite cutout was in line with last year during the first quarter. Recently, we have seen strength in the cutout, supported by strong demand for pork domestically and internationally.
We continue to monitor export demand and ASF in China, Southeast Asia and Europe. ASF continues to be a risk in the pork industry. We have seen the disease could be successfully managed in areas with modern agricultural practices.
We expect higher prices for pork with less volatility than last year. The strength of our brands and balanced approach to procurement continue to be a competitive advantage.
Pork trim markets are expected to remain higher during the second quarter of 2021 and decline in the back half as labor availability and processing plants improves. Beef trim prices are expected to be lower in 2021. We anticipate belly prices to be volatile in the near term driven by strong demand and foodservice industry growth.
Strong Chinese demand and drought conditions in South America continue to generate higher grain prices, which is expected to negatively impact Jennie-O Turkey Store. Like the pork industry, we are closely watching the fundamentals for grain. The primary factor we are watching are global demand, planting intentions for the coming season and weather conditions in South America.
We manage freight costs through a combination of spot buying, derivatives and adjusting feed formulas. Additionally, we have announced pricing action across all Jennie-O products to protect our profitability. We are prepared to take additional actions as conditions change.
Fundamentals in the turkey industry remain mixed. Egg sets, poult placements and cold storage are below year ago levels, while prices for commodity breast and thigh meat remain depressed. Poult placements have been declining recently, which will likely lead to lower levels of supply. Because the foodservice industry is a key outlet for breast meat, as the foodservice industry recovers, breast meat pricing is expected to improve.
We are finalizing the implementation plans for the Planters business. We will have the HR and payroll functions integrated by the closing date. The finance and supply chain will be fully implemented within 1 year of closing.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Obviously, the rationale that we have in terms of what's happened in the grain market supports very strong underlying support. So the team has done a nice job there.
And as we go forward, the idea of elasticity with pricing is something that has been difficult to measure given the pandemic. What we do know is we've continued to see exceptional demand for the Jennie-O Turkey Store retail products. So yes, we remain very optimistic on the success that this business can have for the balance of the year."

And we have the ability to change the formula. So as you can imagine, we're moving the formula to more of a soybean meal-based formula, away from corn. That will offset a portion of the cost. So really, there's multiple approaches we've taken to mitigate the risk around these increases. Jim talked about a very effective approach on price increases, along with the shifting of the feed formula and the positions that we've taken. And we took these positions probably 6 -- more than 6 months ago."

Ben, I'll go ahead and start on the freight costs, and I'll let Jim finish with Project Orion. But one of the things that we have been challenged with is -- our supply chain has battled over last year and early this year is that we've had a number of inefficiencies in terms of how we're -- how we've been able to ship trucks. And so because of that, we've had some higher freight costs and haven't had the opportunity to optimize our loads like we typically do. So we have seen some higher freight costs.
And while there are expectations that freight rates will increase, we see a pretty significant opportunity for us to be able to offset a good portion of those as our supply chain continues to pick up momentum and we're able to fill trucks in a more optimized manner. 
So yes, there'll be some flip freight inflation. But again, we think there's going to be a really good opportunity for us to offset that with some internal efficiencies."

I think the other thing that we talked about last week was the items that you just mentioned. I mean those were at the top of our list in the due diligence process. And our team did a phenomenal job, not just identifying those risks, but really putting together an action plan for when we do own the business, how we can offset that.
When we think about private label, when we -- across our existing categories, private label shares can range across the board. And right now, what we're seeing is the average center store range is about 20%. And the Planters brand, as they face private label, they're seeing about the same percentage of private label. And again, that's across the board. There's different subcategories. So the idea of a private label being a risk, a threat, a competitor, not new to us at all. So obviously, we're prepared to manage our business accordingly.
From a gross margin perspective, I think what we had talked about last week was probably a little lower down in terms of profitability. But without giving too many specifics, it's safe to say that Planters' gross margins are -- they're well above our total company average, and they're also above our Grocery Products average.
So -- and then the other thing, just in terms of the category, we know how to manage brands. We've said that multiple times. And so when we think about commodities and pricing and price elasticities, this brand is very similar to all of our other large brands. So again, not new to us. We know how to manage it.
And when you roll all those things up, from our perspective, this business is not a commodity business. I would go so far to say, again, from our perspective, we know a commodity business when we see one. And this is not a commodity business. So hopefully, that's helpful."

So there's a lot of give and take for the remaining 3 quarters. As we've laid out the business with our business units and reviewed how we think the business is going to flow, I mean, it's their optimism that obviously fuels my optimism and then also the results that we're seeing in the supply chain.

So as we look at it from a financial standpoint, the first area that we should talk about is foodservice. We've seen some very interesting trends in the last, let's say, few weeks on foodservice. And we have idle capacity in foodservice. So we have no problem filling that foodservice need. So any growth in the foodservice category is unrestrained and a great opportunity for us is that business, we're confident, is going to continue to improve.
In the Grocery Products category, we talked about a tremendous Q2 that we had. But Q3 and Q4, I think it's safe to say, were crippled by supply chain challenges that really are not existing anymore. The availability of labor is much better than it was last year. And so that's going to be able to allow us to grow Grocery Products in the back half of the year.
Jim talked about Refrigerated Foods, how we've had some constraints in the pepperoni business and that we have additional capacity that's come online there, and we're doing a very nice job of recovering the pepperoni business and actually seeing some very significant growth in pepperoni in the foodservice category.
So I think it's hard to underestimate how much of an impact the constraint had in 2020 and the opportunity that we have in 2021. And one of the other things that we haven't talked a lot about is that during this time of constraint, we've found some very significant efficiencies in our operations that have helped us produce product even in a difficult time period. Now as we increase it, we'll be able to take those efficiencies and actually drive cost issues and efficiency issues throughout the operations."

Eric, I mean, I don't know and wouldn't want to comment on what some of our competitors might do. From our perspective, we feel really good about the work that we've done leading into the pandemic, if you go back to some of the stumbles we had. But then the effort and the strategic focus on growing distribution in lean ground turkey right before the pandemic hit, I believe that a lot of the success we've had on the retail side is directly attributed to that expanded distribution that the team was able to achieve.
In terms of what inventories look like, I mean, clearly, a lot of breast meat. Turkey breast meat is used in the foodservice industry. And so that collapse has had a dramatic impact. And obviously, there are implications to that across the entire industry. What we have seen is continued strength in the retail business, some recent increase in our Jennie-O foodservice business. And so we believe that there's a lot to be positive about with our Jennie-O Turkey Store business heading forward."

So if you take the bellies, bellies are up 1 95 right now. They have been running in the one -- mid-1 30 range. I think that's an indication that there is some recovery in the foodservice, that there is an expectation that, that demand is going to pick up. We expect these prices for the full year to run in the mid-1 40s, somewhere in that range, which is above last year's levels.
One of the other things that you're seeing, though, is that you're going to have some probably pressure taken off of certain markets. Trim markets are in the 90s right now, and I still think that's a component of the fact that there's not enough labor to do the boning. As labor returns into these facilities, those prices are going to go down. That's just a labor issue.
So we think the bellies are going to be volatile as we go through. And demand is going to have -- be impacted by the foodservice recovery."

But we also do expect to see our retail business, whether it's Grocery Products or our Refrigerated Foods retail businesses, still provide some growth.

The rate and the scale at which that happens is really going to have a big impact on that outlook."

Once again this quarter, I want to recognize the heroic work of our production team members. This team deserves much of the credit for our record sales results this quarter as they continued working to produce safe, high-quality food for millions of consumers and customers. Our #1 priority has been to keep our team members safe And our cross-functional COVID-19 leadership team is ensuring we are on the leading edge of the country's vaccination efforts. To date, We have fully vaccinated over 51% of our domestic workforce, which is well ahead of the country's vaccination rate. We are encouraged by the rapid decline in cases in our communities. 
From a top line perspective, our balanced business model has again proven to be a winning formula as our team delivered record sales for the second quarter and first half. In total, sales for the quarter increased 8% compared to last year, and sales increased over 5% for the first half of the year. A key driver of our sales performance is the rebound in our foodservice business. As expected, our foodservice team experienced a strong recovery and took numerous actions to properly position our organization to capitalize on the industry recovery. 
For the quarter, foodservice sales increased 28%. This reflects an increase of 1% over 2019 prepandemic levels. This is a significant accomplishment especially knowing where the industry was just a few short months ago. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, our foodservice teams have been doing their part to support the industry. Within days of the crisis, we worked closely with our distributor and operator partners to assist their businesses in many different ways, whether it was a rebate program to offset food costs, extending payment leniency helping adjust to the new takeout delivery and pickup environment or simply being available to personally check in with a restauranteur to see how they are doing. 
Our confidence in the industry recovery never wavered. We know these actions benefited our distributor and operator partners and are playing a part in our outperformance of the broader industry trends. 
During this difficult labor environment, our experienced and tenured direct sales force is helping operators meet their accelerating demand with products that simplify their food preparation, save time and minimize labor, all while preserving the flexibility to add their own unique touch to a menu item. 
Products like Hormel Fire Braised meats, Sadler's authentic smoked barbecue, Fontanini, authentic Italian meats, Hormel Bacon 1, Fully Cooked Bacon, holy Guacamole and Jennie, Turkey are uniquely positioned to meet this need. The brightest spot in our foodservice portfolio has been our pizza toppings business. Prior to the pandemic, we capitalized on the continued growth in this category, especially for premium products and invested heavily in capacity to meet future demand. 
We've also been investing in plant-based offerings and are seeing growth from our plant-based pepperoni and crumbles products. We're excited to leverage our expertise in the pizza toppings category to drive growth in plant-based toppings. With our new capacity expansion at and with additional pepperoni capacity set to open at the beginning of fiscal 2022, we are set up nicely to meet the consistent growth we have seen in this space. 
With the foodservice industry recovery well underway, we will continue to strengthen our relationships with our valued partners invest in our direct sales team and support the industry's return to growth with innovative, convenience and flavorful product solutions. 
In addition to foodservice growth, our retail and deli businesses also remained healthy with demand elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. Total retail sales this quarter were flat to last year as we lapped the months when consumers were stocking their pantries in anticipation of the pandemic. 
Sales finished up 16% compared to the second quarter of 2019, and we continue to see strength from our leading brands such as SPAM, Applegate, Jennie-O, Black Label, Herdez and Wholly. As a reminder, we experienced an immediate and sustained demand surge for our shelf-stable products in the Grocery Products segment at the onset of the pandemic. The second wave of demand that impacted our perishable and refrigerated items happened weeks later in the third fiscal quarter. 
Sales in the deli channel increased 4% this quarter and are up 9% over prepandemic levels. Hormel Gatherings party trays delivered strong growth as consumers started to spend more time with family and friends and consequently, are purchasing more products to entertain their guests. The Columbus brand remains a cornerstone for our deli business and is now benefiting from the opening of our new plant in Omaha, which is providing much-needed capacity. 
Columbus is a leader in charcuterie and we now have the capacity to continue expanding distribution. Across the retail and deli space, our consumer takeaway metrics continue to be positive according to IRI. Many of our brands have made large gains in household penetration Overall buy rates are improving, and we are seeing an expansion in cross purchasing across our brands. E-commerce sales grew double digits in the last 12 weeks according to IRI and and we are gaining share in important categories. 
We will continue to increase our investment in this important channel. Throughout the quarter, Our supply chain continued to improve as we were able to increase production levels through a combination of gaining efficiencies, increasing capacities and leveraging our strategic supply chain partners. 
Another area we have made great strides is in our distribution network. Over the last year, we have opened a new grocery product distribution center and in recent weeks, have opened a refrigerated distribution center serving the West Coast. These strategic investments will reduce overall freight miles and cost, improve our customer service levels, support growth for our value-added businesses and reduce greenhouse emissions. 
From a bottom line perspective, operating income showed a slight decline. We saw raw material and feed prices rapidly increase throughout the quarter. We have taken pricing actions in many categories but did not see the full benefit of these actions during the quarter. As we have previously discussed, in volatile market conditions, pricing will lag the markets, which will shift profits to subsequent quarters. 
Net earnings and diluted earnings per share were flat to last year. A higher tax rate negatively impacted earnings by $0.01 per share compared to last year. 
Turning to the segments. Refrigerated Foods volume increased 3% and sales increased 17%, with growth coming from almost every division. Value-added sales increased 18%, driven by a significant recovery in the foodservice businesses. As anticipated, we saw a rapid increase in foodservice demand as the quarter progressed. Almost all categories within foodservice grew sales, led by our pizza toppings portfolio and brands such as Fontanini and Bacon 1. In fact, pepperoni, pizza toppings, Bacon 1 and Fontanini authentic Italian meats all showed growth compared to the second quarter of 2019. 
We also experienced a recovery in the premium breakfast portfolio with growth from our Old Smokehouse brand. Additionally, we saw excellent growth from our premium prepared proteins, which include brands such as Austin Blues, Fire Braised, Cafe H and Sadler. These items are key to our pre strategy. Items that are premarinated, precooked, presliced and fully prepared. As the industry recovery accelerates into the summer, and labor remains the predominant challenge for most operators, our line of products offer convenient, safe, versatile and flavorful solutions. 
Our retail and deli teams delivered a strong quarter on the top line with growth coming from products such as Black Label Bacon, Hormel Gatherings, Applegate, Lloyd's Barbecue, Hormel Pepperoni and Columbus prepared food items. Refrigerated Foods segment profit increased 32% due to higher foodservice sales, higher retail fresh pork profitability and decreased operational expenses due to abating COVID-19 cost pressures. 
International delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of record earnings growth, with sales increasing 17% and segment profit increasing 6%. The performance of the team in China remains impressive. Foodservice volumes have recovered to pre-pandemic levels driven by growth from SKIPPY, pizza toppings and Bacon items. 
Retail demand for the SPAM and SKIPPY brands has also been outstanding. The company's innovative offerings, including beef jerky, SKIPPY snacking items and 2 new SPAM varieties are providing additional avenues for growth, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects for our China business. 
Branded exports also grew with growth coming from the SKIPPY and SPAM brands, higher foodservice sales and improved margins on fresh pork items. In addition, our partners in the Philippines, South Korea and Europe continued to experience elevated demand for shelf-stable products. 
Grocery Products results were strong given the difficult comparison to last year due to the extremely high levels of demand experienced at the onset of the pandemic. Even though volume declined 14%, sales declined 8% and segment profit declined 23%. 
We are encouraged by the segment's performance as we have seen sustained consumer demand for many of our brands compared to pre-pandemic levels. Sales for center store brands such as SPAM, Hormel Chili, Completes and Mary Kitchen hash were all over 20% higher compared to our second quarter of 2019. We will continue to support our leading brands, including Skippy, SPAM, Completes, Aires, Holy, Justin's and Hormel Chile. And we're resuming promotional activity as inventory levels normalize. 
Our MegaMex joint venture performed well as equity and earnings increased 26%. Both the Herdez and Wholly brands grew as consumers looked for authentic and convenient Mexican products to enhance their at-home eating occasions. The Herdez brand continues to outperform the salsa category. This brand has grown households by 3 million since the start of the pandemic and has introduced industry-leading innovation to the marketplace in recent years. 
Following the highly successful performance of Herdez Guacamole Salsa, we continue to expand distribution and grow share with 2 new product lines: Herdez Taqueria Street Sauces and Herdez Salsa Cremosa. Recently, Herdez also entered the hot sauce market with the introduction of Herdez Avocado Hot Sauce, another versatile offering that can enhance any meal. 
The Wholly brand had a strong quarter as well as it continues to target consumers looking for convenient solutions to enjoy avocado offerings. Our recent innovations including Wholly smashed and Wholly diced avocado products solved for that consumer need. And as we saw across many of our refrigerated foodservice businesses, demand for avocado products in the channel started to return during the quarter. 
Jennie-O volume decreased 3% and sales increased 2%. A recovery in the foodservice business and higher whole bird sales drove the sales increase. Foodservice volumes were up double digits compared to last year. Demand for Jennie-O retail products such as lean ground turkey remained above pre-pandemic levels. 
Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit declined 54% due to the impact from higher feed costs. Grain prices continued to increase significantly during the quarter, while pricing action had yet to be fully reflected in the marketplace. Jim Sheehan will provide further commentary on the actions we have taken to manage higher corn and soybean meal costs. 
Looking to the balance of the year, we are increasing our full year sales guidance range to $10.2 billion to $10.8 billion and reaffirming our earnings per share guidance range of $1.70 to $1.82 per share. As a reminder, this guidance range does not include the estimated impact of the pending acquisition of the Planters snack nuts business. Our diversified and balanced business model gives us confidence we can perform well in many different economic scenarios and market conditions. 
We have a very positive outlook on the foodservice business as we head into the second half of the year. We are well positioned from an inventory and capacity standpoint to meet the demand from our distributor partners and operators and are confident in our ability to gain share throughout the recovery. Additionally, we are increasingly confident that K-12 schools and colleges and universities will open and operate in a more traditional manner this fall. This should benefit both Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store. 
We continue to see elevated demand in the retail, deli and international channels. We expect to further benefit from pricing actions, increased capacities on key product lines and continued improvements in our supply chain. This year, we have seen rapid increases in key input costs across our businesses. And we expect to operate in a high-cost environment for the remainder of the year. 
Our experienced management team has a proven ability to navigate and grow our business in volatile and inflationary market conditions. And once again, we will be leveraging our direct sales force to partner with our customers to mutually grow our businesses. As a reminder, our operations were heavily impacted by plant shutdowns, supply shortages and lower production throughput caused by the effects of the pandemic in the back half of fiscal 2020. This ultimately led to lower levels of inventory, which negatively affected the third and fourth quarters. For the strategic actions we have taken to improve all facets of our operations and based on our record first half performance, we expect to benefit from more normalized operations in the back half of fiscal 2021. 
I am confident in our ability to continue growing, and I'm looking forward to closing the acquisition of Planters next month. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter, give an update on our financial position and provide commentary regarding key input cost markets."

First half sales increased 5% to $5.1 billion, also a record. Pretax earnings increased 2% for the quarter compared to last year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.42 per share, flat to last year. 
Second quarter results reflected approximately $0.01 per share in incremental COVID-related costs and $0.01 in higher tax expense. SG&A, excluding advertising, was 6.5% of sales, down slightly to last year. Advertising spend for the quarter was $31 million. Operating margins for the quarter were 11.1% compared to 12.1% last year. 
Higher raw material and feed costs negatively impacted margins as pricing lagged input cost increases. We have taken numerous pricing actions across the portfolio to protect profitability. The actions will take place early in the third quarter with additional pricing actions likely. COVID-related expenses were $6 million. The impact of COVID expenses continued to decline. 
Net unallocated expenses decreased due to higher investment income. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.1% compared to 20.6% last year. Excluding the impact from the Planters acquisition, we estimate the full year tax rate to be between 20% and 21.5%. 
We built inventory during the quarter in preparation for higher demand and to support continued growth for the remainder of the year. Our strategic action to build inventory was the primary driver of lower operating cash flow during the quarter. We paid our 371st consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 17, at an annual rate of $0.98, a 5% increase over the prior year. Share repurchases were minimal during the quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $45 million in the quarter. The company's target for capital expenditures in 2021 is $260 million. During the second quarter, we saw dramatic increases in pork and hog prices. USDA composite cutout prices since January have increased more than $30 with all [indiscernible] contributing to the increase. 
Key inputs such as bellies and trim increased 57% and 76%, respectively, during the quarter. Pork exports also set an all-time record in March due to African swine fever outbreaks in China, Southeast Asia and Europe. We anticipate strength in pork markets due to continued export demand and a food service recovery domestically. USDA is now projecting pork production for the year to be slightly lower than 2020. 
Industry operating efficiencies are expected to improve as COVID pressures abate. However, labor availability, tighter hog supplies and reductions in [indiscernible] support higher markets. Our balanced approach to hog and pork procurement mitigated cost volatility during the quarter. 
In high-cost and volatile environments, the strength of our leading brands and balanced approach to procurement continues to be a competitive advantage. The guidance range assumes elevated and volatile market conditions for the balance of the year with some moderation heading into the fall. 
We expect hog prices in the USDA composite cutout to remain well above year-ago levels due to strong domestic and export demand along with tighter hog supplies. We anticipate prices to peak during the summer and gradually decline in the fall, consistent with the seasonal increase in harvest. 
Belly prices are projected to remain higher than last year in historical averages. We anticipate markets to stabilize near the current levels, but volatility due to low cold storage levels and strong demand in the foodservice channel could cause inflationary pressure. 
Pork trim prices are expected to moderate from the current levels, but labor shortages across the industry remains a key risk to trim prices as limited boning capacity directly impacts trim supply and pricing. Due to the higher beef harvest levels in the several months, beef prices are anticipated to be lower in the back half of 2021. 
In response to global supply and demand imbalances in corn and soybean deal, we have taken strategic hedges to fully cover grain costs for the remainder of the year. The physicians also provide a benefit if markets decline. These hedges, coupled with the previously announced pricing actions, are expected to protect Jennie-O's profitability. 
Turkey pulp placements and egg sales have declined. Inventory levels are lower compared to last year. The tightening of supply has led to higher whole turkey and meat markets. We have also recently seen an increase in breast meat prices. A recovery in the foodservice industry remains the key driver for higher prices for the support market. 
We anticipate inflationary pressure on freight in the back half of the year. The tactical action to optimize our distribution network with 2 new DCs, combined with improvements in loan efficiencies will help mitigate a portion of the increase. We have attained the required regulatory approvals for the acquisition of the Planters snack nut business. The scheduled close date is in June. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

So we've got a lot of activity on that front. And so just the sequential action in our pricing, is what will lead to that sequential improvement in margins. And so as you think about Q3, you'll see improvement, but probably some slightly lower margins as pricing hasn't quite caught up. Q4 really start to see more normalized margins as full pricing takes effect across the board.

The other thing is that we talk about is what's happening in the markets. When you think about Jennie-O, the fundamentals, which we keep pointing towards over the last few years are better. Hog sets and our egg sets and fold placements are both down 3% to 4%. And you're starting to see that with the cold storage levels continue to be at 26% below -- 26% below the 5-year average. What you're starting to see now is some nice improvements in the commodity markets around Turkey. For instance, yesterday, you saw breast meat at $2.11. The -- there are a lot of watchouts on JOTS, but there's also a fair amount of upside and we're starting to see that upside come through. We've watched these -- the fundamentals point towards better markets for probably a year now. They really haven't taken place but they do seem to be taking place as we go forward. As far as the 9%, yes, these -- the drastic jump up in grain costs obviously delay that. So we look at the full year margin of 9%, that's really been pushed out."

And we have spent a lot of time and effort over the last 3-plus years, putting together our One Supply Chain. And it's really been our initiative to take this fragmented approach throughout the supply chain and really capitalize on the efficiencies and take cost out. And so we've done a lot of great work in our operations, in our logistics, as we mentioned, our -- some of the warehousing initiatives that we still had going on. And you're right, the probably the first 2 years of supply chain and even going into the pre-pandemic, we talked about our ability to have cost savings of $75 million. Last year, obviously, was a bit of a disruption, but that didn't stop the good work that was happening behind the scenes. And I think you see that play through when we talk about our ability to open up new warehouses to help mitigate some of the cost pressure on GP and now on our refrigerated portfolio. So -- and the other thing is for me personally, I can't imagine us having gone through the pandemic with a fragmented supply chain, having one voice from the top, setting direction and making sure that the entire team was aligned was very, very powerful and necessary for the organization. So I mean the benefits to the organization have far outweighed the financial returns. And we are in a significantly better place today as a result of our efforts on One Supply Chain."

Once again this quarter, I want to recognize the heroic work of our production team members. This team deserves much of the credit for our record sales results this quarter as they continued working to produce safe, high-quality food for millions of consumers and customers. Our #1 priority has been to keep our team members safe And our cross-functional COVID-19 leadership team is ensuring we are on the leading edge of the country's vaccination efforts. To date, we have fully vaccinated over 51% of our domestic workforce, which is well ahead of the country's vaccination rate. We are encouraged by the rapid decline in cases in our communities. 
From a top line perspective, our balanced business model has again proven to be a winning formula as our team delivered record sales for the second quarter and first half. In total, sales for the quarter increased 8% compared to last year, and sales increased over 5% for the first half of the year. A key driver of our sales performance is the rebound in our foodservice business. As expected, our foodservice team experienced a strong recovery and took numerous actions to properly position our organization to capitalize on the industry recovery. 
For the quarter, foodservice sales increased 28%. This reflects an increase of 1% over 2019 prepandemic levels. This is a significant accomplishment especially knowing where the industry was just a few short months ago. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, our foodservice teams have been doing their part to support the industry. Within days of the crisis, we worked closely with our distributor and operator partners to assist their businesses in many different ways, whether it was a rebate program to offset food costs, extending payment leniency, helping adjust to the new takeout delivery and pickup environment or simply being available to personally check in with a restauranteur to see how they are doing. 
Our confidence in the industry recovery never wavered. We know these actions benefited our distributor and operator partners and are playing a part in our outperformance of the broader industry trends. 
During this difficult labor environment, our experienced and tenured direct sales force is helping operators meet their accelerating demand with products that simplify their food preparation, save time and minimize labor, all while preserving the flexibility to add their own unique touch to a menu item. 
Products like Hormel Fire Braised meats, Sadler's authentic smoked barbecue, Fontanini, authentic Italian meats, Hormel Bacon 1, Fully Cooked Bacon, holy Guacamole and Jennie-O Turkey are uniquely positioned to meet this need. The brightest spot in our foodservice portfolio has been our pizza toppings business. Prior to the pandemic, we capitalized on the continued growth in this category, especially for premium products and invested heavily in capacity to meet future demand. 
We've also been investing in plant-based offerings and are seeing growth from our plant-based pepperoni and crumbles products. We're excited to leverage our expertise in the pizza toppings category to drive growth in plant-based toppings. With our new capacity expansion at work and with additional pepperoni capacity set to open at the beginning of fiscal 2022, we are set up nicely to meet the consistent growth we have seen in this space. 
With the foodservice industry recovery well underway, we will continue to strengthen our relationships with our valued partners, invest in our direct sales team and support the industry's return to growth with innovative, convenience and flavorful product solutions. 
In addition to foodservice growth, our retail and deli businesses also remained healthy with demand elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. Total retail sales this quarter were flat to last year as we lapped the months when consumers were stocking their pantries in anticipation of the pandemic. 
Sales finished up 16% compared to the second quarter of 2019, and we continue to see strength from our leading brands such as SPAM, Applegate, Jennie-O, Black Label, Herdez and Wholly. As a reminder, we experienced an immediate and sustained demand surge for our shelf-stable products in the Grocery Products segment at the onset of the pandemic. The second wave of demand that impacted our perishable and refrigerated items happened weeks later in the third fiscal quarter. 
Sales in the deli channel increased 4% this quarter and are up 9% over prepandemic levels. Hormel Gatherings party trays delivered strong growth as consumers started to spend more time with family and friends and consequently, are purchasing more products to entertain their guests. The Columbus brand remains a cornerstone for our deli business and is now benefiting from the opening of our new plant in Omaha, which is providing much-needed capacity. 
Columbus is a leader in charcuterie, and we now have the capacity to continue expanding distribution. Across the retail and deli space, our consumer takeaway metrics continue to be positive according to IRI. Many of our brands have made large gains in household penetration. Overall buy rates are improving, and we are seeing an expansion in cross purchasing across our brands. E-commerce sales grew double digits in the last 12 weeks according to IRI, and we are gaining share in important categories. 
We will continue to increase our investment in this important channel. Throughout the quarter, our supply chain continued to improve as we were able to increase production levels through a combination of gaining efficiencies, increasing capacities and leveraging our strategic supply chain partners. 
Another area we have made great strides is in our distribution network. Over the last year, we have opened a new grocery product distribution center and in recent weeks, have opened a refrigerated distribution center serving the West Coast. These strategic investments will reduce overall freight miles and cost, improve our customer service levels, support growth for our value-added businesses and reduce greenhouse emissions. 
From a bottom line perspective, operating income showed a slight decline. We saw raw material and feed prices rapidly increase throughout the quarter. We have taken pricing actions in many categories but did not see the full benefit of these actions during the quarter. As we have previously discussed, in volatile market conditions, pricing will lag the markets, which will shift profits to subsequent quarters. 
Net earnings and diluted earnings per share were flat to last year. A higher tax rate negatively impact earnings by $0.01 per share compared to last year. 
Turning to the segments. Refrigerated Foods volume increased 3% and sales increased 17%, with growth coming from almost every division. Value-added sales increased 18%, driven by a significant recovery in the foodservice businesses. As anticipated, we saw a rapid increase in foodservice demand as the quarter progressed. Almost all categories within foodservice grew sales, led by our pizza toppings portfolio and brands such as Fontanini and Bacon 1. In fact, pepperoni, pizza toppings, Bacon 1 and Fontanini authentic Italian meats all showed growth compared to the second quarter of 2019. 
We also experienced a recovery in the premium breakfast portfolio with growth from our Old Smokehouse brand. Additionally, we saw excellent growth from our premium prepared proteins, which include brands such as Austin Blues, Fire Braised, Cafe H and Sadlers. These items are key to our pre strategy. Items that are premarinated, precooked, presliced and fully prepared. As the industry recovery accelerates into the summer and labor remains the predominant challenge for most operators, our line of products offer convenient, safe, versatile and flavorful solutions. 
Our retail and deli teams delivered a strong quarter on the top line, with growth coming from products such as Black Label Bacon, Hormel Gatherings, Applegate, Lloyd's Barbecue, Hormel Pepperoni and Columbus prepared food items. Refrigerated Foods segment profit increased 32% due to higher foodservice sales, higher retail fresh pork profitability and decreased operational expenses due to abating COVID-19 cost pressures. 
International delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of record earnings growth, with sales increasing 17% and segment profit increasing 6%. The performance of the team in China remains impressive. Foodservice volumes have recovered to pre-pandemic levels driven by growth from SKIPPY, pizza toppings and Bacon items. 
Retail demand for the SPAM and SKIPPY brands has also been outstanding. The company's innovative offerings, including beef jerky, SKIPPY snacking items and 2 new SPAM varieties are providing additional avenues for growth, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects for our China business. 
Branded exports also grew, with growth coming from the SKIPPY and SPAM brands, higher foodservice sales and improved margins on fresh pork items. In addition, our partners in the Philippines, South Korea and Europe continued to experience elevated demand for shelf-stable products. 
Grocery Products results were strong given the difficult comparison to last year due to the extremely high levels of demand experienced at the onset of the pandemic. Even though volume declined 14%, sales declined 8% and segment profit declined 23%, we are encouraged by the segment's performance as we have seen sustained consumer demand for many of our brands compared to pre-pandemic levels. 
Sales for center store brands such as SPAM, Hormel Chili, Completes and Mary Kitchen hash were all over 20% higher compared to our second quarter of 2019. We will continue to support our leading brands, including Skippy, SPAM, Completes, Herdez, Wholly, Justin's and Hormel Chile. And we're resuming promotional activity as inventory levels normalize. 
Our MegaMex joint venture performed well as equity and earnings increased 26%. Both the Herdez and Wholly brands grew as consumers looked for authentic and convenient Mexican products to enhance their at-home eating occasions. The Herdez brand continues to outperform the salsa category. This brand has grown households by 3 million since the start of the pandemic and has introduced industry-leading innovation to the marketplace in recent years. 
Following the highly successful performance of Herdez Guacamole Salsa, we continue to expand distribution and grow share with 2 new product lines: Herdez Taqueria Street Sauces and Herdez Salsa Cremosa. Recently, Herdez also entered the hot sauce market with the introduction of Herdez Avocado Hot Sauce, another versatile offering that can enhance any meal. 
The Wholly brand had a strong quarter as well as it continues to target consumers looking for convenient solutions to enjoy avocado offerings. Our recent innovations, including Wholly smashed and Wholly diced avocado products, solved for that consumer need. And as we saw across many of our refrigerated foodservice businesses, demand for avocado products in the channel started to return during the quarter. 
Jennie-O volume decreased 3% and sales increased 2%. A recovery in the foodservice business and higher whole bird sales drove the sales increase. Foodservice volumes were up double digits compared to last year. Demand for Jennie-O retail products such as lean ground turkey remained above pre-pandemic levels. 
Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit declined 54% due to the impact from higher feed costs. Grain prices continued to increase significantly during the quarter, while pricing action had yet to be fully reflected in the marketplace. Jim Sheehan will provide further commentary on the actions we have taken to manage higher corn and soybean meal costs. 
Looking to the balance of the year, we are increasing our full year sales guidance range to $10.2 billion to $10.8 billion and reaffirming our earnings per share guidance range of $1.70 to $1.82 per share. As a reminder, this guidance range does not include the estimated impact of the pending acquisition of the Planters snacks nuts business. Our diversified and balanced business model gives us confidence we can perform well in many different economic scenarios and market conditions. 
We have a very positive outlook on the foodservice business as we head into the second half of the year. We are well positioned from an inventory and capacity standpoint to meet the demand from our distributor partners and operators and are confident in our ability to gain share throughout the recovery. Additionally, we are increasingly confident that K-12 schools and colleges and universities will open and operate in a more traditional manner this fall. This should benefit both Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store. 
We continue to see elevated demand in the retail, deli and international channels. We expect to further benefit from pricing actions, increased capacities on key product lines and continued improvements in our supply chain. This year, we have seen rapid increases in key input costs across our businesses. And we expect to operate in a high-cost environment for the remainder of the year. 
Our experienced management team has a proven ability to navigate and grow our business in volatile and inflationary market conditions. And once again, we will be leveraging our direct sales force to partner with our customers to mutually grow our businesses. As a reminder, our operations were heavily impacted by plant shutdowns, supply shortages and lower production throughput caused by the effects of the pandemic in the back half of fiscal 2020. This ultimately led to lower levels of inventory, which negatively affected the third and fourth quarters. Through the strategic actions we have taken to improve all facets of our operations and based on our record first half performance, we expect to benefit from more normalized operations in the back half of fiscal 2021. 
I am confident in our ability to continue growing, and I'm looking forward to closing the acquisition of Planters next month. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter, give an update on our financial position and provide commentary regarding key input cost markets."

First half sales increased 5% to $5.1 billion, also a record. Pretax earnings increased 2% for the quarter compared to last year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.42 per share, flat to last year. 
Second quarter results reflected approximately $0.01 per share in incremental COVID-related costs and $0.01 in higher tax expense. SG&A, excluding advertising, was 6.5% of sales, down slightly to last year. Advertising spend for the quarter was $31 million. Operating margins for the quarter were 11.1% compared to 12.1% last year. 
Higher raw material and feed costs negatively impacted margins as pricing lagged input cost increases. We have taken numerous pricing actions across the portfolio to protect profitability. The actions will take place early in the third quarter with additional pricing actions likely. COVID-related expenses were $6 million. The impact of COVID expenses continued to decline. 
Net unallocated expenses decreased due to higher investment income. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.1% compared to 20.6% last year. Excluding the impact from the Planters acquisition, we estimate the full year tax rate to be between 20% and 21.5%. 
We built inventory during the quarter in preparation for higher demand and to support continued growth for the remainder of the year. Our strategic action to build inventory was the primary driver of lower operating cash flow during the quarter. We paid our 371st consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 17, at an annual rate of $0.98, a 5% increase over the prior year. Share repurchases were minimal during the quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $45 million in the quarter. The company's target for capital expenditures in 2021 is $260 million. During the second quarter, we saw dramatic increases in pork and hog prices. USDA composite cutout prices since January have increased more than $30 with all primals contributing to the increase. 
Key inputs such as bellies and trim increased 57% and 76%, respectively, during the quarter. Pork exports also set an all-time record in March due to African swine fever outbreaks in China, Southeast Asia and Europe. We anticipate strength in pork markets due to continued export demand and a food service recovery domestically. USDA is now projecting pork production for the year to be slightly lower than 2020. 
Industry operating efficiencies are expected to improve as COVID pressures abate. However, labor availability, tighter hog supplies and reductions in the South herd support higher markets. Our balanced approach to hog and pork procurement mitigated cost volatility during the quarter. 
In high-cost and volatile environments, the strength of our leading brands and balanced approach to procurement continues to be a competitive advantage. The guidance range assumes elevated and volatile market conditions for the balance of the year with some moderation heading into the fall. 
We expect hog prices in the USDA composite cutout to remain well above year-ago levels due to strong domestic and export demand along with tighter hog supplies. We anticipate prices to peak during the summer and gradually decline in the fall, consistent with the seasonal increase in harvest. 
Belly prices are projected to remain higher than last year in historical averages. We anticipate markets to stabilize near the current levels, but volatility due to low cold storage levels and strong demand in the foodservice channel could cause inflationary pressure. 
Pork trim prices are expected to moderate from the current levels, but labor shortages across the industry remains a key risk to trim prices as limited boning capacity directly impacts trim supply and pricing. Due to the higher beef harvest levels in the several months, beef prices are anticipated to be lower in the back half of 2021. 
In response to global supply and demand imbalances in corn and soybean deal, we have taken strategic hedges to fully cover grain costs for the remainder of the year. The physicians also provide a benefit if markets decline. These hedges, coupled with the previously announced pricing actions, are expected to protect Jennie-O's profitability. 
Turkey pulp placements and egg sales have declined. Inventory levels are lower compared to last year. The tightening of supply has led to higher whole turkey and thigh meat markets. We have also recently seen an increase in breast meat prices. A recovery in the foodservice industry remains the key driver for higher prices for the support market. 
We anticipate inflationary pressure on freight in the back half of the year. The tactical action to optimize our distribution network with 2 new DCs, combined with improvements in loan efficiencies will help mitigate a portion of the increase.

And so the pricing actions that we've taken didn't happen all right at the beginning of the second quarter. And quite frankly, we're not done with all the pricing actions that we need to take. So we've got a lot of activity on that front. And so just the sequential action in our pricing is what will lead to that sequential improvement in margins. 
And so as you think about Q3, you'll see improvement, but probably some slightly lower margins as pricing hasn't quite caught up. Q4 really start to see more normalized margins as full pricing takes effect across the board. And I think it's important to note that we've either taken or will take price across almost all of our business."

And as we talked about, we've protected the grain cost for the rest of the year and with also having downside protection on that. So we're 100% covered on grain. 
The other thing is that we talk about is what's happening in the markets. When you think about Jennie-O, the fundamentals, which we keep pointing towards over the last few years are better. Hog sets and our egg sets and fold placements are both down 3% to 4%. And you're starting to see that with the cold storage levels continue to be at 26% below -- 26% below the 5-year average. What you're starting to see now is some nice improvements in the commodity markets around Turkey. 
For instance, yesterday, you saw breast meat at $2.11. The -- there are a lot of watchouts on JOTS, but there's also a fair amount of upside and we're starting to see that upside come through. We've watched these -- the fundamentals point towards better markets for probably a year now. They really haven't taken place, but they do seem to be taking place as we go forward. As far as the 9%, yes, these -- the drastic jump up in grain costs obviously delay that. So we look at the full year margin of 9%, that's really been pushed out up there."

So that looks okay. It looks good at this point. Obviously, in June, we'll have a better read of that. 
But as I would look at things, I think the other thing that's impacting inflation is labor availability. I mean getting people back into their jobs will, I think, alleviate some of the labor pressure. From a COVID standpoint, we're in really good shape, but it's getting new hires. It's getting people back to the job that probably is a watch out for me, not only at JOTS but across the industry.

But just think about it where the majority -- more than the majority of the business is on a pass-through basis."

We're not going to see a huge increase in production this year. These high grain prices probably are disincentive yet we have hog prices -- live prices well over $100, 100 weight right now. Supply constraints on your biggest raw material, is that a possibility going forward here? And it looks like grain prices could be high for a while. So how do you look at maybe the next couple of years, just not just this year, but maybe next in terms of hog production in the U.S.? And what are farmers doing out there?"

And as you are aware, these producers are large operators with a high level of capital and tend to keep their barns filled. We also get a large portion of our production from a contracted facility, the Fremont facility, which is made up of producers. They tend to like to keep their own plants full. So I'm very confident that we'll have the supply that we need both short term and long term. We go through these cycles all the time. Hog prices have increased rapidly. The prices have gone up a lot. You're right. Grain prices are high right now. We'll see how the growing season -- what the results are from the growing season to see what impact it has on prices. But these are long-term agreements and we're not having anybody get into negotiations about taking down their volumes. So I'm highly confident."

And we have spent a lot of time and effort over the last 3-plus years putting together our One Supply Chain. And it's really been our initiative to take this fragmented approach throughout the supply chain and really capitalize on the efficiencies and take cost out. And so we've done a lot of great work in our operations, in our logistics, as we mentioned, our -- some of the warehousing initiatives that we still had going on. And you're right. Probably the first 2 years of supply chain and even going into the pre-pandemic, we talked about our ability to have cost savings of $75 million. 
Last year, obviously, was a bit of a disruption, but that didn't stop the good work that was happening behind the scenes. And I think you see that play through when we talk about our ability to open up new warehouses to help mitigate some of the cost pressure on GP and now on our refrigerated portfolio. So -- and the other thing is for me personally, I can't imagine us having gone through the pandemic with a fragmented supply chain, having one voice from the top, setting direction and making sure that the entire team was aligned was very, very powerful and necessary for the organization. So I mean the benefits to the organization have far outweighed the financial returns. And we are in a significantly better place today as a result of our efforts on One Supply Chain."

Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our team delivered the highest quarterly sales in the company's 130-year history, while operating in an environment, which included inflationary pressures and industry-wide supply chain challenges. 
Our ability to deliver this performance demonstrates the strength of our balanced business model and strong consumer demand as we grew sales in all 4 segments and all 4 sales channels on an organic basis. 
Also in the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Planter Snack Nuts business. This brand fits perfectly into our vision for Hormel Foods and is another step in our strategic evolution. The integration has been smooth, which has allowed us to effectively operate the business with no disruptions. 
These accomplishments were achieved by our team members who never lost sight of our long-term growth strategy in the face of unprecedented industry-wide challenges. To all our team members around the world, including our new Planters team members, thank you for your accomplishments, and thank you for staying safe. 
Now more than ever, our investments across all areas of our business are paying off and have allowed us to reach even more consumers when and where they are eating. Whether it is cooking a meal at home, snacking at work, eating at a local restaurant, hosting a gathering with family and friends or ordering food online, a Hormel Foods branded product will likely be an option. 
The proof is in our performance this quarter. Sales increased 20% on a volume increase of 1%. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, sales increased 25%. This all-time record performance was led by an acceleration in our Foodservice business, sustained demand for our retail and deli products, continued growth from our international business and pricing actions taken across the portfolio. 
Excluding a partial quarter of the Planters business, organic sales increased 14% and volume declined 2%. 
For the quarter, we saw an acceleration in our Foodservice business as sales grew 45% compared to last year. What is even more impressive is sales increased 17% compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. 
Our Enterprise Foodservice portfolio remains perfectly positioned to meet the most pressing need of today's foodservice operators, which is labor. Our products minimize labor, simplify food preparation and save time, all while preserving the flexibility to add their own unique touch to their menus. 
Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon, Wholly Guacamole, Fontanini authentic Italian sausages and Hormel Fire Braised meats are all excellent examples of products that are succeeding in today's environment. 
Our retail business also showed 9% growth compared to 2020. Compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, this business delivered outstanding growth of 31%. Brands such as SPAM, Hormel Black Label, Applegate, Jennie-O and Herdez continue to resonate with consumers. 
Sales in the Deli channel increased 12% this quarter and are up 16% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Hormel Gatherings Party Trays and Columbus charcuterie items showed another quarter of growth as consumers return to entertaining and spending time with family and friends. 
An important component of our growth in Retail and Deli is our e-commerce performance. We continue to invest in the digital space, and we are seeing strong results compared to pre-pandemic levels. 
Our International channel delivered impressive growth of 36% compared to 2020 and is 33% above 2019 levels. Improvement was led by branded exports and strength from the Multinational businesses in China and Brazil. Again, I cannot stress enough how proud I am of our entire team for delivering these impressive results in the midst of an incredibly difficult operating environment marked by significant inflation, labor challenges and supply chain disruptions. 
This not only demonstrates the team's ability to execute our long-term growth strategy, but also reinforces the power of our brands. 
On a consolidated basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.32, a 14% decline compared to 2020. The decrease was due to onetime transaction costs and accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the Planters business. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.39, a 5% increase. Our team did an excellent job actively managing through inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. 
During the quarter, we continue to see inflation in labor rates, freight, supplies, raw materials and many other inputs, with an acceleration compared to the second quarter. Of note, we saw a very high level of inflation in pork input costs. 
To mitigate this inflationary pressure, we have taken pricing on almost every brand and product across our company. This is a testament to our successful pricing strategy, the power of our brands and the hard work of our entire team, especially our direct sales force. 
As a reminder, there is a difference in how quickly pricing flows through by channel, and this can shift profits to later quarters. We have a track record of improved profitability through a market cycle, and we expect margins to improve in the coming quarters. 
We also saw a drastic step-up in industry-wide operational challenges caused by labor shortages. This has impacted both our facilities and the operations of supplier and logistics partners. This has created a very complex operating environment, which led to an inability to fully meet customer demand. 
To address labor availability in our facilities, we are taking swift actions to hire and retain team members, implement automation across manufacturing facilities and simplify the portfolio. Our entire team, from operations to our direct sales force, has done an excellent job adjusting, prioritizing and managing through this dynamic environment. 
Turning to the segments. Refrigerated Foods volume decreased 2%. Sales increased 19%, and segment profit was flat. Organic volume decreased 3%, and organic sales increased 18%. Volume was lower due to lower harvest levels and commodity sales compared to last year. 
Our Foodservice business accelerated compared to the second quarter, with elevated levels of demand for all our branded products. Nearly every category grew volume and sales compared to last year, with standout performances from products like Hormel Bacon one, pizza toppings and sliced meats. 
Bacon 1, Fire Braised, Fontanini, Applegate and Pizza Toppings were just some of the items that also grew volume and sales compared to 2019. 
Similar to prior quarters, we saw excellent growth from premium prepared proteins, which are the cornerstone of our pre strategy, offering versatile and flavorful items that come premarinated, presliced or precooked. These items sold for the most pressing issues facing operators today, labor shortages. Brands like Bacon 1, Austin Blues, Fire Braised and Café H are designed to solve for this challenge and have never been as important or in higher demand than they are today. 
We saw momentum continue for our retail and deli brands in Refrigerated Foods as well. Products showing exceptional sales growth include Hormel Gatherings party trays, Hormel Black Label bacon, Hormel Fully Cooked entrees and Lloyd's Barbecue. 
The Columbus brand has shown no signs of slowing down, as consumers look for premium, authentic charcuterie. I'm pleased with the performance of our new charcuterie plant in Omaha, as the team is quickly filling up the new production lines. We are excited about the upcoming holiday season and expect a high level of demand for our innovative and premium Columbus product lines. 
International delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of record earnings growth, with volume up 2%, sales up 26% and segment profit up 18%. Organic volume increased 1%, and organic sales increased 24%. 
Total branded and fresh pork exports grew during the quarter. We continue to see strong growth from SPAM, Skippy and many foodservice brands around the world. Our business in China continues to perform well led by foodservice and from retail brands such as SPAM and Skippy. Our new item launches of Beef Jerky and Skippy Snacking items have also been very successful. 
Grocery Products volume increased 4%. Sales increased 20% and segment profit increased 1%. Brands, including SPAM, Hormel Complete and Wholly, showed excellent growth in the quarter. We continue to see strong growth relative to 2019,prepandemic levels for brands such as SPAM, Hormel Complete, Dinty Moore, Mary Kitchen and Herdez. 
Organic volume decreased 6%, and organic sales were flat. Organic volumes faced difficult comparisons due to the extremely high levels of demand during the early parts of the pandemic. Additionally, we have rationalized capacity on numerous contract manufacturing items to support growth of our branded business. 
Our MegaMex joint venture delivered excellent results, as equity and earnings increased 30%. The growth from the Herdez and Wholly brands are being driven by the tremendous level of innovation from MegaMex, with products such as Herdez Cremosas, Herdez Guacamole Salsa and Wholly Smashed Avocado. 
We are also extremely encouraged by our entry into the hot sauce space with Herdez Avocado Hot Sauce. 
Jennie-O volume increased 9% and sales increased 22%. A combination of a foodservice recovery and higher whole bird and commodity volumes drove the volume increase. Increased sales is due to higher volumes and pricing actions across the portfolio. Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit declined 17% driven by the impact from significantly higher fee and freight costs. 
While spot grain markets remained elevated during the quarter, the hedging actions we took stabilize the cost increases. 
Looking to the balance of the year, we issued our full year net sales and earnings guidance to reflect the Planters acquisition. We expect net sales to be between $11 billion to $11.2 billion and for diluted earnings per share to be between $1.65 to $1.69. This guidance reflects the addition of the Planters business and includes the associated onetime transaction costs and accounting adjustments, in addition to the impact from inflationary pressures on our business. 
We expect a strong finish to the year as pricing actions continue to take effect, the foodservice industry continues to recover and from the addition of Planters. 
Looking beyond the fourth quarter, I feel very optimistic about the future. Our balanced portfolio with diversification across raw materials, channels and categories will allow us to perform well in many economic environments. Further, we never wavered on our commitment to employee safety and on making disciplined and strategic investments to ensure we are positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth. 
Since the onset of the pandemic, we have made the following strategic investments. We opened a new Columbus charcuterie plant in Omaha, and we immediately invested in Phase 2, representing a major expansion of our pepperoni capacity. We completed the Pizza Toppings expansion at our Burke plant in Iowa, which significantly increased our capacity for Pizza Toppings. We have invested in R&D for plant-based products and launched our plant-based pepperoni and sausage crumble items at the Pizza Expo in mid-August. 
Additionally, we bolstered our innovation efforts by investing in new R&D centers, both domestically and in China. We expanded our distribution network for both the Shelf Stable and Refrigerated businesses. We made further progress on building out our one supply chain by investing in systems, people and processes. 
We acquired Sadler’s Smokehouse, which added capacity to support growth during the recovery in the foodservice industry. We completed the HR and finance portions of Project Orion and continue to work toward the multiphase implementation of our supply chain. 
We continue to make investments in advertising for our leading brands. And finally, we made the company's largest investment ever, the acquisition of Planters. 
We are already seeing the benefits that a large iconic and well-known brand can have on our business. 
These are just some of the many investments we have made to further enhance our business and set us up for growth into the future. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss financial information relating to the quarter, give an update on our financial position and provide commentary regarding key input cost markets."

Third quarter sales were $2.9 billion, an all-time record for the company. Net sales and organic net sales increased 20% and 14%, respectively, compared to last year. Segment profit increased 2% for the quarter driven by",895,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning. 
Third quarter sales were $2.9 billion, an all-time record for the company. Net sales and organic net sales increased 20% and 14%, respectively, compared to last year. 
Segment profit increased 2% for the quarter driven by strong results in the International segment, Foodservice growth and the addition of Planters. 
Earnings per share were $0.32. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding onetime costs and accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of Planters, was $0.39, a 5% increase. 
COVID-related expenses during the quarter were immaterial. Adjusted SG&A was 6.9% of sales compared to 7.6% last year. 
Advertising for the quarter was $31 million, an increase of 25%. 
Adjusted operating margins for the quarter were 8.7%, a decrease from 10.5% last year. We expect margins to show sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, as the impact of pricing actions continue to take effect. 
Net unallocated expenses increased as a result of the onetime acquisition-related costs for Planters and net interest expense. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.3%. The primary driver of the decline was a large volume of stock options exercised during the quarter and a onetime foreign tax benefit. The revised guidance range assumes a full year tax rate between 19% and 20.5%. 
Operating cash flow declined compared to last year impacted by working capital from the Planters acquisition and higher levels of inventory. Inventory levels were unseasonably low last year during the third quarter. 
We paid our 372nd consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 16 at an annual rate of $0.98 per share, a 5% increase over 2020. This completes the 93rd consecutive year of uninterrupted dividend payments. 
Capital expenditures were $54 million in the quarter. The company's target for the capital expenditures in 2021 is $260 million. 
The Planters acquisition represents a change to the company's capital structure. In June, we issued $2.3 billion of notes in 3-, 7- and 30-year tranches. This debt was incremental to the $1 billion of 10-year notes we issued in 2020. Including the treasury locks, the weighted average cost of debt is 1.6%, and the weighted average maturity is 10 years. This attractive debt profile is an ideal balance for our business. 
We will continue to use a disciplined waterfall approach to capital allocation, which includes 3 areas: required, strategic and opportunistic uses of cash. I expect no changes to dividend growth or our CapEx strategy. 
We are committed to an investment-grade rating and plan to deleverage to 1.5 to 2x debt to EBITDA over the next 2 to 3 years. 
The business experienced significant inflationary pressures on pork input costs during the quarter. The dramatic increase in pork and hog prices continued in the third quarter. Hog prices were up 250% compared to 20-year lows last year. Additionally, the prices of pork remained elevated caused by the recovery in the foodservice and the strong worldwide demand. 
The USDA composite cutout was up 50% compared to last year and 20% compared to the second quarter. Trimmed and belly prices also experienced inflationary pressure with significant volatility. Compared to the prior year, belly prices were 62% higher and trim prices 27% higher. 
The business benefited from the balanced approach to hog and pork procurement as we purchase hogs in aggregate at prices lower than the market. However, the rate of the drastic rise in the total pork input costs negatively impacted profitability. 
The latest estimates from the USDA indicate pork production for the year to decrease 2% compared to 2020. Lower harvest levels, lighter carcass weights and labor shortages across the industry support higher markets near term. 
We're closely monitoring the discovery of African swine fever in the Caribbean and labor availability across the industry. Both factors could impact input costs going forward. 
Fundamentals in the turkey industry improved during the third quarter. Higher prices for commodity items, including breast meat, size and whole turkeys were a benefit to the quarter. Additionally, egg sets and pulp placements declined. Cold storage remains significantly below historical averages. 
Higher operating costs offset the market benefits.  Inflationary pressure on corn and soybean meal have resulted in substantially higher feed costs. The strategic hedges on corn and soybean meal have stabilized feed costs. 
We also absorbed higher costs for freight, packaging, supplies and labor. We are actively managing our logistics network and supplier partnerships to minimize cost increases. 
Across the portfolio, pricing actions were effective, but from a timing standpoint, trailed inflation during the quarter. We expect to recover lost profitability due to inflation in the coming quarters as conditions normalize and pricing actions expand. 
The strong demand for our key products during the price increases is a testament to the strength of our leading brands. The guidance issued for the remainder of the year includes the impact of this and the expectations of continued inflationary pressure and volatile market conditions. 
Although the third quarter had its challenges, it also included significant financial milestones. We closed the largest acquisition in the company's history. We financed the transaction by leveraging the balance sheet through an attractive debt structure in both interest rates and tenor, all while maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
We move into the future with a more efficient capital structure, stronger brands and continued financial strength to invest in our business. 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

And I think for us, what we've been watching throughout the second quarter and the third quarter is just to be prepared and making sure that as we're watching not only commodity markets, but packaging costs and freight rates is making sure that we're capturing those in that time frame. 
And what's been different in this environment is, obviously, those costs have just continued to move away from us and no different than any other food company that you're talking to. 
What I do think is different, though, is that we have been ready, we have taken broad-based aggressive pricing, but we've continued to have to do that, and we will continue to have to do that, as we've seen these markets and costs continue to move away from us. 
So again, it's really broad-based. It could vary by product, by category. Clearly, we're watching all of the category dynamics. We're watching what's happening with elasticities within our brands and categories. 
And so it's obviously a very complex dynamic. The key takeaway, though, is that we're really pleased with the pricing actions that we've taken. We're pleased with the brand performances. And we know that we're ready to react with some additional pricing going forward."

As we look at our gross margin change, we certainly have had inflationary pressure.

The pressure on the gross margin really relates to the labor shortages, not only labor shortages at our facilities, but labor shortages throughout the supply chain. At times, we've had lines that have not been running at full capacity, that have created some overheads because we've had shortages in our plants. 
At other times, we've been notified, let's say, relatively late that our suppliers could not provide us, either packaging or input into our products. So as we look at the third quarter, as we look forward, really, inflation, we think we've managed very well. It's this labor issue that is creating the pressure right now.

I mean, really, the key in all of this is, like you said, what are you doing about it? And there is, as you know, a strong linkage between the labor and inflationary issues. 
So labor is costing us. The labor that we have is costing us a lot more. Then you have to deal with the missing labor. So we're pricing for the increased labor. For the labor that we don't have, clearly, we're raising starting wages. We're being more aggressive in how we're finding employee pools to hire. 
We have to be more aggressive and more disciplined in how we're retaining our employees. We're finding ways to automate. That doesn't happen overnight. 
But I would tell you that we've had successes in automation when we think about package placement, palletizing and how we can pivot and reallocate those team members to more important manufacturing responsibilities. And then through it all is how do we simplify our operations, right? 
And so  all of those things go hand-in-hand. And the one thing that this team has been able to do is not find themselves in a victim mentality, but, really, say what are we going to do about it because that's really our challenge."

I know that dollars going to the bank is more important, but I'm just trying to figure it out just because, obviously, the sales is distorted by pricing.

And we're seeing some relief in trim. 
Now the only other -- the only area outside of pork that, from a raw material input that we're seeing increases in, is the beef category. Beef started to go up in our second quarter, and that trend has continued. 
So we're seeing relief in the pork industry. Again, this is -- I'll give you the same warning that I did last quarter. Labor is a very important factor as to how these costs are going to trend in both the near and long term."

A few of your peers have kind of talked about vacancy rates or open requisitions that they have somewhere in the range of like 6% to 10%, which is obviously elevated versus normal. 
I guess just the 2 questions there. One, can you kind of give us a sense of where that stands for you in terms of open positions? And then secondly, just as we look at kind of the volume number in 3Q, I think it was, at least on an organic basis, like 1.15 billion pounds. Is that a good kind of run rate number to use in terms of your total volume that you can actually produce until the labor situation kind of corrects? Just trying to understand that part."

I mean, it ebbs and flows depending on the week, to be honest with you. But I think if you operate with that number, that range in mind, you're in a ballpark. 
I think there's always considerations when we talked about our volume number. Clearly, we had lower harvest level this quarter, which does have a dramatic impact on volumes. And so we've got to watch that closely. 
But taking it to a higher level, yes, the idea of labor in our plants does have an impact on the volume and what we're able to produce. So that's why it is so important that we do take a very aggressive approach in hiring, retain, finding those areas to automate and how do you simplify your operations. 
I mean, we absolutely have to get that done, and there's not a higher priority in the organization from a human resource perspective and a supply chain perspective.

But some of our suppliers, we have less visibility to, and we've had surprises that have interrupted the operations and actually have increased our cost as we've had to go out and find alternative solutions.

Beef is going up, as I stated. It's still continuing to grow in the fourth quarter. The freight issue isn't going away, so there's going to be pressure on freight. If anything, we've seen increases in freight cost recently. Jim has talked about the problems that we're incurring with ocean freight and the additional expenses that it's taking to overcome those challenges. 
The labor issue is an issue that is probably the hardest to read right now, what is going to happen to labor, how quickly it will recover or will it recover at all and just the challenges in the supply chain are putting pressure throughout the organization. And those are the issues that we've addressed in our guidance, and we think that we've taken a fair approach to that -- to those issues. I think as far as how you categorize it, I would look at the pork and the beef inputs and identify that. 
On the other hand, we're seeing tremendous recovery in the Foodservice business, and we're still seeing strong demand in the Retail. So the demand is there for our products. We've priced appropriately. It's a matter of having the labor that's available to produce the product into -- to meet the demand."

You've got our Refrigerated Foods Retail business that has more commodity elements tied to the pricing, and so you will see that move up and down based on the raw material performance, understanding of course going back to my original statement that we have a history of being able to expand those margins, and that's really what drives our stickiness comment.

Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our team delivered the highest quarterly sales in the company's 130-year history while operating in an environment which included inflationary pressures and industry-wide supply chain challenges. Our ability to deliver this performance demonstrates the strength of our balanced business model and strong consumer demand as we grew sales in all 4 segments and all 4 sales channels on an organic basis. 
Also in the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Planters snack nuts business. This brand fits perfectly into our vision for Hormel Foods and is another step in our strategic evolution. The integration has been smooth, which has allowed us to effectively operate the business with no disruptions. These accomplishments were achieved by our team members who never lost sight of our long-term growth strategy in the face of unprecedented industry-wide challenges. To all our team members around the world, including our new Planters team members, thank you for your accomplishments and thank you for staying safe.  
Now more than ever, our investments across all areas of our business are paying off and have allowed us to reach even more consumers when and where they are eating. Whether it is cooking a meal at home, snacking at work, eating at a local restaurant, hosting a gathering with family and friends or ordering food online, a Hormel Foods branded product will likely be an option. The proof is in our performance this quarter. 
Sales increased 20% on a volume increase of 1%. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, sales increased 25%. This all-time record performance was led by an acceleration in our foodservice business, sustained demand for our retail and deli products, continued growth from our International business and pricing actions taken across the portfolio. Excluding a partial quarter of the Planters business, organic sales increased 14% and volume declined 2%.  
For the quarter, we saw an acceleration in our foodservice business as sales grew 45% compared to last year. What is even more impressive is sales increased 17% compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels.  Our enterprise foodservice portfolio remains perfectly positioned to meet the most pressing need of today's foodservice operators, which is labor. Our products minimize labor, simplify food preparation and save time all while preserving the flexibility to add their own unique touch to their menus. Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon, Wholly Guacamole, Fontanini authentic Italian sausages and Hormel Fire Braised meats are all excellent examples of products that are succeeding in today's environment.  
Our retail business also showed 9% growth compared to 2020. Compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, this business delivered outstanding growth of 31%. Brands such as SPAM, Hormel Black Label, Applegate, Jennie-O and Herdez continue to resonate with consumers. Sales in the deli channel increased 12% this quarter and are up 16% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Hormel Gatherings party trays and Columbus charcuterie items showed another quarter of growth as consumers return to entertaining and spending time with family and friends. An important component of our growth in retail and deli is our e-commerce performance. We continue to invest in the digital space, and we are seeing strong results compared to pre-pandemic levels.  
Our International channel delivered impressive growth of 36% compared to 2020 and is 33% above 2019 levels. Improvement was led by branded exports and strength from the multinational businesses in China and Brazil. Again, I cannot stress enough how proud I am of our entire team for delivering these impressive results in the midst of an incredibly difficult operating environment marked by significant inflation, labor challenges and supply chain disruptions. This not only demonstrates the team's ability to execute our long-term growth strategy but also reinforces the power of our brands.  
On a consolidated basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.32, a 14% decline compared to 2020. The decrease was due to onetime transaction costs and accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the Planters business. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.39, a 5% increase. 
Our team did an excellent job actively managing through inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. During the quarter, we continued to see inflation in labor rates, freight, supplies, raw materials and many other inputs, with an acceleration compared to the second quarter. Of note, we saw a very high level of inflation in pork input costs. 
To mitigate this inflationary pressure, we have taken pricing on almost every brand and product across our company. This is a testament to our successful pricing strategy, the power of our brands and the hard work of our entire team, especially our direct sales force. As a reminder, there is a difference in how quickly pricing flows through by channel, and this can shift profits to later quarters. We have a track record of improving profitability through a market cycle, and we expect margins to improve in the coming quarters.  
We also saw a drastic step-up in industry-wide operational challenges caused by labor shortages. This has impacted both our facilities and the operations of supplier and logistics partners. This has created a very complex operating environment, which led to an inability to fully meet customer demand. To address labor availability in our facilities, we are taking swift actions to hire and retain team members, implement automation across manufacturing facilities and simplify the portfolio. Our entire team, from operations to our direct sales force, has done an excellent job adjusting, prioritizing and managing through this dynamic environment.  
Turning to the segments. Refrigerated Foods volume decreased 2%. Sales increased 19%, and segment profit was flat. Organic volume decreased 3%, and organic sales increased 18%. Volume was lower due to lower harvest levels and commodity sales compared to last year.  
Our foodservice business accelerated compared to the second quarter with elevated levels of demand for all our branded products. Nearly every category grew volume and sales compared to last year with standout performances from products like Hormel Bacon 1, Pizza Toppings and sliced meats. Bacon 1, Fire Braised, Fontanini, Applegate and Pizza Toppings were just some of the items that also grew volume and sales compared to 2019.  
Similar to prior quarters, we saw excellent growth from premium prepared proteins, which are the cornerstone of our pre strategy, offering versatile and flavorful items that come premarinated, presliced or precooked. These items solve for the most pressing issues facing operators today, labor shortages. Brands like Bacon 1, Austin Blues, Fire Braised and Café H are designed to solve for this challenge and have never been as important or in higher demand than they are today.  
We saw momentum continue for our retail and deli brands in Refrigerated Foods as well. Products showing exceptional sales growth include Hormel Gatherings party trays, Hormel Black Label bacon, Hormel fully cooked entrees and Lloyd's Barbeque. The Columbus brand has shown no signs of slowing down as consumers look for premium, authentic charcuterie. I'm pleased with the performance of our new charcuterie plant in Omaha as the team is quickly filling up the new production lines. We are excited about the upcoming holiday season and expect a high level of demand for our innovative and premium Columbus product lines.  
International delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of record earnings growth with volume up 2%, sales up 26% and segment profit up 18%. Organic volume increased 1%, and organic sales increased 24%. Total branded and fresh pork exports grew during the quarter. We continue to see strong growth from SPAM, SKIPPY and many foodservice brands around the world. Our business in China continues to perform well, led by foodservice and from retail brands such as SPAM and SKIPPY. Our new item launches of beef jerky and SKIPPY snacking items have also been very successful.  
Grocery Products volume increased 4%. Sales increased 20%, and segment profit increased 1%. Brands including SPAM, Hormel Compleats and Wholly, showed excellent growth during the quarter. We continue to see strong growth relative to 2019, pre-pandemic levels for brands such as SPAM, Hormel Compleats, Dinty Moore, Mary Kitchen and Herdez. Organic volume decreased 6%, and organic sales were flat. Organic volumes faced difficult comparisons due to the extremely high levels of demand during the early parts of the pandemic. Additionally, we have rationalized capacity on numerous contract manufacturing items to support growth of our branded business.  
Our MegaMex joint venture delivered excellent results as equity in earnings increased 30%. The growth from the Herdez and Wholly brands are being driven by the tremendous level of innovation from MegaMex with products such as Herdez cremosas, Herdez guacamole salsa and Wholly smashed avocado.  
We are also extremely encouraged by our entry into the hot sauce space with Herdez avocado hot sauce.  
Jennie-O volume increased 9% and sales increased 22%. A combination of a foodservice recovery and higher whole bird and commodity volumes drove the volume increase. Increased sales is due to higher volumes and pricing actions across the portfolio. Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit declined 17%, driven by the impact from significantly higher feed and freight costs. While spot grain markets remained elevated during the quarter, the hedging actions we took stabilized the cost increases.  
Looking to the balance of the year, we issued our full year net sales and earnings guidance to reflect the Planters acquisition. We expect net sales to be between $11 billion to $11.2 billion and diluted earnings per share to be between $1.65 to $1.69. This guidance reflects the addition of the Planters business and includes the associated onetime transaction costs and accounting adjustments in addition to the impact from inflationary pressures on our business. We expect a strong finish to the year as pricing actions continue to take effect, the foodservice industry continues to recover and from the addition of Planters.  
Looking beyond the fourth quarter, I feel very optimistic about the future. Our balanced portfolio with diversification across raw materials, channels and categories will allow us to perform well in many economic environments. Further, we never wavered on our commitment to employee safety and on making disciplined and strategic investments to ensure we are positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth.  
Since the onset of the pandemic, we have made the following strategic investments. We opened a new Columbus charcuterie plant in Omaha, and we immediately invested in phase 2, representing a major expansion of our pepperoni capacity. We completed the Pizza Toppings expansion at our Burke plant in Iowa, which significantly increased our capacity for Pizza Toppings. We have invested in R&D for plant-based products and launched our plant-based pepperoni and sausage crumble items at the Pizza Expo in mid-August.  
Additionally, we bolstered our innovation efforts by investing in new R&D centers, both domestically and in China. We expanded our distribution network for both the shelf stable and refrigerated businesses. We made further progress on building out our one supply chain by investing in systems, people and processes. We acquired Sadler's Smokehouse, which added capacity to support growth during the recovery in the foodservice industry. We completed the HR and finance portions of Project Orion and continue to work toward a multiphase implementation of our supply chain. We continue to make investments in advertising for our leading brands. 
And finally, we made the company's largest investment ever, the acquisition of Planters. We are already seeing the benefits that a large, iconic and well-known brand can have on our business. These are just some of the many investments we have made to further enhance our business and set us up for growth into the future.  
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss financial information relating to the quarter, give an update on our financial position and provide commentary regarding key input cost markets."

Net sales and organic net sales increased 20% and 14%, respectively, compared to last year.  
Segment profit increased 2% for the quarter driven by strong results in the International segment, foodservice growth and the addition of Planters. Earnings per share were $0.32. Adjusted earnings per share excluding onetime costs and accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of Planters was $0.39, a 5% increase.  
COVID-related expenses during the quarter were immaterial. Adjusted SG&A was 6.9% of sales compared to 7.6% last year. Advertising for the quarter was $31 million, an increase of 25%. 
Adjusted operating margins for the quarter were 8.7%, a decrease from 10.5% last year. We expect margins to show sequential improvement in the fourth quarter as the impact of pricing actions continue to take effect. Net unallocated expenses increased as a result of the onetime acquisition-related costs for Planters and net interest expense.  
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.3%. The primary driver of the decline was a large volume of stock options exercised during the quarter and a onetime foreign tax benefit. The revised guidance range assumes a full year tax rate between 19% and 20.5%.  
Operating cash flow declined compared to last year, impacted by working capital from the Planters acquisition and higher levels of inventory. Inventory levels were unseasonably low last year during the third quarter. We paid our 372nd consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 16 at an annual rate of $0.98 per share, a 5% increase over 2020. This completes the 93rd consecutive year of uninterrupted dividend payments.  
Capital expenditures were $54 million in the quarter. The company's target for the capital expenditures in 2021 is $260 million.  
The Planters acquisition represents a change to the company's capital structure. In June, we issued $2.3 billion of notes in 3-, 7- and 30-year tranches. This debt was incremental to the $1 billion of 10-year notes we issued in 2020. Including the treasury locks, the weighted average cost of debt is 1.6% and the weighted average maturity is 10.4 years. This attractive debt profile is an ideal balance for our business.  
We will continue to use a disciplined waterfall approach to capital allocation, which includes 3 areas: required, strategic and opportunistic uses of cash. I expect no changes to dividend growth or our CapEx strategy. We are committed to an investment-grade rating and plan to deleverage to 1.5 to 2x debt to EBITDA over the next 2 to 3 years.  
The business experienced significant inflationary pressures on pork input costs during the quarter. The dramatic increase in pork and hog prices continued in the third quarter. Hog prices were up 250% compared to 20-year lows last year. Additionally, the prices of pork remained elevated, caused by the recovery in the foodservice and the strong worldwide demand. The USDA composite cutout was up 50% compared to last year and 20% compared to the second quarter. Trim and belly prices also experienced inflationary pressure with significant volatility. Compared to the prior year, belly prices were 62% higher and trim prices were 27% higher. 
The business benefited from the balanced approach to hog and pork procurement as we purchase hogs in aggregate at prices lower than the market. However, the rate of the drastic rise in the total pork input costs negatively impacted profitability. The latest estimates from the USDA indicate pork production for the year to decrease 2% compared to 2020. Lower harvest levels, lighter carcass weights and labor shortages across the industry support higher markets near term. We're closely monitoring the discovery of African swine fever in the Caribbean and labor availability across the industry. Both factors could impact input costs going forward.  
Fundamentals in the turkey industry improved during the third quarter. Higher prices for commodity items, including breast meat, thighs and whole turkeys, were a benefit to the quarter. Additionally, egg sets and poult placements declined. Cold storage remains significantly below historical averages. 
Higher operating costs offset the market benefits. Inflationary pressure on corn and soybean meal have resulted in substantially higher feed costs. The strategic hedges on corn and soybean meal have stabilized feed costs. We also absorbed higher costs for freight, packaging, supplies and labor. We are actively managing our logistics networks and supplier partnerships to minimize cost increases.  
Across the portfolio, pricing actions were effective but from a timing standpoint, trailed inflation during the quarter. We expect to recover lost profitability due to inflation in the coming quarters as conditions normalize and pricing actions expand. The strong demand for our key products during the price increases is a testament to the strength of our leading brands. The guidance issued for the remainder of the year includes the impact of Planters and the expectations of continued inflationary pressure and volatile market conditions.  
Although the third quarter had its challenges, it also included significant financial milestones. We closed the largest acquisition in the company's history. We financed the transaction by leveraging the balance sheet through an attractive debt structure in both interest rates and tenor, all while maintaining our investment-grade rating. We move into the future with a more efficient capital structure, stronger brands and continued financial strength to invest in our business.  
At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

That's a really complex question, and you hit it right on the head when you say, and we've said it, that the pricing is very, very broad-based across the portfolio. And I think for us, what we have been watching throughout the second quarter and the third quarter is just to be prepared and making sure that as we're watching not only commodity markets but packaging costs and freight rates, is making sure that we're capturing those in that time frame. 
What's been different in this environment is obviously those costs have just continued to move away from us and no different than any other food company that you're talking to. What I do think is different though is that we have been ready, we have taken broad-based aggressive pricing. But we've continued to have to do that and we will continue to have to do that as we've seen these markets and costs continue to move away from us.  
So again, it's really broad-based. It could vary by product, by category. Clearly, we're watching all of the category dynamics. We're watching what's happening with elasticities within our brands and categories. And so it's obviously a very complex dynamic. The key takeaway though is that we're really pleased with the pricing actions that we've taken, we're pleased with the brand performances, and we know that we're ready to react with some additional pricing going forward."

We've said we've already seen some of the benefits that an iconic brand like that can have on our business. We're experiencing that in the convenience channel. So yes, at this point, although it's early, we still feel very comfortable with that range."

The inflation is one -- as we look at our gross margin change, we certainly have had inflationary pressure. But when we look at our pricing action, our improved mix and some efficiencies we've brought online, we have really offset that inflation.  
The pressure on the gross margin really relates to the labor shortages, not only labor shortages at our facilities but labor shortages throughout the supply chain. At times, we've had lines that have not been running at full capacity that have created some overheads because we've had shortages in our plants. At other times, we've been notified, let's say, relatively late that our suppliers could not provide us either packaging or input into our products. 
So as we look at the third quarter and as we look forward, really, inflation, we think we've managed very well. It's this labor issue that is creating the pressure right now. So I'd say it's more of a labor issue."

So we're pricing for the increased labor. For the labor that we don't have, clearly, we're raising starting wages. We're being more aggressive in how we're finding employee pools to hire. We have to be more aggressive and more disciplined in how we're retaining our employees. We're finding ways to automate. 
That doesn't happen overnight. But I would tell you that we've had successes in automation when we think about package placement, palletizing and how we can pivot and reallocate those team members to more important manufacturing responsibilities.

But taking it to a higher level, yes, the idea of labor in our plants does have an impact on the volume and what we're able to produce. So that's why it is so important that we do take a very aggressive approach in hiring, retain, finding those areas to automate and how do you simplify your operations.

So I think that's the first thing to look at. 
The other thing is, is that there is an efficiency in the business that we brought forward with. We've talked about Project Orion for a long time. It's adding efficiencies in our SG&A. One quarter in SG&A doesn't make a trend, but we believe that we have a more efficient operation coming out of 2021 than we had coming into it. And we believe that, that efficiency is going to provide a long-term benefit to the company."

Good morning, everyone. I want to start this morning by congratulating Jim Sheehan on his upcoming retirement. Jim will be retiring as CFO at the end of the calendar year, so this will be his last earnings call. Jim has over 4 decades",2000,"Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. 
I want to start this morning by congratulating Jim Sheehan on his upcoming retirement. Jim will be retiring as CFO at the end of the calendar year, so this will be his last earnings call. Jim has over 4 decades with our company and, under his tenure, has built a world-class finance, accounting and technology organization. Jim was the guiding force behind Project Orion, an initiative that will benefit our company for decades to come. 
For over 43 years, with the last 5 years as CFO, Jim has been a trusted partner to me and many of my predecessors. Jim helped complete over $5 billion in strategic acquisitions including Justin's, Fontanini, Caraci, Columbus, Sadler's and our largest acquisition ever, Planters. Equally impressive was Jim's contribution to reshaping our portfolio as he was also a guiding force behind many of the divestitures we made to transform our company. 
Jim's oversight to our evolution puts us on a solid foundation for the future growth of our company. Additionally, Jim has overseen the distribution of over $2 billion in dividends to our shareholders. In addition to his business accolades, Jim was the key voice behind our game-changing Inspired Pathways program, which provides free college education for children of our team members. Jim will be missed and we wish him well in retirement, along with his wife, Jean. 
Jacinth Smiley succeeds Jim and brings a wealth of experience from outside Hormel Foods. She has deep and broad domestic and international experience in areas such as corporate finance, public accounting and compliance. Most recently, she served as the Group Vice President of Corporate Strategy. Hormel Foods is fortunate to have Jacinth as CFO, and I'm looking forward to her leadership in her new role. My sincere congratulations to both Jim and Jacinth. 
In an incredibly difficult and rapidly changing operating environment, our team delivered outstanding top line results. We achieved record sales in fiscal 2021, exceeding both $10 billion and $11 billion in sales for the first time. For the full year, sales were $11.4 billion, representing 19% sales growth. On an organic basis, sales increased 14%. 
Our top line growth was incredibly balanced as each of our go-to-market sales channels and business segments posted strong double-digit sales gains, underpinned by value-added volume growth, pricing and a better mix. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year increased 4% to $1.73 in spite of inflationary pressure and supply chain challenges. Diluted earnings per share was $1.66. 
We had an excellent fourth quarter and posted numerous records, including a fourth consecutive quarter of record sales, record diluted earnings per share and record cash flow from operations. I want to commend our entire team for delivering this impressive performance and the numerous fourth quarter records. 
Sales increased 43% and organic sales increased 32%. Volume increased 14%, and organic volume increased 8%. We grew sales in every segment and every channel for the quarter. Compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, all channels grew by over 25%, driven by strong demand and pricing action in almost every category. 
This all-time record performance was led by further acceleration in our foodservice businesses. Our foodservice teams across the organization posted 72% sales growth for the quarter, 33% higher than pre-pandemic levels. This followed second quarter growth of 28% and third quarter growth of 45%. Strength was broad-based with significant contributions from Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store and MegaMex. We also saw a strong recovery in our noncommercial segments, including college and university and K-12 institutions. Our foodservice portfolio remains perfectly positioned to meet the needs of today's foodservice operators with labor and time-saving products. I believe our growth in foodservice is a function of our differentiated value proposition in the industry as well as our dedication during the pandemic. 
We have grown with our distributor and operator partners during the recovery, strengthening many of our partnerships and decades-long relationships. The top line performances from our other channels were equally impressive. Retail, deli and international each delivered a second consecutive year of growth. Retail and international sales both increased 34% and deli sales increased 24%. 
On an organic basis, each channel posted strong double-digit growth. Growth came from numerous brands across all areas of our portfolio, including SPAM, Applegate, Columbus, Hormel Black Label, Wholly Hormel Compleats, Gatherings and many more. 
We continue to see very positive trends for consumer takeaway at retail. According to IRI, key metrics for our brands such as buy rate and trips per buyer remain favorable, which indicates elevated consumer spending on our products has remained. We also continue to grow share in many important categories, including Hormel Gatherings, Party Trays, Hormel Pepperoni, SPAM luncheon meat and Hormel Chili. 
Our One Supply Chain team has done an excellent job operating in and navigating constant supply chain disruptions. We have also seen the positive impact of their strategic actions, namely, we're starting to see an increasing number of our open positions being filled, more automation being implemented in our facilities and a more simplified product portfolio. In total, these actions are allowing us to maximize our throughput to meet the continued strong demand of our customers. 
From a bottom line perspective, fourth quarter earnings were a record $0.51 per share, a 19% increase compared to 2020, an acceleration in our top line results and the addition of the Planters business led to the earnings growth. As we said in the third quarter, we expected margins to improve as pricing actions took effect. Indeed, margins improved sequentially in all 4 segments. Pricing actions, improved promotional effectiveness and a more profitable mix all contributed to the improvement. 
We started to see relief in key raw materials in the fourth quarter compared to prior quarters. However, labor rates, freight, supplies and raw material costs remain above year-ago levels and in the case of freight, increased further. 
Looking at the segments, Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods and International segments each posted double-digit segment profit growth. Jennie-O Turkey Store profits declined due to higher feed costs. A few highlights from the quarter include the following: Refrigerated Foods delivered strong volume, sales and profit growth. The team was able to leverage the numerous capacity expansion projects since the start of the pandemic for categories such as pizza toppings, bacon and dry sausage. 
Within Grocery Products, our Simple Meals and Mexican portfolios generated excellent growth in addition to contributions from the Planters snack nuts business. Notably, the SPAM brand delivered its seventh consecutive year of record growth, and we recently announced plans for additional capacity to support future growth. 
Our International team achieved a seventh consecutive quarter of record earnings growth with strong results from all of their businesses. The momentum this business has generated over the last 2 years supports our plans to aggressively expand internationally. Lastly, Planters made a positive impact, especially in the fast-growing snacking and entertaining space and within the convenience store channel. This quarter's results were outstanding, and we intend to build on this momentum going into 2022. 
Over the past decade, Hormel Foods has deliberately evolved from a meat-centric, commodity-driven company with a heavy focus on retail, pork and turkey to a global branded food company with leading brands across numerous channels. Our company today is more food forward than ever, with a sharp focus on the needs of our customers, consumers and operators. 
As we begin fiscal 2022, we plan to continue our evolution. First, we will complete the full integration of the Planters business across all functions. The first of 3 production facilities was successfully integrated in the fourth quarter and the remaining 2 facilities are scheduled to be fully integrated in our first quarter. 
Since acquiring Planters 6 months ago, our sales, marketing, innovation and R&D teams have been hard at work, developing new and innovative products and flavors, many of which will be rolled out this coming year. They've also been working on refreshing the branding and packaging, which will also be launched in 2022. Seeing the great work of our teams has me even more confident about where we are able to take this brand in the future and further strengthens our conviction of the potential for Planters. From a financial standpoint, the Planters business is performing at the top end of our expectations, and we expect that trend to continue in fiscal '22. 
Second, we are also taking a series of actions at Jennie-O Turkey Store. Over time, we expect these actions to result in a more demand-oriented and optimized Turkey portfolio that is better aligned to the changing needs of our customers, consumers and operators that will result in long-term growth, improved profitability and lower earnings volatility. 
The transformation starts with accelerating our efforts to shift from commodity to branded value-added products. This is similar to the successful strategy we have executed in Refrigerated Foods over the past 15 years. As a result, we will close the Benson Avenue plant located in Willmar, Minnesota in the first half of fiscal 2022. This plant is an older, inefficient facility which produces numerous commodity items. Value-added products will be consolidated into multiple other facilities. Team members will transition to our newer and larger facility also located in Willmar, which will supplement staffing levels. 
Finally, we will continue to integrate business functions into the Hormel Foods parent organization. Over the past 2 years, we have successfully integrated IT services, finance and accounting and HR into the Hormel organization through Project Orion, and we will continue these efforts for other functions. By doing so, we will bring the deep Turkey expertise and competitive advantages of the Jennie-O team to the broader organization. I want to be very clear that Turkey will continue to play an important role in our company for many brands, including Columbus, Applegate, Hormel Natural Choice. 
In addition to Jennie-O, Turkey is vital to our balanced business model, serves to diversify our portfolio and it's important to consumers who are looking for high-protein, lean and versatile offerings. We will provide a further update and details on the financial components and timing on our first quarter call. 
Finally, we made additional progress on optimizing our pork supply chain by signing a new 5-year raw material supply agreement with our supplier in Fremont, Nebraska. This new agreement more closely matches our pork supply with the needs of our value-added businesses while simultaneously reducing the amount of commodity pork we sell. Similar to the rationale for selling the Fremont plant in 2018, this new agreement further diversifies us away from commodity sales, increases our flexibility within our supply chain and decreases our earnings volatility. 
This agreement should result in a reduction of approximately $350 million of commodity fresh pork sales at very low margins. The impact is split between the Refrigerated Foods and International segments. The contract will be effective at the start of calendar year 2022. 
The success we are having with Planters, the actions we are taking at Jennie-O Turkey Store and the continued progress we are making in our pork supply chain all provide great insights into how we are continuing to evolve Hormel Foods for next year and beyond. And not only have we evolved our portfolio, but we will continue to evolve how we operate as a company with initiatives such as One Supply Chain, Project Orion and our digital experience group. 
Looking at fiscal 2022, we expect net sales to be between $11.7 billion and $12.5 billion and for diluted earnings per share to be between $1.87 and $2.03 per share. We expect growth in excess of our long-term goals due to organic growth across each of our segments and strength in our Planters business. I have confidence in our ability to achieve our guidance with all 4 segments delivering growth. 
Jacinth Smiley will provide more color regarding key drivers to our fiscal 2022 outlook. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss financial information relating to the quarter."

The company achieved record fourth quarter and full year sales of $3.5 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively. Organic sales increased 32% for the quarter and 14% for the full year. Planters contributed $411 million in sales for the full year. Earnings before taxes increased 26% for the fourth quarter, strong results in Refrigerated, International and the inclusion of Planters led to the strong finish to the year despite ongoing inflationary pressures. 
Earnings before taxes increased 1% for the full year compared to fiscal 2020. Diluted earnings per share of $0.51 was a record. This was a 19% increase over last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year was $1.73, a 4% increase from last year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.66. 
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 7.5% compared to 7.9% last year. Strong sales growth and disciplined cost management contributed to the improvement. Advertising investments increased 12% compared to last year. As anticipated, operating margins in the fourth quarter increased compared to the third quarter as a result of effective pricing action. Segment margins expanded from last quarter by 136 basis points to 10.7%, with increases in each segment. 
In 2021, inflation, labor shortages and the Planters deal cost all negatively impacted margins. The fourth quarter results, including the continued strong demand of our products, are an indication of improved market conditions as we exit the year. Net unallocated expenses in 2021 increased primarily as a result of onetime acquisition cost for Planters and higher interest expense. 
The effective tax rate for the year was 19.3% compared to 18.5% last year. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was a record, resulting from strong earnings and disciplined working capital management. Our balanced business model and consistent cash flow provided protection against the complex and challenging business dynamics we navigated during the year, allowing us to invest in numerous capital projects, acquire Planters and grow the dividend. We paid our 373rd consecutive quarterly dividend effective November 15 at an annual rate of $0.98 per share. We also announced a 6% increase for 2022, marking the 56th consecutive year of dividend increases. 
During 2021, the company repurchased 500,000 shares for $20 million. Capital expenditures were $232 million. The company ended 2021 with $3.3 billion in debt or approximately 2.5x EBITDA. Although no mandatory debt repayments are required until 2024, based on our strong cash flow, we expect to make incremental payments as soon as the second half of 2022. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and deleveraging to 1.5 to 2x EBITDA by 2023. 
Market conditions for pork input costs remained elevated during the fourth quarter. The USDA composite cutout averaged 33% higher compared to last year, supported by strong demand for pork and historically low cold storage levels. Hog prices averaged 62% higher than last year but were down 27% compared to the third quarter. Belly pork trim and beef trim markets were also significantly higher for the quarter compared to last year. 
The latest estimates from the USDA indicate pork production for the year to decrease 2% compared to 2020 and remain relatively flat in 2022. Labor shortages may continue to be a significant factor affecting industry production. Turkey industry fundamentals were strong. The whole turkey and thigh meat markets reached all-time highs during the fourth quarter, with fresh meat prices above a year ago. Supporting these prices were historically low cold storage levels, lower pulp placements and decline in egg sets. 
Higher feed costs and labor shortages continue to negatively impact Jennie-O. Feed cost increased over 60% from last year in the fourth quarter. In 2022, we anticipate pork, beef, turkey and feed prices to remain above historical levels. We delivered strong results in the fourth quarter as the team overcame challenging operating conditions and volatile markets. The performance is a testament to the strength of our brands, pricing power, balance model and the team's ability to execute in a dynamic market environment. 
On a personal note, as I reach the end of my career at Hormel, I am thankful for the privilege of working for this great company for the past 43 years. I appreciate the support of Jim Snee, the Board of Directors and my team over my tenure as CFO. I take great pride in the evolution and accomplishments of the company during my career and leave with the greatest confidence in the future. I have enjoyed my interactions with the shareholders and analyst community, and I wish you well. 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley. I know the company is in excellent hands with Jacinth and you will have an opportunity to get to know her better in the coming months. Jacinth will provide an overview of the fiscal 2022 guidance and further context on our expectations for next year."

For analysts and the investment community on the call, I look forward to meeting you in the coming weeks and months. I'm excited to be stepping into the Chief Financial Officer role at Hormel Foods, a company known for its financial strength, its powerhouse brand and its commitment to employees and communities. In the time I have been at the company, I have found that the Hormel Foods is innovative and has a results-driven focus for all stakeholders. 
As Jim mentioned, allow me to share a bit more commentary regarding key drivers to our fiscal 2022 outlook. Building on the momentum we established during the second half of the year and the strategic investments we have made throughout the pandemic, we expect to generate sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2022 above the long-term goals we announced at our investor update in October. We anticipate growth from all 4 segments driven by continued elevated demand for our products; the impact from our pricing actions; improved production throughput; new capacity for key categories such as pizza toppings and dry sausage; and the full year contribution of the Planters business. 
We also expect operating margins to show improvement throughout the year, similar to the dynamic we experienced in the fourth quarter. It is important to note that rapid changes in raw material input costs can shift profitability between quarters. 
In addition to generating strong sales and earnings growth, we will continue to invest in our leading brands through increases in strategic marketing and advertising, capacity expansions for high-growth platforms and capabilities to drive industry-leading innovation. The company's target for capital expenditures in 2022 is $310 million. We are scheduled to open a pepperoni expansion to our newest facility in Omaha during the second quarter, which will provide the needed capacity to meet growing demand in our retail and foodservice businesses. 
We are also beginning work on another expansion for the SPAM family of products scheduled to be operational in 2023. In addition to these larger projects, we are continuing to invest in cost savings, technology and automation projects to drive long-term savings and efficiencies. 
Pivoting to innovation, we achieved our 15% goal in 2021. We have strong innovation platforms for brands such as Planters, SKIPPY, Justin's, Herdez and Hormel Black Label at retail as well as the Jennie-O and HAPPY LITTLE PLANTS brands in the foodservice channel. These platforms in addition to our continuous process and product improvement initiatives give us the confidence going forward to consistently achieve our stated innovation goal. 
I want to speak for a moment about the complexities of our operating environment. The operating environment is expected to remain complex in fiscal 2022, and our guidance accounts for the near-term impacts from labor shortages, higher cost and supply chain disruption. Our entire team has done an excellent job executing our business strategies in this dynamic environment. 
In many ways, we have enhanced our competency for solving the day-to-day challenges inherent to our industry. We have increased our efforts to hire and maintain team members and have developed many strategies to mitigate the effect of labor shortages to meet elevated demand. This includes maximizing our flexibility to produce the items that are most in demand and leveraging our manufacturing partnerships to increase throughput wherever possible. 
Our One Supply Chain team allows us to continue to actively manage our raw material procurement, logistics network and supply partnerships to minimize the impact of further inflation and supply chain disruption. We will also benefit from our expanded logistics network, which has added capacity for both the Refrigerated and Grocery Products business. As a result of these actions, we expect improved fill rates and load factors in fiscal 2022. 
The announcement of the Jennie-O Turkey Store transformation is another step in our evolution to become a stronger global branded food company. Consistent with our long-term strategy, we are continuing our efforts to actively shift away from commodity businesses towards branded, value-added businesses. We expect a strategic and intentional actions to create a better, more profitable and sustainable business model. 
Taking all of these factors into account, as Jim has mentioned, we're setting our full year sales guidance at $11.7 billion to $12.5 billion and our diluted earnings per share guidance at $1.87 to $2.03. Additionally, this guidance reflects the Benson Avenue facility closure, our new pork raw material supply agreement and an effective tax rate between 20.5% and 22.5%. Fiscal 2022 will be 52 weeks. 
As we move forward to execute against our strategic imperatives in 2022 and beyond, I'm pleased to be with a company that continues to evolve as a global branded food company. Jim often says, we are uncommon. I have seen that first hand in my time with the company thus far. This starts with our unwavering commitment to employee safety and remaining an employer of choice in the communities we live and work. We're taking purposeful actions to transform our company as we embark on our most ambitious corporate responsibility journey yet, our 20 By 30 challenge, which is certainly important from an ESG standpoint. 
Our experienced management team, the tireless work of our team members around the world and the progress made to implement the Project Orion and One Supply chain initiatives gives us added confidence in our ability to deliver growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond. I am excited to be with Hormel Foods and be part of its continued success.

We've seen the evolution of our company, whether it was Project Orion, our one Supply Chain effort, really this opportunity to move away from duplication of resources. That's the first thing. The second thing is when we're honest with ourselves, the business has underperformed in recent years. And that's not through a lack of effort on our team's part. That's dealing with a significant oversupply situation that's created a lot of volatility for us. And so as you think about how we've managed other parts of the business, it kind of flew in the face of really what we've been trying to achieve. 
So really, this announcement today is a bigger step in that evolution to make sure that we're moving from a commodity-driven or a supply-driven business to a more demand, consumer-driven business.

And even more importantly, is we've seen some improvement in key plants for us. So key plants, meaning 2 of our larger refrigerated foods plants have seen dramatic improvement in labor rates. Two of our grocery product plants have seen improvements in labor rates. So that's been really helpful as we've progressed throughout the fourth quarter and then head into 2022.

So that's been very, very helpful, whether it's been racking loaders, the transfer vehicles. I mean it's an incredibly automated facility. But you're starting with a more recent blueprint. 
In some of our existing facilities, we've always talked about the need for automation and have looked to find those opportunities. But I would say that if the opportunity projects have accelerated over the last 12 to 18 months. And so we've got a number of projects across multiple facilities where we've talked about the package placement. We've talked about a lot of the boxing and other packaging opportunities. Mark Coffey did a really nice job in his One Supply Chain video during our investor update demonstrating that. 
But I think the other part, and you mentioned it, is how we think about automation going forward? And then how do you factor in that labor component which maybe wasn't as important to factor in, in previous years. But I do think that's going to be part of that opportunity cost that has to be figured into the automation equation as we go forward. I mean we -- as we think about it from an engineering perspective, we're allocating resources in our engineering organization that we've never had before to make sure that not only are we identifying existing automation, but really helping to support and develop automation that isn't even out there yet that we believe we need in our operations.

But if we look into the profitability in the quarter in Grocery Products, I mean, it was clearly was down on a year-over-year basis, and I guess there was still some of the integration costs. But can you give us a feeling of how you think Planters over time is going to be accretive into 2022 from a margin perspective in Grocery Products?"

So the business itself has been operating really, really well, meeting our expectations. 
The integrations have gone smoothly. We talked about already integrating one facility. The other 2 are right behind it. So I mean, the business is doing everything that we thought it would do so far. But then the opportunities going forward in terms of what we're going to be able to do from branding, flavors, innovation, I mean there's still a lot to come, and that's why we're so excited about what it has contributed and will contribute in the future."

And I remember you've talked a lot about the big potential you're seeing within like creating new products, innovation, Planters as an opportunity to leverage some of the other categories within snacking. If you would have to take a look at like the first couple of months of operations, is that something you continue to be very positive on? Have you seen any incremental opportunities to grow that business and to kind of combine it with existing snacking opportunities?

We're having much different conversations with convenience store operators in the past, everything we did was the back of the house when you went in to get food for sandwiches or pizza. Now that retail section of the convenience stores has been opened up because now we have something to talk about with Planters, and we're able to follow on with other parts of our portfolio. 
And so I think those are the new things for us. There were some basics blocking and tackling that we knew we'd be able to get done as well in terms of filling distribution gaps just like we did when we acquired the SKIPPY business. So again, you start piecing this all together, and that's why we remain so optimistic about the acquisition and what it holds for us going forward."

And when you're looking to source those, it's about supply, not cost. And so there are a lot of those examples on a week-to-week basis in the environment we're in right now. 
I think as the entire supply chain, backwards and forward, starts to moderate throughout the year, we'll be able to capture more of those or have those go away. So it will be less of an impact.

I want to start this morning by congratulating Jim Sheehan on his upcoming retirement. Jim will be retiring as CFO at the end of the calendar year, so this will be his last earnings call. Jim has over 4 decades with our company and, under his tenure, has built a world-class finance, accounting and technology organization. Jim was the guiding force behind Project Orion, an initiative that will benefit our company for decades to come.
For over 43 years, with the last 5 years as CFO, Jim has been a trusted partner to me and many of my predecessors. Jim helped complete over $5 billion in strategic acquisitions, including Justin's, Fontanini, Ceratti, Columbus, Sadler's and, our largest acquisition ever, Planters. Equally impressive was Jim's contribution to reshaping our portfolio as he was also a guiding force behind many of the divestitures we made to transform our company.
Jim's oversight to our evolution puts us on a solid foundation for the future growth of our company. Additionally, Jim has overseen the distribution of over $2 billion in dividends to our shareholders. In addition to his business accolades, Jim was the key voice behind our game-changing Inspired Pathways program, which provides free college education for children of our team members. Jim will be missed, and we wish him well in retirement, along with his wife, [ Jean. ]
Jacinth Smiley succeeds Jim and brings a wealth of experience from outside Hormel Foods. She has deep and broad domestic and international experience in areas such as corporate finance, public accounting and compliance. Most recently, she served as the Group Vice President of Corporate Strategy. Hormel Foods is fortunate to have Jacinth as CFO, and I'm looking forward to her leadership in her new role. My sincere congratulations to both Jim and Jacinth.
In an incredibly difficult and rapidly changing operating environment, our team delivered outstanding top line results. We achieved record sales in fiscal 2021, exceeding both $10 billion and $11 billion in sales for the first time. For the full year, sales were $11.4 billion, representing 19% sales growth. On an organic basis, sales increased 14%.
Our top line growth was incredibly balanced as each of our go-to-market sales channels and business segments posted strong double-digit sales gains, underpinned by value-added volume growth, pricing and a better mix. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year increased 4% to $1.73 in spite of inflationary pressure and supply chain challenges. Diluted earnings per share was $1.66.
We had an excellent fourth quarter and posted numerous records, including a fourth consecutive quarter of record sales, record diluted earnings per share and record cash flow from operations. I want to commend our entire team for delivering this impressive performance and the numerous fourth quarter records.
Sales increased 43%, and organic sales increased 32%. Volume increased 14%, and organic volume increased 8%. We grew sales in every segment and every channel for the quarter. Compared to prepandemic levels in 2019, all channels grew by over 25%, driven by strong demand and pricing action in almost every category.
This all-time record performance was led by further acceleration in our foodservice businesses. Our foodservice teams across the organization posted 72% sales growth for the quarter, 33% higher than prepandemic levels. This followed second quarter growth of 28% and third quarter growth of 45%. Strength was broad-based with significant contributions from Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store and MegaMex. We also saw a strong recovery in our noncommercial segments, including college and university and K-12 institutions.
Our foodservice portfolio remains perfectly positioned to meet the needs of today's foodservice operators with labor and time-saving products. I believe our growth in foodservice is a function of our differentiated value proposition in the industry as well as our dedication during the pandemic. We have grown with our distributor and operator partners during the recovery, strengthening many of our partnerships and decades-long relationships.
The top line performances from our other channels were equally impressive. Retail, deli and international each delivered a second consecutive year of growth. Retail and international sales both increased 34%, and deli sales increased 24%.
On an organic basis, each channel posted strong double-digit growth. Growth came from numerous brands across all areas of our portfolio, including SPAM, Applegate, Columbus, Hormel Black Label, Wholly, Hormel Compleats, Gatherings and many more.
We continue to see very positive trends for consumer takeaway at retail. According to IRI, key metrics for our brands such as buy rate and trips per buyer remain favorable, which indicates elevated consumer spending on our products has remained. We also continue to grow share in many important categories, including Hormel Gatherings, party trays, Hormel pepperoni, SPAM luncheon meat and Hormel chili.
Our One Supply Chain team has done an excellent job operating in and navigating constant supply chain disruptions. We have also seen the positive impact of their strategic actions, namely, we're starting to see an increasing number of our open positions being filled, more automation being implemented in our facilities and a more simplified product portfolio. In total, these actions are allowing us to maximize our throughput to meet the continued strong demand of our customers.
From a bottom line perspective, fourth quarter earnings were a record $0.51 per share, a 19% increase compared to 2020. An acceleration in our top line results and the addition of the Planters business led to the earnings growth. As we said in the third quarter, we expected margins to improve as pricing actions took effect. Indeed, margins improved sequentially in all 4 segments. Pricing actions, improved promotional effectiveness and a more profitable mix all contributed to the improvement.
We started to see relief in key raw materials in the fourth quarter compared to prior quarters. However, labor rates, freight, supplies and raw material costs remain above year ago levels and in the case of freight, increased further.
Looking at the segments, Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods and International segments each posted double-digit segment profit growth. Jennie-O Turkey Store profits declined due to higher feed costs. A few highlights from the quarter include the following: Refrigerated Foods delivered strong volume, sales and profit growth. The team was able to leverage the numerous capacity expansion projects since the start of the pandemic for categories such as pizza toppings, bacon and dry sausage.
Within Grocery Products, our simple meals and Mexican portfolios generated excellent growth in addition to contributions from the Planters snack nuts business. Notably, the SPAM brand delivered its seventh consecutive year of record growth, and we recently announced plans for additional capacity to support future growth.
Our International team achieved a seventh consecutive quarter of record earnings growth with strong results from all of their businesses. The momentum this business has generated over the last 2 years supports our plans to aggressively expand internationally.
Lastly, Planters made a positive impact, especially in the fast-growing snacking and entertaining space and within the convenience store channel. This quarter's results were outstanding, and we intend to build on this momentum going into 2022.
Over the past decade, Hormel Foods has deliberately evolved from a meat-centric, commodity-driven company with a heavy focus on retail, pork and turkey to a global-branded food company with leading brands across numerous channels. Our company today is more food forward than ever with a sharp focus on the needs of our customers, consumers and operators.
As we begin fiscal 2022, we plan to continue our evolution. First, we will complete the full integration of the Planters business across all functions. The first of 3 production facilities was successfully integrated in the fourth quarter, and the remaining 2 facilities are scheduled to be fully integrated in our first quarter.
Since acquiring Planters 6 months ago, our sales, marketing, innovation and R&D teams have been hard at work, developing new and innovative products and flavors, many of which will be rolled out this coming year. They've also been working on refreshing the branding and packaging, which will also be launched in 2022. Seeing the great work of our teams has me even more confident about where we are able to take this brand in the future and further strengthens our conviction of the potential for Planters. From a financial standpoint, the Planters business is performing at the top end of our expectations, and we expect that trend to continue in fiscal '22.
Second, we are also taking a series of actions at Jennie-O Turkey Store. Over time, we expect these actions to result in a more demand-oriented and optimized Turkey portfolio that is better aligned to the changing needs of our customers, consumers and operators that will result in long-term growth, improved profitability and lower earnings volatility.
The transformation starts with accelerating our efforts to shift from commodity to branded value-added products. This is similar to the successful strategy we have executed in Refrigerated Foods over the past 15 years. As a result, we will close the Benson Avenue plant located in Willmar, Minnesota in the first half of fiscal 2022. This plant is an older, inefficient facility, which produces numerous commodity items. Value-added products will be consolidated into multiple other facilities. Team members will transition to our newer and larger facility also located in Willmar, which will supplement staffing levels.
Finally, we will continue to integrate business functions into the Hormel Foods parent organization. Over the past 2 years, we have successfully integrated IT services, finance and accounting and HR into the Hormel organization through Project Orion, and we will continue these efforts for other functions. By doing so, we will bring the deep turkey expertise and competitive advantages of the Jennie-O team to the broader organization. I want to be very clear that turkey will continue to play an important role in our company for many brands, including Columbus, Applegate, Hormel Natural Choice in addition to Jennie-O.
Turkey is vital to our balanced business model, serves to diversify our portfolio and it's important to consumers who are looking for high-protein, lean and versatile offerings. We will provide a further update and details on the financial components and timing on our first quarter call.
Finally, we made additional progress on optimizing our pork supply chain by signing a new 5-year raw material supply agreement with our supplier in Fremont, Nebraska. This new agreement more closely matches our pork supply with the needs of our value-added businesses while simultaneously reducing the amount of commodity pork we sell. Similar to the rationale for selling the Fremont plant in 2018, this new agreement further diversifies us away from commodity sales, increases our flexibility within our supply chain and decreases our earnings volatility.
This agreement should result in a reduction of approximately $350 million of commodity fresh pork sales at very low margins. The impact is split between the Refrigerated Foods and International segments. The contract will be effective at the start of calendar year 2022.
The success we are having with Planters, the actions we are taking at Jennie-O Turkey Store and the continued progress we are making in our pork supply chain all provide great insights into how we are continuing to evolve Hormel Foods for next year and beyond. And not only have we evolved our portfolio, but we will continue to evolve how we operate as a company with initiatives such as One Supply Chain, Project Orion and our digital experience group.
Looking at fiscal 2022, we expect net sales to be between $11.7 billion and $12.5 billion and for diluted earnings per share to be between $1.87 and $2.03 per share. We expect growth in excess of our long-term goals due to organic growth across each of our segments and strength in our Planters business. I have confidence in our ability to achieve our guidance with all 4 segments delivering growth.
Jacinth Smiley will provide more color regarding key drivers to our fiscal 2022 outlook. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss financial information relating to the quarter."

The company achieved record fourth quarter and full year sales of $3.5 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively. Organic sales increased 32% for the quarter and 14% for the full year. Planters contributed $411 million in sales",812,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning. The company achieved record fourth quarter and full year sales of $3.5 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively. Organic sales increased 32% for the quarter and 14% for the full year. Planters contributed $411 million in sales for the full year. Earnings before taxes increased 26% for the fourth quarter. Strong results in Refrigerated, International and the inclusion of Planters led to the strong finish to the year despite ongoing inflationary pressures.
Earnings before taxes increased 1% for the full year compared to fiscal 2020. Diluted earnings per share of $0.51 was a record. This was a 19% increase over last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year was $1.73, a 4% increase from last year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.66.
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 7.5% compared to 7.9% last year. Strong sales growth and disciplined cost management contributed to the improvement. Advertising investments increased 12% compared to last year. As anticipated, operating margins in the fourth quarter increased compared to the third quarter as a result of effective pricing action. Segment margins expanded from last quarter by 136 basis points to 10.7%, with increases in each segment.
In 2021, inflation, labor shortages and the Planters deal cost all negatively impacted margins. The fourth quarter results, including the continued strong demand of our products, are an indication of improved market conditions as we exit the year. Net unallocated expenses in 2021 increased primarily as a result of onetime acquisition cost for Planters and higher interest expense.
The effective tax rate for the year was 19.3% compared to 18.5% last year. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was a record, resulting from strong earnings and disciplined working capital management. Our balanced business model and consistent cash flow provided protection against the complex and challenging business dynamics we navigated during the year, allowing us to invest in numerous capital projects, acquire Planters and grow the dividend. We paid our 373rd consecutive quarterly dividend effective November 15 at an annual rate of $0.98 per share. We also announced a 6% increase for 2022, marking the 56th consecutive year of dividend increases.
During 2021, the company repurchased 500,000 shares for $20 million. Capital expenditures were $232 million. The company ended 2021 with $3.3 billion in debt or approximately 2.5x EBITDA. Although no mandatory debt repayments are required until 2024, based on our strong cash flow, we expect to make incremental payments as soon as the second half of 2022. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and deleveraging to 1.5 to 2x EBITDA by 2023.
Market conditions for pork input costs remained elevated during the fourth quarter. The USDA composite cutout averaged 33% higher compared to last year, supported by strong demand for pork and historically low cold storage levels. Hog prices averaged 62% higher than last year but were down 27% compared to the third quarter. Belly, pork trim and beef trim markets were also significantly higher for the quarter compared to last year.
The latest estimates from the USDA indicate pork production for the year to decrease 2% compared to 2020 and remain relatively flat in 2022. Labor shortages may continue to be a significant factor affecting industry production.
Turkey industry fundamentals were strong. The whole turkey and thigh meat markets reached all-time highs during the fourth quarter, with breast meat prices above a year ago. Supporting these prices were historically low cold storage levels, lower pulp placements and decline in egg sets.
Higher feed costs and labor shortages continue to negatively impact Jennie-O. Feed costs increased over 60% from last year in the fourth quarter. In 2022, we anticipate pork, beef, turkey and feed prices to remain above historical levels. We delivered strong results in the fourth quarter as the team overcame challenging operating conditions and volatile markets. The performance is a testament to the strength of our brands, pricing power, balanced model and the team's ability to execute in a dynamic market environment.
On a personal note, as I reach the end of my career at Hormel, I am thankful for the privilege of working for this great company for the past 43 years. I appreciate the support of Jim Snee, the Board of Directors and my team over my tenure as CFO. I take great pride in the evolution and accomplishments of the company during my career and leave with the greatest confidence in the future. I have enjoyed my interactions with the shareholders and analyst community, and I wish you well.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley. I know the company is in excellent hands with Jacinth, and you will have an opportunity to get to know her better in the coming months. Jacinth will provide an overview of the fiscal 2022 guidance and further context on our expectations for next year."

For analysts and the investment community on the call, I look forward to meeting you in the coming weeks and months. I'm excited to be stepping into the Chief Financial Officer role at Hormel Foods, a company known for its financial strength, its powerhouse brands and its commitment to employees and communities. In the time I have been at the company, I have found that the Hormel Foods is innovative and has a results-driven focus for all stakeholders.
As Jim mentioned, allow me to share a bit more commentary regarding key drivers to our fiscal 2022 outlook. Building on the momentum we established during the second half of the year and the strategic investments we have made throughout the pandemic, we expect to generate sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2022 above the long-term goals we announced at our investor update in October. We anticipate growth from all 4 segments driven by continued elevated demand for our products, the impact from our pricing actions, improved production throughput, new capacity for key categories such as pizza toppings and dry sausage and the full year contribution of the Planters business.
We also expect operating margins to show improvement throughout the year, similar to the dynamic we experienced in the fourth quarter. It is important to note that rapid changes in raw material input costs can shift profitability between quarters.
In addition to generating strong sales and earnings growth, we will continue to invest in our leading brands through increases in strategic marketing and advertising, capacity expansions for high-growth platforms and capabilities to drive industry-leading innovation. The company's target for capital expenditures in 2022 is $310 million. We are scheduled to open a pepperoni expansion to our newest facility in Omaha during the second quarter, which will provide the needed capacity to meet growing demand in our retail and foodservice businesses.
We are also beginning work on another expansion for the SPAM family of products scheduled to be operational in 2023. In addition to these larger projects, we are continuing to invest in cost savings, technology and automation projects to drive long-term savings and efficiencies.
Pivoting to innovation, we achieved our 15% goal in 2021. We have strong innovation platforms for brands such as Planters, SKIPPY, Justin's, Herdez and Hormel Black Label at retail as well as the Jennie-O and Happy Little Plants brands in the foodservice channel. These platforms, in addition to our continuous process and product improvement initiatives, give us the confidence going forward to consistently achieve our stated innovation goals.
I want to speak for a moment about the complexities of our operating environment. The operating environment is expected to remain complex in fiscal 2022, and our guidance accounts for the near-term impacts from labor shortages, higher costs and supply chain disruption. Our entire team has done an excellent job executing our business strategies in this dynamic environment.
In many ways, we have enhanced our competency for solving the day-to-day challenges inherent to our industry. We have increased our efforts to hire and maintain team members and have developed many strategies to mitigate the effect of labor shortages to meet elevated demand. This includes maximizing our flexibility to produce the items that are most in demand and leveraging our manufacturing partnerships to increase throughput wherever possible.
Our One Supply Chain team allows us to continue to actively manage our raw material procurement, logistics network and supply partnerships to minimize the impact of further inflation and supply chain disruption. We will also benefit from our expanded logistics network, which has added capacity for both the Refrigerated and Grocery Products business. As a result of these actions, we expect improved fill rates and load factors in fiscal 2022.
The announcement of the Jennie-O Turkey Store transformation is another step in our evolution to become a stronger global branded food company. Consistent with our long-term strategy, we are continuing our efforts to actively shift away from commodity businesses towards branded, value-added businesses. We expect a strategic and intentional actions to create a better, more profitable and sustainable business model.
Taking all of these factors into account, as Jim has mentioned, we're setting our full year sales guidance at $11.7 billion to $12.5 billion and our diluted earnings per share guidance at $1.87 to $2.03. Additionally, this guidance reflects the Benson Avenue facility closure, our new pork raw material supply agreement and an effective tax rate between 20.5% and 22.5%. Fiscal 2022 will be 52 weeks.
As we move forward to execute against our strategic imperatives in 2022 and beyond, I'm pleased to be with a company that continues to evolve as a global-branded food company. Jim often says, we are uncommon. I have seen that first hand in my time with the company thus far. This starts with our unwavering commitment to employee safety and remaining an employer of choice in the communities we live and work. We're taking purposeful actions to transform our company as we embark on our most ambitious corporate responsibility journey yet, our 20 By 30 challenge, which is certainly important from an ESG standpoint.
Our experienced management team, the tireless work of our team members around the world and the progress made to implement the Project Orion and One Supply chain initiatives gives us added confidence in our ability to deliver growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond. I am excited to be with Hormel Foods and be part of this -- its continued success.

We've seen the evolution of our company, whether it was Project Orion, our one Supply Chain effort, really this opportunity to move away from duplication of resources. That's the first thing.
The second thing is when -- we're honest with ourselves, the business has underperformed in recent years. And that's not through a lack of effort on our team's part. That's dealing with a significant oversupply situation that's created a lot of volatility for us. And so as you think about how we've managed other parts of the business, it kind of flew in the face of really what we've been trying to achieve.
So really, this announcement today is a bigger step in that evolution to make sure that we're moving from a commodity-driven or a supply-driven business to a more demand, consumer-driven business. It also allows us to move towards a more fully integrated supply chain. So I mean, there's still a lot of work to be done.

I think the other thing to really understand is just the labor pool in general. And the idea of we're going to rely on the traditional labor pool that you've always had, it's not going to get to where you need to be.
So our team has done a really nice job of sourcing nontraditional labor pools, being creative in how we're staffing our facilities to make sure that we are becoming more employee-friendly. And we've seen an improvement. I mean I'm not going to spike the football here and say that we're over the hump, but we have seen some improvement in our labor rates.
And even more importantly is we've seen some improvement in key plants for us. So key plants, meaning 2 of our larger refrigerated foods plants have seen dramatic improvement in labor rates. Two of our grocery product plants have seen improvements in labor rates. So that's been really helpful as we've progressed throughout the fourth quarter and then head into 2022. So the staffing levels that we're talking about are really helpful. We still have work to do, but it is setting us up for a better 2022."

The other thing to remember in all of this that we've talked about many times is our Grocery Products pricing is very sticky. And so the pricing that we've taken and that we're in the midst of executing, the additional price increase, that pricing will, by and large, sustain.
On the refrigerated side, that underlying pricing commodity, we do track that more closely, both in retail and foodservice. So we'll react accordingly there. But I think your comment is a fair one.

So I think we've done a great job with our pricing. I think it's been very effective. We will have times that volatility will help you and hurt you at times, but you really have to look at this as a long-term trend.

So that's been very, very helpful, whether it's been racking, loaders, the transfer vehicles. I mean it's an incredibly automated facility. But you're starting with a more recent blueprint.
In some of our existing facilities, we've always talked about the need for automation and have looked to find those opportunities. But I would say that it's -- the opportunity projects have accelerated over the last 12 to 18 months. And so we've got a number of projects across multiple facilities where we've talked about the package placement. We've talked about a lot of the boxing and other packaging opportunities. Mark Coffey did a really nice job in his One Supply Chain video during our investor update demonstrating that.
But I think the other part, and you mentioned it, is how we think about automation going forward and then how do you factor in that labor component, which maybe wasn't as important to factor in, in previous years. But I do think that's going to be part of that opportunity cost that has to be figured into the automation equation as we go forward.
I mean we -- as we think about it from an engineering perspective, we're allocating resources in our engineering organization that we've never had before to make sure that not only are we identifying existing automation, but really helping to support and develop automation that isn't even out there yet that we believe we need in our operations.

Do you -- have you seen any incremental opportunities to grow that business and to kind of combine it with existing snacking opportunities? And where do you think this is going to turn out in a more of a medium-term time frame?"

I mean on the retail front, we are having different, more fruitful conversations with retailers in regards to snacking as a category and how we approach that as an organization. And that's exactly what we expected on the retail side.
On the foodservice or convenience store channel, the same thing is happening. We're having much different conversations with convenience store operators. In the past, everything we did was the back of the house when you went in to get food for sandwiches or pizza. Now that retail section of the convenience stores has been opened up because now we have something to talk about with Planters, and we're able to follow on with other parts of our portfolio.
And so I think those are the new things for us. There were some basics, blocking and tackling that we knew we'd be able to get done as well in terms of filling distribution gaps just like we did when we acquired the SKIPPY business. So again, you start piecing this all together, and that's why we remain so optimistic about the acquisition and what it holds for us going forward."

And when you're looking to source those, it's about supply, it's not cost. And so there are a lot of those examples on a week-to-week basis in the environment we're in right now.
I think as the entire supply chain, backwards and forward, starts to moderate throughout the year, we'll be able to capture more of those or have those go away. So it will be less of an impact.
