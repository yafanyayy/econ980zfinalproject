We started this year off on a positive note, and we're excited about our momentum. We took share in the contact lens market with strength in our silicone hydrogel p",1725,"Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper's fiscal first quarter conference call. We started this year off on a positive note, and we're excited about our momentum. 
We took share in the contact lens market with strength in our silicone hydrogel portfolio, led by MyDay and Biofinity. Our myopia management portfolio continued to strengthen, including MiSight growing 82% to $3 million and CooperSurgical posted a very strong quarter with PARAGARD growing 16% and fertility 10%. 
With both businesses outperforming, we delivered robust earnings and cash flow and expect continued strong performance moving forward. 
Regarding the quarter and reporting all percentages on a constant currency basis, even with continuing COVID challenges, we posted consolidated revenues of $681 million with CooperVision revenues of $507 million, up 1% and CooperSurgical revenues of $174 million, up 7%. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.17. For CooperVision, we saw strength in our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio and in our Biofinity franchise, along with general strength in torics and multifocals. 
By geography, the Americas grew 6%, led by strength in Biofinity and daily silicones, including nice growth from both clariti and MyDay. 
EMEA was down 4% as several countries continued managing through stringent COVID-related restrictions. We did see growth in our daily silicones and Biofinity though, so that bodes well for the future. 
Asia Pac was up 3%, led by strength in MyDay, especially in Japan. Overall, sales exceeded expectations, and we're well positioned to continue growing and taking share with current and future product launches driving momentum. 
Moving to some additional quarterly numbers. Our silicone hydrogel dailies grew 8% with both MyDay and clariti growing. Particular strength was noted in MyDay and especially MyDay toric as we continue rolling that product out around the world. 
Overall, dailies silicones are leading the market right now as health and wellness trends drive adoption, and we believe that will continue as there's still $2.4 billion in annual global sales of older hydrogels that need to be traded up. 
Moving to our FRP portfolio. Biofinity grew 6% with strike noted in Biofinity Energys and Biofinity toric multifocal. 
I've mentioned these products before, but as a reminder, Energys is a truly unique and innovative lens that uses digital zone optics to help alleviate eye fatigue from excessive screen time. 
In today's world, this product has the ability to perform well, and we're seeing that. And our Biofinity toric multifocal was launched last year and is doing extremely well. 
This is a made-to-order product and part of our extensive offering of unique products that differentiate our business. 
Regarding product launches, we remain incredibly active. We now have regulatory approval to launch clariti in Japan, and we'll be doing that shortly. And that's in addition to our ongoing successful launch of a second base curve for MyDay sphere in that market. 
We're also continuing to launch and relaunch MyDay sphere and toric in many other markets around the world. We're continuing to roll out of Biofinity toric multifocal, including launching in Europe shortly, and we're rolling out extended toric ranges for clariti and Biofinity. 
Additionally, our pipeline is strong, and we expect to remain very active going forward. And lastly, we're incredibly busy with our myopia management portfolio of MiSight and Ortho K lenses, which grew 46% for the quarter to $12 million. 
Within this, MiSight grew 82% to $3 million and Ortho K grew 37%, including $1 million of revenue from our acquisition of GP specialists from August of last year. 
With respect to MiSight, we now have over 30,000 kids around the world wearing the lens, including  over 2,000 in the U.S. and our momentum is accelerating. 
Our launch activity continues to go extremely well, and we expect similar success in new markets such as South Korea, where we'll be launching in the next few months. 
We've also made advancements in discussions with several large retailers and buying groups regarding MiSight and even moved into a test phase with 1 large retailer for roughly 70 stores. 
We've also received several awards recently, including from contact lens spectrum and popular science, and we're making advancements with multiple professional associations, helping to get myopia management recognize the standard of care. And we made great progress with several universities, supporting the training and education of their optometry students as many schools are now adding myopia management training courses to their curriculums. 
From a bidding perspective, if we look at U.S. data, the average age for a new MiSight wear remains 11 years old and in a positive sign, it's trending younger. Comparing this to the average age of a regular new contact lens wear of 17 shows we're bringing kids into contacts at a much younger age, which is fantastic. 
This is all extremely exciting and supports our goal of reaching or exceeding $25 million of MiSight sales this fiscal year and over $50 million next year. 
Moving to myopia management spectacles, I want to touch on our recent acquisition of [indiscernible] Vision and our partnership with EssilorLuxottica. 
[indiscernible] Vision has developed innovative spectacles to reduce the progression of myopia and children, and our joint venture with EssilorLuxottica will leverage our shared expertise and global leadership in myopia management to accelerate the commercialization of these spectacles around the world. 
We're now working through the typical regulatory requirements to form the JV, and we started developing launch plans in certain markets as we await the 2-year clinical data, which will be out in the next couple of months. 
The [indiscernible] technology is a great complement to our existing myopia management portfolio of contact lenses and working with a great partner like EssilorLuxottica will accelerate growth of the entire pediatric vision marketplace. 
More to follow on this exciting opportunity as we continue making progress. 
To wrap up on myopia management, we're at the forefront of an extremely exciting global pediatric opportunity. This market is in its infancy, but the growth is exciting and having the only FDA-approved product in MiSight has been a game changer. We're continuing to invest in sales and marketing programs and new launches, regulatory approvals and R&D to keep driving adoption on a global basis. Proactively addressing the progression of myopia in pediatric patients offers immediate visual correction along with many long-term health benefits, such as reducing the risk of serious eye disease later in life, such as retinal detachment, cataracts and glaucoma. So this effort is important, and it's why so many eye care professionals are getting involved and strongly supporting this activity. 
To conclude our vision, let me add that the continuing rollout of vaccines will definitely benefit us given the consumer nature of our business. 
In the near term, we expect better foot traffic and retail outlets, especially malls, along with increasing service capacity and better staffing attendance and optometry offices. We also expect a strong back-to-school season as in-person learning returns around the world. On a longer-term basis, our growth drivers remain strong and are likely improving with the macro trend of people spending more time on electronic devices. It's estimated that roughly 1/3 of the world is currently myopic, and that's expected to increase to 50% by 2050. 
Combining this trend with a continuing shift to daily silicones, geographic expansion and growth in torics and multifocals, our industry has a very bright future. 
For CooperVision, our robust product portfolio, active product launch activity, momentum with myopia management and strong new fit data puts us in a great position for long-term sustainable growth. 
Moving to CooperSurgical. We had a very strong quarter led by PARAGARD and fertility. Overall revenues were $174 million, up a healthy 7% as markets rebounded and we took share. I'm really excited about the state of CooperSurgical right now under the fantastic leadership of Holly and our team and the future looks extremely bright. 
Starting with fertility. Revenues grew 10% year-over-year to $70 million with strikes seen around the world and throughout our product portfolio. We're taking share and we're well positioned for future gains with improving traction in our key accounts. One of the strengths of our fertility business is our broad product portfolio, which essentially covers the full spectrum of fertility clinics needs outside of pharma products. 
We've done a great job cross-selling and building relationships with the larger clinics around the world, And this has resulted in solid growth in areas ranging from consumable products like pets, media and RI Witness, our RFID lab-based management system that I discussed last quarter, to equipment such as incubators and workstations to genetic testing. 
From a market perspective, COVID is still negatively impacting patient flow and some important countries like India are still significantly hampered, but we're definitely seeing a pickup in activity. 
In the meantime, we're taking market share, and we expect that to continue. Overall, the fertility market has extremely positive long-term macro growth trends, and we're well positioned to capitalize on these trends to drive growth. 
Within our office and surgical unit, we were up 5%, led by PARAGARD's growth of 16%. PARAGARD performed better than expected as patient activity remains strong, driven by the positive health and wellness trends we're seeing in the U.S. 
As the only 100% hormone-free IUD in the U.S. market, the product offers a fantastic long-lasting birth control option that addresses the needs and interest of women looking for a healthy alternative. 
We're very bullish on PARAGARD right now and believe we'll continue posting solid growth this year. Elsewhere, we've seen deferred elective procedures steadily rescheduled and our medical device sales have improved. Several of our focus products grew in the quarter, including Endosee Advance, our direct visualization system for evaluation of the endometrial. INSORB, our patented surgical skin closure device and our portfolio of uterine manipulators. 
Before I turn it over to Brian, let me close by mentioning our efforts to further enhance our strong focus on environmental matters, corporate responsibility and good governance. We made great progress over the past several years, and we have a lot of exciting things happening today. We just completed an ESG materiality assessment to ensure we stay focused on the right areas and my passion and commitment to this type of work remains very strong. 
If anyone has any questions or interest in our ESG efforts, please reach out and let's connect. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Our fourth quarter consolidated revenues increased 5% year-over-yea",738,"Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. 
Our fourth quarter consolidated revenues increased 5% year-over-year or 3% in constant currency to $681 million. Consolidated gross margin increased 50 basis points year-over-year to 67.8%. This improvement was driven by strength in CooperSurgical with higher-margin PARAGARD and fertility consumable products performing extremely well along with favorable currency. 
Moving forward, we're in excellent shape to continue delivering solid gross margins. We completed our manufacturing restructuring activity in Q1, so we're well positioned for the current environment, along with being ready to efficiently ramp up quickly as demand continues to rebound. 
We still have absorption related inefficiencies, but we expect those to go away with sales growth. OpEx was up only 2.1% year-over-year as we kept expenses under control. This resulted in consolidated operating margins of 26.9%, up nicely from 25% last year. This performance exceeded expectations, and we expect to continue posting strong results, balancing expense control against investment opportunities that we see within our business, particularly within myopia management. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $6.4 million, driven by lower rates and lower average debt and the effective tax rate was 11.3%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.17 with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding. 
Free cash flow was solid at $92 million comprised of $148 million of operating cash flow, offset by $56 million of CapEx. 
Net debt increased slightly to $1.7 billion, while our adjusted leverage ratio decreased to 2.1x with improving EBITDA. And finally, we repurchased $25 million worth of stock this past quarter at an average price of $357 per share. 
In addition to our strong operational performance, we completed several tuck-in acquisitions recently. During the quarter, we acquired Embryo options to add a cryo storage software solution to our fertility portfolio, allowing clinics to automate the management of cryopreserved embryos eggs and sperm. 
The business did $4.7 million in sales last year and added $500,000 in revenue in our Q1. 
Within CooperVision, as Al mentioned, we acquired the remaining 80% stake of SightGlass vision in January for $41 million in cash plus aggregate potential earnouts of up to $139 million based on revenue milestones and regulatory approvals. 
After the close of the quarter, we entered into an agreement to form a 50-50 joint venture with EssilorLuxottica that we hope to close soon. Also subsequent to quarter end, we closed 2 more tuck-in deals at CooperSurgical. The first was the GA Medical, a pre-revenue manufacturer of an in-office water vapor ablation system that will launch shortly. And Safe obstetric systems owner of fetal pile, a balloon device used during C-sections to make the delivery less traumatic for the mother and baby. The business did [ $4.4  million ] in sales last year. And we repurchased -- I'm sorry, we purchased it for $52 million in cash plus a potential earnout of up to $14 million. 
Before moving to guidance, you'll note in our earnings release that our GAAP earnings were much higher than our non-GAAP. This is directly tied to the tax item I discussed last quarter where CooperVision's intellectual property and related assets were transferred to the U.K. in November 2020. 
For non-GAAP purposes, we adjusted for this activity and will continue doing so moving forward. 
Moving to guidance. We continue to monitor and evaluate the scope, duration and impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. While we still view resurgences as a significant risk factor, our visibility has improved. So we're now providing full year 2021 guidance to provide a better feel for our expected upcoming performance, including our anticipated myopia management investments. 
The guidance includes consolidated revenues of $2.8 billion to $2.845 billion, up 15% to 17% or up 12% to 14% in constant currency. 
With CooperVision revenues of $2.090 billion to $2.120 billion, up 13% to 15% or up 9% to 11% and in constant currency. And CooperSurgical revenues of $710 million to $725 million, up 21% to 23% or 19% to 22% in constant currency. 
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $12.90 to $13.10 . Lastly, on free cash flow, we now expect to approach $500 million this year as operating cash flow improves and CapEx reduces. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

Now that we're no longer giving product away for free, I mean, within -- I think we're somewhere around 3,000, maybe a little bit over 3,000 certified fitters right now, tons of activity with the organizations, with the colleges, with fitters, ramping up volumes. We're seeing -- we're having great success with our launches right now in Russia and Taiwan, other activity going on, including discussions with retailers and buying groups right now who are looking at figuring out ways to get MiSight into their organizations to do in more of a bulk manner, if you will. 
So just a lot of momentum in a lot of different areas makes us optimistic. And we see that every single month. We saw more of that in February. So certainly continuing to move in the right direction with MiSight."

We don't have it in our guidance really, but we have the opportunity, I think, for a stronger back half of the year when you look at back-to-school activity. I mean you look at here in California as an example, kids haven't been to school in person in a year. So when you have back-to-school activity, you're going to have kids, not only the kids who would normally be coming in, having problems seeing the blackboard so to speak, but you're going to have all the kids that should have had it addressed last year because kids are working on video screens and things that are right in front of their faces now. 
So I do think that there's a potential certainly for pent-up demand, if you will, or kind of a boom or something like that with back-to-school activity being in person. But that's on the come and I hope that happens. We're not really counting on that. We're ever trying to build that into our guidance. But we are seeing new fits continue to improve. Demand is there. We're seeing that on a global basis. I don't want to get into quarters but -- or months. But I mean, I will say February grew.

We're getting good growth here in the Americas when you look at somewhere like Canada. We're just at the very early stages here in the U.S. of a lot of the revenue recognition. So we have thousands of kids, a couple of thousands or more wearing the lens right now. So I think if we continue to be successful here in the U.S., that's great. And we will continue to be successful. I mean, I see the numbers, I see the ramps coming, I see the fittings all the way through February here, see the revenues moving up nicely, all that kind of stuff. 
But I would not diminish outside of the U.S., I mean, whatever, it was $2.9 million, growing 80% and accelerating. So that's going to drive a lot of the growth."

So if you kind of go back in time and you look over it, right, you're talking about like for this quarter as an example for us because of the fiscal quarter was November, December, January, right? So you can imagine that's a little bit of a struggle anyway. That's why our sales are lower, right? 
You have optometry offices closed. You have the holidays, you have everything going on, you're trying to fit a brand-new thing here. So we were pretty happy that the $3 million exceeded our expectations, that roll-off is continuing to happen. You're getting docs fit, they're out fitting patients. They're getting more comfortable about it. They're learning about it. People around the world are hearing more about it. So you're going to continue to progress on that. And the $25 million is not requiring something crazy, right? Like let's just say it goes to $4.5 million as an example in Q2. And then it moves up towards $6.5 million, $7 million, something like that. And then into $10 million, $11 million, $12 million, something like that. I mean it's a pretty decent just normal kind of progression as we move through. And we have pretty decent visibility on that to be comfortable around that. 
And then the next year, right, the $50 million. If we're doing $25 million plus this year, you definitely become more comfortable with the $50 million, especially when you're confident against having given a lot of product away for free."

So that's why I keep saying, hey, I think the combination of those 2 together is really a powerful tool. 
When you look at outside of the U.S. kind of Canada, some of the markets where we've been selling MiSight for a while. Now we're not seeing a lot of dropouts. We're seeing the kids come in at a very significant portion of those kids stay in and continue to purchase supplies after a year. The 1 kind of neat thing we're starting to see in some of those more developed markets where we've had the product right now for a little while, is quite a bit more interest from some of the retailers about looking at it saying, Hey, we want to take some of our retail operations and open up myopia management segments to the stores and so forth. 
So we want to trial that. We want to see if we can really make this work. We see these independents having a lot of success and really growing.

I think on the contact lens one, what we're seeing right now and what our surveys are showing is that contact lenses will play a bigger part of the myopia management market than they do in general for vision correction. And part of that is certainly tied to the efficacy that we see, right? You put a contact lens in, you're getting the full treatment 100% of the time, right? Kids can take glasses off. They can do a variety of things with glasses, right? 
So when you're talking about a treatment, you want that full treatment at all times. So our work and our interaction with optometrists and survey work and so forth shows that you're going to see contact lenses being a greater percent usage than what we're used to seeing. 
Having said that, I happen to still believe that there's a big part of the market that's going to want to wear glasses and parents are going to be more comfortable putting their kids into glasses. So that will be bigger. That's maybe that 60% of the market or something like that ultimately. 
On PARAGARD, yes, we're doing some advertising there. And there's some new advertising that's coming out. Nothing I would go crazy about for anybody. I mean we've been spending kind of a similar amount of money in the last couple of years, and I would expect that again in terms of spend, which means more dollars flow into the bottom line. The 1 thing I would say about PARAGARD is we grew, what, 16%. It was a strong quarter. I would expect us to continue to have strong growth. And we're going to have really strong growth in the next couple of quarters because we really didn't have sales in April and May. 
The health and wellness kind of trends that we're seeing out there that are helping to drive like daily SiHy, they're helping to drive PARAGARD also. So there's more interest out there right now tied to that. So we'll see how some of that plays out. But at this time, I kind of wouldn't lead you to believe anything different from a spending perspective, but I'm optimistic from a revenue perspective, that's for sure."

And we'll start to get some leverage from that, certainly as we start -- as we move into next year and the following year. But that's a high-margin product, high gross margin that will have high operating margins. So once that stops being a drag, if you will, and starts turning to be a positive. The rest of the business is pretty good. I mean you see what's going on with Surgical right now, that part of the business is becoming a little bigger that has higher gross margins, great operating margins, the core CooperVision business has good margins and should continue to be solid, if you will, with an add-on from MiSight. So I think if I was now, I'd say, Hey, we're going to -- the contact lens market is going to come back and go back to its normal 5% to 6% growth. I think you're going to see us continuing to take share off that plus myopia management on top of that. So I would expect some pretty good numbers if you're doing an LRP going out 4 or 5 years."

We see how well the fits are going, and we can calibrate that back to a place like Canada, where we're having a lot of success in Canada back to Spain, where we're having a lot of success. 
So we kind of take the numbers that we've already seen in some markets. And we say, okay, in these new markets, if they grow similar to what we've seen in other markets, this is kind of what we're looking at. And that's how we build those numbers that you're referencing, right? The $25 million to $50 million to $100 million is, hey, we're just going to continue to perform like we've been performing in spots where we've launched the product, where I think we have some additional upside to that ends up being with these -- the retailers and the buying groups. Because right now, you're talking largely independent optometrists who are really grabbing a hold of this product and really excited about it. 
If you start rolling that into some of these bigger retailers or these bigger buying groups who grab a hold of it and want to push it, then I think you have upside to those numbers. But basically, to go back to answer a little simply, we're just taking our historical success rates and rolling those out. And that's what we're seeing, right? We see that on a monthly basis in Taiwan and Russia and here in the U.S. and in the Nordic region and so forth."

On the competitive environment. Yes, I mean you know our space. We have good competitors out there and big guys out there who we go against, [ 2 ] are launching products. And I talked about this in the past. We're doing the same. I think we're more active than our competitors in terms of our product launch activity. It's interesting because you guys have heard about MyDay for a long time, but we haven't been in a position where we've been able to put it out there really, right? We've been capacity constrained on like a MyDay toric. So to us at times, it feels like it's a brand-new launch, even though it's been around for a little while. So yes, I mean, good competitors with good products, and they're doing some good things out there. 
I think we are, too, and I think we're probably a little bit more active than they are on a global basis. So not too much to add other than that. I mean you go back to pre-COVID and the industry was growing to 5% to 6%, and we were taking a little bit of share. And I think that's ultimately where we're going to go.

We started this year off on a positive note, and we're excited about our momentum. We took share in the contact lens market with strength in our silicone hydrogel portfolio led by MyDay and Biofinity. Our myopia management portfolio continued to strengthen, including MiSight growing 82% to $3 million and CooperSurgical posted a very strong quarter with PARAGARD growing 16% and fertility 10%. With both businesses outperforming, we delivered robust earnings and cash flow and expect continued strong performance moving forward.
Regarding the quarter and reporting all percentages on a constant currency basis, even with continuing COVID challenges, we posted consolidated revenues of $681 million with CooperVision revenues of $507 million, up 1%; and CooperSurgical revenues of $174 million, up 7%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.17.
For CooperVision, we saw strength in our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio and in our Biofinity franchise, along with general strength in torics and multifocals.
By geography, the Americas grew 6% led by strength in Biofinity and daily silicones, including nice growth from both clariti and MyDay.
EMEA was down 4% as several countries continued managing through stringent COVID-related restrictions. We did see growth in our daily silicones and Biofinity, though, so that bodes well for the future.
Asia Pac was up 3% led by strength in MyDay, especially in Japan. Overall, sales exceeded expectations, and we're well positioned to continue growing and taking share with current and future product launches driving momentum.
Moving to some additional quarterly numbers. Our silicone hydrogel dailies grew 8% with both MyDay and clariti growing. Particular strength was noted in MyDay and especially MyDay toric as we continue rolling that product out around the world. Overall, dailies silicones are leading the market right now as health and wellness trends drive adoption, and we believe that will continue as there's still $2.4 billion in annual global sales of older hydrogels that need to be traded up.
Moving to our FRP portfolio. Biofinity grew 6% with strike noted in Biofinity Energys and Biofinity toric multifocal. I've mentioned these products before, but as a reminder, Energys is a truly unique and innovative lens that uses digital zone optics to help alleviate eye fatigue from excessive screen time. In today's world, this product has the ability to perform well, and we're seeing that. And our Biofinity toric multifocal was launched last year and is doing extremely well. This is a made-to-order product and part of our extensive offering of unique products that differentiate our business.
Regarding product launches, we remain incredibly active. We now have regulatory approval to launch clariti in Japan, and we'll be doing that shortly. And that's in addition to our ongoing successful launch of a second base curve for MyDay sphere in that market. We're also continuing to launch and relaunch MyDay sphere and toric in many other markets around the world. We're continuing the rollout of Biofinity toric multifocal, including launching in Europe shortly, and we're rolling out extended toric ranges for clariti and Biofinity. Additionally, our pipeline is strong, and we expect to remain very active going forward.
And lastly, we're incredibly busy with our myopia management portfolio of MiSight and ortho-k lenses, which grew 46% for the quarter to $12 million. Within this, MiSight grew 82% to $3 million and ortho-k grew 37%, including $1 million of revenue from our acquisition of GP Specialists from August of last year.
With respect to MiSight, we now have over 30,000 kids around the world wearing the lens, including  over 2,000 in the U.S., and our momentum is accelerating. Our launch activity continues to go extremely well, and we expect similar success in new markets such as South Korea where we'll be launching in the next few months. We've also made advancements in discussions with several large retailers and buying groups regarding MiSight and even moved into a test phase with 1 large retailer for roughly 70 stores.
We've also received several awards recently, including from Contact Lens Spectrum and Popular Science, and we're making advancements with multiple professional associations, helping to get myopia management recognize the standard of care. And we made great progress with several universities, supporting the training and education of their optometry students as many schools are now adding myopia management training courses to their curriculums.
From a fitting perspective, if we look at U.S. data, the average age for a new MiSight wear remains 11 years old, and in a positive sign, it's trending younger. Comparing this to the average age of a regular new contact lens wear of 17 shows we're bringing kids into contacts at a much younger age, which is fantastic. This is all extremely exciting and supports our goal of reaching or exceeding $25 million of MiSight sales this fiscal year and over $50 million next year.
Moving to myopia management spectacles, I want to touch on our recent acquisition of SightGlass Vision and our partnership with EssilorLuxottica. SightGlass Vision has developed innovative spectacles to reduce the progression of myopia in children, and our joint venture with EssilorLuxottica will leverage our shared expertise and global leadership in myopia management to accelerate the commercialization of these spectacles around the world. We're now working through the typical regulatory requirements to form the JV, and we started developing launch plans in certain markets as we await the 2-year clinical data, which will be out in the next couple of months.
The SightGlass technology is a great complement to our existing myopia management portfolio of contact lenses. And working with a great partner like EssilorLuxottica will accelerate growth of the entire pediatric vision marketplace. More to follow on this exciting opportunity as we continue making progress.
To wrap up on myopia management, we're at the forefront of an extremely exciting global pediatric opportunity. This market is in its infancy, but the growth is exciting, and having the only FDA-approved product in MiSight has been a game-changer. We're continuing to invest in sales and marketing programs and new launches, regulatory approvals and R&D to keep driving adoption on a global basis. Proactively addressing the progression of myopia in pediatric patients offers immediate visual correction, along with many long-term health benefits, such as reducing the risk of serious eye disease later in life, such as retinal detachment, cataracts and glaucoma. So this effort is important, and it's why so many eye care professionals are getting involved and strongly supporting this activity.
To conclude on vision, let me add that the continuing rollout of vaccines will definitely benefit us given the consumer nature of our business. In the near term, we expect better foot traffic in retail outlets, especially malls, along with increasing service capacity and better staffing attendance in optometry offices. We also expect a strong back-to-school season as in-person learning returns around the world.
On a longer-term basis, our growth drivers remain strong and are likely improving with the macro trend of people spending more time on electronic devices. It's estimated that roughly 1/3 of the world is currently myopic, and that's expected to increase to 50% by 2050. Combining this trend with a continuing shift to daily silicones, geographic expansion and growth in torics and multifocals, our industry has a very bright future.
For CooperVision, our robust product portfolio, active product launch activity, momentum with myopia management and strong new fit data puts us in a great position for long-term sustainable growth.
Moving to CooperSurgical. We had a very strong quarter led by PARAGARD and fertility. Overall revenues were $174 million, up a healthy 7% as markets rebounded and we took share. I'm really excited about the state of CooperSurgical right now under the fantastic leadership of Holly and our team, and the future looks extremely bright.
Starting with fertility. Revenues grew 10% year-over-year to $70 million with strikes seen around the world and throughout our product portfolio. We're taking share, and we're well positioned for future gains with improving traction in our key accounts. One of the strengths of our fertility business is our broad product portfolio, which essentially covers the full spectrum of fertility clinics' needs outside of pharma products.
We've done a great job cross-selling and building relationships with the larger clinics around the world, and this has resulted in solid growth in areas ranging from consumable products like pipettes, media and RI Witness, our RFID lab-based management system that I discussed last quarter, to equipment such as incubators and workstations to genetic testing.
From a market perspective, COVID is still negatively impacting patient flow, and some important countries like India are still significantly hampered, but we're definitely seeing a pickup in activity. In the meantime, we're taking market share, and we expect that to continue.
Overall, the fertility market has extremely positive long-term macro growth trends, and we're well positioned to capitalize on these trends to drive growth.
Within our office and surgical unit, we were up 5% led by PARAGARD's growth of 16%. PARAGARD performed better than expected as patient activity remains strong, driven by the positive health and wellness trends we're seeing in the U.S. As the only 100% hormone-free IUD in the U.S. market, the product offers a fantastic, long-lasting birth control option that addresses the needs and interest of women looking for a healthy alternative. We're very bullish on PARAGARD right now and believe we'll continue posting solid growth this year.
Elsewhere, we've seen deferred elective procedures steadily rescheduled, and our medical device sales have improved. Several of our focus products grew in the quarter, including Endosee Advance, our direct visualization system for evaluation of the endometrial; INSORB, our patented surgical skin closure device; and our portfolio of uterine manipulators.
Before I turn it over to Brian, let me close by mentioning our efforts to further enhance our strong focus on environmental matters, corporate responsibility and good governance. We made great progress over the past several years, and we have a lot of exciting things happening today. We just completed an ESG materiality assessment to ensure we stay focused on the right areas, and my passion and commitment to this type of work remains very strong. If anyone has any questions or interest in our ESG efforts, please reach out and let's connect.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
263609,703368159,2231250,"The Cooper Companies, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 04, 2021",2021-03-04,"Earnings Calls","The Cooper Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.Our fourth quarter consolidated revenues increased 5% year-over-year",734,"Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.
Our fourth quarter consolidated revenues increased 5% year-over-year or 3% in constant currency to $681 million. Consolidated gross margin increased 50 basis points year-over-year to 67.8%. This improvement was driven by strength in CooperSurgical with higher-margin PARAGARD and fertility consumable products performing extremely well, along with favorable currency.
Moving forward, we're in excellent shape to continue delivering solid gross margins. We completed our manufacturing restructuring activity in Q1, so we're well positioned for the current environment, along with being ready to efficiently ramp up quickly as demand continues to rebound.
We still have absorption-related inefficiencies, but we expect those to go away with sales growth. OpEx was up only 2.1% year-over-year as we kept expenses under control. This resulted in consolidated operating margins of 26.9%, up nicely from 25% last year. This performance exceeded expectations, and we expect to continue posting strong results, balancing expense control against investment opportunities that we see within our business, particularly within myopia management.
Interest expense for the quarter was $6.4 million driven by lower rates and lower average debt, and the effective tax rate was 11.3%.
Non-GAAP EPS was $3.17 with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding.
Free cash flow was solid at $92 million comprised of $148 million of operating cash flow, offset by $56 million of CapEx.
Net debt increased slightly to $1.7 billion, while our adjusted leverage ratio decreased to 2.1x with improving EBITDA.
And finally, we repurchased $25 million worth of stock this past quarter at an average price of $357 per share.
In addition to our strong operational performance, we completed several tuck-in acquisitions recently. During the quarter, we acquired Embryo Options to add a cryo storage software solution to our fertility portfolio, allowing clinics to automate the management of cryopreserved embryos, eggs and sperm. The business did $4.7 million in sales last year and added $500,000 in revenue in our Q1.
Within CooperVision, as Al mentioned, we acquired the remaining 80% stake of SightGlass Vision in January for $41 million in cash plus aggregate potential earnouts of up to $139 million based on revenue milestones and regulatory approvals.
After the close of the quarter, we entered into an agreement to form a 50-50 joint venture with EssilorLuxottica that we hope to close soon. Also subsequent to quarter end, we closed 2 more tuck-in deals at CooperSurgical: the first was the GA Medical, a pre-revenue manufacturer of an in-office water vapor ablation system that will launch shortly; and Safe Obstetric Systems, owner of Fetal Pillow, a balloon device used during C-sections to make the delivery less traumatic for the mother and baby. The business did $4.4 million in sales last year. And we repurchased -- I'm sorry, we purchased it for $52 million in cash plus a potential earnout of up to $14 million.
Before moving to guidance, you'll note in our earnings release that our GAAP earnings were much higher than our non-GAAP. This is directly tied to the tax item I discussed last quarter where CooperVision's intellectual property and related assets were transferred to the U.K. in November 2020. For non-GAAP purposes, we adjusted for this activity and will continue doing so moving forward.
Moving to guidance. We continue to monitor and evaluate the scope, duration and impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. While we still view resurgences as a significant risk factor, our visibility has improved. So we're now providing full year 2021 guidance to provide a better feel for our expected upcoming performance, including our anticipated myopia management investments.
The guidance includes consolidated revenues of $2.8 billion to $2.845 billion, up 15% to 17% or up 12% to 14% in constant currency; with CooperVision revenues of $2.090 billion to $2.120 billion, up 13% to 15% or up 9% to 11% and in constant currency; and CooperSurgical revenues of $710 million to $725 million, up 21% to 23% or 19% to 22% in constant currency.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $12.90 to $13.10. Lastly, on free cash flow, we now expect to approach $500 million this year as operating cash flow improves and CapEx reduces.
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

So you can imagine what's coming in the U.S. market. Now that we're no longer giving product away for free, I mean, within -- I think we're somewhere around 3,000, maybe a little bit over 3,000 certified fitters right now, tons of activity with the organizations, with the colleges, with fitters, ramping up volumes. We're seeing -- we're having great success with our launches right now in Russia and Taiwan, other activity going on, including discussions with retailers and buying groups right now who are looking at figuring out ways to get MiSight into their organizations to do in more of a bulk manner, if you will.
So just a lot of momentum in a lot of different areas makes us optimistic. And we see that every single month. We saw more of that in February. So certainly continuing to move in the right direction with MiSight."

I mean, usually, Q1 is our lowest and Q2 is a little better, and then we kind of accelerate up in Q3 and Q4. I think we have the opportunity. We don't have it in our guidance, really, but we have the opportunity, I think, for a stronger back half of the year when you look at back-to-school activity.
I mean you look at here in California, as an example, kids haven't been to school in person in a year. So when you have back-to-school activity, you're going to have kids, not only the kids who would normally be coming in, having problems seeing the blackboard, so to speak, but you're going to have all the kids that should have had it addressed last year because kids are working on video screens and things that are right in front of their faces now.
So I do think that there's a potential certainly for pent-up demand, if you will, or kind of a boom or something like that with back-to-school activity being in person. But that's on the come, and I hope that happens. We're not really counting on that or trying to build that into our guidance. But we are seeing new fits continue to improve. Demand is there. We're seeing that on a global basis. I don't want to get into quarters but -- or months. But I mean, I will say February grew.

You have optometry offices closed. You have the holidays. You have everything going on. You're trying to fit a brand-new thing here. So we were pretty happy that the $3 million exceeded our expectations. That roll-off continuing to happen, you're getting docs fit. They're out fitting patients. They're getting more comfortable about it. They're learning about it. People around the world are hearing more about it. So you're going to continue to progress on that.
And the $25 million is not requiring something crazy, right? Like let's just say it goes to $4.5 million, as an example, in Q2. And then it moves up towards $6.5 million, $7 million, something like that, and then $10 million to $11 million, $12 million, something like that. I mean it's a pretty decent just normal kind of progression as we move through. And we have pretty decent visibility on that to be comfortable around that.
And then the next year, right, the $50 million, if we're doing $25 million plus this year, you definitely become more comfortable with the $50 million, especially when you're confident, again, having given a lot of product away for free."

I think on the contact lens one, what we're seeing right now and what our surveys are showing is that contact lenses will play a bigger part of the myopia management market than they do in general for vision correction. And part of that is certainly tied to the efficacy that we see, right? You put a contact lens in, you're getting the full treatment 100% of the time, right? Kids can take glasses off. They can do a variety of things with glasses, right? So when you're talking about a treatment, you want that full treatment at all times. So our work and our interaction with optometrists and survey work and so forth shows that you're going to see contact lenses being a greater percent usage than what we're used to seeing.
Having said that, I happen to still believe that there's a big part of the market that's going to want to wear glasses, and parents are going to be more comfortable putting their kids into glasses. So that will be bigger. That's -- maybe that's 60% of the market or something like that, ultimately.
On PARAGARD, yes, we're doing some advertising there. And there's some new advertising that's coming out. Nothing I would go crazy about for anybody. I mean we've been spending kind of a similar amount of money in the last couple of years, and I would expect that again in terms of spend, which means more dollars flow into the bottom line.
The one thing I would say about PARAGARD is we grew, what, 16%. It was a strong quarter. I would expect us to continue to have strong growth. And we're going to have really strong growth in the next couple of quarters because we really didn't have sales in April and May.
The health and wellness kind of trends that we're seeing out there that are helping to drive like daily SiHy, they're helping to drive PARAGARD also. So there's more interest out there right now tied to that. So we'll see how some of that plays out. But at this time, I kind of wouldn't lead you to believe anything different from a spending perspective, but I'm optimistic from a revenue perspective, that's for sure."

There's a lot of pent-up demand in fertility, so that's being addressed.

That part of the business is becoming a little bigger that has higher gross margins, great operating margins. The core CooperVision business has good margins and should continue to be solid, if you will, with an add-on from MiSight.

If you start rolling that into some of these bigger retailers or these bigger buying groups who grab a hold of it and want to push it, then I think you have upside to those numbers. But basically, to go back to answer a little simply, we're just taking our historical success rates and rolling those out. And that's what we're seeing, right? We see that on a monthly basis in Taiwan and Russia and here in the U.S. and in the Nordic region and so forth."

We've ramped up product manufacturing and so forth. So we're in good shape on that and do not have constraints anymore. So I'm very happy to say that.
On the competitive environment, yes, I mean, you know our space. We have good competitors out there and big guys out there who we go against, who are launching products. And I talked about this in the past. We're doing the same. I think we're more active than our competitors in terms of our product launch activity. It's interesting because you guys have heard about MyDay for a long time, but we haven't been in a position where we've been able to put it out there really, right? We've been capacity constrained on like a MyDay toric. So to us at times, it feels like it's a brand-new launch, even though it's been around for a little while. So yes, I mean, good competitors with good products, and they're doing some good things out there. I think we are, too, and I think we're probably a little bit more active than they are on a global basis.
So not too much to add other than that. I mean you go back to pre-COVID and the industry was growing to 5% to 6%, and we were taking a little bit of share. And I think that's ultimately where we're going to go. The growth rates are obviously going to be a lot higher than that because of the comps.

I'm happy to report that CooperVision and CooperSurgical both posted all-time record quarterly revenues, which drove record quarterly earnings. Our bu",1741,"Great. Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper Companies Fiscal Second Quarter Conference Call. I'm happy to report that CooperVision and CooperSurgical both posted all-time record quarterly revenues, which drove record quarterly earnings. Our businesses have rebounded nicely from the COVID lows with silicone hydrogel lenses and myopia management leading CooperVision and fertility and PARAGARD driving CooperSurgical. 
For the quarter and reporting all percentages on a constant currency basis, consolidated revenues were $720 million, with CooperVision at $523 million, up 25%; and CooperSurgical at $197 million, up 58%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.38. For CooperVision, the Americas grew 38% with clariti, MyDay and Biofinity leading the way. The U.S. was the strongest part of the region, and it allowed us to rebound quickly and strongly, offsetting challenges from markets such as Canada, which are still facing significant COVID restrictions. We're still seeing nice momentum in the U.S., and we're looking forward to the back-to-school season. 
EMEA grew 15% in the quarter, led by strength in MyDay and Biofinity. We're the #1 contact lens company in EMEA, so we're obviously over-indexed in this region and the impact from COVID did temper the market's performance. But we're executing at a very high level and taking share, which is offsetting the challenges. This is a region where we've been a leader for quite some time, and we're getting stronger due to success with key accounts, so we're really looking forward to a rebound in consumer activity as that will definitely benefit us. 
Lastly, Asia Pac was up 19%, led by strength in clariti and MyDay. Asia Pac is making progress rebounding from COVID, but it's slow in many countries, including Japan, where we have a strong presence. Nevertheless, similar to EMEA, our teams are executing at a very high level and taking share, which is helping offset the market challenges. Overall, given our geographic mix, I'm extremely happy with our performance and expect it to remain healthy as vaccines roll out around the world and consumer activity improves. 
Moving to some details, silicone hydrogel dailies grew 31% with MyDay and clariti both posting strong results. MyDay, in particular, is taking share, led by improving availability, especially for MyDay Toric. From a market perspective, there's still roughly $2.4 billion in annual global sales of older daily hydrogels that we expect to be traded up to silicones in the coming years. This tailwind is a significant positive for us as we're under-indexed in dailies, but are seeing great performance from clariti and MyDay. 
Moving to our FRP portfolio, we saw solid growth around the world led by Biofinity. In particular, Biofinity Energys, our unique and innovative lens that uses digital zone optics to help alleviate eye fatigue from excessive screen time and our market-leading Biofinity Toric Multifocal posted extremely strong results. We also just announced that we've doubled the number of prescription options for Biofinity Toric and to provide context on how significant this is, Biofinity Toric is the most prescribed toric lens in the world and is now available at over 33,000 prescriptions. That's more options than all other monthly silicone hydrogel toric lenses combined. 
Regarding product launches, we remain incredibly active. clariti and the MyDay second base curve sphere are being rolled out in Japan and MyDay Toric, Biofinity Toric Multifocal and our extended toric ranges for clariti and Biofinity continue rolling out around the world. And I'm happy to now add MyDay Multifocal to this launch list. We'll start seeding select countries in the coming months with a full launch planned for late this calendar year. As part of our prelaunch activity, we completed product testing in 8 countries with thousands of patients and I'm excited to say the responses have been absolutely fantastic. That's not a huge surprise given the extremely strong clinical data and the success of MyDay Sphere and Toric, but it's still great to see. The multifocal category is roughly 10% of the $8.5 billion global contact lens market and roughly half of that is in dailies. Given we're currently under-indexed in the daily segment at roughly a 16% share, we believe the MyDay Multifocal will be very successful. 
Moving to myopia management, our portfolio grew 122% this quarter to $14 million. Within this, MiSight grew 152% to $4 million and Ortho K grew 112% to $10 million. As a global leader in the myopia management space, our portfolio is the broadest in the industry, comprised of MiSight, the only FDA-approved myopia control product; a broad range of market-leading ortho-k lenses; and our innovative SightGlass Vision spectacles. Given the strength we're seeing, we now expect this portfolio to reach $65 million in sales this year and exceed $100 million next year. 
Regarding MiSight, we've made fantastic progress with our key accounts and have entered into multiple new pilot programs with retailers and buying groups around the world. Our momentum has been accelerating, including in the U.S., where sales grew sequentially from [ 100,000 to 700,000 ], and we're about to launch in South Korea, which should be a great market. The only thing holding us back from growing MiSight even faster is COVID restrictions in several important countries such as Canada, Spain, Taiwan and Singapore. Regardless, we're making tremendous progress and expect very strong growth moving forward. From a fitting perspective, the average age of a new MiSight wearer remains 11 compared to a regular new contact lens wearer of 17, showing this treatment is bringing kids into contact lenses at a much younger age. Additionally, multiple professional associations are now recommending myopia management as standard of care, including the World Council of Optometry and more universities are adding educational training courses to their curriculum. 
Regarding Ortho K, we had a great quarter driven by our broad product portfolio and from the halo effect we started seeing from MiSight. As the myopia management market develops, we're seeing the value of offering multiple options to eye care professionals and this is helping our Ortho K franchise. We also believe it will benefit our SightGlass myopia management spectacles, which are scheduled to be launched in multiple European markets prior to calendar year-end. 
With respect to SightGlass, we just received 2-year clinical data and are in the process of submitting it to the FDA for approval as a myopia management treatment. It took 3-year data to get MiSight approval, but we're hoping to receive approval faster for SightGlass given the strong data and that these are glasses rather than contact lenses. In the meantime, we're finishing the legal and regulatory work to close our joint venture with Essilor Luxottica, and remain very excited about the potential of that partnership. 
To wrap up on myopia management, we're actively investing in sales and marketing, new launches, regulatory approvals and R&D to keep driving success. Our focus remains on leading with clinical data and providing the best and broadest portfolio on the market. To conclude on vision, the rollout of vaccines is definitely benefiting us, given the consumer nature of our business. We're seeing plenty of opportunity heading into what should be a strong back-to-school season, and we're gearing up for some great presentations and meetings at several upcoming eye care conferences. On a longer-term basis, the macro growth trends remain solid, with roughly 1/3 of the world being myopic today, and that number is expected to increase to 50% by 2050. Given our robust portfolio, new product launches, momentum with myopia management and strong new fit data, we're in great shape for long-term sustainable growth. 
Moving to CooperSurgical, this was an outstanding quarter, with record revenues of $197 million in all 3 focus areas: fertility, PARAGARD and office and surgical medical devices outperforming. Starting with fertility, revenues grew 53% year-over-year to $84 million, easily becoming the best fertility quarter we've ever had. Strength was seen around the world and throughout the product portfolio. We're taking share, and we're well positioned for future gains with improving traction in several markets. Our key account strategy is creating opportunities, capitalizing on our market-leading portfolio of products and services, which cover this full spectrum of clinics needs outside of pharma offerings. We're seeing strong growth from consumable products like media and RI Witness, our proprietary automated lab management system that clinics implement to maximize safety and security by optimizing their lab practices; and we're benefiting from increased utilization of our artificial intelligence-based genetic testing platform which increases the doctor's ability to select the best embryos for transfer and also from our capital equipment business with growth in products like incubators. 
From a market perspective, COVID is still negatively impacting patient flow in many countries, but the combination of share gains and healthy patient flow in the U.S. and parts of Europe is driving our results. Overall, increasing vaccination activity will continue supporting the recovery of the IVF industry as more patients are able to return to clinics. And increasing maternal age and better access to IVF treatments are trends that will continue supporting strong growth for many years to come. 
Within our office and surgical unit, we grew 62%, with PARAGARD up 103% and office and surgical medical devices up 41%. PARAGARD performed really well as positive health and wellness trends continue driving patient activity. As the only 100% hormone-free IUD in the U.S. market, the product offers fantastic, long-lasting birth control that addresses the needs and interests of women looking for a healthy alternative. Within Medical Devices, several products performed well, including EndoSee Advance, our direct visualization system for evaluation of the endometrium and our portfolio of uterine manipulators. 
To conclude our CooperSurgical, this was an excellent quarter. Some of it was tied to reopening activity and capital equipment sales, which are tough to forecast, but you'll note in our guidance that we expect to continue delivering strong results. Similar to Vision, we have powerful macro trends supporting our growth and our exposure to consumer activity is benefiting us as economies around the world reopen. 
To finish, let me add that we'll be releasing our new ESG report in a few weeks. For those of you like me who are passionate about environmental sustainability, social responsibility and good governance, you'll see a great summary of where we stand today and insights into our future efforts. We're in an excellent ESG position, and I look forward to continuing advancements and providing additional updates in the future. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. 
Our second quarter consolidated revenues increased 37% year-over-year or 32% in constant currency to $720 million. Consolidated gross margin increased year-over-year to 68.1%, up from 65.8%. Improvement was driven by strength in our higher-margin CooperSurgical business led by PARAGARD, and a nice improvement in our fertility margins where we're seeing the positive impact of transferring a significant amount of production to Costa Rica. CooperVision also posted improving margins driven by currency and product mix. 
Moving forward, we're in excellent shape to continue delivering solid gross margins. We've completed the largest parts of our capital expansion projects at both CooperVision and CooperSurgical and expect to receive the benefits of this over time as capacity utilization increases. OpEx was up 17% year-over-year as expenses naturally increased with the rebound in revenues, along with higher sales and marketing expenses associated with investments in areas such as myopia management. Having said that, expenses were kept under control, resulting in consolidated operating margins of 26.8%, up from 17.4% last year. Interest expense was $6.1 million due to lower interest rates and lower average debt levels and the effective tax rate was 9.6%, driven by a 2.1% benefit from options exercises. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.38 with roughly 49.7 million shares -- average shares outstanding. Free cash flow was very solid at $143 million, comprised of $193 million of operating cash flow, offset by $50 million of CapEx. Net debt decreased to $1.6 billion and our adjusted leverage ratio decreased from 2.1 to 1.8x, driven by lower debt and improving EBITDA. 
Before moving to guidance, it's worth noting we acquired 2 businesses since we last reported earnings. The first was No7 Contact Lens, a U.K.-based contact lens manufacturer primarily focused on specialty lenses, including Ortho K, that had annual revenue of roughly $4.4 million, which we purchased for roughly $12 million. The second was OBP Medical, a U.S.-based medical device company that develops and markets a suite of differentiated women's health medical devices with integrated LED illumination. OBP Medical had roughly $10 million in annual revenues, and we purchased them for $60 million. Both deals are highly strategic and fit perfectly into CooperVision and CooperSurgical, respectively. 
Moving to guidance, we continue to monitor and evaluate the scope, duration and impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. While we still view this as a risk factor, our visibility is sufficient to allow us to provide the following update to our fiscal 2021 guidance. Consolidated revenues are expected to range from $2.855 billion to $2.885 billion, up 14% to 15% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues between $2.11 billion and $2.13 billion, up 11% to 12% in constant currency; and CooperSurgical revenues between $745 million and $755 million, up 25% to 27% in constant currency. 
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to range from $13.20 to $13.40. To provide color on this EPS range, our gross margin expectations are unchanged as we expect CooperVision's improved manufacturing efficiencies to be offset by moderate margin pressure from growing dailies and surgical continuing to post strong results. We expect OpEx as a percent of revenues to track higher than the first half of the year, led by sales and marketing investments to support reopening activity and for the ongoing support of myopia management. Given the lower tax rate in Q2, we now expect our full year tax rate to be around 11%. Lastly, FX has moved against us primarily due to the yen, but we expect the tax improvement to offset this negative impact. And to wrap up on guidance, our business continues to strengthen, and we now expect free cash flow to exceed $500 million this year. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

It's very regional dependent would probably be the easiest way to say, right? Because if you look at the U.S. as an example, we've seen consumption come back up, a lot of activity return to normal. Now we're still not quite seeing the amount of new fit activity that we'd like to see. That's still down. So that's still impacting some of like your new dailies. MiSight as an example, some of that kind of activity. But we're getting there, and we're getting there quickly, right? So I'm pretty optimistic as we get to like the back-to-school season this year, you're going to see that new fit activity and so forth in the U.S. 
As you move to somewhere like Europe, the region from a contact lens perspective is continuing to move in the right direction. It almost feels like it's like 4 months or 5 months or 6 months ago where the U.S. was at. So I hope that's the case, and I hope we see the continuing progress there as consumption, as things pick up, as you're seeing the vaccines roll out. Asia Pac is a little different. Again, though, you probably even have to break that into markets like We're weaker in China than we are in some of the other spots out there. China is doing well. But some of the other markets like even Japan is still in the single digit when it comes to vaccination. 
So I think you're seeing different levels of improvements, different levels of improving consumption activity and so forth. The trend mostly across the board is positive. I guess I'd kind of give you that as like a high-level overview."

We'll launch SightGlass this year. Later this year, we'll get into some European markets start rolling around. It has CE mark. So we'll get that product out there. 
And that will contribute, it'd just be a question mark of how much it contributes. And by the way, Jason, just note that when it comes to SightGlass right now, that's fully rolling through our P&L when we closed the joint venture with Essilor Luxottica that most likely will not show up in revenues. Any gain or loss attributable to that joint venture will be below the line. So I don't -- so I would envision, frankly, at the end of the day, next year, you might not see any site glass revenue coming through our P&L."

I mean, probably a more attainable number would be something kind of in the low 20s, $20 million, $21 million, something like that. Again, I don't think that's going to stop us from hitting $50 million next year because I think the momentum and so forth, we have is strong enough to get there. When I look at like the ramp-up, we've seen a faster ramp than I was anticipating in terms of like trialing, piloting activity from retailers and from buying groups and so forth. So that work take a little time, but We'll work through that, and I'm still crazy bullish on the product and I think we're going to be in great shape.

So SightGlass is a phenomenal product. And I think once it gets in the market is going to do really well. And as we tie that together, with Essilor Luxottica and with MiSight in a lot of markets and even with Ortho K, I think We're going to be hugely successful. 
The question mark that I kind of have on that ends up being a lot of optometrists have come back to us. And obviously, they like glasses and they want to go with glasses because it's an easy sell. But they also have commented back saying, ""Hey, I think that MiSight contact lenses are going to be a lot more efficacious because we really want these kids wearing them all the time, right? It's like metal braces. We want the kids wearing them all the time, and we know we'll get that from contact lenses."" 
So some of the feedback has been, ""Hey, I want to get kids into a myopia management program at like 5 or 6 years old,"" obviously, they're not going to put them in contacts then, right? So what I'm hearing more is like, hey, from 5 to maybe 8, 9, 10, we're looking at a little bit more at glasses and from 10 kind of onward we're pushing and talking much more about contact lenses. So it will be interesting to see how it comes out. I'm just kind of happy we have both of them."

I mean we have seen now 2-year data, 3-year data out from Hoya from SLR just in the last month or so showing those kind of 60%, 65% reductions in myopia progression, things like that. So as glasses do show to be as efficacious, does that change kind of your marketing message? Does that change price points? It looks like to me, even some of the U.K. price points on myopia glass is around $750 a year versus $1,500 per year and for MiSight here in the U.S. How do you -- how comfortable and I know markets are different, but how comfortable are you at the price point you're at with MiSight when glasses seem to be coming in at a less expensive option at least in some of your international markets?"
263609,713140998,2309569,"The Cooper Companies, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jun 03, 2021",2021-06-03,"Earnings Calls","The Cooper Companies, Inc.","Executives","Yes. A couple of things. The price point on MiSight is lower outside of the U.S. So when we talk about the U.S., right, FDA approval and running at about $750, you're getting outside of the U.S. Let me call it a global range more $500 to $750.

And we're seeing a lot of the optometrists out there, sell this as like a package offering. So that wouldn't surprise me moving forward that they kind of do that as, hey, regardless of what product you're getting and how we're going to sell it, we're going to sell these together. So maybe you get -- it's a year of contact lenses or 2 or 3 glasses, right, because kids are going to lose their glasses or break them or need to update their script, that kind of stuff, right? 
So I think that at the end of the day, my gut is that the pricing is probably in a pretty good place right now. Where I've seen the pricing on glass is lower, as you're talking about. That's also for one pair of glasses, right? So you end up saying, okay, well, you either kind of give them 2 glasses or 3 glasses, how you're going to look at that. It seems to be coming together at a pretty decent price point around where we're sitting at right now. So then I think the next thing goes to saying, two components of it, right, is yes, they're both efficacious and it being proven to be relatively similar at the end of the day and their success rates. So then you go to, okay, is the kid going to really wear those classes, right? Because they have to wear them all the time, right, 10 hours a day, every day. And that's where we're seeing optometrists push towards it and say, ""Hey, they're both as efficacious, but one of them, I'm guaranteeing the child's wearing contact lenses, the other one, I'm not. That's why we're seeing more of the push from a lot of optometrists for kids who are 10 or older moving them into contact lenses."

I know like we had a bunch of business. I know in March that we ended up shipping in April. So we don't kind of maneuver too much around some of the month end stuff. 
But yes, I guess, at the end of the day, I would probably answer that. Maybe the easiest way to summarize it is to say, calendar Q1 was okay, flat to up just a little bit. April was definitely a strong month, and we're continuing to see that performance. Big differences regionally. No question about that. Big differences regionally. The U.S. was very strong. So that's one of the things I was talking about, Anthony, when I was saying like, I'm really happy with our performance from the geographic perspective, we're kind of under-indexed in China. We're frankly a little under-indexed, so to speak, here in the U.S., where we're the #3 contact lens company. So I do believe if you look at it for the fiscal quarter, a decent chunk of it was us taking share, and that includes in some markets like Europe and Asia Pac."

Fertility is really strong. We're taking a lot of share even with struggles in places like India, as an example. I mean, it's really tough to see what's going on there. That's a really nice market for us. We're stronger there than in some of the growth markets like China. The question really for fertility ends up being how much of that growth was tied to reopening and capital equipment activity that won't repeat itself. I'm probably more optimistic maybe than most on that because you're continuing to see fertility clinics open around the world as they open, they stock up and so forth. You're continuing to see new fertility clinics get built or build out and that's capital equipment purchases and so forth. So those things are always hard to forecast, but the backlog is pretty damn good within fertility."

I'll answer, quick one on the pharma piece kind of atropine and so forth. We are doing work on that within R&D. I don't know if you'll see anything anytime soon on that, but that's an interesting kind of component of the myopia management business. So yes, we're keeping an eye on it, so to speak. 
When it comes to my side on the retail side, that is going to be one of the big drivers that's out there. The independents have grabbed a hold of this. We had a lot of people continue to get trained and start selling the product. Some of the bigger retailers are looking at this saying, okay, well, wait a minute. I don't want to get left behind on this. This is clearly gaining some traction. World Council of Optometry going out and telling people that they should be standard of care and so forth is pushing things along relatively quickly. 
So what you're seeing from the retailers right now is really trying to figure it out, right? Say, should we have this in all of our stores? Or should we put this in certain stores, right? So if we have a bunch of stores in London, should we select stores where we're going to drive all of our pediatric patients? Or should we have everybody get certified and kind of everybody fit my side, right? So you're getting retailers kind of trying to figure that strategy out. 
You've seen the same thing here in the U.S., frankly, with TreeHouse Eyes and some different organizations becoming more focused on myopia management. So this is still like such early stage in the marketplace. We're really creating a brand-new market here. It makes it kind of exciting, right? But there's some definite question marks out there. The thing I am happy about, and I was kind of saying is moving faster than I expected, right now is the interest from some of those big retailers of kind of saying, ""Hey, I don't want to get left behind here."" I need to get moving and figure this out one way or another. So that's a key component. 
The other thing I would add just quickly when it comes to retailers is it's a little easier for an independent. They run their own store and so forth, how they want to price it, how they want to handle selling it, communicating it and so forth. You go to a retailer where they want to standardize that throughout their operations. That takes them a little while longer, right, figure out how we're going to price it, how we're going to sell it. all the different components that go into it. So a lot of work being done behind the scenes on that."

So as we continue to grow revenues, we'll be able to continue to leverage that basis. I mean the fertility business is a global business, as an example, with a global infrastructure, largely global infrastructure. You're talking about a business even if you annualize this quarter, right, that's a little over $300 million. So we need to continue to grow that to leverage it.

So you do get some of that where you're getting an optometrist to a couple of kids, and then they might wait a little bit. Maybe the other point to make on that Jon, that's probably important is we recognize our activity, all of it upon shipment. One of the challenges that we've had with MiSight is shipping it on a quarterly basis or 6 months rather than manual supply. You've heard me talk historically more about, hey, $750, right? We fit a kid, we get $750. I guess mentally, that's how I think of it. But in actuality from an accounting perspective, depending upon what you're shipping, if you're shipping a full year in the U.S., then yes, you would get $750 or if it's outside the U.S., whatever you would get whatever that price is. 
But certainly, more than half of our sales of MiSight are shipped as 6 months or quarterly sales. So I think maybe the -- maybe I haven't been as clear about that, right, because the number of fittings that we're actually doing, the kids getting fitting greater, I think, than what people think it is because we're not recognizing as much revenue as I think people thinking we are right away, right? That's what -- one of the things that kind of gives me more comfort on the $50 million next year, frankly, is because I see the number of children actually being fit in the product. I know that revenue will come, right? It's a renewing cycle anyways for the annual purchaser, but for all the kids who are not annual purchasers, 6 months or whatever, you know that that's going to continue to come. So I think that's part of it. The $700,000 in the U.S. would be a true number, if you will, right? No free lenses being included in that. 
When it comes to China for $50 million for next year, I guess I think of about it all together, right? It will depend when we get approval for China. When we're able to get launched that product as to how much that's going to contribute. But that would be part of our $50 million plus, I think, to say it that way, in terms of MiSight numbers for next year."

On the margin side, right now, with respect to the retailers, that's not impacting anything because the price point on that is what the price point is, if you will.

My guess, based on history is that we would continue the price point that we're at, we would hold the price point we're at, if you will, It would be more in terms of like, hey, if you do that much volume, we'll give you a cross-promotional activity for other products and services. that type of thing. more sales and marketing in a broader sense than it would be any discount activity associated with a product like MiSight."

So that's obviously factored into our guidance and the impact of FX in the second half of the year is offset by the effective tax rate reduction going from around 12.5% from last quarter to around 11% now with this new guidance. 
On the gross margin side, I had said last quarter, around 67.5% to 68% on a consolidated basis and bouncing around kind of range bound. Yes, we ended up at 68.1%. I still think we have a chance maybe to get to 68%, but we're still going to kind of hold to the upper 67%. I talked in my script about the push/pull around higher dailies offset by better utilization or better efficiencies in our manufacturing plan with volumes and then strong CooperSurgical gross margin.

And then on the operating margin line, that's really where we're kind of -- where we're saying, hey, there's just going to be a little bit more OpEx than what we were expecting, let's say, last quarter.

So on CooperVision, obviously, I talked about earlier, some of the -- both of them were up, Vision and Surgical were up. Some of the trends that we're seeing are still playing out. We had some volume-related absorption. That's starting to go away as volumes pick up. But though that's being offset by higher sales of dailies. Our daily silicone hydrogel suite of products is not quite as high as our company-wide gross margins or CooperVision gross margin. So that's going to be a little bit of a push-pull, but we should see -- we have a chance of seeing CooperVision margins trending a little bit upwards, but flattish. And then on the CooperSurgical side, obviously, stronger PARAGARD sales with that high gross margin product and fertility, all of the work that we're doing to consolidate into Costa Rica all helps CooperSurgical gross margins. So that's a positive trend that should continue. 
On the operating margin side, I'll touch on CooperSurgical operating margins just a few minutes ago. On the vision side, again, I think most of what you're seeing as markets reopen and all the rebound activity that we're doing to see these markets to prepare for product launches and really to put some need around myopia management and make sure we're supporting the launches of all of our Suite Moving project products, you'll see some OpEx increases there. ahead of some of the revenues that you'll see down the road."

The U.S. continues to move in that right direction, and that's critical for us right now because that's an important one, MiSight, especially in the back half of the year, but also for our dailies, right? Because what we were seeing pre-COVID with respect to new fit data was that you were seeing a much higher percentage of people being fit in daily SiHys than you will or any other product. So obviously, that's an area of strength for us. 
I'm making the assumption that when we look at the world at new fits, you're going to continue to see new fits trend in the right direction. I wouldn't anticipate like a big jump all of a sudden anywhere. I think it's just going to be a matter of vaccines rolling out, continuing to be successful, continuing to allow more foot traffic, if you will, will improve new fit data. 
The other thing is like, I mean, you get to California here, right? We still have restrictions. June 15, we get to the point finally where we basically don't have restrictions, that's going to allow a greater volume of patients going through optometry offices and so forth. So there's some big markets out there, California being one of them that continue to take steps in the right direction. You go outside of the U.S., you look at markets like the U.K. continue to move in the right direction, right? So moderate positives, but I'm not anticipating like some massive big step-up."

I would guess, certainly for the foreseeable future, it's going to continue to be managed the same way it is right now. It will be shipped when the patient orders the product. And then it's just a matter of how the doc wants to do it. A lot of them want to say, ""Hey, I'll get a year supply because the child's eyesight is not going to change that much. So let's get the product, let's get it in our house."" Where certainly, as I said, over half of optometrists are saying, ""Hey, I want to see the kid more frequently, I want them to come in for eye exams."" So I'm going to do a 3 month or I'm going to do a 6 month, and then I'm going to do the eye exam. And then if there's a parameter change or treatment needs to be made, I'll do it and send them new lenses. Otherwise, I'll continue to send them the original script.

I'm happy to report that CooperVision and CooperSurgical both posted all-time record quarterly revenues, which drove record quarterly earnings. Our",1741,"Great. Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper Companies Fiscal Second Quarter Conference Call. 
I'm happy to report that CooperVision and CooperSurgical both posted all-time record quarterly revenues, which drove record quarterly earnings. Our businesses have rebounded nicely from the COVID lows with silicone hydrogel lenses and myopia management leading CooperVision and fertility and PARAGARD driving CooperSurgical. 
For the quarter and reporting all percentages on a constant currency basis, consolidated revenues were $720 million, with CooperVision at $523 million, up 25%; and CooperSurgical at $197 million, up 58%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.38. For CooperVision, the Americas grew 38% with clariti, MyDay and Biofinity leading the way. The U.S. was the strongest part of the region, and it allowed us to rebound quickly and strongly, offsetting challenges from markets such as Canada, which are still facing significant COVID restrictions. We're still seeing nice momentum in the U.S., and we're looking forward to the back-to-school season. 
EMEA grew 15% in the quarter, led by strength in MyDay and Biofinity. We're the #1 contact lens company in EMEA, so we're obviously over-indexed in this region and the impact from COVID did temper the market's performance. But we're executing at a very high level and taking share, which is offsetting the challenges. This is a region where we've been a leader for quite some time, and we're getting stronger due to success with key accounts, so we're really looking forward to a rebound in consumer activity as that will definitely benefit us. 
Lastly, Asia Pac was up 19%, led by strength in clariti and MyDay. Asia Pac is making progress rebounding from COVID, but it's slow in many countries, including Japan, where we have a strong presence. Nevertheless, similar to EMEA, our teams are executing at a very high level and taking share, which is helping offset the market challenges. Overall, given our geographic mix, I'm extremely happy with our performance and expect it to remain healthy as vaccines roll out around the world and consumer activity improves. 
Moving to some details, silicone hydrogel dailies grew 31% with MyDay and clariti both posting strong results. MyDay, in particular, is taking share, led by improving availability, especially for MyDay Toric. From a market perspective, there's still roughly $2.4 billion in annual global sales of older daily hydrogels that we expect to be traded up to silicones in the coming years. This tailwind is a significant positive for us as we're under-indexed in dailies, but are seeing great performance from clariti and MyDay. 
Moving to our FRP portfolio, we saw solid growth around the world led by Biofinity. In particular, Biofinity Energys, our unique and innovative lens that uses digital zone optics to help alleviate eye fatigue from excessive screen time and our market-leading Biofinity Toric Multifocal posted extremely strong results. We also just announced that we've doubled the number of prescription options for Biofinity Toric and to provide context on how significant this is, Biofinity Toric is the most prescribed toric lens in the world and is now available at over 33,000 prescriptions. That's more options than all other monthly silicone hydrogel toric lenses combined. 
Regarding product launches, we remain incredibly active. clariti and the MyDay second base curve sphere are being rolled out in Japan and MyDay Toric, Biofinity Toric Multifocal and our extended toric ranges for clariti and Biofinity continue rolling out around the world. And I'm happy to now add MyDay Multifocal to this launch list. We'll start seeding select countries in the coming months with a full launch planned for late this calendar year. As part of our prelaunch activity, we completed product testing in 8 countries with thousands of patients and I'm excited to say the responses have been absolutely fantastic. That's not a huge surprise given the extremely strong clinical data and the success of MyDay Sphere and Toric, but it's still great to see. The multifocal category is roughly 10% of the $8.5 billion global contact lens market and roughly half of that is in dailies. Given we're currently under-indexed in the daily segment at roughly a 16% share, we believe the MyDay Multifocal will be very successful. 
Moving to myopia management, our portfolio grew 122% this quarter to $14 million. Within this, MiSight grew 152% to $4 million and Ortho K grew 112% to $10 million. As a global leader in the myopia management space, our portfolio is the broadest in the industry, comprised of MiSight, the only FDA-approved myopia control product; a broad range of market-leading ortho-k lenses; and our innovative SightGlass Vision spectacles. Given the strength we're seeing, we now expect this portfolio to reach $65 million in sales this year and exceed $100 million next year. 
Regarding MiSight, we've made fantastic progress with our key accounts and have entered into multiple new pilot programs with retailers and buying groups around the world. Our momentum has been accelerating, including in the U.S., where sales grew sequentially from [ 100,000 to 700,000 ], and we're about to launch in South Korea, which should be a great market. The only thing holding us back from growing MiSight even faster is COVID restrictions in several important countries such as Canada, Spain, Taiwan and Singapore. Regardless, we're making tremendous progress and expect very strong growth moving forward. From a fitting perspective, the average age of a new MiSight wearer remains 11 compared to a regular new contact lens wearer of 17, showing this treatment is bringing kids into contact lenses at a much younger age. Additionally, multiple professional associations are now recommending myopia management as standard of care, including the World Council of Optometry and more universities are adding educational training courses to their curriculum. 
Regarding Ortho K, we had a great quarter driven by our broad product portfolio and from the halo effect we started seeing from MiSight. As the myopia management market develops, we're seeing the value of offering multiple options to eye care professionals and this is helping our Ortho K franchise. We also believe it will benefit our SightGlass myopia management spectacles, which are scheduled to be launched in multiple European markets prior to calendar year-end. 
With respect to SightGlass, we just received 2-year clinical data and are in the process of submitting it to the FDA for approval as a myopia management treatment. It took 3-year data to get MiSight approval, but we're hoping to receive approval faster for SightGlass given the strong data and that these are glasses rather than contact lenses. In the meantime, we're finishing the legal and regulatory work to close our joint venture with Essilor Luxottica, and remain very excited about the potential of that partnership. 
To wrap up on myopia management, we're actively investing in sales and marketing, new launches, regulatory approvals and R&D to keep driving success. Our focus remains on leading with clinical data and providing the best and broadest portfolio on the market. To conclude on vision, the rollout of vaccines is definitely benefiting us, given the consumer nature of our business. We're seeing plenty of opportunity heading into what should be a strong back-to-school season, and we're gearing up for some great presentations and meetings at several upcoming eye care conferences. On a longer-term basis, the macro growth trends remain solid, with roughly 1/3 of the world being myopic today, and that number is expected to increase to 50% by 2050. Given our robust portfolio, new product launches, momentum with myopia management and strong new fit data, we're in great shape for long-term sustainable growth. 
Moving to CooperSurgical, this was an outstanding quarter, with record revenues of $197 million in all 3 focus areas: fertility, PARAGARD and office and surgical medical devices outperforming. Starting with fertility, revenues grew 53% year-over-year to $84 million, easily becoming the best fertility quarter we've ever had. Strength was seen around the world and throughout the product portfolio. We're taking share, and we're well positioned for future gains with improving traction in several markets. 
Our key account strategy is creating opportunities, capitalizing on our market-leading portfolio of products and services, which cover this full spectrum of clinics needs outside of pharma offerings. We're seeing strong growth from consumable products like media and RI Witness, our proprietary automated lab management system that clinics implement to maximize safety and security by optimizing their lab practices; and we're benefiting from increased utilization of our artificial intelligence-based genetic testing platform which increases the doctor's ability to select the best embryos for transfer and also from our capital equipment business with growth in products like incubators. 
From a market perspective, COVID is still negatively impacting patient flow in many countries, but the combination of share gains and healthy patient flow in the U.S. and parts of Europe is driving our results. Overall, increasing vaccination activity will continue supporting the recovery of the IVF industry as more patients are able to return to clinics. And increasing maternal age and better access to IVF treatments are trends that will continue supporting strong growth for many years to come. 
Within our office and surgical unit, we grew 62%, with PARAGARD up 103% and office and surgical medical devices up 41%. PARAGARD performed really well as positive health and wellness trends continue driving patient activity. As the only 100% hormone-free IUD in the U.S. market, the product offers fantastic, long-lasting birth control that addresses the needs and interests of women looking for a healthy alternative. Within Medical Devices, several products performed well, including EndoSee Advance, our direct visualization system for evaluation of the endometrium and our portfolio of uterine manipulators. 
To conclude our CooperSurgical, this was an excellent quarter. Some of it was tied to reopening activity and capital equipment sales, which are tough to forecast, but you'll note in our guidance that we expect to continue delivering strong results. Similar to Vision, we have powerful macro trends supporting our growth and our exposure to consumer activity is benefiting us as economies around the world reopen. 
To finish, let me add that we'll be releasing our new ESG report in a few weeks. For those of you like me who are passionate about environmental sustainability, social responsibility and good governance, you'll see a great summary of where we stand today and insights into our future efforts. We're in an excellent ESG position, and I look forward to continuing advancements and providing additional updates in the future. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. 
Our second quarter consolidated revenues increased 37% year-over-year or 32% in constant currency to $720 million. Consolidated gross margin increased year-over-year to 68.1%, up from 65.8%. Improvement was driven by strength in our higher-margin CooperSurgical business led by PARAGARD, and a nice improvement in our fertility margins where we're seeing the positive impact of transferring a significant amount of production to Costa Rica. CooperVision also posted improving margins driven by currency and product mix. 
Moving forward, we're in excellent shape to continue delivering solid gross margins. We've completed the largest parts of our capital expansion projects at both CooperVision and CooperSurgical and expect to receive the benefits of this over time as capacity utilization increases. OpEx was up 17% year-over-year as expenses naturally increased with the rebound in revenues, along with higher sales and marketing expenses associated with investments in areas such as myopia management. 
Having said that, expenses were kept under control, resulting in consolidated operating margins of 26.8%, up from 17.4% last year. Interest expense was $6.1 million due to lower interest rates and lower average debt levels and the effective tax rate was 9.6%, driven by a 2.1% benefit from options exercises. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.38 with roughly 49.7 million shares -- average shares outstanding. Free cash flow was very solid at $143 million, comprised of $193 million of operating cash flow, offset by $50 million of CapEx. Net debt decreased to $1.6 billion and our adjusted leverage ratio decreased from 2.1 to 1.8x, driven by lower debt and improving EBITDA. 
Before moving to guidance, it's worth noting we acquired 2 businesses since we last reported earnings. The first was No7 Contact Lens, a U.K.-based contact lens manufacturer primarily focused on specialty lenses, including Ortho K, that had annual revenue of roughly $4.4 million, which we purchased for roughly $12 million. The second was OBP Medical, a U.S.-based medical device company that develops and markets a suite of differentiated women's health medical devices with integrated LED illumination. OBP Medical had roughly $10 million in annual revenues, and we purchased them for $60 million. Both deals are highly strategic and fit perfectly into CooperVision and CooperSurgical, respectively. 
Moving to guidance, we continue to monitor and evaluate the scope, duration and impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. While we still view this as a risk factor, our visibility is sufficient to allow us to provide the following update to our fiscal 2021 guidance. Consolidated revenues are expected to range from $2.855 billion to $2.885 billion, up 14% to 15% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues between $2.11 billion and $2.13 billion, up 11% to 12% in constant currency; and CooperSurgical revenues between $745 million and $755 million, up 25% to 27% in constant currency. 
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to range from $13.20 to $13.40. To provide color on this EPS range, our gross margin expectations are unchanged as we expect CooperVision's improved manufacturing efficiencies to be offset by moderate margin pressure from growing dailies and surgical continuing to post strong results. We expect OpEx as a percent of revenues to track higher than the first half of the year, led by sales and marketing investments to support reopening activity and for the ongoing support of myopia management. Given the lower tax rate in Q2, we now expect our full year tax rate to be around 11%. Lastly, FX has moved against us primarily due to the yen, but we expect the tax improvement to offset this negative impact. And to wrap up on guidance, our business continues to strengthen, and we now expect free cash flow to exceed $500 million this year. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

It's very regional dependent would probably be the easiest way to say, right? Because if you look at the U.S. as an example, we've seen consumption come back up, a lot of activity return to normal. Now we're still not quite seeing the amount of new fit activity that we'd like to see. That's still down. So that's still impacting some of like your new dailies. MiSight as an example, some of that kind of activity. But we're getting there, and we're getting there quickly, right? So I'm pretty optimistic as we get to like the back-to-school season this year, you're going to see that new fit activity and so forth in the U.S. 
As you move to somewhere like Europe, the region from a contact lens perspective is continuing to move in the right direction. It almost feels like it's like 4 months or 5 months or 6 months ago where the U.S. was at. So I hope that's the case, and I hope we see the continuing progress there as consumption, as things pick up, as you're seeing the vaccines roll out. Asia Pac is a little different. Again, though, you probably even have to break that into markets like We're weaker in China than we are in some of the other spots out there. China is doing well, but some of the other markets like -- even Japan is still in the single digit when it comes to vaccination. 
So I think you're seeing different levels of improvements, different levels of improving consumption activity and so forth. The trend mostly across the board is positive. I guess I'd kind of give you that as like a high-level overview."

We'll launch SightGlass this year. Later this year, we'll get into some European markets, start rolling around. It has CE mark, so we'll get that product out there. And that will contribute, it'd just be a question mark of how much it contributes. 
And by the way, Jason, just note that when it comes to SightGlass right now, that's fully rolling through our P&L when we closed the joint venture with Essilor Luxottica that most likely will not show up in revenues.

And then obviously, other markets maintain COVID restrictions. So that's a challenge for us. 
I mean, probably a more attainable number would be something kind of in the low 20s, $20 million, $21 million, something like that. Again, I don't think that's going to stop us from hitting $50 million next year because I think the momentum and so forth, we have is strong enough to get there. When I look at like the ramp-up, we've seen a faster ramp than I was anticipating in terms of like trialing, piloting activity from retailers and from buying groups and so forth. 
So that work takes a little time, but We'll work through that, and I'm still crazy bullish on the product and I think we're going to be in great shape. I mean when you look at tweaks to the business model right now, not really because of kind of, if you will, the underlying success that we're seeing with respect to the product and the interest that we're getting from some of the -- what are ultimately going to be very, very large fitters of MiSight."

And as we tie that together, with Essilor Luxottica and with MiSight in a lot of markets and even with Ortho K, I think we're going to be hugely successful. 
The question mark that I kind of have on that ends up being a lot of optometrists have come back to us. And obviously, they like glasses and they want to go with glasses because it's an easy sell. But they also have commented back saying, ""Hey, I think that MiSight contact lenses are going to be a lot more efficacious because we really want these kids wearing them all the time, right? It's like metal braces. We want the kids wearing them all the time, and we know we'll get that from contact lenses."" 
So some of the feedback has been, ""Hey, I want to get kids into a myopia management program at like 5 or 6 years old."" Obviously, they're not going to put them in contacts then, right? So what I'm hearing more is like, hey, from 5 to maybe 8, 9, 10, we're looking at a little bit more at glasses, and from 10 kind of onward we're pushing and talking much more about contact lenses. So it will be interesting to see how it comes out. I'm just kind of happy we have both of them."

So as glasses do show to be as efficacious, does that change kind of your marketing message? Does that change price points? 
It looks like to me, even some of the U.K. price points on myopia glass is around $750 a year versus $1,500 per year and for MiSight here in the U.S. How do you -- how comfortable -- and I know markets are different, but how comfortable are you at the price point you're at with MiSight when glasses seem to be coming in at a less expensive option at least in some of your international markets?"

The price point on MiSight is lower outside of the U.S. So when we talk about the U.S., right, FDA approval and running at about $750, you're getting outside of the U.S, let me call it a global range more $500 to $750. And we're seeing a lot of the optometrists out there, sell this as like a package offering. So that wouldn't surprise me moving forward that they kind of do that as, hey, regardless of what product you're getting and how we're going to sell it, we're going to sell these together. So maybe you get -- it's a year of contact lenses or 2 or 3 glasses, right, because kids are going to lose their glasses or break them or need to update their script, that kind of stuff, right? 
So I think that at the end of the day, my gut is that the pricing is probably in a pretty good place right now. Where I've seen the pricing on glass is lower, as you're talking about, that's also for one pair of glasses, right? So you end up saying, okay, well, you either kind of give them 2 glasses or 3 glasses, how you're going to look at that. It seems to be coming together at a pretty decent price point around where we're sitting at right now. So then I think the next thing goes to saying, two components of it, right, is yes, they're both efficacious and it being proven to be relatively similar at the end of the day and their success rates. 
So then you go to, okay, is the kid going to really wear those classes, right, because they have to wear them all the time, right, 10 hours a day, every day. And that's where we're seeing optometrists push towards it and say, ""Hey, they're both as efficacious, but one of them, I'm guaranteeing the child's wearing contact lenses, the other one, I'm not. That's why we're seeing more of the push from a lot of optometrists for kids who are 10 or older moving them into contact lenses."

I know like we had a bunch of business. I know in March that we ended up shipping in April. So we don't kind of maneuver too much around some of the month end stuff. 
But yes, I guess, at the end of the day, I would probably answer that. Maybe the easiest way to summarize it is to say, calendar Q1 was okay, flat to up just a little bit. April was definitely a strong month, and we're continuing to see that performance. Big differences regionally. No question about that. Big differences regionally. The U.S. was very strong. So that's one of the things I was talking about, Anthony, when I was saying like, I'm really happy with our performance from the geographic perspective, we're kind of under-indexed in China. 
We're frankly a little under-indexed, so to speak, here in the U.S., where we're the #3 contact lens company. So I do believe if you look at it for the fiscal quarter, a decent chunk of it was us taking share, and that includes in some markets like Europe and Asia Pac."

I think that's just kind of business as usual right now. 
Fertility is really strong. We're taking a lot of share even with struggles in places like India, as an example. I mean, it's really tough to see what's going on there. That's a really nice market for us. We're stronger there than in some of the growth markets like China. The question really for fertility ends up being how much of that growth was tied to reopening and capital equipment activity that won't repeat itself. I'm probably more optimistic maybe than most on that because you're continuing to see fertility clinics open around the world as they open, they stock up and so forth. You're continuing to see new fertility clinics get built or build out and that's capital equipment purchases and so forth. So those things are always hard to forecast, but the backlog is pretty damn good within fertility."

I'll answer, quick one on the pharma piece kind of atropine and so forth. We are doing work on that within R&D. I don't know if you'll see anything anytime soon on that, but that's an interesting kind of component of the myopia management business. So yes, we're keeping an eye on it, so to speak. 
When it comes to my side on the retail side, that is going to be one of the big drivers that's out there. The independents have grabbed a hold of this. We had a lot of people continue to get trained and start selling the product. Some of the bigger retailers are looking at this saying, okay, well, wait a minute. I don't want to get left behind on this. This is clearly gaining some traction. World Council of Optometry going out and telling people that they should be standard of care and so forth is pushing things along relatively quickly. 
So what you're seeing from the retailers right now is really trying to figure it out, right? Say, should we have this in all of our stores? Or should we put this in certain stores, right? So if we have a bunch of stores in London, should we select stores where we're going to drive all of our pediatric patients? Or should we have everybody get certified and kind of everybody fit my side, right? So you're getting retailers kind of trying to figure that strategy out. 
You've seen the same thing here in the U.S., frankly, with TreeHouse Eyes and some different organizations becoming more focused on myopia management. So this is still like such early stage in the marketplace. We're really creating a brand-new market here. It makes it kind of exciting, right? But there's some definite question marks out there. The thing I am happy about, and I was kind of saying is moving faster than I expected right now, is the interest from some of those big retailers of kind of saying, ""Hey, I don't want to get left behind here."" I need to get moving and figure this out one way or another. So that's a key component. 
The other thing I would add just quickly when it comes to retailers is it's a little easier for an independent. They run their own store and so forth, how they want to price it, how they want to handle selling it, communicating it and so forth. You go to a retailer where they want to standardize that throughout their operations. That takes them a little while longer, right, figure out how we're going to price it, how we're going to sell it, all the different components that go into it. So a lot of work being done behind the scenes on that."

So as we continue to grow revenues, we'll be able to continue to leverage that basis. 
I mean the fertility business is a global business, as an example, with a global infrastructure, largely global infrastructure. You're talking about a business even if you annualize this quarter, right, that's a little over $300 million. So we need to continue to grow that to leverage it.

So you do get some of that where you're getting an optometrist to a couple of kids, and then they might wait a little bit. Maybe the other point to make on that Jon, that's probably important is we recognize our activity, all of it upon shipment. One of the challenges that we've had with MiSight is shipping it on a quarterly basis or 6 months rather than manual supply. You've heard me talk historically more about, hey, $750, right? We fit a kid, we get $750. I guess mentally, that's how I think of it. But in actuality from an accounting perspective, depending upon what you're shipping, if you're shipping a full year in the U.S., then yes, you would get $750 or if it's outside the U.S., whatever you would get whatever that price is. 
But certainly, more than half of our sales of MiSight are shipped as 6 months or quarterly sales. So I think maybe the -- maybe I haven't been as clear about that, right, because the number of fittings that we're actually doing, the kids getting fitting greater, I think, than what people think it is because we're not recognizing as much revenue as I think people thinking we are right away, right? That's what -- one of the things that kind of gives me more comfort on the $50 million next year, frankly, is because I see the number of children actually being fit in the product. I know that revenue will come, right? 
It's a renewing cycle anyways for the annual purchaser, but for all the kids who are not annual purchasers, 6 months or whatever, you know that that's going to continue to come. So I think that's part of it. The $700,000 in the U.S. would be a true number, if you will, right? No free lenses being included in that. 
When it comes to China for $50 million for next year, I guess I think of about it all together, right? It will depend when we get approval for China. When we're able to get launched that product as to how much that's going to contribute. But that would be part of our $50 million plus, I think, to say it that way, in terms of MiSight numbers for next year."

So that's obviously factored into our guidance and the impact of FX in the second half of the year is offset by the effective tax rate reduction going from around 12.5% from last quarter to around 11% now with this new guidance. 
On the gross margin side, I had said last quarter, around 67.5% to 68% on a consolidated basis and bouncing around kind of range bound. Yes, we ended up at 68.1%. I still think we have a chance maybe to get to 68%, but we're still going to kind of hold to the upper 67%. I talked in my script about the push/pull around higher dailies offset by better utilization or better efficiencies in our manufacturing plan with volumes and then strong CooperSurgical gross margin. So some of that's going to be driven by mix, so -- but high 67s. 
And then on the operating margin line, that's really where we're kind of -- where we're saying, hey, there's just going to be a little bit more OpEx than what we were expecting, let's say, last quarter. So all of the myopia management product launches, just general market opening activity in back-to-school is going to result in slightly higher OpEx as a percentage of sales. And so that's how you get to our EPS guidance."

We had some volume-related absorption. That's starting to go away as volumes pick up. But though that's being offset by higher sales of dailies. Our daily silicone hydrogel suite of products is not quite as high as our company-wide gross margins or CooperVision gross margin. So that's going to be a little bit of a push-pull, but we should see -- we have a chance of seeing CooperVision margins trending a little bit upwards, but flattish. 
And then on the CooperSurgical side, obviously, stronger PARAGARD sales with that high gross margin product and fertility, all of the work that we're doing to consolidate into Costa Rica all helps CooperSurgical gross margins. So that's a positive trend that should continue. 
On the operating margin side, I'll touch on CooperSurgical operating margins just a few minutes ago. On the vision side, again, I think most of what you're seeing as markets reopen and all the rebound activity that we're doing to see these markets to prepare for product launches and really to put some need around myopia management and make sure we're supporting the launches of all of our Suite Moving project products, you'll see some OpEx increases there. ahead of some of the revenues that you'll see down the road."

The U.S. continues to move in that right direction, and that's critical for us right now because that's an important one, MiSight, especially in the back half of the year, but also for our dailies, right? Because what we were seeing pre-COVID with respect to new fit data was that you were seeing a much higher percentage of people being fit in daily SiHys than you will or any other product. So obviously, that's an area of strength for us. 
I'm making the assumption that when we look at the world at new fits, you're going to continue to see new fits trend in the right direction. I wouldn't anticipate like a big jump all of a sudden anywhere. I think it's just going to be a matter of vaccines rolling out, continuing to be successful, continuing to allow more foot traffic, if you will, will improve new fit data. 
The other thing is like, I mean, you get to California here, right? We still have restrictions. June 15, we get to the point finally where we basically don't have restrictions, that's going to allow a greater volume of patients going through optometry offices and so forth. So there's some big markets out there, California being one of them, that continue to take steps in the right direction. You go outside of the U.S., you look at markets like the U.K. continue to move in the right direction, right? So moderate positives, but I'm not anticipating like some massive big step-up."

I would guess, certainly for the foreseeable future, it's going to continue to be managed the same way it is right now. It will be shipped when the patient orders the product. 
And then it's just a matter of how the doc wants to do it. A lot of them want to say, ""Hey, I'll get a year supply because the child's eyesight is not going to change that much. So let's get the product, let's get it in our house."" Where certainly, as I said, over half of optometrists are saying, ""Hey, I want to see the kid more frequently, I want them to come in for eye exams."" So I'm going to do a 3-month or I'm going to do a 6-month, and then I'm going to do the eye exam. And then if there's a parameter change or treatment needs to be made, I'll do it and send them new lenses. Otherwise, I'll continue to send them the original script.

I'm pleased to report another very strong quarter with record revenues at CooperVision and CooperSurgical, driving record earnings and robust free cash flow.",1648,"Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper Company's Fiscal Third Quarter Conference Call. I'm pleased to report another very strong quarter with record revenues at CooperVision and CooperSurgical, driving record earnings and robust free cash flow. CooperVision's growth was broad-based and led by our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio of lenses and a solid rebound in EMEA. While our myopia management products also performed really well, and of course, we received the exciting news about regulatory approvals for MiSight in China.
CooperSurgical continued posting great results led by fertility and a nice bump in PARAGARD, helped by buying activity from a price increase. Moving forward, we expect core operational strength to continue driving strong performance even with challenges from COVID and currency. With this expectation and the opportunities we're seeing in myopia management, daily silicones and fertility, we've increased our constant currency revenue guidance for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical and we'll maintain our investment activity to capitalize on the potential for incremental share gains as we move towards fiscal 2022.
Moving to third quarter results and reporting all percentages on a constant currency basis, Consolidated revenues were $763 million, with CooperVision at $558 million, up 20%, and CooperSurgical at $206 million, up 58%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.41. For CooperVision, our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio led the way with all 3 regions posting strong growth. Particular strength was noted in our daily Toric franchises, but daily Sphere and Multifocals also performed well. And in a great sign, we've seen a nice uptick in FIT data for MyDay and clariti, which bodes well for share gains and future growth.
Within the regions, the Americas grew 16%, led by MyDay and clariti and continued improvement in patient flow. EMEA grew a healthy 24% as consumer activity returned in the region, and we took share. We're #1 in EMEA, and we're seeing the benefits of increasing patient flow, so we'll continue investing to support the reopening activity happening in many of the European markets. Asia Pac grew 18%, led by a slow but steady improvement in consumer activity. For us, a significant portion of Asia Pac is driven by Japan. And although consumer activity remains somewhat muted, we're performing well and taking share, and we're well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities given our recent product launches.
Moving to category details. Silicone hydrogel dailies grew 31% and with MyDay and clariti both performing well. MyDay, in particular, continues taking share, led by strength in MyDay toric in all regions. For our FRP portfolio, Biofinity continued its solid performance led by Biofinity Energys and Biofinity Toric multifocal. Regarding product expansions and launches, we remain very active. We're finishing the launch of clariti, Sphere and the MyDay second base curve Sphere in Japan. We're rolling out Biofinity toric multifocal in additional markets. We're rolling out an expanded toric range for MyDay, giving it the broadest range of any daily toric in the world. And we're also completing the rollout of extended toric ranges for clariti and Biofinity.
We've also started prelaunching activity for MyDay multifocal with the launch -- with a full launch on target for the U.S. and other select markets in November. Feedback on this lens remains extremely positive, including from fitters commenting that our Opti expert fitting app has the highest fit success rate of any multifocal in the market. Recent data shows that over 90% of contact lens wearers over the age of 40 expect to continue wearing lenses with the biggest challenge being finding a good multifocal. Given the feedback we've been receiving, we believe MyDay will be the best multifocal on the market and combined with the fact that it's joining an already highly successful MyDay Sphere and toric, we're very optimistic about its success.
Moving to myopia management. Our portfolio grew a robust 90% this quarter to $18 million, with MiSight up 187% to $5 million and Ortho-K products up 68%. As a global leader in the myopia management space, our portfolio is the broadest in the industry, comprised of MiSight, the only FDA-approved myopia control product, our broad range of market-leading Ortho-K lenses, and our innovative SightGlass vision glasses. We continue targeting $65 million in myopia management sales this year, including MiSight reaching $20 million.
Regarding MiSight, there was a lot of positive activity this quarter as we continue capitalizing on our first-mover advantage. We received regulatory approval in China, and we're extremely excited about that opportunity. The approval requires lenses to be manufactured post approval. So we've quickly initiated production and packaging, and plan to seed the market starting in early fiscal Q1 and with a full launch in fiscal Q2 of next year. As part of this, we're immediately ramping up marketing efforts and working quickly to ensure the product is positioned for success. Myopia rates are very high in China, so the market potential is significant. As an example, it's estimated that over 80% of high school kids are myopic, so treating children at a younger age is of high importance in the country.
Outside of China, we continue making great progress with our large retailers and buying groups. Our pilot programs are live and expanding, and we've finally been able to resume in-person training in many markets, including in the U.S. We now have over 40,000 children wearing MiSight worldwide, and that number is growing quickly. Additionally, the average age of a new MiSight wearer remains 11, so this treatment is bringing children into contact lenses at a much younger age.
Lastly, on MiSight, we did see momentum pick up even more in August, including here in the U.S., so we're bullish for a strong Q4. Regarding our other myopia management products, we had a solid quarter for Ortho-K driven by our broad product portfolio and from the halo effect we're seeing with MiSight. And we continue making progress with our SightGlass myopia management glasses, preparing for several upcoming launches later this calendar year. We've also submitted our application to the FDA for approval for MiSight as a myopia management treatment and expect to receive initial feedback within a couple of months.
In the meantime, as the myopia management market continues developing, we're definitely seeing the value of offering multiple options to eye care professionals, so we look forward to expanding our offerings and availability.
To wrap up on myopia management, our innovation pipeline is very healthy with 8 focused pipeline products. Our sales and marketing efforts are proving successful and our focus on leading with clinical data and providing the best and broadest portfolio in the market, has us in an excellent position for continued success.
To conclude on vision, our business is doing really well. The back-to-school season is healthy, new fits are doing well, and we're excited about our existing products and upcoming launches. On a longer-term basis, the macro growth trends remained solid, with roughly 33% of the world being myopic today, and that number is expected to increase to 50% by 2050. Given our robust product portfolio, new product launches, myopia management momentum and strong fit data, we're in great shape for long-term sustainable growth.
Moving to CooperSurgical. This was an outstanding quarter with record revenues of $206 million. Fertility, in particular, continued to perform exceptionally well, growing 72% year-over-year to $83 million. Strength was seen around the world and throughout the product portfolio, including from consumables, capital equipment and genetic testing. Some areas of strength included growth in media, for pets, needles, incubators and embryo transfer catheters, along with another very strong quarter from RI Witness, our proprietary automated lab-based management system that clinics implement to maximize safety and security by optimizing their lab practices.
We're also benefiting from increased utilization of our artificial intelligence-based genetic testing platform, which increases the doctor's ability to select the best embryos for transfer. Similar to last quarter, we're continuing to see COVID impact the market, but share gains and improving patient flow in most countries are driving our results.
Regarding the broader fertility market, the global landscape remains fragmented with significant geographic diversity. And with an addressable market opportunity of well over $1 billion and mid- to upper-single-digit growth, this is a great market for us. It's estimated that 1 in 8 couples in the U.S. has trouble getting pregnant due to a variety of factors, including increasing maternal age. And that more than 100 million individuals worldwide suffer from infertility. Given the improving access to fertility treatments, increasing patient awareness, greater comfort discussing IVF and and increasing global disposable income, this industry should grow nicely for many years to come.
So overall, in fertility, our portfolio and market positioning are excellent. We remain in a great spot for future share gains with improving traction in key accounts. We're seeing continued reopening activity around the world, and the industry has great long-term macro growth drivers. For all these reasons, we remain very bullish on this part of our business.
Within our office and surgical unit, we grew 50% with PARAGARD up 51% and office and surgical medical devices up 49%. For PARAGARD, we implemented a roughly 6% price increase towards the end of the quarter, which resulted in a buy-in of roughly $4 million. This will impact our Q4 performance, but the price increases are long-term positive noting with contracts and reimbursement timing, the price increase rolls in over the next couple of years.
Within Medical Devices, several products performed well, including EndoSee Advance, our direct visualization system, for evaluation of the endometrium and our portfolio of uterine manipulators.
To wrap up on CooperSurgical, this was another excellent quarter, and it was great to exceed $200 million in sales for the first time ever. Similar to CooperVision, we have powerful macro trends supporting our underlying growth and remain confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.Third quarter consolidated revenues increased 32% year-over-year or",523,"Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.
Third quarter consolidated revenues increased 32% year-over-year or 28% in constant currency to $763 million. Consolidated gross margin increased year-over-year to 68.3%, up from 66.3% with CooperVision posting higher margins driven by product mix and currency, and CooperSurgical posting higher margins from product mix tied to the significant year-over-year growth in fertility and PARAGARD.
OpEx grew 28% as sales increased with a rebound in revenues, along with higher sales and marketing expenses associated with investments in areas such as myopia management. Consolidated operating margins were strong at 26.6%, up from 23.2% last year. Interest expense was $5.6 million and the effective tax rate was 13.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.41 with roughly 49.8 million average shares outstanding.
Free cash flow was very strong at $180 million, comprised of $224 million of operating cash flow, offset by $44 million of CapEx. Net debt decreased to $1.5 billion and our adjusted leverage ratio improved to 1.5x. Overall, this was a very strong quarter, and we exceeded our financial performance expectations.
Moving to guidance. We continue monitoring and evaluating the scope, duration and impact of COVID-19 and its variants. And while this remains a risk factor, our visibility is sufficient to provide the following update to our guidance. For the full fiscal year, we're increasing our constant currency guidance for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical and maintaining our non-GAAP EPS guidance. Specific to Q4, consolidated revenues are expected to range from $730 million to $760 million, up 7% to 11% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues between $540 million and $560 million up 6% to 10% in constant currency, and CooperSurgical revenues between $190 million and $200 million, up 8.5% to 14% in constant currency.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to range from $3.24 to $3.44. To provide color on this guidance, currency moves since last quarter have reduced the benefit of the full year FX tailwind from 3% to 2.5% for revenues, and 7% to 5% for EPS. With respect to Q4, this equates to reducing revenues by $10 million in CooperVision and $2 million at CooperSurgical, and reducing EPS by $0.14. CooperVision is offsetting some of the impact with expected strength in daily silicone and myopia management sales, while CooperSurgical is expecting continued strength, although incorporating the Q3 PARAGARD buy-in of $4 million and hopefully some conservatism regarding COVID's impact on elective procedures.
Consolidated gross margins for the fiscal year are expected to be around 68%, with fiscal Q4 gross margins expected to be around 67.5%, driven primarily by currency. Operating expenses are expected to be slightly lower sequentially, but similar to fiscal Q3 on a percentage of sales basis, as we continue investing in multiple areas such as myopia management and fertility. Our Q4 tax rate is expected to be around 11%. And lastly, our free cash flow continues to improve, and we're now expecting roughly $550 million for the full year.
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

When I look at the areas of opportunity for us, we're obviously investing in myopia management. We're hiring around the world, myopia management specialists and so forth, and putting dollars behind product launches, which we have going on in a lot of markets around the world. It's a struggle in a few markets, because of COVID restrictions and so forth, but we're still establishing a presence in a lot of new markets and grow myopia management. I -- look at areas like fertility is another good example. We're investing around the world. We're doing our best to go out there and recruit top talent, who's going to support the business for long-term growth. And I feel good about our ability to continue to put up gains. The other area I'd mention is single-use silicones. We're doing well there. We're gaining share there. We've got products in the marketplace and new products coming. So we're excited to invest kind of in that area.
When you look at operating leverage, I look at the 2 businesses a little bit differently and maybe even you'd have to dig down. Operating leverage for something like myopia management, next year is when we start getting big enough. We should be in that $100 million range or so for our myopia management portfolio. You start getting to a point where you're starting to be able to leverage some of those investments and then you do a better job of that, right, in the next couple of years. If you look at something like fertility as an example, I mean, great global business, nice growth big opportunities, but still somewhat small. So it's hard to leverage that infrastructure. You're going to see the leverage from that come over the years as we continue to get bigger. But suffice it to say, you are summarizing that correctly. We are continuing to invest in the business. We are seeing share gains and opportunities for incremental share gains. So we're continuing to invest."

And on that note, you already use Essilor for your Ortho K distribution in China. It would seem like MiSight is just a good natural extension for that relationship. Is that the right way to think about how you plan to tackle that market, at least in the near term?
And then just relatedly, sorry for the series of questions, but can you address MiSight and myopia management revenue targets for fiscal '22 and maybe how China fits into that?"

Yes, when you look at China, it's a little different market than a lot of people probably think when they think of optometry. Here in the U.S. and Europe, you get a lot of markets where there's independent optometrists or it's heavily driven by chains. You certainly get that in China when it comes to what we'll call regular contact lenses. When you're talking about a product like MiSight, treatment products, they're largely sold through hospitals. So that's what we're going to see from MiSight, is sold through some major, major hospital. Whether it's a public owned hospital, government-owned hospital, if you will, or a private hospital. So it's a different call point largely than what you would have for your traditional contact lens business. You are correct, Essilor has a very strong distribution network there. We received the approval on MiSight a little bit faster than we were anticipating it. So I would just say we're in -- put it this way active negotiations right now, you should hear something shortly on how we'll distribute that product through that marketplace.
But to step back a little bit on that, as I mentioned on the call, right, we received the approval. The approval does require us to manufacture and package those products, everything post approval. So we're very actively doing that right now, ramping everything up. We'll get that product into the market probably kind of in the November, December time frame is when you'll see it really coming in. We're supporting that with kind of prelaunch activity right now. And then we'll have that in the market much more aggressively kind of in the January, February time frame.
If we look at the 2022 targets, we talked about those a decent amount in the past. I'm more comfortable with the discussions we've had. We've talked about that kind of $50 million number for MiSight next year. We talked about $100 million of myopia management number. We'll firm that up in December when we give the guidance. The only negative that I've seen on that, frankly, has been currency. A lot of our sales for Ortho K and MiSight are international sales. But outside of that, I'd be more optimistic on our 2022 myopia management growth opportunities."

And there's very high levels of myopia, because so many children go through hospitals and you're not selling to tons of different optometrists, it's a more focused sale. Because of the clinical attributes of a product like that, it can be very successful. And what we've seen in a lot of spots is optometrists do like glasses and they do want to push glasses, especially for kids kind of younger than 10 years old. But you also hear pretty frequently from optometrists that I want to get kids into this treatment in contact lenses as soon as I can, because their belief is it's more efficacious, right? You want to have the treatment going all day long. Kids can take their glasses off to a variety of things. With their glasses with contact lenses, you put them in, you wear them.

The team has really, really killed it in terms of maintaining our manufacturing and distribution network. So there's kind of all kinds of areas. I'd love to be able to narrow that down to 1, but the answer is a little bit more complex there, but it's kind of a full-scale sale into fertility clinics."

Now to be fair, right, it took 3-year clinical data for the FDA the approved MiSight, right? We have 2-year data on SightGlass. SightGlass is clinical was specifically developed to meet the FDA's clinical requirements. So the question will end up being then looking at that data, which is good data, right?

So that's my sort of 1 free question for screwing up the last one.
And then -- the other 1 is just the Americas, I mean it was really strong results in CBI, but I was a little bit surprised to see the 2-year stack, step down a good amount.

If you look at kind of the growth over 2019 -- constant currency growth over 2019 for the calendar quarter, try to do apples-to-apples, we were up 8%. So a pretty good number there. To try to get down to what's going into the U.S., in particular, like that's a little harder to get to. There's a lot of channel, inventory and stuff moving around. I hear people comment about that. We haven't really seen too much of that, but I know there's some of that activity around there. I might just pull that up, Jon, just to the highest level and just say, hey, on a total basis, for calendar Q2 against calendar Q2 of 2019, we grew 8%. Do you remember, Ken, what was the market at? 4%. So twice what the market grew. So not quite sure how to answer the U.S., because I don't have all that data, but we're obviously doing really well against the overall market.
If you look at -- step back to your myopia management question, you're right in those numbers. You look at MiSight going 20 to 50, you look at kind of what's embedded in there from Ortho K 45 to 50, that would be at $100 million. So -- Just to be clear, I continue to say kind of north of $100 million. We haven't given any more color to that or any granularity to that in terms of the numbers. So I'll wait till December.  But our Ortho K franchise is doing well, right? It's growing nicely. It has good momentum. We have a really strong team there, some really smart folks that are driving that business forward. So I continue to remain pretty optimistic on Ortho K. 
And no one should read anything into that as as there's cannibalization or anything else, because we're actually seeing some of the opposite. We're seeing MiSight helping our Ortho K business. So all good there. Yes, don't read anything into that $100 million right now. Make sure you noted as $100 million plus."

We did a little over $4 million. We did a little over $5 million. When I look at August, which was a great month for us, we've seen that momentum pick up on that. I'm feeling pretty optimistic about a good Q4. A couple of things maybe to remember, if you look at as an example, Q4 of last year -- let's go with the U.S. market. Q4 of last year, you'll remember, we gave a lot of fittings away for free. Remember, we were with a lot of optometrists and said, ""Hey, the first 2 fittings are free to get you in, and then we stopped doing that. So you're getting -- you're now getting those kids, a lot of those kids coming back, making purchases, if you will, for the ""first time."" The dropout rates are really, really low on my side. So all those children who went in, in fiscal Q4 of last year, that ""didn't pay"" or at least we didn't receive money are now paying. So not only are you getting the new fits, but you're getting all those other kids coming in on top of that. 
And then we've seen a little bit of a momentum pickup in some of the markets outside of the U.S. So I sit here today and I kind of look at it, and I don't want to get ahead of ourselves on that, but Q4 should be a pretty good quarter for MiSight. Yes. And then China is included for fiscal 2022. It will be interesting to see how that plays out in terms of stocking and order patterns and everything else that happens. But that a market like that and the growth opportunities there and so forth, make me more comfortable of our ability to hit $50 million for MiSight."

The Delta variant is hurting us a little bit there, because you're still seeing some activity where it's hard for optometry offices to staff up enough. And you're just seeing a little bit of a struggle there that's kind of making it not quite as strong as it could be. Having said that, it's still solid. When I look at the fit data that's come out, I do see the shift moving to daily silicone hydrogels picking back up. You kind of saw that in our numbers were a little bit better this quarter when it came to daily siHy. They fit data, in particular, for clariti and MyDay was stronger. So that was cold sea because that's a really good sign. And all that will bode well as we kind of continue to move forward here. 
The other thing is when you think about back-to-school here in the U.S., certainly, it does run into our fiscal fourth quarter. So we need to see how some of that is going to play out. Again, hopefully, being a little conservative with the Delta variant, we'll see how that plays out. I will say that optometry offices are pretty booked. You can go to a lot of areas, right? You can go right into Manhattan and start asking questions, but there's many other spots around the U.S. where you're seeing optometry offices fully booked with appointments out -- going out several months. So patient kind of flow through and so forth is really important right now.
If you look at the number of trained optometrists, I don't have the exact number off the top of my head. It continues to grow more probably in the U.S. market. We've talked about that in the past, somewhere around 5,000 and well, well north of that around the world. The breakdown gets -- it gets pretty detailed pretty fast in terms of who's fitting and how much they're fitting and what the fit characteristics are of all the different practices out there, and it gets a little bit more convoluted when you dig into some of the buying groups and some of the big retailers where we're doing a lot of activity right now. And they're starting to expand all their pilot programs and roll out to more stores and so forth. So that's a hard 1 for me to answer. I kind of just fall back to the revenues at this point and say hey, the proof is in the pudding, right? Like if we're going to move to an $8 million quarter, then we have a lot of people doing a lot of fitting."

If I step back and look at PARAGARD where we're at today and where we're going moving forward, I kind of still in that pretty same place that I was pre-COVID, maybe a little bit more optimistic. But I tend to say, hey, we're going to get somewhere around 4% to 6% growth in that product, half coming from price, half coming from unit growth. I would continue to say that, right? When I look in the outer years, I'd say that's what we're going to see. It will move around a little bit. But at the end of the day, if we can get that growth, say, put it at 5% in the middle of that. If we can get that growth on that high margin of a product, I'd be pretty happy with that.
So that's kind of where we're sitting right now with that product. So to me, all go with respect to PARAGARD. On investments within CooperVision, yes, we are -- we're hiring some salespeople in different spots around the world. I think you mentioned Japan, we're doing it in Japan. We got some exciting product launches and things going there. One of the things that you've seen -- you saw this quarter, as a matter of fact, right, as Europe started to come back and strengthen, you saw positive results from us because of that. I believe you'll see the same in a place like Japan. It's been pretty muted, but we're strong there. We're hiring there. We're investing there. We've launched products there. If that market -- if Japan can start coming back, like we've seen in the U.S. like Europe is doing more so right now, that's going to be the next positive for us.
I think that's kind of -- as that happens, that's the next kick for us, because it's 1 of those markets we're strong in. I know a lot of people like to focus on the U.S. market. Me in this business, we focus on everything around the world. So we have a lot of strong different markets. When you look at investment activity, a lot of that bulletin investment activity, frankly, is tied to myopia management more than it is everything else. I mean we're hiring salespeople and expanding for our core business, but we expect to get a return on those investments relatively quickly."

But I do believe that as we move forward in the coming years, and the myopia management business continues to grow, you're going to see the op margins on that part of our business really ramp themselves up. So at some point, probably, I don't know, maybe the end of next year at some point, Kim asked me about that operating margin and putting it back in the presentations and stuff, we'll probably get there.

I'm pleased to report another very strong quarter with record revenues at CooperVision and CooperSurgical, driving record earnings and robust free cash flow.",1646,"Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper Company's Fiscal Third Quarter Conference Call. I'm pleased to report another very strong quarter with record revenues at CooperVision and CooperSurgical, driving record earnings and robust free cash flow. CooperVision's growth was broad-based and led by our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio of lenses and a solid rebound in EMEA. While our myopia management products also performed really well, and of course, we received the exciting news about regulatory approvals for MiSight in China. 
CooperSurgical continued posting great results led by fertility and a nice bump in PARAGARD, helped by buying activity from a price increase. Moving forward, we expect core operational strength to continue driving strong performance even with challenges from COVID and currency. With this expectation and the opportunities we're seeing in myopia management, daily silicones and fertility, we've increased our constant currency revenue guidance for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical and we'll maintain our investment activity to capitalize on the potential for incremental share gains as we move towards fiscal 2022. 
Moving to third quarter results and reporting all percentages on a constant currency basis, Consolidated revenues were $763 million, with CooperVision at $558 million, up 20%, and CooperSurgical at $206 million, up 58%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.41. For CooperVision, our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio led the way with all 3 regions posting strong growth. Particular strength was noted in our daily toric franchises, but daily spheres and multifocals also performed well. And in a great sign, we've seen a nice uptick in fit data for MyDay and clariti, which bodes well for share gains and future growth. 
Within the regions, the Americas grew 16%, led by MyDay and clariti and continued improvement in patient flow. EMEA grew a healthy 24% as consumer activity returned in the region, and we took share. We're #1 in EMEA, and we're seeing the benefits of increasing patient flow, so we'll continue investing to support the reopening activity happening in many of the European markets. Asia Pac grew 18%, led by a slow but steady improvement in consumer activity. For us, a significant portion of Asia Pac is driven by Japan. And although consumer activity remains somewhat muted, we're performing well and taking share, and we're well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities given our recent product launches. 
Moving to category details. Silicone hydrogel dailies grew 31% and with MyDay and clariti both performing well. MyDay, in particular, continues taking share, led by strength in MyDay toric in all regions. For our FRP portfolio, Biofinity continued its solid performance led by Biofinity Energys and Biofinity toric multifocal. Regarding product expansions and launches, we remain very active. We're finishing the launch of clariti, sphere and the MyDay second base curve sphere in Japan. We're rolling out Biofinity toric multifocal in additional markets. We're rolling out an expanded toric range for MyDay, giving it the broadest range of any daily toric in the world. And we're also completing the rollout of extended toric ranges for clariti and Biofinity. 
We've also started prelaunching activity for MyDay multifocal with the launch -- with a full launch on target for the U.S. and other select markets in November. Feedback on this lens remains extremely positive, including from fitters commenting that our OptiExpert fitting app has the highest fit success rate of any multifocal on the market. Recent data shows that over 90% of contact lens wearers over the age of 40 expect to continue wearing lenses with the biggest challenge being finding a good multifocal. Given the feedback we've been receiving, we believe MyDay will be the best multifocal on the market and combined with the fact that it's joining an already highly successful MyDay sphere and toric, we're very optimistic about its success. 
Moving to myopia management. Our portfolio grew a robust 90% this quarter to $18 million, with MiSight up 187% to $5 million and ortho-k products up 68%. As a global leader in the myopia management space, our portfolio is the broadest in the industry, comprised of MiSight, the only FDA-approved myopia control product, our broad range of market-leading ortho-k lenses, and our innovative SightGlass Vision glasses. We continue targeting $65 million in myopia management sales this year, including MiSight reaching $20 million. 
Regarding MiSight, there was a lot of positive activity this quarter as we continue capitalizing on our first-mover advantage. We received regulatory approval in China, and we're extremely excited about that opportunity. The approval requires lenses to be manufactured post approval. So we've quickly initiated production and packaging, and plan to seed the market starting in early fiscal Q1 with a full launch in fiscal Q2 of next year. As part of this, we're immediately ramping up marketing efforts and working quickly to ensure the product is positioned for success. Myopia rates are very high in China, so the market potential is significant. As an example, it's estimated that over 80% of high school kids are myopic, so treating children at a younger age is of high importance in the country. 
Outside of China, we continue making great progress with our large retailers and buying groups. Our pilot programs are live and expanding, and we've finally been able to resume in-person training in many markets, including in the U.S. We now have over 40,000 children wearing MiSight worldwide, and that number is growing quickly. Additionally, the average age of a new MiSight wearer remains 11, so this treatment is bringing children into contact lenses at a much younger age. 
Lastly, on MiSight, we did see momentum pick up even more in August, including here in the U.S., so we're bullish for a strong Q4. Regarding our other myopia management products, we had a solid quarter for ortho-k driven by our broad product portfolio and from the halo effect we're seeing with MiSight. And we continue making progress with our SightGlass myopia management glasses, preparing for several upcoming launches later this calendar year. We've also submitted our application to the FDA for approval for MiSight as a myopia management treatment and expect to receive initial feedback within a couple of months. 
In the meantime, as the myopia management market continues developing, we're definitely seeing the value of offering multiple options to eye care professionals, so we look forward to expanding our offerings and availability. 
To wrap up on myopia management, our innovation pipeline is very healthy with 8 focused pipeline products. Our sales and marketing efforts are proving successful and our focus on leading with clinical data and providing the best and broadest portfolio in the market, has us in an excellent position for continued success. 
To conclude on vision, our business is doing really well. The back-to-school season is healthy, new fits are doing well, and we're excited about our existing products and upcoming launches. On a longer-term basis, the macro growth trends remained solid, with roughly 33% of the world being myopic today, and that number is expected to increase to 50% by 2050. Given our robust product portfolio, new product launches, myopia management momentum and strong fit data, we're in great shape for long-term sustainable growth. 
Moving to CooperSurgical. This was an outstanding quarter with record revenues of $206 million. Fertility, in particular, continued to perform exceptionally well, growing 72% year-over-year to $83 million. Strike was seen around the world and throughout the product portfolio, including from consumables, capital equipment and genetic testing. Some areas of strength included growth in media, for pets, needles, incubators and embryo transfer catheters, along with another very strong quarter from RI Witness, our proprietary automated lab-based management system that clinics implement to maximize safety and security by optimizing their lab practices. 
We're also benefiting from increased utilization of our artificial intelligence-based genetic testing platform, which increases the doctor's ability to select the best embryos for transfer. Similar to last quarter, we're continuing to see COVID impact the market, but share gains and improving patient flow in most countries are driving our results. 
Regarding the broader fertility market, the global landscape remains fragmented with significant geographic diversity. And with an addressable market opportunity of well over $1 billion and mid- to upper-single-digit growth, this is a great market for us. It's estimated that 1 in 8 couples in the U.S. has trouble getting pregnant due to a variety of factors, including increasing maternal age. And that more than 100 million individuals worldwide suffer from infertility. Given the improving access to fertility treatments, increasing patient awareness, greater comfort discussing IVF and and increasing global disposable income, this industry should grow nicely for many years to come. 
So overall, in fertility, our portfolio and market positioning are excellent. We remain in a great spot for future share gains with improving traction in key accounts. We're seeing continued reopening activity around the world, and the industry has great long-term macro growth drivers. For all these reasons, we remain very bullish on this part of our business. 
Within our office and surgical unit, we grew 50% with PARAGARD up 51% and office and surgical medical devices up 49%. For PARAGARD, we implemented a roughly 6% price increase towards the end of the quarter, which resulted in a buy-in of roughly $4 million. This will impact our Q4 performance, but the price increases are long-term positive noting with contracts and reimbursement timing, the price increase rolls in over the next couple of years. 
Within medical devices, several products performed well, including EndoSee Advance, our direct visualization system, for evaluation of the endometrium and our portfolio of uterine manipulators. 
To wrap up on CooperSurgical, this was another excellent quarter, and it was great to exceed $200 million in sales for the first time ever. Similar to CooperVision, we have powerful macro trends supporting our underlying growth and remain confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Third quarter consolidated revenues increased 32% year-over-year or 28% in constant currency to $763 million. Consolidated gross margin increased year-over-year to 68.3%, up from 66.3% with CooperVision posting higher margins driven by product mix and currency, and CooperSurgical posting higher margins from product mix tied to the significant year-over-year growth in fertility and PARAGARD. 
OpEx grew 28% as sales increased with a rebound in revenues, along with higher sales and marketing expenses associated with investments in areas such as myopia management. Consolidated operating margins were strong at 26.6%, up from 23.2% last year. Interest expense was $5.6 million and the effective tax rate was 13.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.41 with roughly 49.8 million average shares outstanding. 
Free cash flow was very strong at $180 million, comprised of $224 million of operating cash flow, offset by $44 million of CapEx. Net debt decreased to $1.5 billion and our adjusted leverage ratio improved to 1.5x. Overall, this was a very strong quarter, and we exceeded our financial performance expectations.

For the full fiscal year, we're increasing our constant currency guidance for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical and maintaining our non-GAAP EPS guidance. Specific to Q4, consolidated revenues are expected to range from $730 million to $760 million, up 7% to 11% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues between $540 million and $560 million up 6% to 10% in constant currency, and CooperSurgical revenues between $190 million and $200 million, up 8.5% to 14% in constant currency. 
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to range from $3.24 to $3.44. To provide color on this guidance, currency moves since last quarter have reduced the benefit of the full year FX tailwind from 3% to 2.5% for revenues, and 7% to 5% for EPS. With respect to Q4, this equates to reducing revenues by $10 million in CooperVision and $2 million at CooperSurgical, and reducing EPS by $0.14. CooperVision is offsetting some of the impact with expected strength in daily silicone and myopia management sales, while CooperSurgical is expecting continued strength, although incorporating the Q3 PARAGARD buy-in of $4 million and hopefully some conservatism regarding COVID's impact on elective procedures. 
Consolidated gross margins for the fiscal year are expected to be around 68%, with fiscal Q4 gross margins expected to be around 67.5%, driven primarily by currency. Operating expenses are expected to be slightly lower sequentially, but similar to fiscal Q3 on a percentage of sales basis, as we continue investing in multiple areas such as myopia management and fertility. Our Q4 tax rate is expected to be around 11%. And lastly, our free cash flow continues to improve, and we're now expecting roughly $550 million for the full year. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

When I look at the areas of opportunity for us, we're obviously investing in myopia management. We're hiring around the world, myopia management specialists and so forth, and putting dollars behind product launches, which we have going on in a lot of markets around the world. It's a struggle in a few markets, because of COVID restrictions and so forth, but we're still establishing a presence in a lot of new markets and grow myopia management. I look at areas like fertility is another good example. 
We're investing around the world. We're doing our best to go out there and recruit top talent, who's going to support the business for long-term growth. And I feel good about our ability to continue to put up gains. The other area I'd mention is single-use silicones. We're doing well there. We're gaining share there. We've got products in the marketplace and new products coming. So we're excited to invest kind of in that area. 
When you look at operating leverage, I look at the 2 businesses a little bit differently and maybe even you'd have to dig down. Operating leverage for something like myopia management, next year is when we start getting big enough. We should be in that $100 million range or so for our myopia management portfolio. You start getting to a point where you're starting to be able to leverage some of those investments and then you do a better job of that, right, in the next couple of years. 
If you look at something like fertility as an example, I mean, great global business, nice growth big opportunities, but still somewhat small. So it's hard to leverage that infrastructure. You're going to see the leverage from that come over the years as we continue to get bigger. But suffice it to say, you are summarizing that correctly. We are continuing to invest in the business. We are seeing share gains and opportunities for incremental share gains. So we're continuing to invest."

I appreciate the color there. But wondering if you could expand maybe on what the launch in this market looks like beyond just some of the limited and full launch details, maybe how many doctors you're expecting to or planning to train and really how you're thinking about servicing this market? 
And on that note, you already use Essilor for your ortho-k distribution in China. It would seem like MiSight is just a good natural extension for that relationship. Is that the right way to think about how you plan to tackle that market, at least in the near term?
And then just relatedly, sorry for the series of questions, but can you address MiSight and myopia management revenue targets for fiscal '22 and maybe how China fits into that?"

Yes, when you look at China, it's a little different market than a lot of people probably think when they think of optometry. Here in the U.S. and Europe, you get a lot of markets where there's independent optometrists or it's heavily driven by chains. You certainly get that in China when it comes to what we'll call regular contact lenses. When you're talking about a product like MiSight, treatment products, they're largely sold through hospitals. So that's what we're going to see from MiSight as sold through some major, major hospitals there. Whether it's a public-owned hospital, government-owned hospital, if you will, or a private hospital. So it's a different call point largely than what you would have for your traditional contact lens business. You are correct, Essilor has a very strong distribution network there. We received the approval on MiSight a little bit faster than we were anticipating it. So I would just say we're in -- put it this way, we're in just active negotiations right now, you should hear something shortly on how we'll distribute that product through that marketplace.
But to step back a little bit on that, as I mentioned on the call, right, we received the approval. The approval does require us to manufacture and package those products, everything post approval. So we're very actively doing that right now, ramping everything up. We'll get that product into the market probably kind of in the November, December time frame is when you'll see it really coming in. We're supporting that with kind of prelaunch activity right now. And then we'll have that in the market much more aggressively kind of in the January, February time frame.
If we look at the 2022 targets, we talked about those a decent amount in the past. I'm more comfortable with the discussions we've had. We've talked about that kind of $50 million number for MiSight next year. We talked about $100 million of myopia management number. We'll firm that up in December when we give the guidance. The only negative that I've seen on that, frankly, has been currency. A lot of our sales for ortho-k and MiSight are international sales. But outside of that, I'd be more optimistic on our 2022 myopia management growth opportunities."

And there's very high levels of myopia because so many children go through hospitals and you're not selling to tons of different optometrists, it's a more focused sale. Because of the clinical attributes of a product like that, it can be very successful. And what we've seen in a lot of spots is optometrists do like glasses and they do want to push glasses, especially for kids kind of younger than 10 years old. But you also hear pretty frequently from optometrists that I want to get kids into this treatment in contact lenses as soon as I can, because their belief is it's more efficacious, right? You want to have the treatment going all day long. Kids can take their glasses off to a variety of things with their glasses, with contact lenses, you put them in, you wear them. So it's going to be interesting, but I could certainly see a market for MiSight that would be well north of $100 million. That's for sure."

So when a new clinic is opening or when a clinic is getting larger and they're looking at it from a financial perspective of, hey, how can we maximize our own profits.

When you're looking at key accounts within the fertility space, and the bigger clinics that are out there standardizing things, taking advantage of their volume purchases and so forth. It puts us in an excellent position to be able to offer everything. So there is a focus on a variety of things. There are geographic expansion, because there's new areas out there we're going into.

And then being a top service, customer service provider, if you will, ensuring that clinics are getting products, right?

If you look at kind of the growth over 2019 -- constant currency growth over 2019 for the calendar quarter, try to do apples-to-apples, we were up 8%. So a pretty good number there. To try to get down to what's going into the U.S., in particular, like that's a little harder to get to. There's a lot of channel, inventory and stuff moving around. I hear people commenting about that. We haven't really seen too much of that, but I know there's some of that activity around there. So I might just pull that up, Jon, just to the highest level and just say, hey, on a total basis, for calendar Q2 against calendar Q2 of 2019, we grew 8%.

If you look at -- step back to your myopia management question, you're right in those numbers. You look at MiSight going $20 million to $50 million, you look at kind of what's embedded in there from ortho-k $45 million to $50 million, that would be at $100 million. So just to be clear, I continue to say kind of north of $100 million. We haven't given any more color to that or any granularity to that in terms of the numbers. So I'll wait till December. But our ortho-k franchise is doing well, right? It's growing nicely. It has good momentum. We have a really strong team there, some really smart folks that are driving that business forward. So I continue to remain pretty optimistic on ortho-k. 
And no one should read anything into that as as there's cannibalization or anything else, because we're actually seeing some of the opposite. We're seeing MiSight helping our ortho-k business. So all good there. Yes, don't read anything into that $100 million right now. Make sure you note it as $100 million plus."

We did a little over $4 million. We did a little over $5 million. When I look at August, which was a great month for us, we've seen that momentum pick up on that. I'm feeling pretty optimistic about a good Q4. A couple of things maybe to remember, if you look at as an example, Q4 of last year -- let's go with the U.S. market. Q4 of last year, you'll remember, we gave a lot of fittings away for free. Remember, we were with a lot of optometrists and said, hey, the first 2 fittings are free to get you in, and then we stopped doing that. So you're getting -- you're now getting those kids, a lot of those kids coming back, making purchases, if you will, for the ""first time."" The dropout rates are really, really low on my side. So all those children who went in, in fiscal Q4 of last year, that ""didn't pay"" or at least we didn't receive money are now paying. So not only are you getting the new fits, but you're getting all those other kids coming in on top of that. 
And then we've seen a little bit of a momentum pickup in some of the markets outside of the U.S. So I sit here today and I kind of look at it, and I don't want to get ahead of ourselves on that, but Q4 should be a pretty good quarter for MiSight. Yes. And then China is included for fiscal 2022. It will be interesting to see how that plays out in terms of stocking and order patterns and everything else that happens. But that -- a market like that and the growth opportunities there and so forth, make me more comfortable of our ability to hit $50 million for MiSight."

The Delta variant is hurting us a little bit there, because you're still seeing some activity where it's hard for optometry offices to staff up enough. And you're just seeing a little bit of a struggle there that's kind of making it not quite as strong as it could be. Having said that, it's still solid. When I look at the fit data that's come out, I do see the shift moving to daily silicone hydrogels picking back up. You kind of saw that and our numbers were a little bit better this quarter when it came to daily SiHy. They fit data, in particular, for clariti and MyDay was stronger. So that was cool to see because that's a really good sign. And all that will bode well as we kind of continue to move forward here. 
The other thing is when you think about back-to-school here in the U.S., certainly, it does run into our fiscal fourth quarter. So we need to see how some of that is going to play out. Again, hopefully, being a little conservative with the Delta variant, we'll see how that plays out. I will say that optometry offices are pretty booked. You can go to a lot of areas, right? You can go right into Manhattan and start asking questions, but there's many other spots around the U.S. where you're seeing optometry offices fully booked with appointments out -- going out several months. So patient kind of flow through and so forth is really important right now.
If you look at the number of trained optometrists, I don't have the exact number off the top of my head. It continues to grow more probably in the U.S. market. We've talked about that in the past, somewhere around 5,000 and well, well north of that around the world. The breakdown gets -- it gets pretty detailed pretty fast in terms of who's fitting and how much they're fitting and what the fit characteristics are of all the different practices out there, and it gets a little bit more convoluted when you dig into some of the buying groups and some of the big retailers where we're doing a lot of activity right now. And they're starting to expand all their pilot programs and roll out to more stores and so forth. 
So that's a hard one for me to answer. I kind of just fall back to the revenues at this point and say, hey, the proof is in the pudding, right? Like if we're going to move to an $8 million quarter, then we have a lot of people doing a lot of fitting."

We did do the price increase, so we allow a buy-in before the price increase. So we saw that, and we probably pulled in around $4 million into Q3. So you can expect the Q4 PARAGARD number to be down some because of that. If I step back and look at PARAGARD where we're at today and where we're going moving forward, I kind of still am in that pretty same place that I was pre-COVID, maybe a little bit more optimistic. But I tend to say, hey, we're going to get somewhere around 4% to 6% growth in that product, half coming from price, half coming from unit growth. I would continue to say that, right? When I look in the outer years, I'd say that's what we're going to see. It will move around a little bit. But at the end of the day, if we can get that growth, say, put it at 5% in the middle of that. If we can get that growth on that high margin of a product, I'd be pretty happy with that.
So that's kind of where we're sitting right now with that product. So to me, all good with respect to PARAGARD. On investments within CooperVision, yes, we are -- we're hiring some salespeople in different spots around the world. I think you mentioned Japan, we're doing it in Japan. We got some exciting product launches and things going there. One of the things that you've seen -- you saw this quarter, as a matter of fact, right, as Europe started to come back and strengthen, you saw positive results from us because of that. I believe you'll see the same in a place like Japan. It's been pretty muted, but we're strong there. We're hiring there. We're investing there. We've launched products there. If that market -- if Japan can start coming back, like we've seen in the U.S., like Europe is doing more so right now, that's going to be the next positive for us.
I think that's the kind of -- as that happens, that's the next kick for us, because it's one of those markets we're strong in. I know a lot of people like to focus on the U.S. market. Me, in this business, we focus on everything around the world. So we have a lot of strong different markets. When you look at investment activity, a lot of that bulletin investment activity, frankly, is tied to myopia management more than it is everything else. I mean we're hiring salespeople and expanding for our core business, but we expect to get a return on those investments relatively quickly."

I'm pleased to report another very strong quarter with record revenues at CooperVision and CooperSurgical, driving record earnings and robust free cash flow.",1644,"Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper Companies' Fiscal Third Quarter Conference Call. I'm pleased to report another very strong quarter with record revenues at CooperVision and CooperSurgical, driving record earnings and robust free cash flow. CooperVision's growth was broad-based and led by our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio of lenses and a solid rebound in EMEA. While our myopia management products also performed really well, and of course, we received the exciting news about regulatory approvals for MiSight in China. 
CooperSurgical continued posting great results led by fertility and a nice bump in PARAGARD, helped by buy-in activity from a price increase. Moving forward, we expect core operational strength to continue driving strong performance even with challenges from COVID and currency. With this expectation and the opportunities we're seeing in myopia management, daily silicones and fertility, we've increased our constant currency revenue guidance for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical and we'll maintain our investment activity to capitalize on the potential for incremental share gains as we move towards fiscal 2022. 
Moving to third quarter results and reporting all percentages on a constant currency basis, Consolidated revenues were $763 million, with CooperVision at $558 million, up 20%, and CooperSurgical at $206 million, up 58%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.41. For CooperVision, our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio led the way with all 3 regions posting strong growth. Particular strength was noted in our daily toric franchises, but daily spheres and multifocals also performed well. And in a great sign, we've seen a nice uptick in fit data for MyDay and clariti, which bodes well for share gains and future growth. 
Within the regions, the Americas grew 16%, led by MyDay and clariti and continued improvement in patient flow. EMEA grew a healthy 24% as consumer activity returned in the region, and we took share. We're #1 in EMEA, and we're seeing the benefits of increasing patient flow, so we'll continue investing to support the reopening activity happening in many of the European markets. Asia Pac grew 18%, led by a slow but steady improvement in consumer activity. For us, a significant portion of Asia Pac is driven by Japan. And although consumer activity remains somewhat muted, we're performing well and taking share, and we're well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities given our recent product launches. 
Moving to category details. Silicone hydrogel dailies grew 31%, with MyDay and clariti both performing well. MyDay, in particular, continues taking share, led by strength in MyDay toric in all regions. For our FRP portfolio, Biofinity continued its solid performance led by Biofinity Energys and Biofinity toric multifocal. Regarding product expansions and launches, we remain very active. We're finishing the launch of clariti, sphere and the MyDay second base curve sphere in Japan. We're rolling out Biofinity toric multifocal in additional markets. We're rolling out an expanded toric range for MyDay, giving it the broadest range of any daily toric in the world. And we're also completing the rollout of extended toric ranges for clariti and Biofinity. 
We've also started prelaunching activity for MyDay multifocal with the launch -- with a full launch on target for the U.S. and other select markets in November. Feedback on this lens remains extremely positive, including from fitters commenting that our OptiExpert fitting app has the highest fit success rate of any multifocal on the market. Recent data shows that over 90% of contact lens wearers over the age of 40 expect to continue wearing lenses with the biggest challenge being finding a good multifocal. Given the feedback we've been receiving, we believe MyDay will be the best multifocal on the market and combined with the fact that it's joining an already highly successful MyDay sphere and toric, we're very optimistic about its success. 
Moving to myopia management. Our portfolio grew a robust 90% this quarter to $18 million, with MiSight up 187% to $5 million and ortho-k products up 68%. As a global leader in the myopia management space, our portfolio is the broadest in the industry, comprised of MiSight, the only FDA-approved myopia control product, our broad range of market-leading ortho-k lenses, and our innovative SightGlass Vision glasses. We continue targeting $65 million in myopia management sales this year, including MiSight reaching $20 million. 
Regarding MiSight, there was a lot of positive activity this quarter as we continue capitalizing on our first-mover advantage. We received regulatory approval in China, and we're extremely excited about that opportunity. The approval requires lenses to be manufactured post approval. So we've quickly initiated production and packaging, and plan to seed the market starting in early fiscal Q1 with a full launch in fiscal Q2 of next year. As part of this, we're immediately ramping up marketing efforts and working quickly to ensure the product is positioned for success. Myopia rates are very high in China, so the market potential is significant. As an example, it's estimated that over 80% of high school kids are myopic, so treating children at a younger age is of high importance in the country. 
Outside of China, we continue making great progress with our large retailers and buying groups. Our pilot programs are live and expanding, and we've finally been able to resume in-person training in many markets, including in the U.S. We now have over 40,000 children wearing MiSight worldwide, and that number is growing quickly. Additionally, the average age of a new MiSight wearer remains 11, so this treatment is bringing children into contact lenses at a much younger age. 
Lastly, on MiSight, we did see momentum pick up even more in August, including here in the U.S., so we're bullish for a strong Q4. Regarding our other myopia management products, we had a solid quarter for ortho-k driven by our broad product portfolio and from the halo effect we're seeing with MiSight. And we continue making progress with our SightGlass myopia management glasses, preparing for several upcoming launches later this calendar year. We've also submitted our application to the FDA for approval for MiSight as a myopia management treatment and expect to receive initial feedback within a couple of months. 
In the meantime, as the myopia management market continues developing, we're definitely seeing the value of offering multiple options to eye care professionals, so we look forward to expanding our offerings and availability. 
To wrap up on myopia management, our innovation pipeline is very healthy with 8 focused pipeline products. Our sales and marketing efforts are proving successful and our focus on leading with clinical data and providing the best and broadest portfolio in the market, has us in an excellent position for continued success. 
To conclude on vision, our business is doing really well. The back-to-school season is healthy, new fits are doing well, and we're excited about our existing products and upcoming launches. On a longer-term basis, the macro growth trends remained solid, with roughly 33% of the world being myopic today, and that number is expected to increase to 50% by 2050. Given our robust product portfolio, new product launches, myopia management momentum and strong fit data, we're in great shape for long-term sustainable growth. 
Moving to CooperSurgical. This was an outstanding quarter with record revenues of $206 million. Fertility, in particular, continued to perform exceptionally well, growing 72% year-over-year to $83 million. Strike was seen around the world and throughout the product portfolio, including from consumables, capital equipment and genetic testing. Some areas of strength included growth in media, for pets, needles, incubators and embryo transfer catheters, along with another very strong quarter from RI Witness, our proprietary automated lab-based management system that clinics implement to maximize safety and security by optimizing their lab practices. 
We're also benefiting from increased utilization of our artificial intelligence-based genetic testing platform, which increases the doctor's ability to select the best embryos for transfer. Similar to last quarter, we're continuing to see COVID impact the market, but share gains and improving patient flow in most countries are driving our results. 
Regarding the broader fertility market, the global landscape remains fragmented with significant geographic diversity. And with an addressable market opportunity of well over $1 billion and mid- to upper-single-digit growth, this is a great market for us. It's estimated that 1 in 8 couples in the U.S. has trouble getting pregnant due to a variety of factors, including increasing maternal age. And that more than 100 million individuals worldwide suffer from infertility. Given the improving access to fertility treatments, increasing patient awareness, greater comfort discussing IVF and increasing global disposable income, this industry should grow nicely for many years to come. 
So overall, in fertility, our portfolio and market positioning are excellent. We remain in a great spot for future share gains with improving traction in key accounts. We're seeing continued reopening activity around the world, and the industry has great long-term macro growth drivers. For all these reasons, we remain very bullish on this part of our business. 
Within our office and surgical unit, we grew 50% with PARAGARD up 51% and office and surgical medical devices up 49%. For PARAGARD, we implemented a roughly 6% price increase towards the end of the quarter, which resulted in a buy-in of roughly $4 million. This will impact our Q4 performance, but the price increases are long-term positive noting with contracts and reimbursement timing, the price increase rolls in over the next couple of years. 
Within medical devices, several products performed well, including EndoSee Advance, our direct visualization system, for evaluation of the endometrium and our portfolio of uterine manipulators. 
To wrap up on CooperSurgical, this was another excellent quarter, and it was great to exceed $200 million in sales for the first time ever. Similar to CooperVision, we have powerful macro trends supporting our underlying growth and remain confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.

Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. 
Third quarter consolidated revenues increased 32% year-over-year or 28% in constant currency to $763 million. Consolidated gross margin increased year-over-year to 68.3%, up from 66.3% with CooperVision posting higher margins driven by product mix and currency, and CooperSurgical posting higher margins from product mix tied to the significant year-over-year growth in fertility and PARAGARD. 
OpEx grew 28% as sales increased with a rebound in revenues, along with higher sales and marketing expenses associated with investments in areas such as myopia management. Consolidated operating margins were strong at 26.6%, up from 23.2% last year. Interest expense was $5.6 million and the effective tax rate was 13.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.41 with roughly 49.8 million average shares outstanding. 
Free cash flow was very strong at $180 million, comprised of $224 million of operating cash flow, offset by $44 million of CapEx. Net debt decreased to $1.5 billion and our adjusted leverage ratio improved to 1.5x. Overall, this was a very strong quarter, and we exceeded our financial performance expectations. 
Moving to guidance. We continue monitoring and evaluating the scope, duration and impact of COVID-19 and its variants. And while this remains a risk factor, our visibility is sufficient to provide the following update to our guidance. For the full fiscal year, we're increasing our constant currency guidance for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical and maintaining our non-GAAP EPS guidance. Specific to Q4, consolidated revenues are expected to range from $730 million to $760 million, up 7% to 11% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues between $540 million and $560 million, up 6% to 10% in constant currency, and CooperSurgical revenues between $190 million and $200 million, up 8.5% to 14% in constant currency. 
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to range from $3.24 to $3.44. To provide color on this guidance, currency moves since last quarter have reduced the benefit of the full year FX tailwind from 3% to 2.5% for revenues, and 7% to 5% for EPS. With respect to Q4, this equates to reducing revenues by $10 million in CooperVision and $2 million at CooperSurgical, and reducing EPS by $0.14. CooperVision is offsetting some of the impact with expected strength in daily silicone and myopia management sales, while CooperSurgical is expecting continued strength, although incorporating the Q3 PARAGARD buy-in of $4 million and hopefully some conservatism regarding COVID's impact on elective procedures. 
Consolidated gross margins for the fiscal year are expected to be around 68%, with fiscal Q4 gross margins expected to be around 67.5%, driven primarily by currency. Operating expenses are expected to be slightly lower sequentially, but similar to fiscal Q3 on a percentage of sales basis, as we continue investing in multiple areas such as myopia management and fertility. Our Q4 tax rate is expected to be around 11%. And lastly, our free cash flow continues to improve, and we're now expecting roughly $550 million for the full year. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

When you look at operating leverage, I look at the 2 businesses a little bit differently and maybe even you'd have to dig down. Operating leverage for something like myopia management, next year is when we start getting big enough. We should be in that $100 million range or so for our myopia management portfolio. You start getting to a point where you're starting to be able to leverage some of those investments and then you do a better job of that, right, in the next couple of years. 
If you look at something like fertility as an example, I mean, great global business, nice growth big opportunities, but still somewhat small. So it's hard to leverage that infrastructure. You're going to see the leverage from that come over the years as we continue to get bigger. But suffice it to say, you are summarizing that correctly. We are continuing to invest in the business. We are seeing share gains and opportunities for incremental share gains. So we're continuing to invest."

I appreciate the color there. But wondering if you could expand maybe on what the launch in this market looks like beyond just some of the limited and full launch details, maybe how many doctors you're expecting to or planning to train and really how you're thinking about servicing this market? 
And on that note, you already use Essilor for your ortho-k distribution in China. It would seem like MiSight is just a good natural extension for that relationship. Is that the right way to think about how you plan to tackle that market, at least in the near term?
And then just relatedly, sorry for the series of questions, but can you address MiSight and myopia management revenue targets for fiscal '22 and maybe how China fits into that?"

Yes, when you look at China, it's a little different market than a lot of people probably think when they think of optometry. Here in the U.S. and Europe, you get a lot of markets where there's independent optometrists or it's heavily driven by chains. You certainly get that in China when it comes to what we'll call regular contact lenses. When you're talking about a product like MiSight, treatment products, they're largely sold through hospitals. So that's what we're going to see from MiSight, it's sold through some major, major hospitals there. Whether it's a public-owned hospital, government-owned hospital, if you will, or a private hospital. So it's a different call point largely than what you would have for your traditional contact lens business. You are correct, Essilor has a very strong distribution network there. We received the approval on MiSight a little bit faster than we were anticipating it. So I would just say we're in -- put it this way, we're in just active negotiations right now, you should hear something shortly on how we'll distribute that product through that marketplace.
But to step back a little bit on that, as I mentioned on the call, right, we received the approval. The approval does require us to manufacture and package those products, everything post approval. So we're very actively doing that right now, ramping everything up. We'll get that product into the market probably kind of in the November, December time frame is when you'll see it really coming in. We're supporting that with kind of prelaunch activity right now. And then we'll have that in the market much more aggressively kind of in the January, February time frame.
If we look at the 2022 targets, we talked about those a decent amount in the past. I'm more comfortable with the discussions we've had. We've talked about that kind of $50 million number for MiSight next year. We talked about $100 million myopia management number. We'll firm that up in December when we give the guidance. The only negative that I've seen on that, frankly, has been currency. A lot of our sales for ortho-k and MiSight are international sales. But outside of that, I'd be more optimistic on our 2022 myopia management growth opportunities."

The environment in China for a product like MiSight is very positive. And there's very high levels of myopia because so many children go through hospitals and you're not selling to tons of different optometrists, it's a more focused sale. Because of the clinical attributes of a product like that, it can be very successful. And what we've seen in a lot of spots is optometrists do like glasses and they do want to push glasses, especially for kids kind of younger than 10 years old. But you also hear pretty frequently from optometrists that I want to get kids into this treatment in contact lenses as soon as I can, because their belief is it's more efficacious, right? You want to have the treatment going all day long. Kids can take their glasses off to a variety of things with their glasses, with contact lenses, you put them in, you wear them. So it's going to be interesting, but I could certainly see a market for MiSight that would be well north of $100 million. That's for sure."

We've been seeing things continue to improve. Whether you're in Europe, whether you're in Asia Pac, you're seeing things continue to improve. The U.S. kind of came back relatively quickly, but we're still seeing fits improve a little bit in the U.S. So we're not seeing a lot of negativeness coming out of the COVID and Delta variant yet, but I certainly think it's prudent to be a little careful when you're guiding to numbers and what's going on in the marketplace today."

So when a new clinic is opening or when a clinic is getting larger and they're looking at it from a financial perspective of, hey, how can we maximize our own profits. When you're looking at key accounts, we've been very successful on vision. When you're looking at key accounts within the fertility space, and the bigger clinics that are out there standardizing things, taking advantage of their volume purchases and so forth. It puts us in an excellent position to be able to offer everything. So there is a focus on a variety of things. There are geographic expansion, because there's new areas out there we're going into. There's areas around the world where you're seeing additional clinics being built out. A focus on key accounts, trying to expand our relationships with those key accounts. 
And then being a top service, customer service provider, if you will, ensuring that clinics are getting products, right? I mean that's one of the things that's tough in a lot of industries right now is demand for products and supply constraints. We've done a fantastic job. The team has really, really killed it in terms of maintaining our manufacturing and distribution network. So there's kind of all kinds of areas.

Jon, you're asking about kind of market share. When I look at it, I'd say, okay, well, what did you grow against 2019 Q2 at. We grew 8% and I've got the market growing 4%."

It's a pretty big sequential step to get to the approaching $20 million or close to $20 million you're now talking about and then the run rate has to kind of continue to accelerate on that to get to that $50 million next year. So again, does -- one, does China add to that $50 million? I was trying to understand your comment there that just gives you increased confidence in the $50 million. And two, how do we connect the dots just here in the near term on kind of that sequential improvement that's kind of implied over the next few quarters?"

So we do need a solid Q4. So if I look at it, we did a touch over $3 million. We did a little over $4 million. We did a little over $5 million.

We did a little over $4 million. We did a little over $5 million. When I look at August, which was a great month for us, we've seen that momentum pick up on that. I'm feeling pretty optimistic about a good Q4. A couple of things maybe to remember, if you look at as an example, Q4 of last year -- let's go with the U.S. market. Q4 of last year, you'll remember, we gave a lot of fittings away for free. Remember, we were with a lot of optometrists and said, hey, the first 2 fittings are free to get you in, and then we stopped doing that. So you're getting -- you're now getting those kids, a lot of those kids coming back, making purchases, if you will, for the ""first time."" The dropout rates are really, really low on my side. So all those children who went in, in fiscal Q4 of last year, that ""didn't pay"" or at least we didn't receive money are now paying. So not only are you getting the new fits, but you're getting all those other kids coming in on top of that. 
And then we've seen a little bit of a momentum pickup in some of the markets outside of the U.S. So I sit here today and I kind of look at it, and I don't want to get ahead of ourselves on that, but Q4 should be a pretty good quarter for MiSight. Yes. And then China is included for fiscal 2022. It will be interesting to see how that plays out in terms of stocking and order patterns and everything else that happens. But that -- a market like that and the growth opportunities there and so forth, make me more comfortable of our ability to hit $50 million for MiSight."

The Delta variant is hurting us a little bit there, because you're still seeing some activity where it's hard for optometry offices to staff up enough. And you're just seeing a little bit of a struggle there that's kind of making it not quite as strong as it could be. Having said that, it's still solid. When I look at the fit data that's come out, I do see the shift moving to daily silicone hydrogels picking back up. You kind of saw that and our numbers were a little bit better this quarter when it came to daily SiHy. They fit data, in particular, for clariti and MyDay was stronger. So that was cool to see because that's a really good sign. And all that will bode well as we kind of continue to move forward here. 
The other thing is when you think about back-to-school here in the U.S., certainly, it does run into our fiscal fourth quarter. So we need to see how some of that is going to play out. Again, hopefully, being a little conservative with the Delta variant, we'll see how that plays out. I will say that optometry offices are pretty booked. You can go to a lot of areas, right? You can go right into Manhattan and start asking questions, but there's many other spots around the U.S. where you're seeing optometry offices fully booked with appointments out -- going out several months. So patient kind of flow through and so forth is really important right now.
If you look at the number of trained optometrists, I don't have the exact number off the top of my head. It continues to grow more probably in the U.S. market. We've talked about that in the past, somewhere around 5,000 and well, well north of that around the world. The breakdown gets -- it gets pretty detailed pretty fast in terms of who's fitting and how much they're fitting and what the fit characteristics are of all the different practices out there, and it gets a little bit more convoluted when you dig into some of the buying groups and some of the big retailers where we're doing a lot of activity right now. And they're starting to expand all their pilot programs and roll out to more stores and so forth. 
So that's a hard one for me to answer. I kind of just fall back to the revenues at this point and say, hey, the proof is in the pudding, right? Like if we're going to move to an $8 million quarter, then we have a lot of people doing a lot of fitting."

We did do the price increase, so we allow a buy-in before the price increase. So we saw that, and we probably pulled in around $4 million into Q3. So you can expect the Q4 PARAGARD number to be down some because of that. If I step back and look at PARAGARD where we're at today and where we're going moving forward, I kind of still in that pretty same place that I was pre-COVID, maybe a little bit more optimistic. But I tend to say, hey, we're going to get somewhere around 4% to 6% growth in that product, half coming from price, half coming from unit growth. I would continue to say that, right? When I look in the outer years, I'd say that's what we're going to see. It will move around a little bit. But at the end of the day, if we can get that growth, say, put it at 5% in the middle of that. If we can get that growth on that high margin of a product, I'd be pretty happy with that.
So that's kind of where we're sitting right now with that product. So to me, all good with respect to PARAGARD. On investments within CooperVision, yes, we are -- we're hiring some salespeople in different spots around the world. I think you mentioned Japan, we're doing it in Japan. We got some exciting product launches and things going there. One of the things that you've seen -- you saw this quarter, as a matter of fact, right, as Europe started to come back and strengthen, you saw positive results from us because of that. I believe you'll see the same in a place like Japan. It's been pretty muted, but we're strong there. We're hiring there. We're investing there. We've launched products there. If that market -- if Japan can start coming back, like we've seen in the U.S., like Europe is doing more so right now, that's going to be the next positive for us.
I think that's the kind of -- as that happens, that's the next kick for us, because it's one of those markets we're strong in. I know a lot of people like to focus on the U.S. market. Me, in this business, we focus on everything around the world. So we have a lot of strong different markets. When you look at investment activity, a lot of that bulletin investment activity, frankly, is tied to myopia management more than it is everything else. I mean we're hiring salespeople and expanding for our core business, but we expect to get a return on those investments relatively quickly."

I'm pleased to report another strong quarter led by record revenues at CooperVision, where we exceeded the high end of expectations for the quarter. Our dai",1736,"Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to Cooper Companies' fiscal fourth quarter conference call. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter led by record revenues at CooperVision, where we exceeded the high end of expectations for the quarter. Our daily silicone hydrogel and myopia management portfolios posted strong results, and our key account strategy generated share gains in markets around the world. 
Within CooperSurgical, our fertility business continued to perform extremely well, and we recently announced an exciting agreement to acquire Generate Life Sciences, a great strategic fit with our fertility and labor and delivery offerings. 
For the full fiscal year 2021, I'm proud to report record revenues at both CooperVision and CooperSurgical, record non-GAAP earnings and record free cash flow. As we enter fiscal 2022, we have strong momentum and expect another record setting year. 
Regarding fourth quarter results and reporting all percentages on a constant currency basis, consolidated revenues were $759 million, with CooperVision at $565 million, up 11%; and CooperSurgical at $194 million, up 11%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.28. 
For CooperVision, our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio led the way growing 19%. All 3 regions reported strength in this product category with our premium product, MyDay, and our mass market product, clariti, both performing really well. Biofinity also had a solid quarter, supported by strength in torics and multifocals. 
For the regions, the Americas grew 6%, led by our daily silicone hydrogel lenses with particular strength in MyDay where we continue seeing strong fit activity. EMEA grew a healthy 15% with improving consumer activity and strength in our key accounts driving growth and share gains. Within this region, we posted broad-based growth from our daily silicones and Biofinity. Asia Pac grew 14%, led by a steady improvement in consumer activity and success with several new product launches. This region remains a very important growth driver for us, and we're investing accordingly as we're outperforming the market and taking share. 
For our FRP portfolio, Biofinity posted solid results, driving growth in markets around the world with its broad offerings, including a toric multifocal and Energys, the most innovative product in the monthly space. 
Regarding product launches, we remain incredibly active. I've highlighted in the past the many products and range extensions we've been launching around the world for MyDay, clariti and Biofinity, and all that activity continued. This has driven consistent share gains, and we expect that to continue. 
One recent launch that I want to highlight this quarter is our new MyDay multifocal. We've launched the product in the U.S. and several major European markets, and the feedback and results are absolutely fantastic. 
We're consistently hearing from eye care practitioners that the new binocular progressive fitting system is a breakthrough approach that simplifies fit and provides optimal visual acuity at all levels. And we're hearing that from patients who are touting it as the best multifocal they've ever worn for exceptional near intermediate and distant vision. We expect this launch to continue performing extremely well and to provide a nice halo effect supporting the already successful MyDay brand of torics and spheres. 
Moving to myopia management. Our portfolio grew 63% to $21 million, with MiSight up 165% to $7 million and Ortho K products up 40%. We reached our goal of $65 million for the year, up 76% year-over-year, and our momentum is strong. 
As a global leader in the myopia management space, our portfolio is the broadest in the industry, comprised of MiSight, the only FDA-approved myopia control product; our broad range of market-leading Ortho K lenses and our innovative sight glass vision glasses. 
Regarding MiSight, we didn't quite reach our target this quarter, but we did reach $19 million in sales for the full year, up a very impressive 149% year-over-year. We're making great progress with independent optometrists, buying groups and retailers around the world, and we're seeing momentum in all these channels. 
We're also making great progress in China, where we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Essilor. Essilor is now actively promoting MiSight following a soft launch last month at one of the largest ophthalmic trade shows, and we're on target for a full launch in fiscal Q2. 
We've also assembled an advisory board of key opinion leaders whose affiliated hospitals represent over 50% of myopia management contact lens volume in China. This team of experts is providing fantastic insight into our MiSight positioning and how we can grow Ortho K even faster and how SightGlass will successfully fit in. As a reminder, childhood myopia rates in China are estimated at over 80%, and reducing myopia is a priority for the Chinese government, so the opportunity is significant. 
Lastly, we recently presented our industry-leading 7-year clinical study of MiSight, confirming the product works for nearly all myopic children. It cuts myopia progression by roughly 59% on average. It works at any age child starts treatment. It works for as long as the child wears it, and there's no rebound if treatment has stopped. These are the drivers that will continue supporting short- and long-term growth. 
Regarding our other myopia management products, our Ortho K portfolio performed really well led by success in China. And in November, we commercially colaunched our SightGlass myopia management glasses in Europe with Essilor and we'll be partnering with them on several additional launches coming soon. 
Overall, on myopia management, our momentum is strong, and we're still targeting constant currency growth of over 50% in fiscal 2022 to roughly $100 million in sales. 
To conclude our vision, we estimate the overall contact lens market grew 7% in calendar Q3, while CooperVision grew 8% even as new fits remain below pre-COVID levels. According to recent U.S. data, roughly 64% of eye care practitioners stated they had capacity to serve more patients but cannot, mostly due to staffing challenges. Having said that, trends are positive, and we expect the market to grow in the 4% to 6% range this coming year, supported by improving fit activity in the U.S. and EMEA and reopening activity in Asia Pac. Meanwhile, the long-term macro growth trends remain solid, with roughly 1/3 of the world being myopic today, and that's expected to increase to 50% by 2050. 
For CooperVision, we closed this fiscal year on a really strong note, exceeding the high end of our expectations, and we've entered fiscal 2022 with a robust product portfolio, new product launches, a fast-growing myopia management business and strong Fit Data. To ensure we're seizing the growth opportunities in front of us, we've increased our sales force investments, and we'll continue with our successful myopia management investment strategy. We have strong momentum. We're growing faster than the market, and we expect that to continue. 
Moving to CooperSurgical. Our fertility business performed exceptionally well, growing 24% year-over-year to $82 million. Strength was seen around the world and throughout our product portfolio, including from consumables, capital equipment and genomics. 
One particular area of continued strength was our RI Witness platform. This is our proprietary automated lab management system that clinics implement to maximize safety and security by optimizing their lab practices. A system like this is especially important in today's world to improve quality control and workflow management to enable social distancing and prevent mistakes such as embryo mismatches, which you unfortunately occasionally hear about. 
Regarding the broader fertility industry, our addressable market is approaching $2 billion with 5% to 10% long-term growth expected. It's estimated that 1 in 8 couples has trouble getting pregnant due to a variety of factors, such as increasing maternal age, and that more than 100 million individuals worldwide suffer from infertility. Given the improving access to treatments, increasing patient awareness, greater comfort discussing IVF and increasing global disposable income, this industry should grow nicely for many years to come. 
Within our office and surgical unit, we grew 3%. Medical Devices performed well, growing 20%, led by our portfolio of uterine manipulators, several of our surgical devices and our next-generation NOC Advance product line. 
Meanwhile, PARAGARD declined 17%, largely as forecasted due to buy-in activity from last quarter's price increase. Having said that, similar to what we've seen from the general IUD market, the performance was soft, likely due to COVID staffing challenges. 
Lastly, for CooperSurgical, we recently announced an agreement to acquire Generate Life Sciences for $1.6 billion. Many of you may know this company as a core blood storage business, but they've done a phenomenal job expanding over the years, and this business is now a great strategic fit for CooperSurgical, as they're a leader in donor egg and sperm and cryopreservation services for fertility treatments as well as being a leader in cord blood and cord tissue storage, which is an excellent fit with our labor and delivery group. 
We have an investor presentation on our website that summarizes the deal, but let me provide some additional color. 
Roughly 1/3 of the business is in fertility, which we estimate will grow 5% to 10% long term, supported by general industry growth. Meanwhile, combining Generate's offerings with our existing portfolio allows us to leverage our infrastructure, launch new products and go international to accelerate growth beyond this range. 
2/3 of the business is in cord blood and cord tissue storage, which we expect to grow 3% to 5% long term. This is driven by increasing demand for cord tissue stem cells due to optimism around the significant number of clinical trials using these stem cells for regenerative medicine. Consolidated, this business offers long-term sustainable growth of 4% to 6%, and we believe there are opportunities to push that range higher with potential revenue synergies as we leverage our expertise. 
To finish, let me make a few comments on fiscal 2022. Introducing annual guidance in today's world is a challenge given COVID uncertainties. Regardless, our organic revenue growth is strong, and we expect that to continue. We're investing in product launches, and we're doing that intelligently by leveraging our operations to ensure we receive strong returns. 
I believe CooperVision is the most innovative company in the contact lens space today with leading products in myopia management and the broadest product offerings in the market, and CooperSurgical is in an extremely exciting position led by our fertility business. As a company, we remain on a steady upward trend, and we see that continuing for fiscal 2022 and many years beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Fourth quarter consolidated revenues increased 11% year-over-year a",596,"Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. 
Fourth quarter consolidated revenues increased 11% year-over-year and also 11% in constant currency to $759 million. Consolidated gross margin decreased year-over-year by 20 basis points to 67.5%, driven primarily by currency, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs at CooperVision.  
Operating expenses grew 16% as strategic investments in sales and marketing to support myopia management and fertility continue. Within this, we did see slightly higher than initially forecasted investments for SightGlass vision and MiSight in China along with elevated distribution costs tied to higher demand of direct shipments. 
Consolidated operating margins were 24.9%, down from 26.8% last year. Interest expense was $5 million on lower average debt and the effective tax rate was 10.3%, helped by stock option exercises in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.28 with roughly 49.9 million average shares outstanding. FX negatively impacted us and was roughly $0.05 worse than expected when we gave guidance last quarter. 
Free cash flow was solid at $110 million, comprised of $175 million of operating cash flow, offset by $65 million of CapEx. Net debt decreased to $1.4 billion, and our adjusted leverage ratio improved to 1.38x. 
Moving to 2022 guidance and excluding the recently announced Generate Life Sciences acquisition, Consolidated revenues are expected to be in the range of $3.032 billion to $3.090 billion, up 6% to 8% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues between $2.225 billion and $2.267 billion, up 6% to 8% in constant currency, and CooperSurgical revenues between $807 million and $823 million, up 6% to 8% in constant currency. 
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to range from $13.60 to $14, up 9.5% to 12.5% in constant currency. And the tax rate is expected to be around 13%. At the midpoint of guidance, this equates to constant currency revenue growth of roughly 7% and constant currency EPS growth of roughly 11%. Regarding currency on a year-over-year basis, we're expecting an FX headwind of roughly 2.5% on revenues and 7% on EPS. This impact will be most detrimental in Q1, where we're expecting EPS in the $3 to $3.10 range. 
Before opening the call to questions, let me touch on the Generate Life Sciences acquisition that we announced on November 10. As of today, we're optimistic we'll close in the next couple of weeks, which would give us roughly 10.5 months of their operations in our fiscal 2022. Having said that, we're still waiting for final regulatory approvals, so we're not providing specific guidance today. 
In the meantime, let me walk you through the deal accretion that we expect. As previously announced, Generate has roughly $250 million in trailing 12-month revenue. Gross margins are expected to be roughly 70%, and OpEx is expected to be elevated in year 1 as synergies are expected to be minimal as we integrate and invest in the business. As we are now closer to securing permanent financing for this transaction, we are updating our year 1 non-GAAP EPS accretion estimate to around $0.50, and would add that we expect this accretion to improve in year 2 with synergies. 
In summary, we're pleased with how we closed this fiscal year. And we look forward -- and as we look forward into 2022 and beyond, we continue to believe our strategic investments will drive top line momentum, supporting share gains in both businesses and long-term sustainable earnings growth. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

Yes, this is a great deal for",494,"Sure. Yes. I'm happy to be talking about this. I know we made the announcement, and it was frustrating for many of you and absolutely frustrating for me to not be talking about it on a deal that I'm pretty passionate about. 
Yes, this is a great deal for us. It's a great fit. I mean you're talking about 1/3 of this business that's in fertility. We, as you know, have a great position in the fertility industry. Adding the donor piece of it to our existing product is just -- it's one more thing that allows us to walk into a fertility clinic and offer a full suite of products. So I'm really excited about how that's going to roll in. And when I think about our ability to leverage that with our existing salespeople and our ability to leverage that with our existing relationships of fertility clinics in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., I get pretty excited about that. 
I mean, so you got a fertility business that's growing 5% to 10%, at least, as you can see by the reported numbers, this part of the industry is growing along with that has that. So I do think that we're going to be able to accelerate that growth when I think of some of the new products that we're going to be able to launch in that space and then with some of the leverage we have. So kind of a slam dunk fit, if you will, on the fertility side of things. And that's not even touching on the cryopreservation, which is a perfect fit. 
If you look at the other piece of it, about 2/3 of that business is on the storage side for cord blood and cord tissue. That's been around for a long time, and many people on the phone know about that. Anyone who has kids probably knows about that. That space has gotten a little bit more exciting recently because of the cord tissue. 
The stem cells are used for regenerative medicine. There's a ton of clinical studies that are going on right now, well over 1,000, so you've seen an increasing interest in storage of cord tissue. So that's kind of exciting. I mean they have a relatively small sales force handle on that. We have a great team that's calling on OB-GYNs around the U.S., 100 people or so. So we're going to be able to take that messaging directly to the OB-GYN. 
And you touched on the DTC side of things, and that's great, right? DTC is certainly fine, but the medical professional drives a lot of the decision-making here. Our ability to bring that in, first time that you're actually going to have a company own one of these businesses who's calling directly on OB/GYNs with great relationships. I think we're going to be able to have some real value there. So kind of excited about both pieces of that."

I mean, as you know, and Brian touched on it, currency is a fairly decent negative to us this year. So that's causing us to take a step back, right, from an as-reported perspective but not from constant currency perspective. Yes, good gross margins on the Generate business. 70% or so fits in really well. 
Now this first year buying this, we'll be a little careful on the integration activity. They had acquired a business this past summer that took them into Australia and Canada. We need to roll this business into our operations. We need to take care of everything with respect from IT to customer service and a variety of other things. So not anticipating a lot of leverage in the first year, but then we will roll it in, and then through the year, we will. 
We will get leverage from this business. Now the question mark on it ends up really being when you look at the $0.50 is more around the interest expense. We're not going to get into the OpEx at this point in time in interest expense because, one, we haven't closed Generate yet; two, we haven't closed the permanent financing for it yet. So when we do, we can supply a little bit more color. But suffice it to say that long term, this will be accretive, if you will, to company-wide gross margins and help us get to that 30%."

You talk about Stellest, which is their glasses that they're selling into China right now and doing really well with the Chinese government is has said publicly that addressing myopia is a very significant concern of theirs. So they're taking it seriously. These glasses or contact lenses are sold through the hospitals. I mean it's something that can move fairly quickly and can be very successful. I won't necessarily break the dollars down in our expectations, but we definitely have high hopes for a lot of success in China. 
When I look at that $100 million mark, we've talked about that in the past. We still stand by that. You know my opinion on MiSight. I think we're going to have a lot of success now. It's going to depend on China, how successful that is this year. 
But at the same time, we're seeing success in China with our Ortho K product. So I'm happy about that, maybe even a little bit more success than I was thinking about it. 
So a few different moving parts there, and I wouldn't discount SightGlass. I mean that's a product that's -- we just launched -- colaunched, I should say, with Essilor in Europe. As you said, Stellest is doing really well. We'll bring SightGlass into China here at some point in time. So a lot of different moving parts in there that are going to drive that $100 million."

And the midpoint of EPS guidance is 11%, and that includes hurdling the tax, right, that we talked about. So that's your leverage right there, right? 
I mean I've talked in the past about how we have a business where we can lever this business. We've invested a lot in myopia management. We're going to continue to invest there. And frankly, we're investing in vision more aggressively in a number of different areas, which we started this past quarter with some sales force expansion in several markets. 
So a lot of investments going into vision right now. Sales force, product launches, MyDay multifocal, super excited about that. SightGlass, a lot of different areas, we're doing all those investments, and we're still talking about 7% and 11% leverage through the P&L. So I feel pretty good about that.

So how comfortable are you with that $750 million? I mean if you did $19 million in MiSight revenue, even if you haircut the per box price by a good amount to really push penetration, you probably make that up within a year or 2 or maybe faster. So I mean just what do you think of that wholesale price that is pretty high right now?"

And we're talking about that internally right now. We wanted to get through year-end here, where we had a good comp, especially in the U.S. against last year, where you remember, we gave a lot of the lenses away for free. 
So we are looking at that. We are doing some sensitivity on that. To your point, right, you cut price, but you sell more product and does that make up for it. So we're kind of evaluating that, if you will, right now. 
Having said that, the #1 pushback by far is definitely not price, right? That's on the list, but it's not #1. It continues to be the staffing concerns and fit concerns and the amount of time it takes to talk to the parents, talk to the kids, get the kids in it. It's just a longer process than what we initially thought. You're getting -- we're still seeing a situation where we're getting there, and we're converting a ton of the patients but it's taking 6 months, 9 months, something like that, 12 months. 
The kid has to come in again, right? The parents -- the ECP explains that they have myopia, what it means, how it's progressing. The parent doesn't want to pay, to your point, or they don't want -- they're concerned about putting their kids in contact lenses, so they delay the decision and then they come back in, and the ECP explains that their child's eyesight is worse, and it's going to continue to get worse, that's when the sale actually happens. So the actual sale, which, frankly, I thought was going to happen a little bit quicker, obviously, when I put the numbers out there and the uptake is still happening. It's just a little bit more delayed. So I think pricing is a component of it, but just better fit activities going to drive it also."

So let's say you're kind of talking about your core portfolio in the to 4 to 6, 4.5 to 6.5, so you're kind of saying we think we're going to be about in line with the market. Historically, you've been nicely above market. 
Is that conservatism? Is that again just COVID? Is that competitive launches? So one there and the 4% to 6% market assumption you're going with, does that include maybe a step up in pricing, you think, for the whole industry this year? Or do you think it's 4 to 6 and then if people do take 3, 4 price instead of historically 1 or 2 price, there's some upside to that 4 to 6 market?"

You have everything else that's going on in the marketplace in different markets around the world. 
So sitting here today, I think that we'll end up in that 4 to 6 range with the pricing, with some pricing in there. I think we'll take market share. I'll be really surprised if we don't take market share on a core -- on a like-to-like basis, if you will. My OP management or management portfolio will add to that, obviously, and ensure, if you will, that we're above market growth. But on a like-to-like basis, I think we'll take share. I'm not sure it will be a lot of share, but it will be -- I'll be really surprised if it's not share. There are some other good competitive launches and stuff going out there. So I don't want to necessarily get ahead of ourselves. But based on the strength I'm seeing with some key accounts and so forth, especially in Europe and Asia Pac, we'll take share. 
I think the degree of share gains for us on a core portfolio basis, meaning on a like-to-like basis will certainly be tied to some geographies, right? I mean if Asia Pac continues to come back in places like Japan, where we're really well positioned right now, we would stretch kind of our share gains."

It's a great industry. It's growing. It's got all kinds of potential. Interestingly, it's still relatively fragmented, and there's different players in different markets around the world, some sizable players in different markets around the world in different areas of fertility. So I think that Generate was a good example of one that kind of came out and is a nice addition for us. we'll see. I mean we certainly have a great fertility franchise right now and a lot of opportunities to grow and grow in excess of the market rates. But I mean if we could find other transactions to kind of fit in there that could make sense from a geographic expansion perspective, that type of thing, we would certainly evaluate those. 
If I look at PARAGARD, it's funny that within our medical device space, probably similar to a lot of companies that you follow, we did see some softness in September. That's for sure. We even saw some softness in October. I was pleasantly surprised with how our core medical device products held up during that time. Some of them hold up naturally because they're tied to childbirth and so forth. But even the elective procedure products held up okay, and we had a decent October. That was not the case as much for PARAGARD. 
Now I don't think PARAGARD is unique. When I look at the IUD market in general and you look at the other products out there. Those have also been soft. So I'm not sure how to like really fine-tune that down to the point of an individual product. But I do think that some of the staffing restrictions and so forth that are out there are causing problems with IUDs and some other products. Frankly, I think you're going to continue to have a few of those struggles even in our fiscal Q1, to be honest with you, because you're still seeing some of those staffing challenges and so forth out there and on the medical side of things. We don't see that really on the contact lens side, but we certainly see it on the med device side of things. And PARAGARD is caught up in that. 
Now I don't think it's doing any worse, by the way, just to be clear, with respect to the IUD market. It's in line or maybe even doing a little bit better, but that part of the market has been hit. ."

I mean we just have a very large fertility business, and we have a large OB-GYN business and some great products, specifically within the OB space. So we're talking to those professionals. We know those professionals really well. 
One of the challenges you have when you're a company like Generate is you're seeing a lot of your success come from like direct-to-consumer activity, that type of thing. It's more DTC and not direct to the professional. We're known as kind of a high-quality educational shop within the CooperSurgical, within the OB-GYN space and within the fertility space. I mean, if you look at the training we do, there's just training and knowledge, communication and so forth that we do with medical professionals in that side of things. 
That's not something that Generate has really been able to take advantage of because they just didn't have the size to be able to do that. When you take their business and combine it with our strengths, that 1 + 1 is a 3. I mean that's what's so cool about this. So yes, this opportunity came up. I've been following it, frankly, for a long time. When it was a cord blood storage business, that was a little bit of a different story. As you fast forward to where it is today and you think about things like regenerative medicine and what's going on over 1,000 clinicals in process on that, who is able to talk to the obstetricians about that? Who's able to speak to fertility clinics or the value of that and those clinical studies and so forth? 
We are. We have the professionals already in there talking to them and doing training and so forth. So I really think we can add a lot of value there. I mean -- and frankly, at the end of the day, deals come up when deals come up, right, I mean when opportunities are available. 
I've been looking at this thing for many, many years. I was happy to see it come up and I was happy to see us get the opportunity to win this business. So to me, I kind of looked at it as, a, yes, it's a big deal, and it is a big deal for us. It's an important deal for us. But when you find something that's a great strategic fit that's growing mid-single digits, and you think that you're going to be able to enhance that growth you look at those opportunities, you take advantage of them, especially in something that's going to throw some nice accretion to the bottom line."

It's significant because it's continued to grow. There's a lot of ECPs trained on it right now. 
I would say the more important takeaway probably from that, Joanne, is if I had to do it over again, how would I go about that over again, right? Because a lot of these ECPs are getting trained. They're fully certified. They go back into their practice. They're excited about it. Maybe they don't have a lot of kids coming in, a lot of volume. And it ends up kind of falling onto the -- it falls into back seat, so to speak, right, because they're dealing with staffing challenges. They're dealing with patients that they're trying to pass through that are easier to fit and sell to. 
Where we've seen is that once you get the ECP trained and excited about it and you have a myopia specialist, which we have now. We fully staffed up our myopia management specialists around the world. When you have that myopia management specialists talking to them and working with them and answering their questions as it comes up about how to sell it, how to fit it, how to charge for it and so forth, we are dramatically more successful. 
So that's the key. It's ended up not being so much like how many do you have? It's how many do you have combined with how many are you working with and helping. Once they fit a few kids and get rolling, it's like a snowball going downhill. Okay. Now I'm comfortable with it. I'm comfortable fitting children talking to parents, I'm going to do this for every child that walks in the door. Every single child, I'm going to talk to him about this because I've got the process down. I understand how to do it. I understand how to sell it. So that ends up being the key. 
In some of these newer markets that we're going into right now, we're having a lot more success a lot faster because we've learned so much over the last couple of years about how to successfully transition someone from the training to the actual selling of the product."

And we have many instances of eye care professionals telling us that. So that's really fantastic. 
The retainage rate, if you will, on those sales is really high. it's somewhere kind of 85%, 90% or so. There are still kids who are nonresponders to MiSight, right? You give them the lens. They wear the lens. We've seen that in the clinical data, and we see it in the real-world application where some kids, for whatever reason, continue to have their myopia progress at the same rate. I mentioned last call, we have a lot of clinical work going on. We have 8 products in R&D right now specifically associated with this. And some of those are addressing the nonresponders right now so that we can come out with some additional products to try to address everybody.

I mean I think the one on kidneys as an example, I think, is -- our liver is like stage 4. There's some real work being done there on the clinical side of things for regenerative medicine. And the best stem cells to use are the cord tissue stem cells.  You don't have to use those, but those are the best. 
And just so everyone is aware, those are different stem cells between the core blood that we've always heard about when we've had kids over the years to the stem cells with cord tissue. There are legitimate clinicals going on out there that are showing a lot of potential for success. So there's definitely more interest in that. When we were doing our diligence and our work, we were actually -- we actually did a bunch of survey work asking people about that, asking women who just had children who are currently pregnant, ""Are you going to store your cord tissue?"" And the rates were pretty low. 
Then when we took them through the clinical side of things, if you will, and said, ""Hey, this is what's going on with regenerative medicine. There's no guarantees here, but this is what's going on,"" the desire to store their core tissue went to almost 100%. So I think a bunch of it is education. If you try to sell that on a DTC basis, you're going to have a hard time. If you're talking to medical professionals and there's people out there. And this does not have to be an OB-GYN, right? This could be an oncologist, this could be a some sort of sports injury professional. There's all kinds of things you could use regenerative medicine for. 
So you're saying, ""Hey, there's no promises here, but there's a lot of really, really strong clinical work going on, much more so than there is the stem cells associated with cord blood. So some good exciting stuff going on there. We'll see how it plays out, but I think there's some opportunity to increase the storage there as a just in case, if you will."

And I guess to start, I mean, I certainly personally do not believe that the Generate deal is going to be dilutive to our consolidated growth rate, just to be clear. I do think that based on their history and based on where I see the market going, that's probably a 4% to 6% kind of grower, and that's what we talked about. 
But we have multiple areas to drive that growth rate higher. We have some new products that we're already talking about right now that we're going to be launching. And we have other forms of revenue synergies coming from our sales forces and then international expansion also where there's some faster growth rates out there. So I am optimistic about our ability to drive growth. 
Now it's pretty close right now. I mean 4% to 6% is not bad. That's for sure, especially on a annuity sales and very high cash flow product with strong margins. So that's the other side of this, right? I mean because at the end of the day, we still look at this stuff and say, ""Okay, well, what makes sense from an acquisition perspective?"" We have a tendency to really focus on traditional discounted cash flow models. We're very serious -- and we focus on that and we try to be very intense about the numbers that are going in that and ensure we're getting a sufficient return on that. We do that a little bit more than we would do like ROIC and some of that kind of stuff because of the nature of our business, right? Strong cash flow, growth business, so on and so forth. 
So the other thing I would add on that is strategic deals. I've talked about that in the past. If we could find strategic acquisitions that meet the financial metrics that can drive value in this business, then we're going to look at doing those kind of deals, and this one kind of checks all those boxes."

When you look at the international expansion opportunities, let's go to fertility because that's one I would really highlight, a lot of that gets done with the fertility clinic. You're teaming up with the fertility clinic because when you're talking about donor eggs and donor sperm, that's usually a fairly quick transaction unlike the traditional storage, like we obviously do like permanent storage of eggs and sperm that type of thing. But a lot of that activity aligns itself directly with fertility clinics. And you're using the fertility clinics and working with them their operations.

For the full fiscal year 2021, I'm proud to report record revenues at both CooperVision and CooperSurgical, record non-GAAP earnings and record free cash flow. As we enter fiscal 2022, we have strong momentum and expect another record-setting year.
Regarding fourth quarter results and reporting all percentages on a constant currency basis, consolidated revenues were $759 million, with CooperVision at $565 million, up 11%; and CooperSurgical at $194 million, up 11%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.28.
For CooperVision, our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio led the way, growing 19%. All 3 regions reported strength in this product category, with our premium product, MyDay, and our mass market product, clariti, both performing really well. Biofinity also had a solid quarter, supported by strength in toric multifocal.
For the regions, the Americas grew 6%, led by our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, with particular strength in MyDay, where we continue seeing strong fit activity. EMEA grew a healthy 15%, with improving consumer activity and strength in our key accounts driving growth and share gains. Within this region, we posted broad-based growth from our daily silicones and Biofinity. Asia Pac grew 14%, led by a steady improvement in consumer activity and success with several new product launches. This region remains a very important growth driver for us, and we're investing accordingly as we're outperforming the market and taking share.
For our FRP portfolio, Biofinity posted solid results, driving growth in markets around the world with its broad offerings, including the toric multifocal and Energys, the most innovative product in the monthly space.
Regarding product launches, we remain incredibly active. I've highlighted in the past the many products and range extensions we've been launching around the world for MyDay, clariti and Biofinity, and all that activity continued. This has driven consistent share gains, and we expect that to continue.
One recent launch that I want to highlight this quarter is our new MyDay multifocal. We've launched the product in the U.S. and several major European markets, and the feedback and results are absolutely fantastic.
We're consistently hearing from eye care practitioners that the new binocular progressive fitting system is a breakthrough approach that simplifies fit and provides optimal visual acuity at all levels. And we're hearing that from patients who are touting it as the best multifocal they've ever worn for exceptional near, intermediate and distant vision. We expect this launch to continue performing extremely well and to provide a nice halo effect, supporting the already successful MyDay brand of torics and spheres.
Moving to myopia management. Our portfolio grew 63% to $21 million, with MiSight up 165% to $7 million and Ortho K products up 40%. We reached our goal of $65 million for the year, up 76% year-over-year, and our momentum is strong. As a global leader in the myopia management space, our portfolio is the broadest in the industry, comprised of MiSight, the only FDA-approved myopia control product; our broad range of market-leading Ortho K lenses; and our innovative SightGlass Vision glasses.
Regarding MiSight, we didn't quite reach our target this quarter, but we did reach $19 million in sales for the full year, up a very impressive 149% year-over-year. We're making great progress with independent optometrists, buying groups and retailers around the world, and we're seeing momentum in all these channels.
We're also making great progress in China, where we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Essilor. Essilor is now actively promoting MiSight following a soft launch last month at one of the largest ophthalmic trade shows, and we're on target for a full launch in fiscal Q2.
We've also assembled an advisory board of key opinion leaders, whose affiliated hospitals represent over 50% of myopia management contact lens volume in China. This team of experts is providing fantastic insight into our MiSight positioning and how we can grow Ortho K even faster and how SightGlass will successfully fit in. As a reminder, childhood myopia rates in China are estimated at over 80%, and reducing myopia is a priority for the Chinese government, so the opportunity is significant.
Lastly, we recently presented our industry-leading 7-year clinical study of MiSight, confirming the product works for nearly all myopic children. It cuts myopia progression by roughly 59% on average. It works at any age a child starts treatment. It works for as long as the child wears it. And there's no rebound if treatment is stopped. These are the drivers that will continue supporting short- and long-term growth.
Regarding our other myopia management products, our Ortho K portfolio performed really well, led by success in China. And in November, we commercially co-launched our SightGlass myopia management glasses in Europe with Essilor, and we'll be partnering with them on several additional launches coming soon.
Overall, on myopia management, our momentum is strong, and we're still targeting constant currency growth of over 50% in fiscal 2022, to roughly $100 million in sales.
To conclude on Vision, we estimate the overall contact lens market grew 7% in calendar Q3, while CooperVision grew 8% even as new fits remain below pre-COVID levels. According to recent U.S. data, roughly 64% of eye care practitioners stated they had capacity to serve more patients but cannot, mostly due to staffing challenges. Having said that, trends are positive, and we expect the market to grow in the 4% to 6% range this coming year, supported by improving fit activity in the U.S. and EMEA and reopening activity in Asia Pac.
Meanwhile, the long-term macro growth trends remain solid, with roughly 1/3 of the world being myopic today and that expected to increase to 50% by 2050.
For CooperVision, we closed this fiscal year on a really strong note, exceeding the high end of our expectations, and we've entered fiscal 2022 with a robust product portfolio, new product launches, a fast-growing myopia management business and strong fit data. To ensure we're seizing the growth opportunities in front of us, we've increased our sales force investments, and we'll continue with our successful myopia management investment strategy. We have strong momentum. We're growing faster than the market, and we expect that to continue.
Moving to CooperSurgical. Our fertility business performed exceptionally well, growing 24% year-over-year to $82 million. Strength was seen around the world and throughout our product portfolio, including from consumables, capital equipment and genomics.
One particular area of continued strength was our RI Witness platform. This is our proprietary automated lab management system that clinics implement to maximize safety and security by optimizing their lab practices. A system like this is especially important in today's world to improve quality control and workflow management, to enable social distancing and prevent mistakes such as embryo mismatches, which you unfortunately occasionally hear about.
Regarding the broader fertility industry, our addressable market is approaching $2 billion, with 5% to 10% long-term growth expected. It's estimated that 1 in 8 couples has trouble getting pregnant due to a variety of factors, such as increasing maternal age, and that more than 100 million individuals worldwide suffer from infertility. Given the improving access to treatments, increasing patient awareness, greater comfort discussing IVF and increasing global disposable income, this industry should grow nicely for many years to come.
Within our office and surgical unit, we grew 3%. Medical devices performed well, growing 20%, led by our portfolio of uterine manipulators, several of our surgical devices and our next-generation EndoSee Advance product line.
Meanwhile, PARAGARD declined 17%, largely as forecasted due to buy-in activity from last quarter's price increase. Having said that, similar to what we've seen from the general IUD market, the performance was soft, likely due to COVID staffing challenges.
Lastly, for CooperSurgical, we recently announced an agreement to acquire Generate Life Sciences for $1.6 billion. Many of you may know this company as a cord blood storage business, but they've done a phenomenal job expanding over the years, and this business is now a great strategic fit for CooperSurgical as they're a leader in donor egg and sperm and cryopreservation services for fertility treatments as well as being a leader in cord blood and cord tissue storage, which is an excellent fit with our labor and delivery group.
We have an investor presentation on our website that summarizes the deal, but let me provide some additional color.
Roughly 1/3 of the business is in fertility, which we estimate will grow 5% to 10% long-term, supported by general industry growth. Meanwhile, combining Generate's offerings with our existing portfolio allows us to leverage our infrastructure, launch new products and go international to accelerate growth beyond this range.
2/3 of the business is in cord blood and cord tissue storage, which we expect to grow 3% to 5% long-term. This is driven by increasing demand for cord tissue stem cells due to optimism around the significant number of clinical trials using these stem cells for regenerative medicine. Consolidated, this business offers long-term sustainable growth of 4% to 6%, and we believe there are opportunities to push that range higher with potential revenue synergies as we leverage our expertise.
To finish, let me make a few comments on fiscal 2022. Introducing annual guidance in today's world is a challenge given COVID uncertainties. Regardless, our organic revenue growth is strong, and we expect that to continue. We're investing in product launches, and we're doing that intelligently by leveraging our operations to ensure we receive strong returns.
I believe CooperVision is the most innovative company in the contact lens space today, with leading products in myopia management and the broadest product offerings in the market, and CooperSurgical is in an extremely exciting position, led by our fertility business. As a company, we remain on a steady upward trend, and we see that continuing for fiscal 2022 and many years beyond.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian."
263609,1686892014,2454786,"The Cooper Companies, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Dec 02, 2021",2021-12-02,"Earnings Calls","The Cooper Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.Fourth quarter consolidated revenues increased 11% year-over-year an",596,"Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.
Fourth quarter consolidated revenues increased 11% year-over-year and also 11% in constant currency to $759 million. Consolidated gross margin decreased year-over-year by 20 basis points to 67.5% driven primarily by currency, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs at CooperVision.
Operating expenses grew 16% as strategic investments in sales and marketing to support myopia management and fertility continued. Within this, we did see slightly higher than initially forecasted investments for SightGlass Vision and MiSight in China, along with elevated distribution costs tied to higher demand of direct shipments.
Consolidated operating margins were 24.9%, down from 26.8% last year. Interest expense was $5 million on lower average debt, and the effective tax rate was 10.3%, helped by stock option exercises in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.28, with roughly 49.9 million average shares outstanding. FX negatively impacted us and was roughly $0.05 worse than expected when we gave guidance last quarter.
Free cash flow was solid at $110 million, comprised of $175 million of operating cash flow, offset by $65 million of CapEx. Net debt decreased to $1.4 billion, and our adjusted leverage ratio improved to 1.38x.
Moving to 2022 guidance and excluding the recently announced Generate Life Sciences acquisition, consolidated revenues are expected to be in the range of $3.032 billion to $3.090 billion, up 6% to 8% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues between $2.225 billion and $2.267 billion, up 6% to 8% in constant currency, and CooperSurgical revenues between $807 million and $823 million, up 6% to 8% in constant currency.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to range from $13.60 to $14, up 9.5% to 12.5% in constant currency. And the tax rate is expected to be around 13%. At the midpoint of guidance, this equates to constant currency revenue growth of roughly 7% and constant currency EPS growth of roughly 11%. Regarding currency on a year-over-year basis, we're expecting an FX headwind of roughly 2.5% on revenues and 7% on EPS. This impact will be most detrimental in Q1, where we're expecting EPS in the $3 to $3.10 range.
Before opening the call to questions, let me touch on the Generate Life Sciences acquisition that we announced on November 10. As of today, we're optimistic we'll close in the next couple of weeks, which would give us roughly 10.5 months of their operations in our fiscal 2022. Having said that, we're still waiting for final regulatory approvals, so we're not providing specific guidance today.
In the meantime, let me walk you through the deal accretion that we expect. As previously announced, Generate has roughly $250 million in trailing 12-month revenue. Gross margins are expected to be roughly 70%. And OpEx is expected to be elevated in year 1 as synergies are expected to be minimal as we integrate and invest in the business. As we are now closer to securing permanent financing for this transaction, we are updating our year 1 non-GAAP EPS accretion estimate to around $0.50 and would add that we expect this accretion to improve in year 2 with synergies.
In summary, we're pleased with how we closed this fiscal year. And we look forward -- and as we look forward into 2022 and beyond, we continue to believe our strategic investments will drive top line momentum, supporting share gains in both businesses and long-term sustainable earnings growth.
And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions."

Yes. I'm happy to be talking about this. I know we made the announcement, and it was frustrating for many of you and absolutely frustrating for me to not be talking about it on a deal that I'm pretty passionate about.
Yes, this is a great deal for us. It's a great fit. I mean you're talking about 1/3 of this business that's in fertility. We, as you know, have a great position in the fertility industry. Adding the donor piece of it to our existing product is just -- it's one more thing that allows us to walk into a fertility clinic and offer a full suite of products on. So I'm really excited about how that's going to roll in. And when I think about our ability to leverage that with our existing salespeople and our ability to leverage that with our existing relationships of fertility clinics in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., I get pretty excited about that.
I mean so you got a fertility business that's growing 5% to 10%, at least, as you can see by the reported numbers, this part of the industry that's growing along with that has that. So I do think that we're going to be able to accelerate that growth when I think of some of the new products that we're going to be able to launch in that space and then with some of the leverage we have. So kind of a slam dunk fit, if you will, on the fertility side of things. And that's not even touching on the cryopreservation, which is a perfect fit.
If you look at the other piece of it, about 2/3 of that business is on the storage side for cord blood and cord tissue. That's been around for a long time, and many people on the phone know about that. Anyone who has -- had kids probably knows about that. That space has gotten a little bit more exciting recently because of the cord tissue.
The stem cells are used for regenerative medicine. There's a ton of clinical studies that are going on right now, well over 1,000, so you've seen an increasing interest in storage of cord tissue. So that's kind of exciting. I mean they have a relatively small sales force handle on that. We have a great team that's calling on OB-GYNs around the U.S., 100 people or so, so we're going to be able to take that messaging directly to the OB-GYN.
And you touched on the DTC side of things, and that's great, right? DTC is certainly fine, but the medical professional drives a lot of the decision-making here. Our ability to bring that in, the first time that you're actually going to have a company own one of these businesses, who's calling directly on OB-GYNs with great relationships, I think we're going to be able to add some real value there. So I'm kind of excited about both pieces of that."

I mean as you know, and Brian touched on it, currency is a fairly decent negative to us this year. So that's causing us to take a step back, right, from an as-reported perspective, but not from constant currency perspective. Yes, good gross margins on the Generate business, 70% or so, fits in really well.
Now this first year buying this, we'll be a little careful on the integration activity. They had acquired a business this past summer that took them into Australia and Canada. We need to roll this business into our operations. We need to take care of everything with respect, from IT to customer service and a variety of other things. So not anticipating a lot of leverage in the first year, but then we will roll it in, and then through the year, we will. And we will get leverage from this business.
Now the question mark on it ends up really, being when you look at the $0.50, is more around the interest expense. We're not going to get into the OpEx at this point in time in interest expense because, one, we haven't closed Generate yet; two, we haven't closed the permanent financing for it yet. So when we do, we can supply a little bit more color. But suffice it to say that long-term, this will be accretive, if you will, to company-wide gross margins and help us get to that 30%."

We did the soft launch already there. We are in a really good position with them. We're kind of hitting on all cylinders, if you will, early here in China.
You talk about Stellest, which is their glasses that they're selling into China right now and doing really well with. The Chinese government is -- has said publicly that addressing myopia is a very significant concern of theirs. So they're taking it seriously. These glasses or contact lenses are sold through the hospitals. So I mean, it's something that can move fairly quickly and can be very successful. I won't necessarily break the dollars down in our expectations, but we definitely have high hopes for a lot of success in China.
When I look at that $100 million mark, we've talked about that in the past. We still stand by that. You know my opinion on MiSight. I think we're going to have a lot of success now. It's going to depend on China how successful that is this year. But at the same time, we're seeing success in China with our Ortho K product. So I'm happy about that, and maybe even a little bit more success than I was thinking about it.
So a few different moving parts there, and I wouldn't discount SightGlass. I mean that's a product that's -- we just launched, co-launched, I should say, with Essilor in Europe. As you said, Stellest is doing really well. We'll bring SightGlass into China here at some point in time. So a lot of different moving parts in there that are going to drive that $100 million."

If you kind of look at kind of leverage through the P&L, I guess, I would probably just probably do it at a high level and say, if I went to the midpoint of guidance, it's 7%, is the midpoint of revenue guidance in constant currency. And the midpoint of EPS guidance is 11%. And that includes hurdling the tax, right, that we talked about. So that's your leverage right there, right?
I mean I've talked in the past about how we have a business where we can lever this business. We've invested a lot in myopia management. We're going to continue to invest there. And frankly, we're investing in Vision more aggressively in a number of different areas, which we started this past quarter, with some sales force expansion in several markets.
So a lot of investments going into Vision right now. Sales force, product launches, MyDay, multifocal, super excited about that, SightGlass, a lot of different areas. We're doing all those investments, and we're still talking about 7% and 11% leverage through the P&L. So I feel pretty good about that. And that, again, hurdles the tax increase."

When we go out and talk to a lot of these docs, it just seems like everybody is really excited about the technology, wants to be pushing this into more and more patients. But that $750 wholesale price or selling price, however you want to look at it, it's kind of a big hurdle, especially if you guys want to put $500 in professional fees or something on top of that or in some cases, even more.
So how comfortable are you with that $750? I mean if you did $19 million in MiSight revenue, even if you haircut the per-box price by a good amount to really push penetration, you probably make that up within a year or 2 or maybe faster. So I mean, just what do you think of that wholesale price that is pretty high right now?"

And we're talking about that internally right now. We wanted to get through year-end here, where we had a good comp, especially in the U.S., against last year, where you remember, we gave a lot of the lenses away for free. So we are looking at that. We are doing some sensitivity on that. To your point, right, you cut price, but you sell more product, and does that make up for it? So we're kind of evaluating that, if you will, right now.
Having said that, the #1 pushback by far is definitely not price, right? That's on the list, but it's not #1. It continues to be the staffing concerns and fit concerns and the amount of time it takes to talk to the parents, talk to the kids, get the kids in it. It's just a longer process than what we initially thought. You're getting -- we're still seeing a situation where we're getting there and we're converting a ton of the patients, but it's taking 6 months, 9 months, something like that, 12 months.
The kid has to come in again, right? The parents -- the ECP explains that they have myopia, what it means, how it's progressing. The parent doesn't want to pay, to your point, or they don't want to -- they're concerned about putting their kids in contact lenses. So they delay the decision, and then they come back in and the ECP explains that their child's eyesight is worse and it's going to continue to get worse. That's when the sale actually happens.
So the actual sell, which frankly I thought was going to happen a little bit quicker, obviously, when I put the numbers out there and the uptake, is still happening, it's just a little bit more delayed. So I think pricing is a component of it, but just better fit activity is going to drive it also."

So let's say you're kind of talking about your core portfolio in the 4%, to 4% to 6%, 4.5% to 6.5%, so you're kind of saying we think we're going to be about in line with the market. Historically, you've been nicely above market.
Is that conservatism? Is that again just COVID? Is that competitive launches? So one there, and the 4% to 6% market assumption you're going with, does that include maybe a step-up in pricing, you think, for the whole industry this year and you think it's 4% to 6%? And then if people do take 3, 4 price instead of historically 1 or 2 price, that there's some upside to that 4% to 6% market?"

You could certainly make an argument that the 4% to 6% could be a little bit lower, right, because you do have obviously the COVID concerns, you have everything else that's going on in the marketplace in different markets around the world.
So sitting here today, I think that we'll end up in that 4% to 6% range with the pricing, with some pricing in there. I think we'll take market share. I'll be really surprised if we don't take market share on a core -- on a like-to-like basis, if you will. Myopia management, our myopia management portfolio, will add to that, obviously, and ensure, if you will, that we're above market growth.
But on a like-to-like basis, I think we'll take share. I'm not sure it will be a lot of share, but it will be -- I'll be really surprised if it's not share. There are some other good competitive launches and stuff going on out there. So I don't want to necessarily get ahead of ourselves. But based on the strength I'm seeing with some key accounts and so forth, especially in Europe and Asia Pac, we'll take share.
I think the degree of share gains for us on a core portfolio basis, meaning on a like-to-like basis, will certainly be tied to some geographies, right? I mean if Asia Pac continues to come back in places like Japan, where we're really well-positioned right now, we would stretch kind of our share gains."

So yes, as it relates to guidance, gross margins and operating margins, when you take -- when you start at the midpoint of our guidance, gross margins on a constant currency basis will be up year-over-year, and operating margins will be up even more year-over-year.
So when Al was talking about the leverage and we were talking about hurdling some inflationary pressures, like wages and freight and other higher costs and then also having this continued investment activity in growth areas, like myopia and fertility, we're levering -- we're getting leverage from the P&L and from higher revenues, and that's showing up in operating margin.

And then maybe just to tack on, on CSI, PARAGARD did miss their number. I know there's some moving parts due to the price last quarter and the buy-ahead. But maybe exiting fiscal '21, do you feel like inventory is in a good place due to the buy-in on the PARAGARD side of things?"

It's a great industry. It's growing. It's got all kinds of potential. Interestingly, it's still relatively fragmented, and there's different players in different markets around the world, some sizable players in different markets around the world, in different areas of fertility.
So I think that Generate was a good example of one that kind of came out and is a nice addition for us. We'll see. I mean we certainly have a great fertility franchise right now and a lot of opportunities to grow and grow in excess of the market rates. But I mean, if we could find other transactions to kind of fit in there that could make sense from a geographic expansion perspective, that type of thing, we would certainly evaluate those.
If I look at PARAGARD, it's funny, that within our medical device space, probably similar to a lot of companies that you follow, we did see some softness in September. That's for sure. But we even saw some softness in October. I was pleasantly surprised with how our core medical device products held up during that time. Some of them hold up naturally because they're tied to childbirth and so forth. But even the elective procedure products held up okay, and we had a decent October. That was not the case as much for PARAGARD.
Now I don't think PARAGARD is unique. When I look at the IUD market in general and you look at the other products out there, those have also been soft. So I'm not sure how to like really fine-tune that down to the point of an individual product. But I do think that some of the staffing restrictions and so forth that are out there are causing problems with IUDs and some other products.
Frankly, I think you're going to continue to have a few of those struggles even in our fiscal Q1, to be honest with you, because you're still seeing some of those staffing challenges and so forth out there and on the medical side of things. We don't see that really on the contact lens side, but we certainly see it on the med device side of things. And PARAGARD is caught up in that.
Now I don't think it's doing any worse, by the way, just to be clear, with respect to the IUD market. It's in line or maybe even doing a little bit better, but that part of the market has been hit."

I mean we just have a very large fertility business, and we have a large OB-GYN business and some great products, specifically within the OB space. So we're talking to those professionals. We know those professionals really well.
One of the challenges you have when you're a company like Generate is you're seeing a lot of your success come from like direct-to-consumer activity, that type of thing. It's more DTC and not direct to the professional. We're known as kind of a high-quality educational shop within the CooperSurgical, within the OB-GYN space and within the fertility space. I mean if you look at the training we do, there's just extensive training and knowledge, communication and so forth that we do with medical professionals in that side of things.
That's not something that Generate has really been able to take advantage of because they just didn't have the size to be able to do that. When you take their business and combine it with our strengths, that 1 + 1 is a 3. I mean that's what's so cool about this. So yes, this opportunity came up. I've been following it, frankly, for a long time. When it was a cord blood storage business, that was a little bit of a different story. As you fast-forward to where it is today and you think about things like regenerative medicine and what's going on over 1,000 clinicals in process on that, who is able to talk to the obstetricians about that? Who's able to speak to the fertility clinics or the value of that and those clinical studies and so forth?
We are. We have the professionals already in there talking to them and doing training and so forth. So I really think we can add a lot of value there. I mean -- and frankly, at the end of the day, deals come up when deals come up, right, I mean, when opportunities are available.
I've been looking at this thing for many, many years. I was happy to see it come up, and I was happy to see us get the opportunity to win this business. So to me, I kind of looked at it as, a, yes, it's a big deal and it is a big deal for us. It's an important deal for us. But when you find something that's a great strategic fit, that's growing mid-single digits, and you think that you're going to be able to enhance that growth, you look at those opportunities, you take advantage of them, especially in something that's going to throw some nice accretion to the bottom line."

Maybe they don't have a lot of kids coming in, a lot of volume. And it ends up kind of falling onto the -- it falls into the backseat, so to speak, right, because they're dealing with staffing challenges. They're dealing with patients that they're trying to pass through, that are easier to fit and sell to.
Where we've seen is that once you get the ECP trained and excited about it and you have a myopia specialist, which we have now, and we fully staffed up our myopia management specialists around the world, when you have that myopia management specialist talking to them and working with them and answering their questions as it comes up, about how to sell it, how to fit it, how to charge for it and so forth, we are dramatically more successful.
So that's the key. It's ended up not being so much like how many do you have, it's how many do you have, combined with how many are you working with and helping. Once they fit a few kids and get rolling, it's like a snowball going downhill. Okay. Now I'm comfortable with it. I'm comfortable fitting children and talking to parents. I'm going to do this for every child that walks in the door. Every single child, I'm going to talk to him about this because I've got the process down. I understand how to do it. I understand how to sell it. So that ends up being the key.

They wear the lens. We've seen that in the clinical data, and we see it in the real-world application, where some kids, for whatever reason, continue to have their myopia progress at the same rate.
I mentioned, last call, we have a lot of clinical work going on. We have 8 products in R&D right now specifically associated with this. And some of those are addressing the nonresponders right now so that we can come out with some additional products to try to address everybody. But yes, I mean, it's something like 9 in 10 kids are staying in the product. It's a pretty high-level retainage."

I mean I think the one on kidneys is an example. I think is -- our liver is just like Stage IV. There's some real work being done there on the clinical side of things for regenerative medicine. And the best stem cells to use are the cord tissue stem cells. You don't have to use those, but those are the best.
And just so everyone is aware, right, those are different stem cells between the cord blood that we've always heard about when we've had kids over the years, to the stem cells with cord tissue. There are legitimate clinicals going on out there that are showing a lot of potential for success. So there's definitely more interest in that.
When we were doing our diligence in our work, we were actually -- we actually did a bunch of survey work asking people about that, asking women who just had children, who are currently pregnant, ""Are you going to store your cord tissue?"" And the rates were pretty low.
Then when we took them through the clinical side of things, if you will, and said, ""Hey, this is what's going on with regenerative medicine. There's no guarantees here, but this is what's going on."" The desire to store their cord tissue went to almost 100%. So I think a bunch of it is education. If you try to sell that on a DTC basis, you're going to have a hard time.
If you're talking to medical professionals and there's people out there, and this does not have to be an OB-GYN, right? This could be an oncologist. This could be a some sort of sports injury professional. There's all kinds of things you could use regenerative medicine for.
So you're saying, ""Hey, doc, there's no promises here, but there's a lot of really, really strong clinical work going on, much more so than there is the stem cells associated with cord blood."" So some good exciting stuff going on there. We'll see how it plays out, but I think there's some opportunity to increase the storage there as a just-in-case, if you will."

It was a decent number, that's for sure, this year. We had some pretty decent investments going out in Q4. And it will be a sizable number this year. Having said that, we actually get leverage on it year-over-year, meaning that's part of the reason you're seeing leverage. We put a pretty good infrastructure in place this year.

And I guess, to start, I mean, I certainly personally do not believe that the Generate deal is going to be dilutive to our consolidated growth rate, just to be clear. I do think that based on their history and based on where I see the market going, that's probably a 4% to 6% kind of grower, and that's what we've talked about.
But we have multiple areas to drive that growth rate higher. We have some new products that we're already talking about right now that we're going to be launching. And we have other forms of revenue synergies coming from our sales forces and then international expansion also, where there's some faster growth rates out there. So I am optimistic about our ability to drive growth.
Now it's pretty close right now. I mean 4% to 6% is not bad. That's for sure, especially on an annuity sale and very high cash flow product with strong margins. So that's the other side of this, right? I mean because at the end of the day, we still look at this stuff and say, ""Okay. Well, what makes sense from an acquisition perspective?"" We have a tendency to really focus on traditional discounted cash flow models.
We're very serious, and we focus on that and we try to be very intense about the numbers that are going in that and ensure we're getting a sufficient return on that. We do that a little bit more than we would do like ROIC and some of that kind of stuff because of the nature of our business, right, strong cash flow, growth business, so on and so forth.
So the other thing I would add on that is strategic deals. I've talked about that in the past. If we could find strategic acquisitions that meet the financial metrics, that can drive value in this business, then we're going to look at doing those kind of deals, and this one kind of checks all those boxes."

When you look at the international expansion opportunities, let's go to fertility because that's one I would really highlight, a lot of that gets done with the fertility clinic. You're teaming up with the fertility clinic because when you're talking about donor eggs and donor sperm, that's usually a fairly quick transaction, unlike the traditional storage. Like we'll obviously do like permanent storage of eggs and sperm, that type of thing.
But a lot of that activity aligns itself directly with fertility clinics. And you're using the fertility clinics and working with them, their operations. So you just don't get a situation where you have significant CapEx. It's low CapEx. It's really high cash flow in that business."
