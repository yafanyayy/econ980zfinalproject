As reported earlier today, our growth momentum accelerated in the final quarter of the year. Revenue increased 23%, exceeding $1.3 billion, driven by strong double-digit growth in our fitness, outdoor and marine segments. Gross margin improved to 58.5%. Operating income increased 34% to $371 million, and operating margin expanded to 27.5%. GAAP EPS was $1.73 and pro forma EPS was also $1.73, increasing 34% over the prior year. 
Looking back, I'm very proud of what we accomplished in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges affecting every company. And of course, Garmin was no exception. Many of these challenges were the burden of employees, such as learning to work and collaborate remotely, while juggling new challenges in their personal lives. Our employees were very resilient and faced these challenges with courage and determination as reflected in our outstanding performance throughout the year. 
The pandemic also created many new opportunities as interest in health, fitness and active lifestyles surged. We were well positioned to seize these opportunities with a strong product lineup, and our vertically integrated business model gave us flexibility to meet rapidly changing demands. During this crisis, we maintained our focus on R&D, which allowed us to introduce many innovative new products throughout the year. 
On a consolidated basis, revenue increased 11% to nearly $4.2 billion, which is a new record for Garmin, and our fifth consecutive year of growth. Gross margin was 59.3%, and operating margin was 25.2%. Operating income increased 11% to over $1 billion, which is another record achievement. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $5.17 and pro forma EPS of $5.14, an increase of 16% over the prior year. Considering these strong results at our upcoming annual meeting, will ask shareholders to approve an annual dividend of $2.68 per share, representing a 10% increase over the current annual dividend amount. 
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to highlight some achievements from the past year and the outlook for each of our 5 business segments. 
Starting with the fitness segment. Revenue increased 26% as strong demand for advanced wearables and cycling products fueled our growth. Growth in operating margins were 53% and 24%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 66% over the prior year. During the year, we launched innovative new wearables and cycling products, such as the Venue Sq and Forerunner 745 and the next-generation of Edge cycling computers. 
Looking forward, we are well positioned to capitalize on the broader trends in health and fitness. We plan to leverage our recent acquisition of first speed to offer products with unique health and fitness features. In addition, we intend to capitalize on the trends in indoor cycling with our strong lineup of tax products. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue from the fitness segment will increase approximately 10% in 2021. 
In the outdoor segment, revenue increased 23%, primarily driven by strong demand for adventure watches. Gross and operating margins were 66% and 39%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 32%. During the year, we added solar charging technology to a broad range of Phoenix and Instinct models, extending our lead in low power technology and further differentiating ourselves in the highly competitive smartwatch market. Looking forward, we expect the broader trends in outdoor to continue. We plan to leverage this opportunity by offering compelling products that maximize the enjoyment of outdoor activity and adventure. We believe that inReach will continue to grow as more people appreciate the convenience and life-saving potential of 2-way remote communication. 
Our recent acquisition of GEOS, a critical provider of emergency monitoring and incident response services, allows us to expand its scale and improve service levels for our growing base of inReach customers. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue from the outdoor segment will increase approximately 10% in 2021. 
Looking next at the aviation segment, revenue decreased 15% due to lower revenue from OEM product categories and the expected decline of the ADS-B market. Gross and operating margins were 73% and 22%, respectively. 
While the pandemic created some headwinds, particularly in the OEM market, we see positive signs in the smaller aircraft segment, especially in owner-flown aircraft. In addition, when adjusting for the impact of ADS-B, there are encouraging signs in the aftermarket as aircraft owners embrace the latest cockpit technologies. 
Autoland is being recognized as game-changing new safety technology for general aviation, and recently was named 1 of 2020 greatest innovations by Popular Science. Autoland also won a top flight award from Aviation International News. During the year, Autoland achieved certification on 3 aircraft models, including the Cerus Vision Jet, the Piper M600 and the Docker TBM 940. Over 150 Autoland equipped aircraft are now in service, a number that continues to grow every day. 
We believe the general aviation market is stabilizing. And during 2021, we expect this segment to grow approximately 5% with contributions from both OEM and aftermarket categories. We expect revenue from the segment to decline in the first quarter as we compare against strong residual ADS-B numbers from last year, followed by growth as the year-over-year comparisons become much more favorable. We are focused on certifying safety enhancing technologies such as Autoland and additional aircraft models, and we will continue to invest in future growth opportunities. 
Moving on to marine. The segment delivered another year of impressive results, as the pandemic created an opportunity for people to rediscover boating and fishing. Revenue increased 29%, with growth in multiple product categories, led by strong demand for chartplotters. 
Gross and operating margins were 58% and 27%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 60%. We continue to be recognized for innovation and achievement in the marine industry. We were named supplier of the year by Independent Boat Builders, Inc; manufacturer of the year by the National Marine Electronics Association; and recently, we were recognized as 1 of the top 10 most innovative marine companies by Sounding Straight Only, which is a B2B news and information provider for the recreational boating industry. 
Looking forward, we anticipate that interest in boating and fishing will remain strong. Many boatbuilders have already sold out of their 2021 models, and our retail partners are preparing for another year of strong growth. We plan to capitalize on these trends by offering a compelling lineup of products with innovative features and disruptive new technologies. With this in mind, we anticipate revenue from the marine segment will increase approximately 15% in 2021. 
Moving finally to the auto segment. I want to highlight that we are now providing expanded disclosures for the segment. Specifically, we are disclosing separate financial information for the 2 operating segments within auto: the consumer segment, which includes P&D and specialty products; and the OEM segment, which is focused on hardware and software solutions for vehicle manufacturers. We believe these expanded disclosures will help investors better understand the mix of revenue, the level of investment and the profit profile of each profit segment. 
Now looking at the year-end results for the auto segment. Revenue decreased 16% as the decline in PNDs was partially offset by growth in specialty products and revenue from new OEM programs. Gross margin was 35%, and we recorded an operating loss of $19 million, driven by investments in auto OEM programs. 
Our auto OEM business has reached an inflection point as we ramp up new programs over the next few years. Prior to the most recent wins, we have been successful on various software, navigation and infotainment programs with several top-tier OEMs, such as Honda, Toyota, Daimler and Fuzhou, to name just a few. We are currently in production with a full infotainment system for the Daimler Vito van, and we recently began production on the current BMW program, where we are a Tier 1 build-to-print supplier. Also, we are developing the next-generation program for BMW as the lead supplier, which expands our role to encompass all aspects of the design, including hardware, complex operating system development and system integration. Moving into this lead supplier role on future programs is a testament to the progress we've made as a Tier 1 supplier to the auto industry. These programs require a significant investment in R&D prior to realizing revenue, and not all costs are reimbursed by the customer. With these things in mind, we expect total auto revenue to grow approximately 5% in '21, driven by growth in specialty consumer products and new OEM programs. We also expect additional losses from the OEM operating segment as we invest in the development of future programs expected to launch in late 2022. 
Well, in summary, I'm very proud of what we accomplished in 2020, while facing challenges that no one could have anticipated just 1 year ago. The indicators for 2021 look positive, and we are excited about the opportunities in every business segment. With this in mind, we anticipate 2021 revenue will be approximately $4.6 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year, and we anticipate growth in all segments. We expect gross margin to be approximately 59.2% and operating margin at approximately 23.5%. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of 10.5%, pro forma earnings per share are expected to be approximately $5.15. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue over $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter, representing a 23% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.5%, a 50 basis point increase in the prior year. Operating expense percentage of sales was 31.1%, a 180 basis point decrease. Operating income was $371 million, a 34% increase. Operating margin was 27.5%, 240 basis point increase in the prior year. Our GAAP pro forma EPS was $1.73, 34% increase from the prior year pro forma EPS. 
Looking at full year results, we pose revenue of over $4.1 billion, representing 11% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.3%, a 20 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating expense percentage of sales was 34.1%, a 20 basis point decrease. Operating income was $1.054 billion, a 7% increase. Operating margin was 25.2%, consistent with the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $5.17 per EPS of $5.14, 16% increase from the prior year. 
Next, looking at fourth quarter revenue by segment and geography. In our fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth for our 5 segments, led by marine segment, the growth of 48%; followed by the outdoor segment, 40% growth to fitness segment for 26% growth. By geography, we achieved growth in all 3 regions, led by strong growth, 32%, both EMEA and APAC. 
Americas grew 13%, which is more heavily impacted by the decline in aviation. Excluding aviation, Americas' growth was more in line with other regions. For the full year 2020, we achieved 11% consolidated growth with strong double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. Marine, fitness and outdoor each grew in excess of 20%. On geography, we achieved growth in all 3 regions, led by 17% growth, EMEA, 8% growth, both Americas and APAC. 
Looking next, operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $57 million or 16%. Research and development increased $38 million year-over-year, primarily due to engineering personnel costs their expenses related to auto OEM programs. Our advertising expense decreased approximately $2 million for the prior year quarter. SG&A increased $21 million compared to prior year quarter, a decrease percentage of sales to 11.8%, a 70 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. The increase in SG&A is primarily due to increases in Information Technology costs personnel-related expenses. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and dividends. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially year-over-year to $849 million due to strong sales in the fourth quarter. Inventory balance increased year-over-year to $762 million. During the fourth quarter 2020, we generated free cash flow of $387 million. 
For the full year 2020, we generated free cash flow of approximately $950 million, $369 million increase from the prior year due to improved earnings decreased operating capital needs. For 2021, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $725 million, approximately $350 million of capital expenditures. Expected year-over-year increase capital expenditures due to investments in platforms for growth, including expansion of our Taiwan manufacturing facilities, restarting the late expansion project, which includes the renovation of the previous aletha manufacturing and distribution facility to increase workspace capacity, the auto OEM manufacturing facility in Europe and IT-related projects. 
We announced our plans to seek shareholder approval for an increase in our dividend beginning with the June 2021 payment. Proposal is a cash dividend of $2.68 per share or $0.67 per share for the quarter. This is a 10% increase from our current quarterly dividend of $0.61 per share. 
For full year 2020, we reported an effective tax rate of 10.1%. Former effective tax rate is 10.4%, 510 basis point decrease from the prior year, primarily due to the migration intellectual property ownership in Switzerland to United States. The fiscal year 2021 pro forma effective tax rate expected to be 10.5%, relatively flat year-over-year. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Joel, can you please open the line for Q&A?"

But to give you a little bit color on the operating expenses, yes, we're anticipating 2021 to be about 160 basis points higher as a percent of sales. Looking at each of the pieces, advertising, we anticipate or target that to be relatively flat as a percentage of sales year-over-year. SG&A will be slightly up. We think that's primarily due to increased it expense as well as other personnel-related expenses. And then the increase, as you mentioned, really is driven by R&D. 
So if you look at R&D, we're anticipating that as a percentage of sales to be about 150 basis points higher year-over-year in there. It's really driven by a big piece of that relating to auto OEM investments, but other investments that we see in other parts of our segments."

As it relates to 2021 on operating margins, we see most of the segments probably being relatively consistent year-over-year. A couple of them will probably be a little bit lower or some lower, I should say, and one of which is auto OEM. 
As we continue to make investments in auto OEM, you also see there the gross margin came down some as some of our newer programs have a lower gross margin. So in auto OEM, you will see some decline there. And then aviation is all depending upon the growth we have and expansion there, so it depends upon how the revenue growth relates to our operating expenses."

This business, of course, is a different kind of margin profile overall than the rest of our business. And so we recognize that it will be lower gross margins and lower operating margins, which are consistent with the industry. But we're also witnessing one of the biggest transformations in personal transportation taking place right now. And as a result, there's many, many companies that are trying to get into the opportunity presented by this turnover of technology.

598655,701624642,2213980,"Garmin Ltd., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2021",2021-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As reported earlier today, our growth momentum accelerated in the final quarter of the year. Revenue increased 23%, exceeding $1.3 billion driven by strong double-digit growth in our fitness, outdoor and marine",1562,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As reported earlier today, our growth momentum accelerated in the final quarter of the year. Revenue increased 23%, exceeding $1.3 billion driven by strong double-digit growth in our fitness, outdoor and marine segments. Gross margin improved to 58.5%. Operating income increased 34% to $371 million, and operating margin expanded to 27.5%. GAAP EPS was $1.73 and pro forma EPS was also $1.73, increasing 34% over the prior year. 
Looking back, I'm very proud of what we accomplished in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges affecting every company. And of course, Garmin was no exception. Many of these challenges were the burden of employees such as learning to work and collaborate remotely while juggling new challenges in their personal lives. Our employees were very resilient and faced these challenges with courage and determination as reflected in our outstanding performance throughout the year. The pandemic also created many new opportunities as interest in health, fitness and active lifestyles surged. We were well positioned to seize these opportunities with a strong product lineup, and our vertically integrated business model gave us flexibility to meet rapidly changing demands. During this crisis, we maintained our focus on R&D, which allowed us to introduce many innovative new products throughout the year. 
On a consolidated basis, revenue increased 11% to nearly $4.2 billion, which is a new record for Garmin, and our fifth consecutive year of growth. Gross margin was 59.3%, and operating margin was 25.2%. Operating income increased 11% to over $1 billion, which is another record achievement. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $5.17 and pro forma EPS of $5.14, an increase of 16% over the prior year. Considering these strong results, at our upcoming annual meeting, we'll ask shareholders to approve an annual dividend of $2.68 per share, representing a 10% increase over the current annual dividend amount. 
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to highlight some achievements from the past year and the outlook for each of our 5 business segments. Starting with the fitness segment. Revenue increased 26% as strong demand for advanced wearables and cycling products fueled our growth. Growth and operating margins were 53% and 24%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 66% over the prior year. During the year, we launched innovative new wearables and cycling products, such as the Venu Sq, the Forerunner 745 and the next generation of Edge cycling computers. 
Looking forward, we are well positioned to capitalize on the broader trends in health and fitness. We plan to leverage our recent acquisition of Firstbeat to offer products with unique health and fitness features. In addition, we intend to capitalize on the trends in indoor cycling with our strong lineup of tax products. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue from the fitness segment will increase approximately 10% in 2021. 
In the outdoor segment, revenue increased 23% primarily driven by strong demand for adventure watches. Gross and operating margins were 66% and 39%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 32%. During the year, we added solar charging technology to a broad range of fenix and Instinct models, extending our lead in low-power technology and further differentiating ourselves in the highly competitive smartwatch market. Looking forward, we expect the broader trends in outdoor to continue. We plan to leverage this opportunity by offering compelling products that maximize the enjoyment of outdoor activity and adventure.
We believe that inReach will continue to grow as more people appreciate the convenience and life-saving potential of 2-way remote communication. Our recent acquisition of GEOS, a critical provider of emergency monitoring and incident response services, allows us to expand its scale and improve service levels for our growing base of inReach customers. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue from the outdoor segment will increase approximately 10% in 2021. 
Looking next at the aviation segment. Revenue decreased 15% due to lower revenue from OEM product categories and the expected decline of the ADS-B market. Gross and operating margins were 73% and 22%, respectively. While the pandemic created some headwinds, particularly in the OEM market, we see positive signs in the smaller aircraft segment, especially in owner-flown aircraft. In addition, when adjusting for the impact of ADS-B, there are encouraging signs in the aftermarket as aircraft owners embrace the latest cockpit technologies. 
Autoland is being recognized as game-changing new safety technology for general aviation and recently was named one of 2020's greatest innovations by Popular Science. Autoland also won a Top Flight Award from Aviation International News. During the year, Autoland achieved certification on 3 aircraft models, including the Cirrus Vision Jet, the Piper M600 and the Daher TBM 940. Over 150 Autoland-equipped aircraft are now in service, a number that continues to grow every day. 
We believe the general aviation market is stabilizing. And during 2021, we expect this segment to grow approximately 5% with contributions from both OEM and aftermarket categories. We expect revenue from the segment to decline in the first quarter as we compare against strong residual ADS-B numbers from last year, followed by growth as the year-over-year comparisons become much more favorable. We are focused on certifying safety-enhancing technologies such as Autoland in additional aircraft models, and we will continue to invest in future growth opportunities. 
Moving on to marine. The segment delivered another year of impressive results, as the pandemic created an opportunity for people to rediscover boating and fishing. Revenue increased 29%, with growth in multiple product categories led by strong demand for chartplotters. Gross and operating margins were 58% and 27%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 60%. 
We continue to be recognized for innovation and achievement in the marine industry. We were named Supplier of the Year by Independent Boat Builders, Inc.; Manufacturer of the year by the National Marine Electronics Association; and recently, we were recognized as one of the top 10 most innovative marine companies by Soundings Trade Only, which is a B2B news and information provider for the recreational boating industry. 
Looking forward, we anticipate that interest in boating and fishing will remain strong. Many boatbuilders have already sold out of their 2021 models, and our retail partners are preparing for another year of strong growth. We plan to capitalize on these trends by offering a compelling lineup of products with innovative features and disruptive new technologies. With this in mind, we anticipate revenue from the marine segment will increase approximately 15% in 2021. 
Moving finally to the auto segment. I want to highlight that we are now providing expanded disclosures for the segment. Specifically, we are disclosing separate financial information for the 2 operating segments within auto: the consumer segment, which includes PND and specialty products; and the OEM segment, which is focused on hardware and software solutions for vehicle manufacturers. We believe these expanded disclosures will help investors better understand the mix of revenue, the level of investment and the profit profile of each profit segment. 
Now looking at the year-end results for the auto segment. Revenue decreased 16% as the decline in PNDs was partially offset by growth in specialty products and revenue from new OEM programs. Gross margin was 45%, and we recorded an operating loss of $19 million driven by investments in auto OEM programs. 
Our auto OEM business has reached an inflection point as we ramp up new programs over the next few years. Prior to the most recent wins, we have been successful on various software, navigation and infotainment programs with several top-tier OEMs, such as Honda, Toyota, Daimler and Peugeot, to name just a few. We are currently in production with a full infotainment system for the Daimler Vito van, and we recently began production on the current BMW program, where we are a Tier 1 build-to-print supplier. 
Also, we are developing the next-generation program for BMW as the lead supplier, which expands our role to encompass all aspects of the design, including hardware, complex operating system development and system integration. Moving into this lead supplier role on future programs is a testament to the progress we've made as a Tier 1 supplier to the auto industry. These programs require a significant investment in R&D prior to realizing revenue, and not all costs are reimbursed by the customer. With these things in mind, we expect total auto revenue to grow approximately 5% in '21 driven by growth in specialty consumer products and new OEM programs. We also expect additional losses from the OEM operating segment as we invest in the development of future programs expected to launch in late 2022. 
Well, in summary, I'm very proud of what we accomplished in 2020 while facing challenges that no one could have anticipated just 1 year ago. The indicators for 2021 look positive, and we are excited about the opportunities in every business segment. With this in mind, we anticipate 2021 revenue will be approximately $4.6 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year, and we anticipate growth in all segments. We expect gross margin to be approximately 59.2% and operating margin at approximately 23.5%. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of 10.5%, pro forma earnings per share are expected to be approximately $5.15. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue over $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter, representing a 23% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.5%, 50 basis point increase on the prior year. Operating expense percentage of sales was 31.1%, 180 basis point decrease. Operating income was $371 million, a 34% increase. Operating margin was 27.5%, 240 basis point increase in the prior year. Our GAAP pro forma EPS was $1.73, 34% increase from the prior year pro forma of EPS. 
Looking at full year results, we posted revenue of over $4.1 billion, representing 11% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.3%, a 20 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 34.1%, a 20 basis point decrease. Operating income was $1.054 billion, 11% increase. Operating margin was 25.2%, consistent with the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $5.17. Pro forma EPS was $5.14, 16% increase on prior year. 
Next, looking at fourth quarter revenue by segment and geography. In our fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth for our 5 segments, led by marine segment with growth of 48%; followed by the outdoor segment, 40% growth; fitness segment with 26% growth. By geography, we achieved growth in all 3 regions, led by strong growth of 32% both EMEA and APAC. Americas grew 13%, which is more heavily impacted by the decline in aviation. Excluding aviation, Americas' growth was more in line with other regions. For the full year 2020, we achieved 11% consolidated growth with strong double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. Marine, fitness and outdoor each grew in excess of 20%. On geography, we achieved growth in all 3 regions, led by 17% growth, EMEA; 8% growth, both Americas and APAC. 
Looking next, operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $57 million or 16%. Research and development increased $38 million year-over-year primarily due to engineering personnel costs and other expenses related to auto OEM programs. Our advertising expense decreased approximately $2 million from the prior year quarter. SG&A increased $21 million compared to prior year quarter, a decrease percentage of sales to 11.8%, a 70 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. The increase in SG&A is primarily due to increases in information technology costs and personnel-related expenses. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and dividends. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially year-over-year to $849 million due to strong sales in the fourth quarter. Inventory balance increased year-over-year to $762 million. 
During the fourth quarter 2020, we generated free cash flow of $387 million. For the full year 2020, we generated free cash flow of approximately $950 million, $369 million increase from the prior year due to improved earnings and decreased operating capital needs. For 2021, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $725 million, approximately $350 million of capital expenditures.
Expected year-over-year increase capital expenditures due to investments in platforms for growth include expansion of our Taiwan manufacturing facilities; restarting the late expansion project, which includes the renovation of the previous Olathe manufacturing and distribution facility to increase workspace capacity; the auto OEM manufacturing facility in Europe and IT-related projects. We announced our plans to seek shareholder approval for an increase in our dividend beginning with the June 2021 payment. Proposal is a cash dividend of $2.68 per share or $0.67 per share for the quarter. This is a 10% increase from our current quarterly dividend of $0.61 per share. 
For full year 2020, we reported an effective tax rate of 10.1%. Pro forma effective tax rate is 10.4%, 510 basis point decrease from the prior year primarily due to the migration intellectual property ownership of Switzerland to United States. The fiscal year 2021 pro forma effective tax rate expected to be 10.5%, relatively flat year-over-year. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Joelle, can you please open the line for Q&A?"

If you look at the gross margin, was relatively comparable, maybe 10 basis points lower there. But to give you a little bit color on the operating expenses, yes, we're anticipating 2021 to be about 160 basis points higher as a percent of sales. Looking at each of the pieces, advertising, we anticipate or target that to be relatively flat as a percentage of sales year-over-year. SG&A will be slightly up, we think. That's primarily due to increased IT expense as well as other personnel-related expenses. And then the increase, as you mentioned, really is driven by R&D. 
So if you look at R&D, we're anticipating that as a percentage of sales to be about 150 basis points higher year-over-year in there. It's really driven by a big piece of that relating to auto OEM investments but other investments that we see in other parts of our segments."

And then on top of that, our product line and our growth in terms of the market, market share has been strong, and so we've been able to essentially double leverage those things."

And it still remains to be seen how much the vaccine really makes people feel free to do those kinds of activities. There's still a lot of guidance coming out that the vaccines have -- they help, but they don't necessarily ensure that people won't get sick or couldn't infect someone else. So these are all things that people are still processing. It's early days. And so right now, we're believing that the trends that we've been seeing in the business over the past year are solid and will continue."

As I mentioned in my remarks, the smaller aircraft segment, especially owner-flown and also we're hearing the news from charter and fractional companies, that they're seeing an uptick in their demand. And so that's playing out exactly as we thought. 
And as we look forward, again, the demand is just super strong in the smaller aircraft segment. And we're strongly positioned in every one of those platforms to take advantage of that.

We don't expect them to be, but we're working very hard to fulfill the demand. And the good news has been, that as we've ramped up production, it seems like our back orders have really also increased. And so we believe that people love the product.

As reported earlier today, our growth momentum accelerated in the final quarter of the year. Revenue increased 23%, exceeding $1.3 billion driven by strong double-digit growth in our fitness, outdoor and marine",1562,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As reported earlier today, our growth momentum accelerated in the final quarter of the year. Revenue increased 23%, exceeding $1.3 billion driven by strong double-digit growth in our fitness, outdoor and marine segments. Gross margin improved to 58.5%. Operating income increased 34% to $371 million, and operating margin expanded to 27.5%. GAAP EPS was $1.73 and pro forma EPS was also $1.73, increasing 34% over the prior year.  
Looking back, I'm very proud of what we accomplished in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges affecting every company, and of course, Garmin was no exception. Many of these challenges were the burden of employees such as learning to work and collaborate remotely while juggling new challenges in their personal lives. Our employees were very resilient and faced these challenges with courage and determination as reflected in our outstanding performance throughout the year. The pandemic also created many new opportunities as interest in health, fitness and active lifestyles surged. We were well positioned to seize these opportunities with a strong product lineup, and our vertically integrated business model gave us flexibility to meet rapidly changing demands. During this crisis, we maintained our focus on R&D, which allowed us to introduce many innovative new products throughout the year. 
On a consolidated basis, revenue increased 11% to nearly $4.2 billion, which is a new record for Garmin, and our fifth consecutive year of growth. Gross margin was 59.3%, and operating margin was 25.2%. Operating income increased 11% to over $1 billion, which is another record achievement. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $5.17 and pro forma EPS of $5.14, an increase of 16% over the prior year. Considering these strong results, at our upcoming annual meeting, we'll ask shareholders to approve an annual dividend of $2.68 per share, representing a 10% increase over the current annual dividend amount. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to highlight some achievements from the past year and the outlook for each of our 5 business segments. 
Starting with the fitness segment. Revenue increased 26% as strong demand for advanced wearables and cycling products fueled our growth. Growth and operating margins were 53% and 24%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 66% over the prior year. During the year, we launched innovative new wearables and cycling products, such as the Venu Sq, the Forerunner 745 and the next generation of Edge cycling computers. Looking forward, we are well positioned to capitalize on the broader trends in health and fitness. We plan to leverage our recent acquisition of Firstbeat to offer products with unique health and fitness features. In addition, we intend to capitalize on the trends in indoor cycling with our strong lineup of Tacx products. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue from the fitness segment will increase approximately 10% in 2021. 
In the outdoor segment, revenue increased 23%, primarily driven by strong demand for adventure watches. Gross and operating margins were 66% and 39%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 32%. During the year, we added solar charging technology to a broad range of fenix and Instinct models, extending our lead in low-power technology and further differentiating ourselves in the highly competitive smartwatch market. Looking forward, we expect the broader trends in outdoor to continue. We plan to leverage this opportunity by offering compelling products that maximize the enjoyment of outdoor activity and adventure.  We believe that inReach will continue to grow as more people appreciate the convenience and life-saving potential of 2-way remote communication. Our recent acquisition of GEOS, a critical provider of emergency monitoring and incident response services, allows us to expand its scale and improve service levels for our growing base of inReach customers. With these things in mind, we anticipate revenue from the outdoor segment will increase approximately 10% in 2021.
Looking next at the aviation segment. Revenue decreased 15% due to lower revenue from OEM product categories and the expected decline of the ADS-B market. Gross and operating margins were 73% and 22%, respectively. While the pandemic created some headwinds, particularly in the OEM market, we see positive signs in the smaller aircraft segment, especially in owner-flown aircraft. In addition, when adjusting for the impact of ADS-B, there are encouraging signs in the aftermarket as aircraft owners embrace the latest cockpit technologies. Autoland is being recognized as game-changing new safety technology for general aviation and recently was named one of 2020's greatest innovations by Popular Science. Autoland also won a Top Flight Award from Aviation International News. During the year, Autoland achieved certification on 3 aircraft models, including the Cirrus Vision Jet, the Piper M600 and the Daher TBM 940. Over 150 Autoland-equipped aircraft are now in service, a number that continues to grow every day.  We believe the general aviation market is stabilizing, and during 2021, we expect this segment to grow approximately 5% with contributions from both OEM and aftermarket categories. We expect revenue from the segment to decline in the first quarter as we compare against strong residual ADS-B numbers from last year, followed by growth as the year-over-year comparisons become much more favorable. We are focused on certifying safety-enhancing technologies such as Autoland in additional aircraft models, and we will continue to invest in future growth opportunities.
Moving on to marine. The segment delivered another year of impressive results as the pandemic created an opportunity for people to rediscover boating and fishing. Revenue increased 29%, with growth in multiple product categories led by strong demand for chartplotters. Gross and operating margins were 58% and 27%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 60%. We continue to be recognized for innovation and achievement in the marine industry. We were named Supplier of the Year by Independent Boat Builders, Inc.; Manufacturer of the Year by the National Marine Electronics Association; and recently, we were recognized as one of the top 10 most innovative marine companies by Soundings Trade Only, which is a B2B news and information provider for the recreational boating industry.  Looking forward, we anticipate that interest in boating and fishing will remain strong. Many boatbuilders have already sold out of their 2021 models, and our retail partners are preparing for another year of strong growth. We plan to capitalize on these trends by offering a compelling lineup of products with innovative features and disruptive new technologies. With this in mind, we anticipate revenue from the marine segment will increase approximately 15% in 2021.
Moving finally to the auto segment. I want to highlight that we are now providing expanded disclosures for the segment. Specifically, we are disclosing separate financial information for the 2 operating segments within auto: the consumer segment, which includes PND and specialty products; and the OEM segment, which is focused on hardware and software solutions for vehicle manufacturers. We believe these expanded disclosures will help investors better understand the mix of revenue, the level of investment and the profit profile of each profit segment. Now looking at the year-end results for the auto segment. Revenue decreased 16% as the decline in PNDs was partially offset by growth in specialty products and revenue from new OEM programs. Gross margin was 45%, and we recorded an operating loss of $19 million driven by investments in auto OEM programs. Our auto OEM business has reached an inflection point as we ramp up new programs over the next few years. Prior to the most recent wins, we have been successful on various software, navigation and infotainment programs with several top-tier OEMs, such as Honda, Toyota, Daimler and Peugeot, to name just a few. We are currently in production with a full infotainment system for the Daimler Vito van, and we recently began production on the current BMW program, where we are a Tier 1 build-to-print supplier.  Also, we are developing the next-generation program for BMW as the lead supplier, which expands our role to encompass all aspects of the design, including hardware, complex operating system development and system integration. Moving into this lead supplier role on future programs is a testament to the progress we've made as a Tier 1 supplier to the auto industry. These programs require a significant investment in R&D prior to realizing revenue, and not all costs are reimbursed by the customer. With these things in mind, we expect total auto revenue to grow approximately 5% in '21, driven by growth in specialty consumer products and new OEM programs. We also expect additional losses from the OEM operating segment as we invest in the development of future programs expected to launch in late 2022. 
Well, in summary, I'm very proud of what we accomplished in 2020 while facing challenges that no one could have anticipated just 1 year ago. The indicators for 2021 look positive, and we are excited about the opportunities in every business segment. With this in mind, we anticipate 2021 revenue will be approximately $4.6 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year, and we anticipate growth in all segments. We expect gross margin to be approximately 59.2%, and operating margin at approximately 23.5%. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of 10.5%, pro forma earnings per share are expected to be approximately $5.15. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk us through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results, move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue over $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter, representing a 23% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.5%, 50 basis point increase on the prior year. Operating expense percentage of sales was 31.1%, 180 basis point decrease. Operating income was $371 million, a 34% increase. Operating margin was 27.5%, 240 basis point increase in the prior year. Our GAAP pro forma EPS was $1.73, 34% increase from the prior year pro forma of EPS. 
Looking at full year results, we posted revenue of over $4.1 billion, representing 11% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.3%, a 20 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 34.1%, 20 basis point decrease. Operating income was $1.054 billion, 11% increase. Operating margin was 25.2%, consistent with the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $5.17. Pro forma EPS was $5.14, 16% increase on prior year. 
Next, looking at fourth quarter revenue by segment and geography. In our fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth for our 5 segments, led by marine segment with growth of 48%; followed by the outdoor segment, 40% growth; fitness segment with 26% growth. By geography, we achieved growth in all 3 regions, led by strong growth of 32%, both EMEA and APAC. Americas grew 13%, which is more heavily impacted by the decline in aviation. Excluding aviation, Americas' growth was more in line with other regions. For the full year 2020, we achieved 11% consolidated growth with strong double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. Marine, fitness and outdoor each grew in excess of 20%. On geography, we achieved growth in all 3 regions, led by 17% growth, EMEA; 8% growth, both Americas and APAC. 
Looking next, operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $57 million or 16%. Research and development increased $38 million year-over-year, primarily due to engineering personnel costs and other expenses related to auto OEM programs. Our advertising expense decreased approximately $2 million from the prior year quarter. SG&A increased $21 million compared to prior year quarter, a decrease percentage of sales to 11.8%, 70 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. Increase in SG&A is primarily due to increases in information technology costs and personnel-related expenses.
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and dividends. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially year-over-year to $849 million due to strong sales in the fourth quarter. Inventory balance increased year-over-year to $762 million.  During the fourth quarter 2020, we generated free cash flow of $387 million. For the full year 2020, we generated free cash flow of approximately $950 million, $369 million increase from the prior year due to improved earnings and decreased operating capital needs. For 2021, we expect free cash flow to be approximately $725 million, approximately $350 million of capital expenditures.  Expected year-over-year increase capital expenditures due to investments in platforms for growth include expansion of our Taiwan manufacturing facilities; restarting the late expansion project, which includes the renovation of the previous Olathe manufacturing and distribution facility to increase workspace capacity; the auto OEM manufacturing facility in Europe and IT-related projects. We announced our plans to seek shareholder approval for an increase in our dividend, beginning with the June 2021 payment. Proposal is a cash dividend of $2.68 per share or $0.67 per share for the quarter. This is a 10% increase from our current quarterly dividend of $0.61 per share.  For full year 2020, we reported an effective tax rate of 10.1%. Pro forma effective tax rate is 10.4%, 510 basis point decrease from the prior year, primarily due to the migration intellectual property ownership of Switzerland to United States. The fiscal year 2021 pro forma effective tax rate expected to be 10.5%, relatively flat year-over-year.

Looking at each of the pieces, advertising, we anticipate or target that to be relatively flat as a percentage of sales year-over-year. SG&A will be slightly up, we think. That's primarily due to increased IT expense as well as other personnel-related expenses. And then the increase, as you mentioned, really is driven by R&D. So if you look at R&D, we're anticipating that as a percentage of sales to be about 150 basis points higher year-over-year in there. It's really driven by a big piece of that relating to auto OEM investments, but other investments that we see in other parts of our segments."

There's still a lot of guidance coming out that the vaccines have -- they help, but they don't necessarily ensure that people won't get sick or couldn't infect someone else.

And we mentioned last year at this time as the pandemic was erupting that we believe that general aviation had a bright future throughout this because of the flexibility and the options that it provides people that might have concerns about how they travel. And we've definitely seen that play out. As I mentioned in my remarks, the smaller aircraft segment, especially owner-flown and also we're hearing the news from charter and fractional companies that they're seeing an uptick in their demand. And so that's playing out exactly as we thought.  And as we look forward, again, the demand is just super strong in the smaller aircraft segment. And we're strongly positioned in every one of those platforms to take advantage of that. We're in all the right places in the light jet market, up through medium jets, on the piston side for the owner-flown people as well. And so we're ideally positioned in all of those categories to be able to meet the demand."

So we've always been in a strong position, and that's where we'll continue to be.  We do have concerns and constraints around the capital structure. We want to make sure that we can distribute dividends to shareholders as efficiently as possible, which means that we have a certain amount of capital that we can deploy, whether it's dividends or buybacks.

Operating margin increased to 23.3% and operating income grew 41% to $250 million. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.14. Pro forma EPS was $1.18, up 30% over the prior year. 
Before turning the call over to Doug, I'll provide highlights by segment and a summary of what we see ahead. Starting with fitness, revenue increased 38% to $308 million, driven by strong demand for cycling products and advanced wearables. Gross and operating margins were 56% and 24%, respectively. Operating income more than doubled over the prior year to $74 million. During the quarter, we introduced Lily, a fashion first smart watch with exceptional features designed specifically for women. In the cycling market, we launched the Rally power meters, including a version for off-road cycling, which is a new product category for us. 
Moving to outdoor. Revenue increased 46% to $256 million with growth across all product categories led by strong demand for adventure watches. The outdoor segment generated strong growth and operating margins of 67% and 36%, respectively. Operating income nearly doubled over the prior year to $93 million. During the quarter, we launched Enduro, a new adventure watch category built specifically for athletes who demand exceptional battery life for endurance racing. We also expanded the Approach family of golf tracking devices with the launch of 3 new products for golfers of every skill level. 
Looking next at aviation, revenue decreased 8% to $174 million driven primarily by reduced contributions from ADS-B products that remained strong in the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact from ADS-B, revenue was relatively flat to last year, which is an encouraging signal that the underlying market has stabilized. Gross and operating margins were 73% and 26%, respectively. 
During the quarter, Autoland was selected as 1 of 7 finalists for the Robert J. Collier Trophy. The Collier Trophy is a prestigious award that recognizes significant achievements in the areas of aeronautics and astronautics. In addition, we recently added several aircraft models to the list of GFC500 and  600 autopilot certifications, which expands the addressable market for these advanced flight control systems. 
Looking next at the marine segment. Revenue increased 28% to $209 million. Gross and operating margins were 58% and 29%, respectively. Operating income increased 53% over the prior year to $62 million. During the quarter, we experienced strong demand for chartplotters and Panoptix LiveScope sonars from new boat manufacturers and users preparing their boats for the upcoming season on the water. 
Looking finally at auto revenue increased 18% to $124 million, and we experienced growth in both OEM and consumer categories. Gross margin was 39% and, and we recorded an operating loss of $24 million, driven by ongoing investments in OEM programs for next-generation vehicles. During the quarter, we entered the powersports market with a full complement of products designed to help recreational offroaders find their way, stay connected with other riders, control electrical systems on the vehicle and monitor their surroundings. [Audio Gap] 
And 31% growth in APAC. Americas grew 18%, is more heavily impacted by decline in aviation. Excluding aviation, Americas' growth was more in line with the other regions. 
Next, operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $62 million or 19%. Research and development increased $38 million year-over-year, primarily due to engineering personnel costs across all of our segments, other expenses related to auto OEM programs. Our advertising expense increased approximately $4 million due to higher spend in the outdoor and fitness segments. SG&A increased $20 million compared to prior year quarter, a decrease in percentage of sales to 14.7%, a 30 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. Increase in SG&A was primarily due to increase in personnel-related expenses, information technology costs. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash, marketable securities approximately $3.2 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $558 million on a seasonally strong fourth quarter. Inventory balance increased year-over-year to $838 million. In the first quarter 2021, we generated free cash flow of $331 million, $147 million increase on the prior quarter. And our first quarter 2021 reported an effective tax rate of 12.2% and compared to 9.3% in the prior year quarter. The increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to larger amount of reserve releases in the prior year. This concludes our formal remarks. Michelle, can you please open the line for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, 2021 began on a strong as momentum from 2020 continued into the new year. Consolidated revenue came in at nearly $1.1 billion, up 25% over the prior year with strong double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 business segments. Gross margin was strong at 59.8%. Operating margin increased to 23.3% and operating income grew 41% to $250 million. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.14. Pro forma EPS was $1.18, up 30% over the prior year. 
Before turning the call over to Doug, I'll provide highlights by segment and a summary of what we see ahead. Starting with fitness, revenue increased 38% to $308 million, driven by strong demand for cycling products and advanced wearables. Gross and operating margins were 56% and 24%, respectively. Operating income more than doubled over the prior year to $74 million. During the quarter, we introduced Lily, a fashion first smart watch with exceptional features designed specifically for women. In the cycling market, we launched the Rally power meters, including a version for off-road cycling, which is a new product category for us. 
Moving to outdoor. Revenue increased 46% to $256 million with growth across all product categories led by strong demand for adventure watches. The outdoor segment generated strong growth and operating margins of 67% and 36%, respectively. Operating income nearly doubled over the prior year to $93 million. During the quarter, we launched Enduro, a new adventure watch category built specifically for athletes who demand exceptional battery life for endurance racing. We also expanded the Approach family of golf tracking devices with the launch of 3 new products for golfers of every skill level. 
Looking next at aviation, revenue decreased 8% to $174 million driven primarily by reduced contributions from ADS-B products that remained strong in the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact from ADS-B, revenue was relatively flat to last year, which is an encouraging signal that the underlying market has stabilized. Gross and operating margins were 73% and 26%, respectively. 
During the quarter, Autoland was selected as 1 of 7 finalists for the Robert J. Collier Trophy. The Collier Trophy is a prestigious award that recognizes significant achievements in the areas of aeronautics and astronautics. In addition, we recently added several aircraft models to the list of GFC500 and  600 autopilot certifications, which expands the addressable market for these advanced flight control systems. 
Looking next at the marine segment. Revenue increased 28% to $209 million. Gross and operating margins were 58% and 29%, respectively. Operating income increased 53% over the prior year to $62 million. During the quarter, we experienced strong demand for chartplotters and Panoptix LiveScope sonars from new boat manufacturers and users preparing their boats for the upcoming season on the water. 
Looking finally at auto revenue increased 18% to $124 million, and we experienced growth in both OEM and consumer categories. Gross margin was 39% and, and we recorded an operating loss of $24 million, driven by ongoing investments in OEM programs for next-generation vehicles. During the quarter, we entered the powersports market with a full complement of products designed to help recreational offroaders find their way, stay connected with other riders, control electrical systems on the vehicle and monitor their surroundings.  
In summary, Q1 was another record-breaking quarter. We're very pleased with what we've accomplished so far this year, and we continue to see strong demand for our products. Some of you are wondering how this strong performance affects our outlook for the rest of the year. We believe there are 2 very important factors to consider. First, much of the year  remains ahead of us. Q1 is typically the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year. It's difficult to predict what the remainder of the year will look like based on 1 period especially considering the pandemic-driven dynamics of the past year.
Second, the electronics industry is experiencing high demand for and short supply of certain electrical components. So far, the impact on us has been minimal due to our inventory strategy and vertically integrated business model. However, the situation is very dynamic, complex and long term in nature and, thus, difficult to predict how it will evolve. With these things in mind, we're maintaining the guidance issued on February 17, 2021. So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'm reviewing our first quarter financial results and make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $1.072 billion in the first quarter, representing 25% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.8%, a 60 basis point increase. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 36.5%, a 200 basis point decrease. Operating income was $250 million, 41% increase. Operating margin was 23.3%, 260 basis point increase. Our GAAP EPS was $1.14. Pro forma EPS was $1.18. 
Next with our first quarter revenue by segment and geography. For the first quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments led by the outdoor segment with strong growth of 46% followed by the segment with 38% growth and the marine segment with 28% growth. By geography, we achieved double-digit growth in all 3 segments and by strong growth of 33% EMEA and 31% growth in APAC. Americas grew 18%, is more heavily impacted by decline in aviation. Excluding aviation, Americas' growth was more in line with the other regions. 
Next, operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $62 million or 19%. Research and development increased $38 million year-over-year, primarily due to engineering personnel costs across all of our segments, other expenses related to auto OEM programs. Our advertising expense increased approximately $4 million due to higher spend in the outdoor and fitness segments. SG&A increased $20 million compared to prior year quarter, a decrease in percentage of sales to 14.7%, a 30 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. Increase in SG&A was primarily due to increase in personnel-related expenses, information technology costs. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash, marketable securities approximately $3.2 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $558 million on a seasonally strong fourth quarter. Inventory balance increased year-over-year to $838 million. In the first quarter 2021, we generated free cash flow of $331 million, $147 million increase on the prior quarter. And our first quarter 2021 reported an effective tax rate of 12.2% and compared to 9.3% in the prior year quarter. The increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to larger amount of reserve releases in the prior year. This concludes our formal remarks. Michelle, can you please open the line for Q&A?"

I think we've got fantastic employees at Garmin. We're really proud of all of them, over 16,000 employees around the world now. And our culture is very unique and the kind of products and markets that we serve are also very unique.

As announced earlier today, 2021 began on a strong note as momentum from 2020 continued into the new year. Consolidated revenue came in at nearly $1.1 billion, up 25% over the prior year with strong double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 business segments. Gross margin was strong at 59.8%. Operating margin increased to 23.3% and operating income grew 41% to $250 million. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1.14. Pro forma EPS was $1.18, up 30% over the prior year.  
Before turning the call over to Doug, I'll provide highlights by segment and a summary of what we see ahead. Starting with fitness, revenue increased 38% to $308 million, driven by strong demand for cycling products and advanced wearables. Gross and operating margins were 56% and 24%, respectively. Operating income more than doubled over the prior year to $74 million. During the quarter, we introduced Lily, a fashion-first smart watch with exceptional features designed specifically for women. In the cycling market, we launched the Rally power meters, including a version for off-road cycling, which is a new product category for us.  
Moving to outdoor. Revenue increased 46% to $256 million with growth across all product categories led by strong demand for adventure watches. The outdoor segment generated strong growth and operating margins of 67% and 36%, respectively. Operating income nearly doubled over the prior year to $93 million. During the quarter, we launched Enduro, a new adventure watch category built specifically for athletes who demand exceptional battery life for endurance racing. We also expanded the Approach family of golf tracking devices with the launch of 3 new products for golfers of every skill level.
Looking next at aviation. Revenue decreased 8% to $174 million, driven primarily by reduced contributions from ADS-B products that remained strong in the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact from ADS-B, revenue was relatively flat to last year, which is an encouraging signal that the underlying market has stabilized. Gross and operating margins were 73% and 26%, respectively.  
During the quarter, Autoland was selected as 1 of 7 finalists for the Robert J. Collier Trophy. The Collier Trophy is a prestigious award that recognizes significant achievements in the areas of aeronautics and astronautics. In addition, we recently added several aircraft models to the list of GFC500 and and 600 autopilot certifications, which expands the addressable market for these advanced flight control systems.  
Looking next at the Marine Segment. Revenue increased 28% to $209 million. Gross and operating margins were 58% and 29%, respectively. Operating income increased 53% over the prior year to $62 million. During the quarter, we experienced strong demand for chartplotters and Panoptix LiveScope sonars from new boat manufacturers and users preparing their boats for the upcoming season on the water.  
Looking finally at auto. Revenue increased 18% to $124 million, and we experienced growth in both OEM and consumer categories. Gross margin was 39% and, and we recorded an operating loss of $24 million, driven by ongoing investments in OEM programs for next-generation vehicles. During the quarter, we entered the powersports market with a full complement of products designed to help recreational off-roaders find their way, stay connected with other riders, control electrical systems on the vehicle and monitor their surroundings.
In summary, Q1 was another record-breaking quarter. We're very pleased with what we've accomplished so far this year, and we continue to see strong demand for our products. Some of you are wondering how this strong performance affects our outlook for the rest of the year. We believe there are 2 very important factors to consider. First, much of the year remains ahead of us. Q1 is typically the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year. It's difficult to predict what the remainder of the year will look like based on 1 period, especially considering the pandemic-driven dynamics of the past year.
Second, the electronics industry is experiencing high demand for and short supply of certain electrical components. So far, the impact on us has been minimal due to our inventory strategy and vertically integrated business model. However, the situation is very dynamic, complex and long term in nature and, thus, difficult to predict how it will evolve. With these things in mind, we're maintaining the guidance issued on February 17, 2021. So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'm reviewing our first quarter financial results and make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.

I'm reviewing our first quarter financial results and make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $1.072 billion in the first quarter, representing 25% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.8%, a 60 basis point increase. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 36.5%, a 200 basis point decrease. Operating income was $250 million, 41% increase. Operating margin was 23.3%, 260 basis point increase. Our GAAP EPS was $1.14. Pro forma EPS was $1.18. 
Next with our first quarter revenue by segment and geography. For the first quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments led by the outdoor segment with strong growth of 46% followed by the segment with 38% growth and the marine segment with 28% growth. By geography, we achieved double-digit growth in all 3 segments and by strong growth of 33% EMEA and 31% growth in APAC. Americas grew 18%, is more heavily impacted by decline in aviation. Excluding aviation, Americas' growth was more in line with the other regions.
Next, operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses increased by $62 million or 19%. Research and development increased $38 million year-over-year, primarily due to engineering personnel costs across all of our segments, other expenses related to Auto OEM Programs. Our advertising expense increased approximately $4 million due to higher spend in the outdoor and fitness segments. SG&A increased $20 million compared to prior year quarter, a decrease in percentage of sales to 14.7%, a 30 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. Increase in SG&A was primarily due to increase in personnel-related expenses, information technology costs.  
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash, marketable securities approximately $3.2 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $558 million from a seasonally strong fourth quarter. Inventory balance increased year-over-year to $838 million. In the first quarter 2021, we generated free cash flow of $331 million, $147 million increase the prior quarter. And our first quarter 2021 reported an effective tax rate of 12.2% compared to 9.3% in the prior year quarter. The increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to larger amount of reserve releases in the prior year. This concludes our formal remarks. Michelle, can you please open the line for Q&A?"

We experienced strong doub",920,"Thank you, Teri. Good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported record revenue and operating income for the second quarter.
Consolidated revenue increased 53% over the prior year. and exceeded $1.3 billion. We experienced strong double-digit growth in all 5 business segments. Profitability in the quarter was also strong. Operating margin expanded to 28% and operating income increased 97% to $371 million.
There are 2 important things to consider when looking at our Q2 performance. First, Q2 2020 was negatively impacted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced consumer demand and disrupted our retail partners. As a result, a portion of the current period growth is attributable to the unusual comparable from the prior year.
Second, the compound annual growth rate from 2019 to 2021 was 18% for the period. which is very much in line with recent trends during quarters less impacted by the dynamics of the pandemic. We believe this indicates that the underlying market is healthy and continues to grow.
To meet the growing demand for our products, I'm pleased to report that later this fall, we plan to open a fourth production facility in Taiwan, which will approximately double our capacity. This is part of a multiyear initiative to improve our capacity and prepare for opportunities that lie ahead. Also, we entered a new phase of our Alta facility expansion to convert the former warehouse building into additional office space. These projects follow the recent completion of other notable investments, including a new production facility for tax cycling trainers, our new auto OEM production facility in Europe and the expansion of our Lake facility to include auto OEM production.
Given our strong performance in the first half of the year, we're updating our full year guidance. We now anticipate revenue of approximately $4.9 billion, up 17% over the prior year, with double-digit growth expected in each of our 5 business segments. In a moment, Doug will provide more details on our financial results and updated guidance. But first, I'll provide a few brief remarks on the performance and outlook of our business segments.
Starting with fitness. Revenue increased 40% to $413 million, with growth across all categories, led by cycling products and advanced wearables. During the quarter, we celebrated Global Running Day with the launch of 2 new running watches, the Forerunner 55 and the Forerunner 945 LTE. The Forerunner 945 LTE is noteworthy because it includes built-in connectivity and leverages the safety monitoring capability of our recent GEOS acquisition.
We also launched the Venu 2 smartwatch in 2 sizes, which will enhance the appeal of these devices across a broader range of customers. Given the strong performance of the fitness segment, we're raising our revenue growth estimate to 17% for the year.
Moving to outdoor. Revenue increased 57% to $323 million, with growth across all categories, led by adventure watches. During the quarter, we launched our smallest dive watch, the Descent Mk2S, featuring multiple dive modes, multisport chain and smartwatch features for everyday use. Given the strong performance of the outdoor segment, we are raising our revenue growth estimate to 17% for the year.
Looking next at Aviation. Revenue increased 43% to $181 million. and we experienced growth in both OEM and aftermarket categories. Revenue in the quarter was comparable to the levels achieved in the second quarter of 2019, which is significant considering the impact ADS-B had on 2019 performance. During the quarter, Autoland was awarded the prestigious Robert J. Collier Trophy as the year's greatest achievement in the field of Aeronautics or Astronautics. Autoland is the first certified autonomous system designed to activate during an emergency to safely fly and land the aircraft without human intervention.
We also announced the acquisition of Aerodata, a leading provider of performance information for commercial aircraft, serving more than 135 airlines worldwide. Aerodata broadens our presence in commercial, and we look forward to building on their success. We're pleased with how the Aviation segment has recovered from the impact of the pandemic and the complete of the ADS-B mandate. We now expect full year revenue to increase approximately 10%. 
Turning next to the marine segment. Revenue increased 66% to $262 million, with growth across multiple categories led by chartplotters. During the quarter, we announced support for Mercury Smart Craft engines, expanding the list of engines compatible with our display systems. We also launched the MSC 10, Marine Satellite Compass, which provides precised position and heading information without the interference challenges associated with traditional magnetic compass systems. The Marine segment is off to a great start in 2021, and we expect that demand will continue to be strong throughout the remainder of the year. With this in mind, we expect full year revenue to increase approximately 27%.
And looking finally at auto. Revenue increased 74% to $148 million, with growth contributions from both consumer categories and new OEM programs. During the quarter, we launched our first connected dash cam with Live B monitoring and premium subscription-based cloud storage. Given the strong start to the year, we now expect the auto segment to increase approximately 15%. 
In summary, we're very pleased with our performance so far, which gives us confidence to raise our guidance for the year. In addition, we are investing for the future by expanding both our production capacity and office facilities. So we are well positioned to seize opportunities that lie ahead.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results and our updated guidance. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results, provide comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes and our updated guidance.We posted revenue of $1.327 billion for the second quarter, r",570,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results, provide comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes and our updated guidance.
We posted revenue of $1.327 billion for the second quarter, representing a 53% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.8%, a 50 basis point decrease from the prior year quarter. Operating expense to percentage of sales was 30.9%, a 670 basis point decrease in the prior quarter. Operating income was $371 million, a 97% increase. Operating margin was 28%, a 630 basis point increase. Our GAAP EPS was $1.64 and proforma EPS was $1.68. 
Next, look at our second quarter revenue by segment and geography. We have a highly diverse business model, provide a rich set of opportunities and reduce our reliance on single markets and product lines. Fitness is our largest segment, contributing 31% of the sales in the second quarter, followed by outdoor at 24%. 
During the second quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in all of our segments, led by auto with 74% growth. By geography, the Americas region contributed about half of our revenue, the remaining coming from EMEA and APAC. We achieved double-digit growth in all 3 regions, led by strong growth of 72% in APAC, followed by 53% in Americas and 46% in EMEA. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses increased by $83 million or 25%. Research and development increased $35 million year-over-year, primarily due to engineering personnel costs across all of our segments. SG&A increased $34 million compared to the prior year quarter, a decrease as a percentage of sales of 12.5%, a 270 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. Increase in SG&A was primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses from Asian technology costs. Advertising expense increased approximately $14 million due to higher spend in the fitness and outdoor segments.
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3.2 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially and year-over-year to $737 million due to strong second quarter sales. Inventory balance increased sequentially and year-over-year to $939 million, primarily due to raw material requirements. During the second quarter of 2021, we generated free cash flow of $120 million, a $22 million decrease in the prior year quarter. Our capital expenditures for the second quarter were $110 million. We expect full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximately $750 million and capital expenditures of approximately $400 million to be best in expansion projects that Cliff previously mentioned.
During the second quarter of 2021, we reported an effective tax rate of 14.8% compared to the prior year quarter GAAP tax rate of 6.8% and pro forma tax rate of 14%. 
Turning next to our full year guidance. We estimate revenue of approximately $4.9 billion, an increase of 17% for the prior year, with double-digit growth in each of our segments. We expect gross margin to be approximately 58.5%, which is lower than our previous guidance of 59.2% due to higher supply chain costs. We expect an operating margin of approximately 23.8%. Also, we expect pro forma effective tax rate of 11.5%, which is higher than our previous guidance of 10.5% due to income mix by jurisdiction. This results in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $5.50. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Valerie, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

But I would say that in terms of the kind of customer that will buy this product is a customer that's specifically interested in the safety story that Garmin offers. With the integration with our GEOS subsidiary that we recently acquired, it allows us to offer now with the connectivity and end-to-end solution for people that want real-time monitoring of their activities and also the ability to summon safety help if they need it. So that's the kind of customer that would take that product.
And again, it's early days, and I really can't speak to the road map right now, but it's something that is compatible with the approach we've taken with our inReach product line in terms of safety monitoring for active lifestyles."

So in terms of operating margin, it's come up in this period because of the additional sales leverage that we have. And our aviation team has, of course, worked very hard on managing expenses during a pretty difficult challenge that we face. But that said, we don't forecast really the operating margin that we have for the future other than to say we strive to be and expect to be very profitable. It will depend on the investments that we make in the programs and the new products that we're doing in aviation.
In terms of Aerodata contribution, it's a small adder, but an important one because it's very important performance calculations that are done for commercial flights that help airlines conserve fuel and also provide safety, escape procedures for engine out during takeoff. And so that's a critical function that's required in commercial aviation, and it's something that we think we can expand to business aviation as well.
And then finally, on Autoland. Autoland is delivering on 3 models right now, the TBMs, the SS from Cerus and then the M600 from Piper. And of course, in those models, it's 100%. This is not an option.
So the market is growing rapidly. The number of aircraft out there is growing with the delivery of those models and their very popular models. In terms of the ARO data part of that, they aren't closely connected to Autoland per se, but ARO data in business aircraft would be something that's an enhancer from a safety and performance point of view."

And then we also look at our product release timing of this year versus last year. That's a factor in our outlook and finally, potential uncertainties around supply chain that still exists.

Now we'll increase on absolute dollars as co-op, increased sales and media spend.
As it relates to R&D, we do expect that to be up about 50 basis points year-over-year percentage of sales, and they're just increased headcount supporting our product road map. We're talking about investing in autoam, et cetera. Then on SG&A, a little flavor there a percentage of sales on a full year basis.

As it relates to R&D on a sequential basis, the situation there is that is lower in the second quarter due to reimbursement of some change or requests from our OEM partners.

And Cliff, if I look at the aviation guidance and implies meaningfully lower sequentially second half revenue. What would be driving aviation sales to go down from here? And also a related as we speak of aviation, how should investors think about normalized operating margins in aviation once that business kind of goes back to normal?"

But some of our outlook for the second half is related to the timing of deliveries of certain products to customers. So that's one thing we benefited some in the first half because of some accelerated delivery. So that's part of it.
In terms of the normalized growth rates, I mean, there's a lot of studies and a lot of people that put effort into long-term projections for the aviation market, and they typically grow at or above GDP levels for developing countries. And frankly, those studies are so long term. It's very difficult to know how real they are based on everything that can happen as we know pandemics can change the whole course of growth trajectory. So we probably only look at that from a passing interest point of view, and we generally say that we -- We want our Aviation segment to continue to grow, both in terms of market share and penetration on platforms and with market growth."

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported record revenue and operating income for the second quarter. Consolidated revenue increased 53% over the prior year and exceeded $1.3 billion. We experienced strong double",920,"Thank you, Teri. Good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported record revenue and operating income for the second quarter. Consolidated revenue increased 53% over the prior year and exceeded $1.3 billion. We experienced strong double-digit growth in all 5 business segments. Profitability in the quarter was also strong. Operating margin expanded to 28% and operating income increased 97% to $371 million. 
There are 2 important things to consider when looking at our Q2 performance. First, Q2 of 2020 was negatively impacted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced consumer demand and disrupted our retail partners. As a result, a portion of the current period growth is attributable to the unusual comparable from the prior year. Second, the compound annual growth rate from 2019 to 2021 was 18% for the period, which is very much in line with recent trends during quarters less impacted by the dynamics of the pandemic. We believe this indicates that the underlying market is healthy and continues to grow.
To meet the growing demand for our products, I'm pleased to report that later this fall, we plan to open a fourth production facility in Taiwan, which will approximately double our capacity. This is part of a multiyear initiative to improve our capacity and prepare for opportunities that lie ahead. Also, we entered a new phase of our Olathe facility expansion to convert the former warehouse building into additional office space. These projects follow the recent completion of other notable investments, including a new production facility for Tacx cycling trainers, our new auto OEM production facility in Europe and the expansion of our Olathe facility to include auto OEM production.
Given our strong performance in the first half of the year, we're updating our full year guidance. We now anticipate revenue of approximately $4.9 billion, up 17% over the prior year, with double-digit growth expected in each of our 5 business segments. In a moment, Doug will provide more details on our financial results and updated guidance. But first, I'll provide a few brief remarks on the performance and outlook of our business segments.
Starting with fitness. Revenue increased 40% to $413 million, with growth across all categories, led by cycling products and advanced wearables. During the quarter, we celebrated Global Running Day with the launch of 2 new running watches, the Forerunner 55 and the Forerunner 945 LTE. The Forerunner 945 LTE is noteworthy because it includes built-in connectivity and leverages the safety monitoring capability of our recent GEOS acquisition. We also launched the Venu 2 smartwatch in 2 sizes, which will enhance the appeal of these devices across a broader range of customers. Given the strong performance of the fitness segment, we're raising our revenue growth estimate to 17% for the year.
Moving to outdoor. Revenue increased 57% to $323 million, with growth across all categories, led by adventure watches. During the quarter, we launched our smallest dive watch, the Descent Mk2S, featuring multiple dive modes, multisport training and smartwatch features for everyday use. Given the strong performance of the outdoor segment, we are raising our revenue growth estimate to 17% for the year.
Looking next at aviation. Revenue increased 43% to $181 million and we experienced growth in both OEM and aftermarket categories. Revenue in the quarter was comparable to the levels achieved in the second quarter of 2019, which is significant considering the impact ADS-B had on 2019 performance. During the quarter, Autoland was awarded the prestigious Robert J. Collier Trophy as the year's greatest achievement in the fields of aeronautics or astronautics. Autoland is the first certified autonomous system designed to activate during an emergency to safely fly and land the aircraft without human intervention.
We also announced the acquisition of AeroData, a leading provider of performance information for commercial aircraft serving more than 135 airlines worldwide. AeroData broadens our presence in commercial, and we look forward to building on their success. We're pleased with how the aviation segment has recovered from the impact of the pandemic and the completion of the ADS-B mandate. We now expect full year revenue to increase approximately 10%.
Turning next to the marine segment. Revenue increased 66% to $262 million, with growth across multiple categories led by chartplotters. During the quarter, we announced support for Mercury's SmartCraft engines, expanding the list of engines compatible with our display systems. We also launched the MSC 10 marine satellite compass, which provides precise position and heading information without the interference challenges associated with traditional magnetic compass systems. The marine segment is off to a great start in 2021, and we expect that demand will continue to be strong throughout the remainder of the year. With this in mind, we expect full year revenue to increase approximately 27%.
And looking finally at auto. Revenue increased 74% to $148 million, with growth contributions from both consumer categories and new OEM programs. During the quarter, we launched our first connected dash cam with Live View monitoring and premium subscription-based cloud storage. Given the strong start to the year, we now expect the auto segment to increase approximately 15%.
In summary, we're very pleased with our performance so far, which gives us confidence to raise our guidance for the year. In addition, we are investing for the future by expanding both our production capacity and office facilities, so we are well positioned to seize opportunities that lie ahead. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results and our updated guidance. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results, provide comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes and our updated guidance. We posted revenue of $1.327 billion for the second quarter, representing a 53% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.8%, a 50 basis point decrease from the prior year quarter. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 30.9%, a 670 basis point decrease in the prior quarter. Operating income was $371 million, a 97% increase. Operating margin was 28%, a 630 basis point increase. Our GAAP EPS was $1.64 and pro forma EPS was $1.68.
Next, we look at our second quarter revenue by segment and geography. We have a highly diverse business model, provide a rich set of opportunities and reduce our reliance on single markets and product lines. Fitness is our largest segment, contributing 31% of the sales in the second quarter, followed by outdoor at 24%. During the second quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in all of our segments, led by auto with 74% growth. By geography, the Americas region contributed about 1/2 of our revenue with the remaining coming from EMEA and APAC. We achieved double-digit growth in all 3 regions, led by strong growth of 72% in APAC, followed by 53% in Americas and 46% in EMEA.
Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses increased by $83 million or 25%. Research and development increased $35 million year-over-year, primarily due to engineering personnel costs across all of our segments. SG&A increased $34 million compared to the prior year quarter, a decrease as a percentage of sales of 12.5%, a 270 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. Increase in SG&A was primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses and information technology costs. Advertising expense increased approximately $14 million due to higher spend in the fitness and outdoor segments.
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3.2 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially and year-over-year to $737 million due to strong second quarter sales. Inventory balance increased sequentially and year-over-year to $939 million, primarily due to raw material requirements. During the second quarter of 2021, we generated free cash flow of $120 million, a $22 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Our capital expenditures for the second quarter were $110 million. We expect full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximately $750 million and capital expenditures of approximately $400 million to be invested in expansion projects that Cliff previously mentioned. During the second quarter of 2021, we reported an effective tax rate of 14.8% compared to the prior year quarter GAAP tax rate of 6.8% and pro forma tax rate of 14%.
Turning next to our full year guidance. We estimate revenue of approximately $4.9 billion, an increase of 17% from the prior year, with double-digit growth in each of our segments. We expect gross margin to be approximately 58.5%, which is lower than our previous guidance of 59.2% due to higher supply chain costs. We expect an operating margin of approximately 23.8%. Also, we expect pro forma effective tax rate of 11.5%, which is higher than our previous guidance of 10.5% due to income mix by jurisdiction. This results in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $5.50.
This concludes our formal remarks. Valerie, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

So really not a lot to say yet about the results there, and we don't provide results by product category anyway. But I would say that in terms of the kind of customer that will buy this product is a customer that's specifically interested in the safety story that Garmin offers. With the integration with our GEOS subsidiary that we recently acquired, it allows us to offer now with the connectivity and end-to-end solution for people that want real-time monitoring of their activities and also the ability to summon safety help if they need it.
So that's the kind of customer that would take that product. And again, it's early days, and I really can't speak to the road map right now, but it's something that is compatible with the approach we've taken with our inReach product line in terms of safety monitoring for active lifestyles."

And then on aviation, you're approaching '19 levels of revenue and a very nice rebound in operating margins. Should we expect to see operating margins kind of hit north of 30% as we navigate through the balance of the year? Or are there some different dynamics or product mix going on with less ADS-B benefit? And then on AeroData, how much contribution should we expect there? And talk about any cross-selling opportunities you see with that existing customer base?
And then finally, on Autoland, can this be another kind of ADS-B type of opportunity? I've seen very high ASPs for this product. So assumed not as large of an adoption there, but where is the penetration rate you think that goes? And does Aerofit -- AeroData kind of fit in here in terms of improving the overall performance of this feature?"

So in terms of operating margin, it's come up in this period because of the additional sales leverage that we have. And our aviation team has, of course, worked very hard on managing expenses during a pretty difficult challenge that we faced. But that said, we don't forecast really the operating margin that we have for the future other than to say we strive to be and expect to be very profitable. It will depend on the investments that we make in the programs and the new products that we're doing in aviation.
In terms of AeroData contribution, it's a small adder, but an important one because it's very important performance calculations that are done for commercial flights that help airlines conserve fuel and also provide safety escape procedures for engine out during takeoff. And so that's a critical function that's required in commercial aviation, and it's something that we think we can expand to business aviation as well.
And then finally, on Autoland. Autoland is delivering on 3 models right now, the TBMs, the SFs from Cirrus and then the M600 from Piper. And of course, in those models, it's 100%. This is not an option. So the market is growing rapidly. The number of aircraft out there is growing with the delivery of those models and they're very popular models. In terms of the AeroData part of that, they aren't closely connected to Autoland per se, but AeroData in business aircraft would be something that's an enhancer from a safety and performance point of view."

I'd say as it relates to the supply chain situation, that is something that we're managing very effectively on a daily basis just to making sure that we do have the appropriate components to meet that demand. As I think about the rest of the year, as it relates to inventory, I think it will increase some even more than what we have today, probably a -- probably increase more than what our sales level is going to be and probably just a rough number, probably close to $1 billion probably by the end of the year.

And then retail partners were disrupted, many of them not even opened their doors. So that is a factor as we look at our guide.
And then we also look at our product release timing of this year versus last year. That's a factor in our outlook. And finally, potential uncertainties around supply chain that still exists.

So on a full year basis, the percentage of sales, we expect operating expenses to be up about 60 basis points year-over-year. Looking at each one of the categories. Advertising, our goal is to keep that relatively flat, the percentage of sales on a full year basis. Now we'll increase on absolute dollars as co-op, increased sales and media spend.
As it relates to R&D, we do expect that to be up about 50 basis points year-over-year the percentage of sales, and they're just increased headcount supporting our product road map. We're talking about investing in Autoland, et cetera.
Then on SG&A, a little flavor there, percentage of sales on a full year basis. We expect that to be slightly up, maybe about 10 basis points, and that's really due to increased sales. Also driving that to volume, some of the areas such as IT costs, as well as product support and different operations. 
As it relates to R&D on a sequential basis, the situation there is that is lower in the second quarter due to reimbursement of some change or requests from our OEM partners. The situation is whenever an OEM partner gives a change of request, we get reimbursed for that, and that is shown as a reduction in R&D. So there may be a little bit bumpy between the quarters there from that standpoint."

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported record revenue of $1.2 billion for the third quarter, increasing 7% over the pandemic fuel levels we achieved in the prior year. Operating income declined year-over-y",938,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported record revenue of $1.2 billion for the third quarter, increasing 7% over the pandemic fuel levels we achieved in the prior year. Operating income declined year-over-year to $283 million due to a combination of higher freight costs affecting gross margin and increased expenses as we invest in R&D, information technology and marketing initiatives. Operating margin was very strong at 23.7%. 
There are 2 things to consider when looking at our performance in the back half of the year. First, financial comparisons to the prior year are more challenging due to the pandemic-driven demand and retail disruptions of 2020. Also, we are facing one of the most challenging supply chain environments in history. Our vertically integrated business model and commitment to safety stock was a key factor driving revenue growth for the quarter, but supplies are tight, and we expect freight costs to remain elevated as we rush to fill retail shelves in time for the important holiday selling season. I'm pleased with what we've accomplished in this tough environment, and I'm very proud of our team who worked tirelessly to maintain continuity supply from our factories to customers. 
Last time, I mentioned that we invested in a fourth production facility in Taiwan. I'm pleased to report that this facility is operational and will help us fill more orders during the important holiday selling season. 
Given our strong performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we're updating our full year guidance. We now anticipate revenue of approximately $4.95 billion, up 18% over the prior year, with double-digit growth expected in each of our 5 business segments. In a moment, Doug will provide more details on our financial results and updated guidance, but first, I'll provide a few highlights for each business segment. 
Starting with fitness. Revenue increased 4% to $342 million, with growth driven primarily by cycling products and advanced wearables. Our Connect IQ development platform is a strong differentiator for us, and we are deploying it across a broader range of Garmin devices. We recently held our fifth Annual Developer Conference, where we announced a partnership with Dexcom to deliver real-time glucose information via a Connect IQ app on selected smartwatches and cycling computers, even during activities. Fitness segment revenue has grown 26% year-to-date, and we are maintaining our revenue growth estimate of 17% for the year. 
Moving to outdoor. Revenue decreased 3% to $324 million. The decrease in revenue is due to the strong sell-in activity associated with the launch of our solar adventure watches in the prior year quarter and limited supplies of traditional handheld and dog products in the current quarter. During the quarter, we launched the APPROACH R10, our first portable golf monitor. The R10 can be used on course or at home to help golfers improve their game with more than a dozen key metrics shown in real time. Customers are very enthusiastic about the R10, and it's on its way to becoming another halo product for Garmin. Outdoor segment revenue has grown 26% year-to-date, and we are maintaining our growth estimate of 17% for the year. 
Looking next at Aviation. Revenue increased 19% to $180 million, with growth in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. During the quarter, we were ranked #1 in avionics product support by Aviation International News for the 18th consecutive year. Being consistently recognized for unrivaled support year after year clearly shows our strategic focus on taking care of customers and standing behind our products. We launched Smart Glide, a game-changing safety feature inspired by Autoland technology that will help pilots manage loss of engine power by automatically flying the optimal glide ratio and navigating to the best available airport. 
Also in the quarter, we announced the certification of the GFC 600H flight control system on the Bell 505 helicopter. This advanced autopilot includes state-of-the-art safety features, such as electronic stability control and a hover-assist mode. We are pleased with how the Aviation segment has recovered so far this year, and now expect full year revenue guidance to increase approximately 12%. 
Turning next to the Marine segment. Revenue increased 25% to $208 million, with growth across multiple categories, led by chartplotters. We continue to be recognized for innovation and achievements in the marine industry. For the seventh consecutive year, the National Ringing Electronics Association named Garmin Manufacturer of the Year, and we also received 5 Product of Excellence awards. During the quarter, we introduced Surround View, the industry's first intelligent camera system that provides a 360-degree bird's eye view around the vessel. We also announced our partnership with Malibu Boats. Our 7-inch touchscreen displays will be standard equipment across the Malibu axis boat line, beginning with the 2022 model year. Given the strong year-to-date performance on the Marine segment, we are raising our revenue growth estimate to 30% over the year. 
And looking finally at auto, revenue increased 7% to $138 million, with growth primarily driven by OEM programs. During the quarter, we began production shipments of the BMW computing module from our Olathe, Kansas manufacturing facility, and we delivered prototypes of the next-generation BMW system from our new manufacturing facility located in Poland. 
We also recently announced a refreshed lineup of Drive Navigators for the consumer auto segment. These devices offer larger, higher resolution displays as well as enhanced connected features. Given the strong year-to-date performance of the Auto segment, we are raising our revenue growth estimate to 17% for the year. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results and updated guidance. Doug?"

I begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, provide comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes, our updated guidance. We posted revenue of $1,192,000,000 for the third quarter, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.4%, 180 basis point decrease compared to prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to higher freight costs. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 34.7%, 310 basis point increase to the prior quarter. Operating income was $283 million, 11% decrease. Operating margin was 23.7%, a [ 290 ] basis point decrease. Our GAAP EPS was $1.34. Pro forma EPS was $1.41. 
Next, with our third quarter revenue by segment. We have a highly diverse business model, provides a rich set of opportunities, reduce our reliance on single markets and product lines. In the third quarter, we achieved growth in 4 [ of ] 5 segments, double-digit growth in both Marine and Aviation. Fitness is our largest segment, contributing 29% of the sales in the third quarter, followed by Outdoor at 27%. 
Moving to our revenue by geography. Americas and EMEA regions grew 10% and 9%, respectively. The APAC region decreased 2%. The Americas region contributed nearly 1/2 of our revenue, the remaining coming from the EMEA and APAC regions. 
Looking next, operating expenses. Third quarter operating expenses increased by $62 million or 18%. Research and development increased $39 million year-over-year, primarily due to engineering personnel costs. SG&A increased $21 million compared to prior year quarter, primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses, information technology costs. Our advertising expense increased approximately $3 million due to higher media spend. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities [ were ] $3.2 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially and year-over-year to $639 million. Inventory balance increased, both a sequential year-over-year basis, to $1.1 billion, primarily due to raw material requirements in preparation for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. During the third quarter 2021, we generated free cash flow of $204 million, a $32 million decrease compared to prior quarter. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $41 million. We expect full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximately $750 million, capital expenditures of approximately $325 million [ in ] the third quarter of 2021 for an effective tax rate of 5.9% compared to 6.9% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to impact return provision adjustments associated with filing the U.S. tax return. 
Turning next to our full year guidance. We estimate revenue of approximately $4.95 billion, increase of 18% for the prior year, double-digit growth in each of our segments. We expect gross margin to be approximately 58.2%, which is lower than our previous guidance, 58.5%, due to higher freight costs. We expect an operating margin of approximately 24%. Also, we expect the full year 2021 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 11.5%, which results in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $5.60.

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported record revenue of $1.2 billion for the third quarter, increasing 7% over the pandemic fuel levels we achieved in the prior year. Operating income declined year-over-y",938,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported record revenue of $1.2 billion for the third quarter, increasing 7% over the pandemic fuel levels we achieved in the prior year. Operating income declined year-over-year to $283 million due to a combination of higher freight costs affecting gross margin and increased expenses as we invest in R&D, information technology and marketing initiatives. Operating margin was very strong at 23.7%. 
There are 2 things to consider when looking at our performance in the back half of the year. First, financial comparisons to the prior year are more challenging due to the pandemic-driven demand and retail disruptions of 2020. Also, we are facing one of the most challenging supply chain environments in history. Our vertically integrated business model and commitment to safety stock was a key factor driving revenue growth for the quarter, but supplies are tight, and we expect freight costs to remain elevated as we rush to fill retail shelves in time for the important holiday selling season. I'm pleased with what we've accomplished in this tough environment, and I'm very proud of our team who've worked tirelessly to maintain continuity to supply from our factories to customers. 
Last time, I mentioned that we invested in a fourth production facility in Taiwan. I'm pleased to report that this facility is operational and will help us fill more orders during the important holiday selling season. 
Given our strong performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we're updating our full year guidance. We now anticipate revenue of approximately $4.95 billion, up 18% over the prior year, with double-digit growth expected in each of our 5 business segments. In a moment, Doug will provide more details on our financial results and updated guidance, but first, I'll provide a few highlights for each business segment.
Starting with fitness. Revenue increased 4% to $342 million, with growth driven primarily by cycling products and advanced wearables. Our Connect IQ development platform is a strong differentiator for us, and we are deploying it across a broader range of Garmin devices. We recently held our fifth Annual Developer Conference, where we announced a partnership with Dexcom to deliver real-time glucose information via the Connect IQ app on selected smartwatches and cycling computers, even during activities. Fitness segment revenue has grown 26% year-to-date, and we are maintaining our revenue growth estimate of 17% for the year. 
Moving to outdoor. Revenue decreased 3% to $324 million. The decrease in revenue is due to the strong sell-in activity associated with the launch of our solar adventure watches in the prior year quarter and limited supplies of traditional handheld and dog products in the current quarter. During the quarter, we launched the APPROACH R10, our first portable golf monitor. The R10 can be used on course or at home to help golfers improve their game with more than a dozen key metrics shown in real time. Customers are very enthusiastic about the R10, and it's on its way to becoming another halo product for Garmin. Outdoor segment revenue has grown 26% year-to-date, and we are maintaining our growth estimate of 17% for the year. 
Looking next at Aviation. Revenue increased 19% to $180 million, with growth in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. During the quarter, we were ranked #1 in avionics product support by Aviation International News for the 18th consecutive year. Being consistently recognized for unrivaled support year after year clearly shows our strategic focus on taking care of customers and standing behind our products. We launched Smart Glide, a game-changing safety feature inspired by Autoland technology that will help pilots manage loss of engine power by automatically flying the optimal glide ratio and navigating to the best available airport. 
Also in the quarter, we announced the certification of the GFC 600H flight control system on the Bell 505 helicopter. This advanced autopilot includes state-of-the-art safety features, such as electronic stability control and a hover-assist mode. We are pleased with how the Aviation segment has recovered so far this year, and now expect full year revenue guidance to increase approximately 12%. 
Turning next to the Marine segment. Revenue increased 25% to $208 million, with growth across multiple categories, led by chartplotters. We continue to be recognized for innovation and achievements in the marine industry. For the seventh consecutive year, the National Marine Electronics Association named Garmin Manufacturer of the Year, and we also received 5 Product of Excellence awards. 
During the quarter, we introduced Surround View, the industry's first intelligent camera system that provides a 360-degree bird's eye view around the vessel. We also announced our partnership with Malibu Boats. Our 7-inch touchscreen displays will be standard equipment across the Malibu axis boat line, beginning with the 2022 model year. Given the strong year-to-date performance on the Marine segment, we are raising our revenue growth estimate to 30% over the year. 
And looking finally at auto, revenue increased 7% to $138 million, with growth primarily driven by OEM programs. During the quarter, we began production shipments of the BMW computing module from our Olathe, Kansas manufacturing facility, and we delivered prototypes of the next-generation BMW system from our new manufacturing facility located in Poland. 
We also recently announced a refreshed lineup of Drive Navigators for the consumer auto segment. These devices offer larger, higher-resolution displays as well as enhanced connected features. Given the strong year-to-date performance of the Auto segment, we are raising our revenue growth estimate to 17% for the year. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results and updated guidance. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, provide comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes, our updated guidance.

I'll begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results, provide comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes, our updated guidance. We posted revenue of $1,192,000,000 for the third quarter, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.4%, 180 basis point decrease compared to prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to higher freight costs. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 34.7%, 310 basis point increase to the prior quarter. Operating income was $283 million, 11% decrease. Operating margin was 23.7%, a [ 290 ] basis point decrease. Our GAAP EPS was $1.34. Pro forma EPS was $1.41. 
Next, with our third quarter revenue by segment. We have a highly diverse business model, provides a rich set of opportunities, reduce our reliance on single markets and product lines. In the third quarter, we achieved growth in 4 of our 5 segments, double-digit growth in both Marine and Aviation. Fitness is our largest segment, contributing 29% of the sales in the third quarter, followed by Outdoor at 27%. 
Moving to our revenue by geography. The Americas and EMEA regions grew 10% and 9%, respectively. The APAC region decreased 2%. The Americas region contributed nearly 1/2 of our revenue, the remaining coming from the EMEA and APAC regions. 
Looking next, operating expenses. Third quarter operating expenses increased by $62 million or 18%. Research and development increased $39 million year-over-year, primarily due to engineering personnel costs. SG&A increased $21 million compared to prior year quarter, primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses and information technology costs. Our advertising expense increased approximately $3 million due to higher media spend. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities worth $3.2 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially and year-over-year to $639 million. Inventory balance increased, both a sequential year-over-year basis, to $1.1 billion, primarily due to raw material requirements in preparation for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. During the third quarter 2021, we generated free cash flow of $204 million, a $32 million decrease compared to prior quarter. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $41 million. We expect full year 2021 free cash flow to be approximately $750 million, capital expenditures of approximately $325 million And a third quarter of 2021 for an effective tax rate of 5.9% compared to 6.9% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to impact to return provision adjustments, associated with filing the U.S. tax return. 
Turning next to our full year guidance. We estimate revenue of approximately $4.95 billion, increase of 18% for the prior year, double-digit growth in each of our segments. We expect gross margin to be approximately 58.2%, which is lower than our previous guidance, 58.5%, due to higher freight costs. We expect an operating margin of approximately 24%. Also, we expect the full year 2021 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 11.5%, which results in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $5.60. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Rachel, can you please open the line for Q&A?"
