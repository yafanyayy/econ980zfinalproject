Order trends have remained positive across the majority of our portfolio since September, and we had a strong finish to the year. Our year-over-year backlog is up 21% as a result of general recovery trends across the portfolio, a meaningful increase in the CFRE segment backlog and some recognition from our customers that raw material costs and supply chain constraints are becoming more challenging into 2021, driving preorders in some markets. 
Revenue at $1.8 billion was flat versus the comparable period. Adjusted segment operating margin at 17.1% was flat despite unfavorable revenue mix during the quarter. 
For the full year, revenue was down 6% and adjusted segment margin up to 16.7% as a result of structural cost savings, center-led strategic initiatives, tight cost controls offsetting the impact of fixed costs under [indiscernible]. As we discussed at length in Q3, we are driving towards a strong cash flow performance in the fourth quarter, and we got it, with full year free cash flow increasing 24% over 2019, achieving 14% of revenue. This is what we would expect to happen as we liquidate working capital in excess of lost profits impact, and as a result of efficiency gains from our back office consolidation program. 
With that backdrop, we look into 2021 with conservative optimism. Our order book is solid, albeit with a different mix as compared to last year, with DFRE having a material positive impact to the top and bottom line in '21. We are executing on many initiatives other than structural cost takeout that are expected to deliver margin improvements, which I'll cover later in the presentation. 
With that, we are initiating full year guidance of 5% to 6% organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $6.25 to $6.45. I'll not spend a lot of time on Slide 4, which is a more detailed overview of the results of the quarter. So let's move to Slide 5. 
Engineered Products revenue declined on lower shipments in CapEx levered markets such as industrial winches, waste handling equipment and vehicle services. ESG had a tough Q4 comparable to overcome and VSG was coming off a strong Q3, so the performance was largely expected, both have strong backlogs into 2021. And the Aerospace & Defense business had a strong quarter that ended a record year for the business, and demand in industrial automation has shown robust recovery contributing to our backlog as global auto sequentially ramps production. In Fueling Solutions, as we discussed at the end of Q3, the comparable benchmark for Q4 was tough. Despite the top line pressure, the segment posted another quarter of strong margin performance on lower volume as our as our productivity actions remain durable. 
We are beginning to see the mix benefits from our Helix and Anthem dispenser products, which we believe are winning in the marketplace. We completed the acquisition of Innovation Control Systems in the fourth quarter, which is a great addition to our vehicle launch platform. ICS is a leading supplier of access, payment and site management solutions and software, which fits into our strategy of driving long-term value from the large installed base of retail fuel sites, which we presented in October. 
Sales in Imaging & Identification declined 3% organically, the core market and coating business grew on continued healthy demand for consumables and improvement in demand for principal equipment, with particularly healthy activity in the United States. Digital textile printing CapEx remains slow, but we began seeing recovery in demand for consumables and small format machines, which are likely harbingers of conditions normalizing in 2021. Imaging & Identification is our highest gross margin segment. The marketing and coating business has delivered commendable margin performance this year holding the profit line virtually unchanged. However, decrementals and textile printing on lower volumes weighed on the segment margins in Q4 and during the full year, we expect this to begin reversing progressively into 2021. 
Pumps & Process Solutions returned to top line in the fourth quarter on strong growth in biopharma, medical and hygienic applications. We also began seeing cyclical recovery in industrial pumps which posted growth after several soft quarters. Compression components in aftermarket continued to be slow, but recent trends in natural gas and LNG markets gives us grounds for optimism going forward. 
The fourth quarter closed off a solid margin performance in this segment, with margins expanding 150 basis points in Q4 and 220 basis points for the full year. This was driven by broad-based productivity efforts, cost controls, favorable mix and well-timed capacity expansion in biopharma and medical, which we highlighted earlier in the year. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment posted 13% organic growth, with all businesses except Food Service Equipment delivering the increase. A significant portion of the growth came from the well advertised strength in can making. We are also very encouraged by activity in core food retail market, which grew organic top line at high single digits in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in the door case product line, where we saw double-digit growth for the full year. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in heat pumps and residential applications as well as refrigerated, transport and industrial applications like semiconductors and data centers. 
Margin performance effectively improved, supported by volume and actions we took in the middle of 2020. Absolute earnings increased 71% in the quarter over the comparable period. This margin before, coupled with the upcoming ramp-up of automated case line and food retail, positions us to deliver material margin expansion in 2021. 
I'll pass it to Brad here."

Our top line continued its recovery, with sequential improvement in organic revenue over Q3. Several of our businesses, including short-cycle industrial pumps and heat exchanges, returned to positive growth in the quarter, while biopharma, aerospace and defense, marketing and coding, food retail and can making continued their positive growth trajectory from prior quarters. 
FX benefited the top line by 2% or $34 million, driven principally by a strengthening of the euro against the dollar. Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by $12 million. We expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters. 
Revenue breakdown by geography reflects sequential improvement in each major geography, except -- with the exception of Asia. 
The U.S., our largest market, posted a 1% organic decline in the quarter, an improvement over the 4% decline in Q3 on progressively improving order rates and a strong quarter in biopharma, marking coding, food retail and can making, among others. Europe declined 3% organically, driven by retail fueling and a difficult comparable quarter in vehicle services, though partially offset by continued strength in several of our Pumps & Process Solutions businesses. 
All of Asia was down 11% organically, driven principally by China, which was down 16% organically. This result in China was not unexpected as we continue to face headwinds in retail fueling due to the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate. 
Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 2% organically, reflecting the continued momentum we see across our businesses. In the quarter, we saw organic growth in 4 out of our 5 segments. The fifth segment, fueling solutions, faced a difficult comparable quarter in the prior year, as previously discussed. Overall, our backlog is currently up approximately $300 million or 21% higher compared to this time last year, positioning us well as we enter 2021. 
Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide 7. We delivered improved sequential results in the quarter after a significant decline in Q2 and a recovery in Q3. On the top chart, adjusted segment EBIT and margin were both essentially flat year-over-year as we -- as continued productivity initiatives offset negative organic growth and dilutive impact of FX on margins. 
Going to the bottom chart, adjusted net earnings declined $1 million as higher taxes and corporate expense offset improved segment EBIT. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, was approximately 21.4% for the year compared to 21.5% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $8 million in the quarter and $22 million for the year, or approximately $4 million lower than in 2019. 
As we move into 2021, excluding the impact of discrete taxes, we expect the effective tax rate to remain essentially the same as 2020, at about 21.5%. Rightsizing and other costs were $21 million in the quarter, or $17 million after-tax, relating to several new permanent cost, containment initiatives and other items that we executed at the end of 2020. 
Now on Slide 8. We are pleased with the cash performance in 2020, with full year free cash flow of $939 million, a $181 million or 24% increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 21% of revenue for the fourth quarter, historically our highest cash flow quarter, and 14% for the full year, a significant increase over the prior year. The call of last quarter's -- last quarter's earnings call, we decided to prioritize prudent working capital management over fixed cost absorption to close out the year, and you can see the value delivered in our year-over-year working capital comparison. We have strong revenue visibility into Q1 and confidence in our team's ability to match industrial production with improved customer demand. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Rich."

Let me take a few moments to give you an update on our center-led initiatives that we outlined in our strategic plan in September of 2019. While we could have not expected but transpired in 2020, we posited at the time that our portfolio had through-cycle durability and that there were opportunities to drive synergies from our diverse portfolio to improve profitability over time. Despite this, we often hear a notion that Dover is a cost-out story, likely because we give measurable structural cost saving goals each year, implying a finite nature to such endeavor. 
There's a lot more than cost reductions to our improvement journey, and we continue to reinvest a portion of the savings, so we'll give you a short update on where we are on these strategic initiatives. 
True in 2019, we began with the rightsizing of our SG&A base after a significant portfolio change. This was necessary and required immediate intervention. Since then, the improvements have been driven by steady productivity and structural cost actions by our operating units, and from our investments in 4 core enterprise capabilities that generate very attractive return on investment and can be leveraged across the portfolio. The investments are substantial. By the end of this coming year, the headcount involved that center-led enterprise capabilities will have increased by over 50%. These are transformational initiatives touching every quarter of our global portfolio and delivering real results that you can see in our bottom line, and there is significant runway to drive value. We are investing in the following 4 enterprise capabilities, and I'll highlight a few results, but I would encourage you to review the stats in the slides. 
First, Dover Digital on Slide 10. This work began in 2017 and accelerate in 2018 with the opening of our Dover Digital Center in Boston. We have over 100 e-commerce connected product and software experts dedicated to this event. This team helps our business lever each commerce at scale and improve the customer journey with ease of doing business as well as back end efficiency for sales and order entry. For example, this year, we target to reach a run rate of $1 billion of revenue processed through digital channels much of which is service parts and catalog items compared to $100 million in 2019. This team also helps our business connect their products and enhance their offerings, which we'll progressively highlight in future presentations as we did for fueling solutions recently. 
This is a multiyear journey, value creation journey, and we are very excited about what lies ahead for our digital team. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our Operations Center of Excellence is a central team of domain knowledge experts that delivers health and safety, supply chain management, lean operations and advanced manufacturing and automation. This team is instrumental in driving value through rooftop consolidation and automation projects. 
As you know, we have a number of these in the works. We are also excited about the results of the early lean initiatives [indiscernible]. This is another multiyear journey that we continue -- we will continue to deliver results. 
Moving on to Slide 12 is our central back office system, which we call Dover Business Services. We've been at this for several years, and we're still in the early innings of expanding the scale and scope of this capability. By centralizing and offshoring transactional back office facilities, we multiply efficiency through scale, technology leverage and unit cost arbitrage. DBS is and will remain an integral part of our margin enhancement story. 
And lastly, moving to Slide 3. The India innovation center is more than 600 person strong team that our operating companies can leverage for product engineering, digital solutions development, data information management, research and development and intellectual property services. The scale and expertise of this team allows our operating companies to tap resources that would have been unaffordable to them as stand-alone companies. And allows for concurrent engineering on time-sensitive projects. 
So let's sum this up on Slide 14. We laid out 4 pillars of our strategy in 2019, and have been delivering through cycle. We have maintained our focus on margin improvement and continue to invest despite the economic difficulties of 2010. Our end market exposures, coupled with the strategic R&D investments we are delivering attractive growth profile. We are committed to reinvesting in our businesses as a top priority and capital allocation to maintain competitiveness, fuel growth and improve productivity. 
We are making good strides on the inorganic front. Finally, we're staying disciplined in our capital allocation by returning excess capital to our shareholders via growing dividends and share repurchases. 
Moving to 15, where does this leave us going into 2021? We believe that our playbook offers us a significant runway to continue delivering attractive through-cycle returns through mid-single-digit top line growth, steady margin expansion, healthy cash conversion and disciplined capital allocation and shareholder-friendly capital return posture. 
Okay. I'll step off the soapbox, and let's move on to 16. We expect demand in engineered products to rebound in 2021. We have seen strong bookings recently in vehicle services and industrial automation, with relevant automotive and vehicle usage statistics trending in the right direction. Bookings have also improved to retain in waste handling, and we are nearly fully booked for the first quarter. Municipal demand will remain uncertain, but we see strong trends in the parts and digital business. As we previewed in November, we expect fueling solutions to have a modest organic growth year. There is known headwind from EMV roll off in the U.S., but there are a number of positives [indiscernible]. We are encouraged by the prospects of our new Anthem user interface solution offering. We expect robust growth in our systems and software business, where we will be launching the industry-first cloud platform developed [indiscernible].  We also see good setup for vehicle wash and are excited about having ICs in our portfolio. We expect Imaging & Identification to perform well this year. Marketing & Coading saw a limited downside in 2020, and we've been on a good trajectory in recent quarters despite the tough comp in Q1 due to COVID-driven consumable stocking. This further improvement in services travel restriction subside and activity and serialization software is also firming up. The biggest factor in this segment is, of course, the digital textile printing unit. Our initial read is for the recovery to take place in the second half of the year, that printers will be ramping up production for 2020 apparel collections. 
Pumps & Process Solution is expected to have another solid year. We expect a robust growth in biopharma and hygienic applications, the continued recovery trend in industrial pumps, plastics and polymers is expected to deliver steady performance with a comparable basis to the second half bias to the second half. Precision components is likely to experience a slower start to the year, and we're still comping versus last year's first quarter, that saw robust upstream and downstream activity. 
And finally, we expect a very strong year in Refrigeration & Food Equipment. The core food retail business is operating with a strong backlog and the order trajectory has been healthy in the last few quarters. We expect retailers that have paused their remodel programs last year amidst the pandemic to restart these strategic initiatives, and we are well positioned to participate in that activity. Additionally, we see a good outlook for natural refrigerant systems, both in Europe and also in the U.S. California was the first state to recently mandate transition to natural refrigerant systems. 
We were the pioneers in the space, and we are very well positioned to capitalize on the sustainability trend in the industry. Belvac, as you know, is working through a record backlog and is booked for the year. Our heat exchanger business also exited 2020 with a record backlog instructive order trajectory across multiple verticals. This will result in material margin improvement in this segment on the back of the case production automation project, higher volumes, positive business mix. 
We've covered most of the items on the earlier slides, but I summarize them here in this slide for your reference. As usual, before I wrap up, I'd like to thank everyone at Dover for their work and continued perseverance during this last year. The Dover team has delivered strong results in its difficult conditions. I commend all of our employees were doing that part. And Andrey, with that, let's move on Q&A."

So the bad news is, we're going to have to deal with those constraints, and we're going to have to be on the front foot in terms of offsetting raw [indiscernible] in terms of whether it's either pricing or productivity. But I think that my comment about the backlog, it is influencing demand in the backlog because, I think, that there's beginning a recognition out there of, ""I've got to get my orders in because of these constraints."" I mean, it's -- look at what's going on in auto, just as a precursor to that. So I don't think it's bad in a way, and I don't think it's negative for us in terms of people placing orders in advance of raw material costs because, I think, that we've got some levers to pull there, and it's really short-cycle at the end of the day. The good news is, I think, to the extent that our backlogs go up from an S&OP process, we can plan more appropriately, and that drives efficiency at the factory level floor. So probably going to be a little bit of an interest in Q1, but I think, overall, it's not insurmountable."

But look, it's all built into the EPS forecast that we have there. Whatever the pullback of kind of -- let me -- let me answer you this way, right? We had coverage on furloughs, okay? So that was a positive this year because it deferred the cost of us having to take those people out to a certain extent. 
What we're going to bring back is going to be absorbed into industrial production in the revenue line. So net-net, that's an indifference. So what we're talking about is general SG&A, And the bigger movements there were T&E and incentive comps. So let's think positive for a moment, the incentive comp comes back, I think, T&E is going to come back. But is it going to reach 2019 levels? No."

Look, you know what, I think that the backlog is a good precursor for delivering the incremental margins that we're looking for from a segment point of view. Our expectation, it's the highest growth segment in our forecast right now. And I'd have to go back to look because it's a margin differential, but it's a material contributor to the EPS expansion. So to the extent the trend continues because this is a relatively short-cycle business, if I just talking about refrigeration now not Belvac. Belvac is booked for the year. So we get more orders for callback, it just gets pushed into 2022, frankly. So DFR, which is generally a short-cycle business, we're covered for Q1 and beginning to get coverage into Q2. Let's get Q1 under our belt before we start moving the number up. 
But it's -- a lot of the total profit change that we have baked into the EPS is coming from that segment. By the way, and the reason when you could say, well, it's not overly aggressive in terms of the conversion rate. Remember, that's one of our lower-margin businesses so that's going to bring down the consolidated conversion a little bit. We'll take it in terms of absolute profits."

We look at it more as in terms of its hierarchy in terms of return on invested capital in the cup and whether they are advantaged or disadvantaged structurally over the next time horizon."

I mean, we're expecting big things from the retail food business this year. For sure, a lot of the deferments that happened because of COVID access and a variety of other forces are clearly what's building the backlog into '21. But having said that, we've gone through a 4.5- to 5-year cycle where there hasn't been even, we would argue, replacement or maintenance spending in terms of food retail. So there is some pent-up demand there. We think that we have a more competitive product now. We're changing the cost structure of that product. 
And as we talked about before, our view is that what the customers really value in this business is being able to have the product available when they want it. And to the extent that now we've changed -- are changing the dynamic of our lead times, I think that's beginning to be reflected in our backlog. So this is expense. The management team of this business has spent 2.5 years, working real hard to transform this business. And our expectations in terms of profitability this year is material in terms of what's baked into our EPS."

So we're predicting FX in advance of 12 months and predicting mix over a wide diverse portfolio in terms of gross margin. So we need to give ourselves a little bit of latitude there. As I mentioned in the previous question before, the good news is that refrigeration is coming back and in terms of absolute profits, it's going to be material to the bottom line. That's not really great in terms of consolidated conversion margin just because of the of the EBIT margin of that particular business. So if you go back to the question, I think, that was just asked before, well, could that revenue be higher? Are we at an inflection point because there's really going to be -- and we're under forecasting refrigeration for the year. In a way, I hope we are. What that's going to do is push up the top line, but it's going to draw down the conversion margin, but we'll take the absolute profit. So it's our best guess right now. I guess, at the beginning of the year, we like to give us some latitude. I think that the history around here has been to try to hit the top, and we've caught every intention of trying to do so."

Order trends have remained positive across the majority of our portfolio since September, and we had a strong finish to the year. Our year-over-year backlog is up 21% as a result of general recovery trends across the portfolio, a meaningful increase in the DRFE segment backlog and some recognition from our customers that raw material costs and supply chain constraints are becoming more challenging into 2021, driving preorders in some markets.
Revenue at $1.8 billion was flat versus the comparable period. Adjusted segment operating margin at 17.1% was flat despite unfavorable revenue mix during the quarter. For the full year, revenue was down 6% and adjusted segment margin up to 16.7% as a result of structural cost savings, center-led strategic initiatives, tight cost controls offsetting the impact of fixed costs under absorption.
As we discussed at length in Q3, we are driving towards a strong cash flow performance in the fourth quarter, and we got it, with full year free cash flow increasing 24% over 2019, achieving 14% of revenue. This is what we would expect to happen as we liquidate working capital in excess of lost profits impact, and as a result of efficiency gains from our back office consolidation program.
With that backdrop, we look into 2021 with conservative optimism. Our order book is solid, albeit with a different mix as compared to last year, with DRFE having a material positive impact to the top and bottom line in '21. We are executing on many initiatives other than structural cost takeout that are expected to deliver margin improvements, which I'll cover later in the presentation.
With that, we are initiating full year guidance of 5% to 6% organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $6.25 to $6.45. I'll not spend a lot of time on Slide 4, which is a more detailed overview of the results of the quarter. So let's move to Slide 5. 
Engineered Products revenue declined on lower shipments in CapEx levered markets such as industrial winches, waste handling equipment and vehicle services. ESG had a tough Q4 comparable to overcome and VSG was coming off a strong Q3, so the performance was largely expected, both have strong backlogs into 2021. The Aerospace & Defense business had a strong quarter that ended a record year for the business, and demand in industrial automation has shown robust recovery contributing to our backlog as global auto sequentially ramps production.
In Fueling Solutions, as we discussed at the end of Q3, the comparable benchmark for Q4 was tough. Despite the top line pressure, the segment posted another quarter of strong margin performance on lower volume as our as our productivity actions remain durable.
We are beginning to see the mix benefits from our Helix and Anthem dispenser products, which we believe are winning in the marketplace. We completed the acquisition of Innovation Control Systems in the fourth quarter, which is a great addition to our vehicle launch platform. ICS is a leading supplier of access, payment and site management solutions and software, which fits into our strategy of driving long-term value from the large installed base of retail fuel sites, which we presented in October.
Sales in Imaging & Identification declined 3% organically. The core Marking & Coding business grew on continued healthy demand for consumables and improvement in demand for principal equipment, with particularly healthy activity in the United States. Digital textile printing CapEx remains slow, but we will begin seeing recovery in demand for consumables and small format machines, which are likely harbingers of conditions normalizing in 2021.
Imaging & Identification is our highest gross margin segment. The Marking & Coding business has delivered commendable margin performance this year holding the profit line virtually unchanged. However, decrementals in textile printing on lower volumes weighed on the segment margins in Q4 and during the full year. We expect this to begin reversing progressively into 2021.
Pumps & Process Solutions returned to top line in the fourth quarter on strong growth in biopharma, medical and hygienic applications. We also began seeing cyclical recovery in industrial pumps which posted growth after several soft quarters. Compression components in aftermarket continued to be slow, but recent trends in natural gas and LNG markets gives us grounds for optimism going forward.
The fourth quarter closed off a solid margin performance in this segment, with margins expanding 150 basis points in Q4 and 220 basis points for the full year. This was driven by broad-based productivity efforts, cost controls, favorable mix and well-timed capacity expansion in biopharma and medical, which we highlighted earlier in the year.
Refrigeration & Food Equipment posted 13% organic growth, with all businesses except Food Service Equipment delivering the increase. A significant portion of the growth came from the well advertised strength in can making. We are also very encouraged by activity in core food retail market, which grew organic top line at high single digits in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in the door case product line, where we saw double-digit growth for the full year. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in heat pumps and residential applications as well as refrigerated, transport and industrial applications like semiconductors and data centers.
Margin performance effectively improved, supported by volume and actions we took in the middle of 2020. Absolute earnings increased 71% in the quarter over the comparable period. This margin performance, coupled with the upcoming ramp-up of automated case line and food retail, positions us to deliver material margin expansion in 2021.
I'll pass it to Brad here."

Our top line continued its recovery, with sequential improvement in organic revenue over Q3. Several of our businesses, including short-cycle industrial pumps and heat exchanges, returned to positive growth in the quarter, while biopharma, aerospace and defense, marking & coding, food retail and can making continued their positive growth trajectory from prior quarters.
FX benefited the top line by 2% or $34 million, driven principally by a strengthening of the euro against the dollar. Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by $12 million. We expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters. The revenue breakdown by geography reflects sequential improvement in each major geography, except -- with the exception of Asia. 
The U.S., our largest market, posted a 1% organic decline in the quarter, an improvement over the 4% decline in Q3 on progressively improving order rates and a strong quarter in biopharma, marking & coding, food retail and can making, among others. Europe declined 3% organically, driven by retail fueling and a difficult comparable quarter in vehicle services, though partially offset by continued strength in several of our Pumps & Process Solutions businesses.
All of Asia was down 11% organically, driven principally by China, which was down 16% organically. This result in China was not unexpected as we continue to face headwinds in retail fueling due to the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate.
Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 2% organically, reflecting the continued momentum we see across our businesses. In the quarter, we saw organic growth in 4 out of our 5 segments. The fifth segment, Fueling Solutions, faced a difficult comparable quarter in the prior year, as previously discussed. Overall, our backlog is currently up approximately $300 million or 21% higher compared to this time last year, positioning us well as we enter 2021.
Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide 7. We delivered improved sequential results in the quarter after a significant decline in Q2 and a recovery in Q3. On the top chart, adjusted segment EBIT and margin were both essentially flat year-over-year as we -- as continued productivity initiatives offset negative organic growth and dilutive impact of FX on margins.
Going to the bottom chart, adjusted net earnings declined $1 million as higher taxes and corporate expense offset improved segment EBIT. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, was approximately 21.4% for the year compared to 21.5% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $8 million in the quarter and $22 million for the year, or approximately $4 million lower than in 2019. 
As we move into 2021, excluding the impact of discrete taxes, we expect the effective tax rate to remain essentially the same as 2020 at about 21.5%. Rightsizing and other costs were $21 million in the quarter, or $17 million after tax, relating to several new permanent cost containment initiatives and other items that we executed at the end of 2020.
Now on Slide 8. We are pleased with the cash performance in 2020, with full year free cash flow of $939 million, a $181 million or 24% increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 21% of revenue for the fourth quarter, historically our highest cash flow quarter, and 14% for the full year, a significant increase over the prior year. The call of last quarter's earnings call, we decided to prioritize prudent working capital management over fixed cost absorption to close out the year, and you can see the value delivered in our year-over-year working capital comparison. We have strong revenue visibility into Q1 and confidence in our team's ability to match industrial production with improved customer demand.
With that, I'll turn it back to Rich."

Let me take a few moments to give you an update on our center-led initiatives that we outlined in our strategic plan in September of 2019. While we could have not expected but transpired in 2020, we posited at the time that our portfolio had through-cycle durability and that there were opportunities to drive synergies from our diverse portfolio to improve profitability over time. Despite this, we often hear a notion that Dover is a cost-out story, likely because we give measurable, structural cost saving goals each year, implying a finite nature to such endeavor.
There's a lot more than cost reductions to our improvement journey, and we continue to reinvest a portion of the savings, so we'll give you a short update on where we are on these strategic initiatives.
True in 2019, we began with the rightsizing of our SG&A base after a significant portfolio change. This was necessary and required immediate intervention. Since then, the improvements have been driven by steady productivity and structural cost actions by our operating units, and from our investments in 4 core enterprise capabilities that generate very attractive return on investment and can be leveraged across the portfolio. The investments are substantial. By the end of this coming year, the headcount involved at center-led enterprise capabilities will have increased by over 50%. These are transformational initiatives touching every corner of our global portfolio and delivering real results that you can see in our bottom line, and there is significant runway to drive value. We are investing in the following 4 enterprise capabilities, and I'll highlight a few results, but I would encourage you to review the stats in the slides.
First, Dover Digital on Slide 10. This work began in 2017 and accelerated in 2018 with the opening of our Dover Digital Center in Boston. We have over 100 e-commerce connected product and software experts dedicated to this event. This team helps our business lever each commerce at scale and improve the customer journey with ease of doing business as well as back-end efficiency for sales and order entry. For example, this year, we target to reach a run rate of $1 billion of revenue processed through digital channels, much of which is service parts and catalog items compared to $100 million in 2019. This team also helps a business connect their products and enhance their offerings, which we'll progressively highlight in future presentations as we did for Fueling Solutions recently. This is a multiyear journey, value creation journey, and we are very excited about what lies ahead for our digital team.
Moving to Slide 11. Our Operations Center of Excellence is a central team of domain knowledge experts that delivers health and safety, supply chain management, lean operations and advanced manufacturing and automation. This team is instrumental in driving value through rooftop consolidation and automation projects. As you know, we have a number of these in the works. We are also excited about the results of the early lean initiatives this team is spearheading. This is another multiyear journey that we continue -- we will continue to deliver results.
Moving on to Slide 12 is our central back office system, which we call Dover Business Services. We've been at this for several years, and we're still in the early innings of expanding the scale and scope of this capability. By centralizing and offshoring transactional back-office facilities, we multiply efficiency through scale, technology leverage and unit cost arbitrage. DBS is and will remain an integral part of our margin enhancement story.
And lastly, moving to Slide 13, the India innovation center is more than 600-person strong team that our operating companies can leverage for product engineering, digital solutions development, data information management, research and development and intellectual property services. The scale and expertise of this team allows our operating companies to tap resources that would have been unaffordable to them as stand-alone companies and allows for concurrent engineering on time-sensitive projects.
So let's sum this up on Slide 14. We laid out 4 pillars of our strategy in 2019, and have been delivering through cycle. We have maintained our focus on margin improvement and continue to invest despite the economic difficulties of 2020. Our end market exposures, coupled with the strategic R&D investments, are delivering attractive growth profile. We are committed to reinvesting in our businesses as a top priority and capital allocation to maintain competitiveness, fuel growth and improve productivity. We are making good strides on the inorganic front. Finally, we're staying disciplined in our capital allocation by returning excess capital to our shareholders while growing dividends and share repurchases.
Moving to 15, where does this leave us going into 2021? We believe that our playbook offers us a significant runway to continue delivering attractive through-cycle returns through mid-single-digit top line growth, steady margin expansion, healthy cash conversion and disciplined capital allocation and shareholder-friendly capital return posture.
Okay. I'll step off the soapbox, and let's move on to 16. We expect demand in engineered products to rebound in 2021. We have seen strong bookings recently in vehicle services and industrial automation, with relevant automotive and vehicle usage statistics trending in the right direction. Bookings have also improved to retain in waste handling, and we are nearly fully booked for the first quarter. Municipal demand will remain uncertain, but we see strong trends in the parts and digital business.
As we previewed in November, we expect Fueling Solutions to have a modest organic growth year. There is known headwind from EMV roll off in the U.S., but there are a number of positives also. We are encouraged by the prospects of our new Anthem user interface solution offering. We expect robust growth in our systems and software business, where we will be launching the industry-first cloud platform developed with Microsoft. We also see good setup for vehicle wash and are excited about having ICS in our portfolio.
We expect Imaging & Identification to perform well this year. Marking & Coding saw a limited downside in 2020, and we've been on a good trajectory in recent quarters despite the tough comp in Q1 due to COVID-driven consumable stocking. We expect further improvement in services as travel restriction subside and activity in serialization software is also firming up. The biggest factor in this segment is, of course, the digital textile printing unit. Our initial read is for the recovery to take place in the second half of the year when printers will be ramping up production for 2020 apparel collections.
Pumps & Process Solutions is expected to have another solid year. We expect a robust growth in biopharma and hygienic applications and a continued recovery trend in industrial pumps. Plastics and polymers is expected to deliver steady performance with a comparable basis to the second half -- biased to the second half. Precision components is likely to experience a slower start to the year, and we're still comping versus last year's first quarter that saw robust upstream and downstream activity.
And finally, we expect a very strong year in Refrigeration & Food Equipment. The core food retail business is operating with a strong backlog and the order trajectory has been healthy in the last few quarters. We expect retailers that have paused their remodel programs last year amidst the pandemic to restart these strategic initiatives, and we are well positioned to participate in that activity. Additionally, we see a good outlook for natural refrigerant systems, both in Europe and also in the U.S., where California was the first state to recently mandate transition to natural refrigerant systems.
We were the pioneers in the space, and we are very well positioned to capitalize on the sustainability trend in the industry. Belvac, as you know, is working through a record backlog and is booked for the year. Our heat exchanger business also exited 2020 with a record backlog and a constructive order trajectory across multiple verticals. This will result in material margin improvement in this segment on the back of the case production automation project, higher volumes, positive business mix.
We've covered most of the items on the earlier slides, but I'll summarize them here on this slide for your reference. As usual, before I wrap up, I'd like to thank everyone at Dover for their work and continued perseverance during this last year. The Dover team has delivered strong results in its difficult conditions, and I commend all of our employees for doing that part.
And Andrey, with that, let's move on to Q&A."

Raw material prices are moving up. And there is a lot of constraint in logistics right now. I think that it's been going on somewhat through the fourth quarter. And it looks to be getting tighter going into the first quarter as economic activity moves up. So the bad news is, we're going to have to deal with those constraints, and we're going to have to be on the front foot in terms of offsetting the raw materials in terms of whether it's either pricing or productivity.
But I think that my comment about the backlog, it is influencing demand in the backlog because, I think, that there's beginning a recognition out there of, ""I've got to get my orders in because of these constraints."" I mean, it's -- look at what's going on in auto, just as a precursor to that. So I don't think it's bad in a way, and I don't think it's negative for us in terms of people placing orders in advance of raw material costs because, I think, that we've got some levers to pull there, and it's really short-cycle at the end of the day. The good news is, I think, to the extent that our backlogs go up from an S&OP process, so we can plan more appropriately, and that drives efficiency at the factory level floor. So probably going to be a little bit of an interest in Q1, but I think, overall, it's not insurmountable."

And then the 11% to 13% of revenue in free cash flow in a year where I'll be growing pretty strongly. So basically, you should see some headwind. It shouldn't be like a gray cash year, for example. I think, back in 2019, in the fall, you said 25% to 30% incrementals and 8% to 12% free cash as a percentage of sales.

But -- so I don't want to take the number down right now or say it's an anomaly, but experience would say that it's probably a little bit high."

So that was a positive this year because it deferred the cost of us having to take those people out to a certain extent.
What we're going to bring back is going to be absorbed into industrial production in the revenue line. So net-net, that's an indifference. So what we're talking about is general SG&A, And the bigger movements there were T&E and incentive comps.

Look, you know what, I think that the backlog is a good precursor for delivering the incremental margins that we're looking for from a segment point of view. Our expectation, it's the highest growth segment in our forecast right now. And I'd have to go back to look because it's a margin differential, but it's a material contributor to the EPS expansion. So to the extent the trend continues because this is a relatively short-cycle business, if I -- just talking about refrigeration now, not Belvac. Belvac is booked for the year.
So if we get more orders for callback, it just gets pushed into 2022 quite frankly. So DFR, which is generally a short-cycle business, we're covered for Q1 and beginning to get coverage into Q2. Let's get Q1 under our belt before we start moving the number up.
But it's -- a lot of the total profit change that we have baked into the EPS is coming from that segment. By the way, and the reason one -- you could say, well, it's not overly aggressive in terms of the conversion rate, remember, that's one of our lower-margin businesses, so that's going to bring down the consolidated conversion a little bit.

We have businesses like our industrial pumps business that sells through stocking distributors. Our early read here in January is there's an amount of restocking going on because our backlogs and the industrial businesses there are building the same thing with material handling. Those backlogs are building. So I think it's fair to say that everybody was very prudent in terms of inventories on the distribution side.
In '20, they -- now everybody is trying to make 2 calls. What is economic activity going to be in '21? And the second thing I mentioned of, if there are going to be supply constraints as everybody ramps sequentially? Do I got to get in the front foot and get my orders in because there's a potential that some of those deliveries are going to be delayed outside of the quarter. So there's really 2 of those phenomenon going on. Do I think that they're severely under stock? No. But I think that, by and large, our stocking distributors are going to stock based on what they think that the revenue is going to be and -- which is built into our forecast."

So let's discuss why, right? The Engineered Products is going to be slightly lower just because of the gross margin within that segment. And despite the fact that DRFE has lower gross margins at the segmental level, the revenue growth there is so high that you're getting a pretty big impact in terms of absorption benefit year-over-year.
So, now, having said that, we do have structural cost savings that are rolling through at the same time, and that depends segment by segment. But I think that my comments here are -- I think you've got your finger on it for DFS because it's a relatively low growth environment, and it is a little bit negative because of the mix, but we think that we can make that up in terms of productivity.

So there is some pent-up demand there. We think that we have a more competitive product now. We're changing the cost structure of that product.
And as we talked about before, our view is that what the customers really value in this business is being able to have the product available when they want it. And to the extent that now we've changed, are changing the dynamic of our lead times, I think that's beginning to be reflected in our backlog.

So we're predicting FX in advance of 12 months and we're predicting mix over a wide, diverse portfolio in terms of gross margin. So we need to give ourselves a little bit of latitude there.
As I mentioned in a previous question before, the good news is that refrigeration is coming back and in terms of absolute profits, it's going to be material to the bottom line. That's not really great in terms of consolidated conversion margin just because of the EBIT margin of that particular business. So if you go back to the question, I think, that was just asked before, well, could that revenue be higher?
Are we at an inflection point because there's really going to be -- and we're under forecasting refrigeration for the year. In a way, I hope we are. What that's going to do is push up the top line, but it's going to draw down the conversion margin, but we'll take the absolute profit. So it's our best guess right now. I guess, at the beginning of the year, we'd like to give it some latitude. I think that the history around here has been to try to hit the top, and we've got every intention of trying to do so."

So let's move to Page 3. The business challenge moving into Q1 was twofold for Dover. First, we exited 2020 with a healthy backlog of business which we needed to operationally deliver against. Second, we had -- we're closely with our distributors and customers to seize opportunities in the marketplace despite a complex set of challenges with raw materials, components, logistics and labor availability. We are pleased with our first quarter performance on both counts, which is reflected in our robust revenue growth and the increase in our order backlog as we move into Q2. 
Let's take a look at the metrics. Total revenue was up 13%, 9% organic to the comparable period. Clearly, the quarter benefit from a good [ order backlog ] position and the willingness of the cannels to receive product deliveries as market demand accelerated, resulting in the highest volume quarter since 2014 and largest first quarter volume since 2012 for the company. 
This performance is a clear indication that our product portfolio is attractive and often underappreciated growth avenues and that the work that we have done on operational excellence is gaining traction. 
Order rates outpaced revenue in the quarter, posting bookings of $2.3 billion, a 27% comparable organic increase. The growth was broad-based with all 5 segments contributing to the increase. This resulted in a seasonally high backlog of $2.2 billion, an increase of 39%. 
Since our earnings are issued among the first in the industrial sector, I suppose it's on us to explain the drivers of growth and their impact on seasonality and full year demand, try to be careful with my choice of terms and comments not to cast unwarranted shade on a clearly positive market demand environment. There are several factors driving healthy customer activity. including pent-up demand from last year as a result of low starting channel inventories in certain sectors. 
As I also mentioned in my opening remarks, this was further influenced by tight supply chains and materials inflation, positively contributing to seasonal demand and backlog build as our customers and channels position themselves to meet their forecasted demand. Importantly, before we get all wound up trying to quantify the impact of channel inventory stocking and inflationary prebuy and how it impacts quarterly demand, let's not lose sight of the fact that total marketplace demand is robust, which is reflected in our backlog and which also leads us to revise our revenue growth guidance upward for the full year to 10% to 12%. 
So put succinctly, it's not prebuy if we don't remove it from the full year revenue estimates. Still early in the year, we will continue to produce to meet customer demand and watch our backlog and order patterns carry. 
We have more color on the drivers of demand and our revenue performance, including contribution of market share gains as we progress through the year. For now, we are focused on executing operationally and demanding conditions to win in the marketplace, but we clearly believe that favorable demand conditions remain durable through the year. 
Let's move to profitability. Q1 was solid with consolidated adjusted segment margin at 19.1%, 320 basis points higher versus the comparable quarter. This was supported by strong volumes, favorable mix of products delivered, positive pricing for continued operational discipline and efficiency initiatives, which more than offset input cost headwinds. 
Strong profitability and continued focus on working capital management resulted in seasonally strong free cash flow, which was up $110 million compared to last year's first quarter or the comparable period. 
With the solid Q1 under our belt, we look at the remainder of 2020 with constructive optimism. Strong order trends and a record backlog portend a robust top line outlook. And we have confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges. 
With that, we are raising our guidance for the year to 10% to 12%, all-in revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $6.75 to $6.85 per share, a substantial step-up compared to our prior guidance. 
I will skip Slide 4, which provides a more detailed overview of our results for the first quarter. So let's move to Slide 5. Engineered Products revenue was up 2% organically as demand conditions improved modestly the comparable period. 
Vehicle Services entered the year with a strong order book and faced solid demand across all geographies and product lines. industrial automation grew on automotive recovery and channel restocking and aerospace and defense shipments were solid. The business remains booked well into the second half of the year. As expected, waste hauling was down year-over-year given a lower starting backlog entering Q1, which was further impacted by component availability issues that constrained shipments in the quarter. 
We have forecasted this business to be levered towards H2 and order trends of backlog reflect that. Same dynamic for industrial winches with revenue down in the quarter [indiscernible] recovery in order rates, we expect a continued gradual recovery in this business over the year. 
Margin performance in the quarter was flat year-over-year as volume leverage and pricing offset the negative fixed cost absorption in the capital goods portion of the portfolio. 
Fueling Solutions is up 3% organically in the quarter on the strength of North American retail fueling as well as our software and systems business in. Activity in China remains subdued. Order backlogs are up 13%, and we expect our hanging hardware, vehicle wash and compliance-driven underground product offerings to contribute positively due to an increase in miles driven and construction seasonality as we make our way through the year. 
The segment posted another quarter of strong margin performance on higher volumes, productivity actions and mix, which is a continuation of the trajectory that we exited in '20. 
Sales in Imaging &  Identification improved 4% organically. The core marking and coding business grew well on strong printer and services demand in North America and Asia. It was partially offset by a decline in consumables against the comparable quarter where customers stocked up on inks at the onset of the pandemic. 
We also saw a nice pickup in serialization software sales. iTextile printer sales remained soft as global apparel and retail remains impacted by COVID. Ink consumable volumes were up as we significantly improved ink attachment rates, and we saw encouraging improvement in the pipeline in new printer sales as the quarter progressed. 
Margins improved slightly in the segment on higher volumes, and we were able to offset material cost inflation with strategic pricing during the quarter. Pumps & Process Solutions posted 18% organic growth in the quarter on improved volumes across all businesses, except Precision Components. Order rates and shipments for biopharma connectors and pumps continue to be strong. Industrial pumps had a solid quarter, driven by improved end market conditions and distributor demand. and polymer processing shipments grew year-over-year on robust demand in Asia and the U.S. 
Precision Components was down in the quarter, though demand conditions stabilized in hydrodynamic bearings and compression parts as well as broadly in China through new OEM builds remain impacted. 
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded by 890 basis points on strong volume, favorable mix and pricing. This team has moved this segment to best-in-class top line and bottom line metrics through a dedication to operational excellence, robust product development and innovation management and proactive and purposeful inorganic actions. It's a world-class collection of assets that we will continue to invest behind. 
Refrigeration & Food Equipment continued its solid momentum from the second half of last year, posting 18% organic growth. Revenue and new orders in beverage can making more than doubled year-over-year. Food retail saw broad-based increases across its product lines as key retailers resumed capital investment in programs Plus we've seen good demand for some of our new product introductions and customer wins. 
Our natural refrigerant systems business, in particular, experienced robust demand in Europe in the U.S. as customers are adopting more environmentally friendly solutions. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in Asia and Europe across all end markets. Food service equipment was down in the quarter but saw stabilization in chain restaurant demand. 
Despite operational challenges in food retail due to availability issues with insulation raw materials, adjusted margin performance improved by 450 basis points supported by stronger volumes, productivity initiatives and cost actions we took in the middle of 2020, partially offset by input cost inflation. I'll pass it to Brad from here."

Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. On the top is the revenue bridge. Our top line benefited from organic growth across all 5 segments, with particular strength in Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments. 
FX benefited top line by 3% or $51 million. Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by $15 million. 
We expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters. The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North America, Europe and Asia, our 3 largest geographic regions. 
The U.S., our largest market, posted 7% organic growth in the quarter on solid order rates in retail fueling, marking and coding, biopharma connectors food, retail and can making, among others, and was partially offset by delayed shipments in waste filling. 
Europe grew by 13% in the quarter on strong shipments in vehicle aftermarket, biopharma industrial pumps and heat exchangers. All of Asia returned to growth and was up 20% organically, driven by China, which was up 60% against the COVID impacted comparable quarter in the prior year. 
Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 27% organically, reflecting the continued broad-based momentum we are seeing across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic bookings growth across all 5 segments. 
Overall, our backlog is currently up $626 million or 39% versus this time last year. positioning us well for the remainder of the year. 
Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide 7. On the top of the chart, adjusted segment EBIT was up nearly $100 million on margin improvement -- margin improved several hundred basis points as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset input cost inflation. 
Going to the bottom of the chart. Adjusted net earnings improved by $60 million as higher segment EBIT more than offset higher taxes as well as higher corporate expenses, primarily related to compensation accruals and deal expenses. 
The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, was approximately $21.7 million for the quarter compared to 21.5% in the prior year. 
Discrete tax benefits were $6 million in the quarter or approximately $3 million lower than in 2020. Rightsizing and other costs were $4 million in the quarter or $3 million after tax. 
Now on Slide 8. We are pleased with the cash flow performance in the first quarter with free cash flow of $146 million or $110 million increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 8% of revenue in the first quarter, which is historically our lowest cash flow quarter due to seasonality of our production.

We expect demand in Engineered Products to improve sequentially through the remainder of the year, which is supported by a robust backlog. We continue to see strong results strong bookings trends in vehicle services and industrial automation. 
Aerospace spent a significant revenue visibility through its government programs and is booked well into the second half of the year. Order rates and waste handling improved significantly during the first quarter, though the shipment schedule will be levered towards the second half, and we are watching the supply chain here closely, which is a stabilized and expect gradual recovery through the second half of the year. 
As communicated at our investor meeting in November, we expect fueling solutions to post modern organic growth for the year. There was a known headwind from EMV roll-off in the U.S., but order trends support a number of positives offsetting it, including growth in systems and software, recovery in underground businesses and growth in vehicle wash. We also expect that Asia, in China, in particular, should stabilize and become a net positive for us in the second half. The ICS acquisition, which we closed at the end of last year, is off to a very good start as vehicle wash market is recovering healthily. 
Imaging & ID is expected to perform well this year. Our core marking and coding business a stalwarts in 2020 is expected to continue to deliver low to mid-single-digit growth with services and serialization products positively impacting performance. 
Digital textile printing remained slow, although we saw a year-over-year improvement in ink tonnage sales in Q1 as we continue executing our strategy to attach consumables to machine sales. We expect recovery here in the second half. 
Pumps & Process Solutions should have another solid Demand for biopharma and hygienic applications remains robust, and trading conditions in industrial pumps rebounded quickly in the first quarter and momentum should continue. Our recent investments in biopharma capacity [indiscernible] and we are well positioned to continue capitalizing on the secular growth story. 
Plastics and polymers is expected to deliver steady performance as a global shortage of plastic and rubber as well as petrochemical investments are driving increased investment in processing plants. 
Precision Components have stabilized, and we expect it to contribute to year-over-year growth beginning in the second half of the year. 
With its large backlog and high order rates, Refrigeration & Food Equipment is expected to have a strong year. New orders in the core food retail businesses have been healthy in the last few quarters as retailers that had paused their remodel programs last year amidst the pandemic are restarting these strategic initiatives. 
Additionally, we are capitalizing on our leadership position In natural refrigerant systems, both in Europe and also in the U.S., where we believe the recent mandate in California [indiscernible] among the other 49 states to mandate the transition to more environmentally friendly solutions. 
We also see good growth in our specialty product line and small-format customer segment. Belvac continues to work through a record backlog and had another significant bookings quarter in Q1, they are booked for the year. 
Our heat exchanger business is seeing strong order rates across all verticals and geographies. We are investing in capacity and new capabilities in these 2 businesses and are well positioned to capture growth. 
Demand has stabilized in foodservice equipment at restaurant chains, and we expect the institutional business to recover in the second half  as students return to schools and traffic improves at stadiums and hotels. 
Our revised annual guidance is on Page 10. We covered the most pertinent of these items on earlier the slides, and we've summarized them here for your reference. 
Finally, on Slide 11, puts expected 2021 performance in a multiyear perspective. Our 2019 investor presentation, we highlighted how the changes to Dover's portfolio over the prior decade shaped a less cyclical business, provided attractive through-cycle returns. 
2020 was proof of lower top line cyclicality in a demanding environment and our ability to protect profitability. Operational excellence and operating margin expansion has been our priority over the last couple of years and that we are on track to deliver more than 100 basis points of average margin expansion over that period. And we have the playbook and tools for this to continue. Dover is positioned to deliver attractive double-digit EPS growth in line with our long-term corporate targets communicated in 2019. 
 Before wrapping up, I'd like to thank everyone at Dover for their hard work delivering these results and their continued perseverance. And that's the end of the presentation. So Andre, we can open it up for"

The kind of rest of the year guidance, I just wanted to kind of get an idea of -- you mentioned there are these kind of like. I think there were bookings tailwinds this quarter but not necessarily revenue tailwinds. 
But when I look at kind of the rest of the year, just kind of simply divide the rest of the year guide quarterly, just to get to a quarterly number. And keeping in mind the first quarter is usually like a pretty low number seasonally. It seems like sequentially to the rest of the year, quarterly that you have EPS, EBIT kind of softening and actually down sequentially and sales basically kind of flattish for the rest of the year, just on a quarterly kind of simple quarterly divide it by 3, rest of the year divided by 3. 
So what's -- is there something like fundamental that will drop off other than EMV. I mean you mentioned a lot of these businesses have a second half that actually looks pretty good. And anything we're missing on this front?"
174901,711123596,2253796,"Dover Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2021",2021-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","No. Look, I mean at the end of the day, Q1 was stronger than we expected. So I think that we're quite pleased in our ability to pivot operationally to get the product out the door.

So I think that we're quite pleased in our ability to pivot operationally to get the product out the door. 
I think that there were probably being arguably conservative to get another quarter under our belt to see how much of that backlog and demand is being influenced by channel restocking and trying to get in front of raw material perceived price increases in the future. 
And I'm not entirely clear right now how much of Q1 overperformance was taken from Q2, which is seasonally when we kind of ramp. So it's usually a low Q1, big move in Q2, Q3 and then kind of run for cash in Q4, whether we were where that -- You just can't do the math and say, well, historically, it's been this percentage of revenue and operating profit, and this is what the seasonality is. And if I take Q1 as a proxy and I run my spreadsheet, it kicks out an extraordinarily high number both on the revenue side and the operating margin side. 
So from the revenue side, I think fair enough, we may be a little conservative. We'd like to see our bookings go through Q2. I'll tell you, sitting here in April, that it's not deteriorating, which is a good news. So that portends a pretty decent Q3 that we've got coming up. But we'd like to see how that develops over time? Because make no mistake, there's a couple of things here. 
Operationally, it is getting kind of difficult out there in terms of sourcing raw materials, labor availability, a variety of different things out there. We had some headwinds in the first quarter, but I'd tell you that operationally, we plowed through. We're not out of the woods yet. Right now, we missed shipments in both ESG and into -- in retail refrigeration because of component availability. 
I don't really know yet whether that's going to get better or worse. My final comment, and I know this is a long answer, but you're at the head of the line, and this is going to be the question we knew we were going to get is from a margin point of view, and I think that I discussed this at the end of '20, the incremental margin expectation for Q2 because the comp is so good has been overstated on margin because of our ability to use mechanisms that were subsidized by the government, meaning we could take production people off of our payroll because we had subsidies in place to account for it. 
So you actually have a snapback of costs. Now we're in pretty good shape because our revenue is up so much. So we should be able to absorb it. But I think by and large, what I've seen that there is an expectation in industrial world where the incremental in Q2 margin performance is a lot higher than we would expect. 
The second answer on the margin performance of the balance of the year is we really expect to accelerate in refrigeration over the balance of the year. So we've got this big backlog. It's up to us to get it out. So the -- out of the growth that we expect in the balance of the year, a lot more of that growth is going to -- from refrigeration than it was in Q1. And as you know, that is so to margins as we go forward. So I would caution you not to take Q1 incremental margins and just multiply it by 3."

In Q1 of '21, the 20, I guess, is earlier in reach than even we had been modeling it in the past. Now that is going to be -- I'm not going to give this big mix discussion again. 
I guess over the balance of the year -- so number one, the answer is we're going to get to 20 earlier than we thought based on current trajectory. So what that means, I'm not putting a target out there yet. 
We'll give you 1 maybe in Q3. What we are going to fight against between now and the end of the year, we've discussed the mix impact on margins is inflationary input costs between raw materials, labor and price/cost. 
We -- as we discussed at the end of 2020, we were on the front foot in terms of getting price out there. So think about it in terms of inventory change. The inflation on the raw materials was not in our inventory. So you get positive price cost early in the transition as long as you stay on the front foot. 
Now we're going to be really closely watching price cost over the balance of the year in terms of net realization. So we would have expected to get the biggest benefit in Q1. And by and large, that's where we expect it. I mean the way it's looking, we may have to intervene on price again in certain of the businesses over the balance of the year. 
So that [indiscernible] that will impact the margin performance. So yes, I mean, look, 2020 when we put the target out there was 400 basis points improvement, I think, from the time period we put it out there.

But we -- as Brad mentioned, I think in his comments, we're booking well into '22 now. On the heat exchanger side, I don't -- I think that we are outgrowing the market, quite frankly. I think that we've got some unique positioning, especially in heat pumps.

But the whole freight logistics chain is kind of -- I guess, it's tight right now, and it's tight, and it's reflected in the cost of [indiscernible], the logistics costs that we've had to bear and it's tight in terms of getting the deliveries we want. So -- but then like anything else at Dover becomes very anecdotal because we're not vertically integrated industrial making 1 product. So we've had issues with hydraulic components in ESG. We had have issue with lighting systems in refrigeration. So I mean, there's a laundry list of things. But for the most part, it's let's call it, supply chain logistics constraints that are impacting us."

I talk to kind of tried to give everybody idea what that business is capable of delivering at. So that was a business because of its capacity utilization is running -- is converting at gross margin level right now, which is very healthy. 
We're watching it closely. Right now, it  is actually a short-cycle business. We're trying to build our backlog, but we really don't have a lot of visibility. So I think that we're being prudent in terms of our second half estimates in terms of how long that goes. 
On the industrial pump side, it's actually been quite robust also, but that's more channel inventory. Interestingly, we had a very good performance in China in the pump business in Q1, and it's been some time since we've seen that, and the margins were quite healthy. 
And you have to recall that management had been very proactive in taking costs out in '20. And so we have the roll-forward benefit on the industrial pump side on the margin moving into '21. 
So that was quite healthy. I think on pumps and polymers. This is a business that I think that the management team has effectively doubled the margin in the last 3 years. So gross margins in that business are healthy again. So overall, it's -- what's going to impact the margin the most is going to be mix even when precision components does come back in the second half, It's not overtly dilutive to it slightly so. The bigger issue is going to be, how does demand hold up on single-use pumps in the second half of the year."

If our Capital Group businesses return in the second half as we expect, that would meet our original forecast. I think it's vehicle services group looks to be poised to get a probably a full point of organic growth that we did not expect at the beginning of the year. 
Printing & ID business is performing as expected. Clearly, the upside is if textile comes back in a robust fashion in the second half. Right now, we don't have the backlog that would support that thesis. 
But if it turns, we'll probably have a lot more color on that one at the end of the second quarter. DFS looks like it may have a point, if not 2. One of those points is based on the acquisition -- the acquisitions that we've made. So You get a point of growth there. 
When that rolls into organic or not, I have to look in the calendarization of blah, blah, blah. But just in terms of total, that's why we gave out total growth early on here and didn't try to parse it between organic and inorganic. 
But we may get a point of growth. We'd like to take a real close look on OPW or the underground portion of it in  [indiscernible] hanging hardware, but we'd expect that to get better over the year, offsetting what's likely to be the negative EMV headwind that we have on the aboveground side in the second half. 
I think that I just I answered Jeff Sprague's question about Pumps & Process Solutions. So I've gone through that one. And look, Our backlog in DRFE, Belvac adding to its backlog doesn't do anything with the revenue. 
I mean they're going to -- it's purely execution now. How much of that backlog they can realize and we just expanded capacity there to help them do it. 
I think the outlier is going to be refrigeration. So we've got a real robust backlog that is a short-cycle business. So we don't have -- I think we may be eating into the beginning of Q3 right now in terms of orders. So we don't have anything for Q4. I think we probably need another quarter to kind of get that tightened down."

And number two, I think that we mentioned at the end of the year, we've given some latitude on working capital to prebuy their own raw materials to get in front of what we expected to be inflationary environment. 
The fact of the matter is, in Q1, the performance is based on a couple of things. Number one, we did not -- Our payables balance exiting '20 was not as high as it had been in previous quarters. 
So there wasn't a snapback in terms of making those payables in Q1 that we've seen in the past. And quite frankly, our conversion or velocity of working capital in Q1 because the revenue was what it was, was a lot higher than we would normally see. 
So look, in how do you hit your nail on the head in absolute terms, if we're guiding the revenue up and the margin looks like it's proactive than in absolute dollars, then free cash flow should move at the same. 
We're working really hard on it. And I think that we probably like a quarter or 2 when we visit the metric as a percent of revenue.

Now does that change between now and the end of the year, our view? I'm sure it will change every quarter as we work through it.

Look, we're raising prices -- look it's all started with raw materials. So you can go through our portfolio clearly that the capital goods side.  [ He's ] got the biggest exposure to the raw materials, and they were on the front foot at the beginning. And from what we can see so far, it looks like the entire complex is following along. Now it takes 90 to 180 days to see what real realization is because you get pricing out there, then you got inventory turns and blah, blah, blah. 
So that's where it started. But the fact of the matter is I get it that the fed doesn't want to recognize inflation, but there is inflation. And it's not just the raw materials, because raw materials are in the subcomponents that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. 
And clearly, at the assembly level on labor, availability is becoming a problem, and that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time. 
So it's now gone from -- it's a capital good size that are buying a lot of raw materials. Now it's moving into the assembled component portions of the business that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year. On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs, we ship a lot of product that's FOB. So we're not -- it's more inbound logistics costs than it is outbound logistics costs, but freight costs are going up because you're going to -- I mean, God forbid, you have to air freight anything right now. It's a bit of a negative. 
So we are going to be on it in terms of price/cost. And it's hard for us because of the disparity of the SKUs that we have in this portfolio. It's not like we're making cars. So we're going to be on it. 
And it's a trailing number, and we're going to have to do it as a combination of as the numbers come out and our intuition going in. But at worst, it's going to have to be a scenario of net neutral."

So it sort of implied in your answer is the channel is not really resisting. People aren't saying, ""Excuse me, you can't raise prices in this regard, we'll go to competitor b or whatever. I mean none of us want to see rapid inflation. But if there's mild inflation that's across the board, can Dover start to raise pricing in other areas that maybe aren't quite as affected but still help your profitability, particularly if the channel is kind of more willing to accept because of general inflation, blah, blah, blah."

So I'm just curious whether it's discussing the price cost impact in 1Q or how you see that playing out for the rest of the year? I'm just curious to hear how you're thinking this is going to -- the trajectory is going to look like going forward?"

I mean there are trade-offs where In '19, certain geographies are stronger and now they're weaker, but they have their own reasons why. 
I think that the only 1 that we can really point to where there's an inflection of the demand environment is refrigeration, but we talked about that leading into '21, where we went through a 3- to 4-year period where the capital base was underinvested by big box retail, and now we're going into a cycle, we're calling it a 3-year cycle. Let's hope it's 4%. And then you've got some interesting changes in structural changes like that are impacting things like Belvac, where this transition to aluminum cans is kind of cyclical where that business hasn't grown in a very long time, and now it's making a pretty sweeping transition for COVID reasons and environmental reasons. 
So the '19 base is important, but we would have expected that if we rebase '19 for new product launches and acquisitions, That base would have been higher anyway at the end of the day, if that answers your question."

So let's move to Page 3. The business challenge moving into Q1 was twofold for Dover. First, we exited 2020 with a healthy backlog of business which we needed to operationally deliver against. Second, we had -- we're closely with our distributors and customers to seize opportunities in the marketplace despite a complex set of challenges with raw materials, components, logistics and labor availability. We are pleased with our first quarter performance on both counts, which is reflected in our robust revenue growth and the increase in our order backlog as we move into Q2. 
Let's take a look at the metrics. Total revenue was up 13%, 9% organic to the comparable period. Clearly, the quarter benefited from a good order backlog position and the willingness of the channels to receive product deliveries as market demand accelerated, resulting in the highest volume quarter since 2014 and largest first quarter volume since 2012 for the company. This performance is a clear indication that our product portfolio is attractive and often underappreciated growth avenues and that the work that we have done on operational excellence is gaining traction.
Order rates outpaced revenue in the quarter, posting bookings of $2.3 billion, a 27% comparable organic increase. The growth was broad-based with all 5 segments contributing to the increase. This resulted in a seasonally high backlog of $2.2 billion, an increase of 39%. Since our earnings are issued among the first in the industrial sector, I suppose it is upon -- it's on us to explain the drivers of growth and their impact on seasonality and full year demand. I'm going to try to be careful with my choice of terms and comments not to cast unwarranted shade on a clearly positive market demand environment. There are several factors driving healthy customer activity. including pent-up demand from last year as a result of low-starting channel inventories in certain sectors. As I also mentioned in my opening remarks, this was further influenced by tight supply chains and materials inflation, positively contributing to seasonal demand and backlog build as our customers and channels position themselves to meet their forecasted demand. 
Importantly, before we get all wound up trying to quantify the impact of channel inventory stocking and inflationary prebuy and how it impacts quarterly demand, let's not lose sight of the fact that total marketplace demand is robust, which is reflected in our backlog and which also leads us to revise our revenue growth guidance upward for the full year to 10% to 12%. 
So put succinctly, it's not prebuy if we don't remove it from the full year revenue estimates. Still early in the year, we will continue to produce to meet customer demand and watch our backlog and order patterns carefully. We have more color on the drivers of demand and our revenue performance, including contribution of market share gains as we progress through the year. For now, we are focused on executing operationally in demanding conditions to win in the marketplace, but we clearly believe that favorable demand conditions remain durable through the year. 
Let's move to profitability. Q1 was solid with consolidated adjusted segment margin at 19.1%, 320 basis points higher versus the comparable quarter. This was supported by strong volumes, favorable mix of products delivered, positive pricing for continued operational discipline and efficiency initiatives, which more than offset input cost headwinds. 
Strong profitability and continued focus on working capital management resulted in seasonally strong free cash flow, which was up $110 million compared to last year's first quarter or the comparable period. 
With a solid Q1 under our belt, we look at the remainder of 2020 with constructive optimism. Strong order trends and a record backlog portend a robust top line outlook, and we have confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges. 
With that, we are raising our guidance for the year to 10% to 12% all-in revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $6.75 to $6.85 per share, a substantial step-up compared to our prior guidance. 
I will skip Slide 4, which provides a more detailed overview of our results for the first quarter, so let's move to Slide 5. Engineered Products revenue was up 2% organically as demand conditions improved modestly during the comparable period. Vehicle services entered the year with a strong order book and faced solid demand across all geographies and product lines. Industrial automation grew on automotive recovery and channel restocking, and aerospace and defense shipments were solid. The business remains booked well into the second half of the year. As expected, waste hauling was down year-over-year given a lower starting backlog entering Q1, which was further impacted by component availability issues that constrained shipments in the quarter. 
We have forecasted this business to be levered towards H2, and order trends and backlog reflect that. Same dynamic for industrial winches with revenue down in the quarter, but recovery in order rates, we expect a continued gradual recovery in this business over the year. Margin performance in the quarter was flat year-over-year as volume leverage and pricing offset the negative fixed cost absorption in the capital goods portion of the portfolio.
And Fueling Solutions was up 3% organically in the quarter on the strength of North American retail fueling, as well as our software and systems business in Europe. Activity in China remains subdued. Order backlogs are up 13%, and we expect our hanging hardware, vehicle wash and compliance-driven underground product offerings to contribute positively due to an increase in miles driven and construction seasonality as we make our way through the year. The segment posted another quarter of strong margin performance on higher volumes, productivity actions and mix, which is a continuation of the trajectory that we exited in 2020.
Sales in Imaging & Identification improved 4% organically. The core marking and coding business grew well on strong printer and services demand in North America and Asia. It was partially offset by a decline in consumables against the comparable quarter where customers stocked up on inks at the onset of the pandemic. We also saw a nice pickup in serialization software sales. Textile printer sales remained soft as global apparel and retail remains impacted by COVID. Ink consumable volumes were up as we significantly improved ink attachment rates, and we saw encouraging improvement in the pipeline in new printer sales as the quarter progressed. Margins improved slightly in the segment on higher volumes, and we were able to offset material cost inflation with strategic pricing during the quarter. 
Pumps & Process Solutions posted 18% organic growth in the quarter on improved volumes across all businesses, except precision components. Order rates and shipments for biopharma connectors and pumps continued to be strong. Industrial pumps had a solid quarter driven by improved end market conditions and distributor demand. And polymer processing shipments grew year-over-year on robust demand in Asia and the U.S. Precision components was down in the quarter, though demand conditions stabilized in hydrodynamic bearings and compression parts as well as broadly in China through new OEM builds remain impacted. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded by 890 basis points on strong volume, favorable mix and pricing. This team has moved the segment to best-in-class top line and bottom line metrics through a dedication to operational excellence, robust product development and innovation management and proactive and purposeful inorganic actions. It's a world-class collection of assets that we will continue to invest behind.
Refrigeration & Food Equipment continued its solid momentum from the second half of last year, posting 18% organic growth. Revenue and new orders in beverage can making more than doubled year-over-year. Food retail saw broad-based increases across its product lines as key retailers resumed capital investment in programs, plus we've seen good demand for some of our new product introductions and customer wins. Our natural refrigerant systems business, in particular, experienced robust demand in Europe and the U.S. as customers are adopting more environmentally friendly solutions. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in Asia and Europe across all end markets. Foodservice equipment was down in the quarter but saw stabilization in chain restaurant demand. Despite operational challenges in food retail due to availability issues with insulation raw materials, adjusted margin performance improved by 450 basis points supported by stronger volumes, productivity initiatives and cost actions we took in the middle of 2020, partially offset by input cost inflation. 
I'll pass it to Brad from here."

Our top line benefited from organic growth across all 5 segments with particular strength in Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments. FX benefited top line by 3% or $51 million. Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by $15 million. We expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters. 
The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North America, Europe and Asia, our 3 largest geographic regions. The U.S., our largest market, posted 7% organic growth in the quarter on solid order rates in retail fueling, marking and coding, biopharma connectors, food retail and can making, among others, and was partially offset by delayed shipments in waste hauling. Europe grew by 13% in the quarter on strong shipments in vehicle aftermarket, biopharma industrial pumps and heat exchangers. All of Asia returned to growth and was up 20% organically driven by China, which was up 60% against a COVID-impacted comparable quarter in the prior year. 
Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 27% organically, reflecting the continued broad-based momentum we are seeing across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic bookings growth across all 5 segments. Overall, our backlog is currently up $626 million or 39% versus this time last year. positioning us well for the remainder of the year. 
Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide 7. On the top of the chart, adjusted segment EBIT was up nearly $100 million on margin improvement -- but margin improved several hundred basis points as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset input cost inflation. 
Going to the bottom of the chart. Adjusted net earnings improved by $60 million as higher segment EBIT more than offset higher taxes as well as higher corporate expenses, primarily related to compensation accruals and deal expenses. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, was approximately $21.7 million for the quarter compared to 21.5% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $6 million in the quarter or approximately $3 million lower than in 2020. Rightsizing and other costs were $4 million in the quarter or $3 million after tax. 
Now on Slide 8. We are pleased with the cash flow performance in the first quarter with free cash flow of $146 million or $110 million increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 8% of revenue in the first quarter, which is historically our lowest cash flow quarter due to seasonality of our production. 
Let me turn it back to Rich."

We expect demand in Engineered Products to improve sequentially through the remainder of the year, which is supported by a robust backlog. We continue to see strong results -- strong bookings trends in vehicle services and industrial automation. Aerospace and defense has a significant revenue visibility through its government programs and is booked well into the second half of the year. Order rates in waste handling improved significantly during the first quarter, though the shipment schedule will be levered towards the second half, and we are watching the supply chain here closely, which is -- have stabilized and expect gradual recovery through the second half of the year. 
As communicated at our investor meeting in November, we expect Fueling Solutions to post modern organic growth for the year. There was a known headwind from EMV roll-off in the U.S., but order trends support a number of positives offsetting it, including growth in systems and software, recovery in underground businesses and growth in vehicle wash. We also expect that Asia, China, in particular, should stabilize and become a net positive for us in the second half. The ICS acquisition, which we closed at the end of last year, is off to a very good start as vehicle wash market is recovering healthily. 
Imaging & ID is expected to perform well this year. Our core marking and coding business, our stalwarts in 2020, is expected to continue to deliver low- to mid-single-digit growth with services and serialization products positively impacting performance. Digital textile printing remained slow, although we saw a year-over-year improvement in ink tonnage sales in Q1 as we continue executing our strategy to attach consumables to machine sales. We expect recovery here in the second half. 
Pumps & Process Solutions should have another solid year. Demand for biopharma and hygienic applications remains robust, and trading conditions in industrial pumps rebounded quickly in the first quarter, and momentum should continue. Our recent investments in biopharma capacity were prescient, and we are well positioned to continue capitalizing on the secular growth story. Plastics and polymers is expected to deliver steady performance as the global shortage of plastic and rubber as well as petrochemical investments are driving increased investment in processing plants. precision Components have stabilized, and we expect it to contribute to year-over-year growth beginning in the second half of the year. 
If with large backlog and high order rates, Refrigeration & Food Equipment is expected to have a strong year. New orders in the core food retail businesses have been healthy in the last few quarters as retailers that had paused their remodel programs last year amidst the pandemic are restarting these strategic initiatives. 
Additionally, we are capitalizing on our leadership position in natural refrigerant systems, both in Europe and also in the U.S., where we believe the recent mandate in California will foretell a trend among the other 49 states to mandate the transition to more environmentally friendly solutions. We also see good growth in our specialty product line and small-format customer segment. Belvac continues to work through a record backlog and had another significant bookings quarter in Q1. They are booked for the year. 
Our heat exchanger business is seeing strong order rates across all verticals and geographies. We are investing in capacity and new capabilities in these 2 businesses and are well positioned to capture growth. Demand has stabilized in foodservice equipment at restaurant chains, and we expect the institutional business to recover in the second half as students return to schools and traffic in brews at stadiums and hotels. 
Our revised annual guidance is on Page 10. We covered the most pertinent of these items in the slides, and we summarized them here for your reference. 
And finally, on Slide 11 puts expected 2021 performance in a multiyear perspective. In our 2019 investor presentation, we highlighted how the changes to Dover's portfolio over the prior decade shaped a less cyclical business and provided attractive through-cycle returns. 2020 was proof of lower top line cyclicality in a demanding environment and our ability to protect profitability. Operational excellence and operating margin expansion has been our priority over the last couple of years and that we are on track to deliver more than 100 basis points of average margin expansion over that period, and we have the playbook and tools for this to continue. Dover is positioned to deliver attractive double-digit EPS growth in line with our long-term corporate targets communicated in 2019. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to thank everyone at Dover for their hard work delivering these results and continued perseverance. And that's the end of the presentation. So Andrey, we can open it up for Q&A."

The kind of rest of the year guidance, I just wanted to kind of get an idea of -- you mentioned there are these kind of like -- I think there were bookings tailwinds this quarter but not necessarily revenue tailwinds. But when I look at kind of the rest of the year, and I just kind of simply divide the rest of the year guide quarterly, just to get to a quarterly number. And keeping in mind the first quarter is usually like a pretty low number seasonally, it seems like sequentially through the rest of the year quarterly that you have EPS, EBIT kind of softening and actually down sequentially and sales basically kind of flattish for the rest of the year, just on a quarterly kind of simple quarterly divide it by 3 -- rest of the year divide it by 3. So what's -- is there something like -- a fundamental that will drop off, other than EMV? I mean you mentioned a lot of these businesses have a second half that actually looks pretty good.

So I think that we're quite pleased in our ability to pivot operationally to get the product out the door. I think that we're probably being arguably conservative to get another quarter under our belt to see how much of that backlog and demand is being influenced by channel restocking and trying to get in front of raw material perceived price increases in the future. So -- and I'm not entirely clear right now how much of Q1 over performance was taken from Q2, which is seasonally when we kind of ramp, so it's usually a low Q1, big move in Q2, Q3 and then kind of run for cash in Q4. Whether we were that -- you just can't do the math and say, ""Well, historically, it's been this percentage of revenue and operating profit, and this is what the seasonality is. And if I take Q1 as a proxy and I run my spreadsheet, it kicks out an extraordinarily high number, both on the revenue side and the operating margin side.""
So from the revenue side, I think, fair enough, we may be a little conservative. We'd like to see our bookings go through Q2. I'll tell you, sitting here in April that it's not deteriorating, which is a good news. So that portends a pretty decent Q3 that we've got coming up, but we'd like to see how that develops over time because, make no mistake, there's a couple of things here. 
Operationally, it is getting kind of difficult out there in terms of sourcing raw materials, labor availability, a variety of different things out there. We had some headwinds in the first quarter, but I'd tell you that, operationally, we plowed through. We're not out of the woods yet. Right now, we missed shipments in both ESG and into -- in retail refrigeration because of component availability. I don't really know yet whether that's going to get better or worse. 
My final comment, and I know this is a long answer, but you're at the head of the line, and this is going to be the question we knew we were going to get, is from a margin point of view, and I think that I discussed this at the end of '20, the incremental margin expectation for Q2 because the comp is so good has been overstated on margin because of our ability to use furlough mechanisms that were subsidized by the government, meaning we could take production people off of our payroll because we had subsidies in place to account for it. So you actually have a snapback of costs. Now we're in pretty good shape because our revenue is up so much, so we should be able to absorb it. But I think, by and large, what I've seen that there's an expectation in industrial world where the incremental in Q2 margin performance is a lot higher than we'd expect.
The second answer on the margin performance of the balance of the year is we really expect to accelerate in refrigeration over the balance of the year, so we've got this big backlog. It's up to us to get it out. So the -- out of the growth that we expect in the balance of the year, a lot more of that growth is going to -- from refrigeration than it was in Q1. And as you know, that is diluted to margins as we go forward. So I would caution you not to take Q1 incremental margins and just multiply it by 3."

I guess over the balance of the year -- so number one, the answer is we're going to get to 20% earlier than we thought based on current trajectory. So what that means, I'm not putting a target out there yet. We'll give you one maybe in Q3. 
What we are going to fight against between now and the end of the year, we've discussed the mix impact on margins is inflationary input costs between raw materials, labor and price/cost. We -- as we discussed at the end of 2020, we were on the front foot in terms of getting price out there. So think about it in terms of inventory change. The inflation on the raw materials was not in our inventory, so you get positive price/cost early in the transition as long as you stay on the front foot. Now we're going to be really closely watching price/cost over the balance of the year in terms of net realization, so we would have expected to get the biggest benefit in Q1. And by and large, that's where we expect it. I mean the way it's looking, we may have to intervene on price again in certain of the businesses over the balance of the year. So -- and that's going to -- and that will impact the margin performance. 
So yes. I mean, look, 2020 when we put the target out there was 400 basis points improvement, I think, from the time period we put it out there. Clearly, I think we'll be revisiting those longer-term targets sometime this year."

I mean how long the transition from expanding capacity and can making in the transition from PET to aluminum, how long that goes remains to be seen. But we -- as Brad mentioned, I think, in his comments, we're booking well into '22 now. 
On the heat exchanger side, I don't -- I think that we are outgrowing the market, quite frankly. I think that we've got some unique positioning, especially in heat pumps.

So that was a business because of its capacity utilization is running -- is converting at gross margin level right now, which is very healthy. We're watching it closely. Right now, it is actually a short-cycle business. We're trying to build our backlog, but we really don't have a lot of visibility. So I think that we're being prudent in terms of our second half estimates in terms of how long that goes.
On the industrial pump side, it's actually been quite robust also, but that's more channel inventory. Interestingly, we had a very good performance in China in the pump business in Q1, and it's been some time since we've seen that. And the margins were quite healthy. And you have to recall that management had been very proactive in taking costs out in '20, and so we have the roll-forward benefit on the industrial pump side on the margin moving into '21. So that was quite healthy. 
I think on pumps and polymers, this is a business that I think that the management team has effectively doubled the margin in the last 3 years. So gross margins in that business are healthy again. So overall, it's -- what's going to impact the margin the most is going to be mix. Even when precision components does come back in the second half, It's not overtly dilutive to it, slightly so. The bigger issue is going to be, how does demand hold up on single-use pumps in the second half of the year."

If our capital group businesses return in the second half, as we expect, that would meet our original forecast. I think it's -- vehicle services group looks to be poised to get a probably a full point of organic growth that we did not expect at the beginning of the year. 
The Printing & ID business is performing, as expected. Clearly, the upside is if textile comes back in a robust fashion in the second half. Right now, we don't have the backlog that would support that thesis. But if it turns, we'll probably have a lot more color on that one at the end of the second quarter. DFS looks like it may have a point, if not 2. One of those points is based on the acquisition that we've made, so you get a point of growth there. When that rolls into organic or not, I have to look in the calendarization of blah, blah, blah. But just in terms of total -- that's why we gave out total growth early on here and didn't try to parse it between organic and inorganic, but we may get a point of growth. We'd like to take a real close look on OPW or the underground portion of it and see if we can develop some hanging hardware, but we'd expect that to get better over the year, offsetting what's likely to be the negative EMV headwind that we have on the aboveground side in the second half. 
I think that I just -- I answered Jeff Sprague's question about Pumps & Process Solutions, so I've gone through that one. 
And look, our backlog in DRFE, Belvac adding to its backlog doesn't do anything with the revenue. I mean they're going to -- it's purely execution now. How much of that backlog they can realize and we just expanded capacity there to help them do it. I think the outlier is going to be refrigeration. So we've got a real robust backlog that is a short-cycle business. So we don't have -- I think we may be eating into the beginning of Q3 right now in terms of orders.

The fact of the matter is, in Q1, the performance is based on a couple of things. Number one, we did not -- Our payables balance exiting '20 was not as high as it had been in previous quarters, so there wasn't a snapback in terms of making those payables in Q1 that we've seen in the past. And quite frankly, our conversion or velocity of working capital in Q1, because the revenue was what it was, was a lot higher than we would normally see. 
So look, and -- you hit the nail on the head, in absolute terms, if we're guiding the revenue up and the margin looks like it's proactive than in absolute dollars, then free cash flow should move at the same.

Look, we're raising prices -- look, this all started with raw materials.

Now it takes 90 to 180 days to see what real realization is because you get pricing out there, then you got inventory turns and blah, blah, blah. So that's where it started. 
But the fact of the matter is I get it that the fed doesn't want to recognize inflation, but there is inflation. And it's not just the raw materials because raw materials are in the subcomponents that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. And clearly, at the assembly level on labor, availability is becoming a problem, and that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time.
So it's now gone from -- it's the capital good side that are buying a lot of raw materials. Now it's moving into the assembled component portions of the business that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year. 
On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs. We ship a lot of product that's FOB, so we're not -- it's more inbound logistics costs than it is outbound logistics costs, but freight costs are going up because you're going to -- I mean, God forbid, you have to air freight anything right now. It's a bit of a negative. 
So we are going to be on it in terms of price/cost, and it's hard for us because of the disparity of the SKUs that we have in this portfolio. It's not like we're making cars.

I think it's going to be a credit, right?

I mean there are trade-offs where in '19, certain geographies are stronger, and now they're weaker, but they have their own reasons why. 
I think that the only one that we can really point to where there's an inflection of the demand environment is refrigeration, but we talked about that leading into '21, where we went through a 3- to 4-year period where the capital base was under invested by big-box retail. And now we're going into a cycle, we're calling it a 3-year cycle. Let's hope it's 4. And then you've got some interesting changes in -- structural changes like that are impacting things like Belvac, where this transition to aluminum cans is kind of cyclical, where that business hasn't grown in a very long time, and now it's making a pretty sweeping transition for COVID reasons and environmental reasons.

First, we exited 2020 with a healthy ba",1429,"Thank you, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. We simply have a big group this morning so we're going to have a robust Q&A session. 
So let's move to Page 3. The business challenge moving into Q1 was twofold for Dover. First, we exited 2020 with a healthy backlog of business which we needed to operationally deliver against. Second, we had -- we're closely with our distributors and customers to seize opportunities in the marketplace despite a complex set of challenges with raw materials, components, logistics and labor availability. We are pleased with our first quarter performance on both counts, which is reflected in our robust revenue growth and the increase in our order backlog as we move into Q2. 
Let's take a look at the metrics. Total revenue was up 13%, 9% organic to the comparable period. Clearly, the quarter benefited from a good order backlog position and the willingness of the channels to receive product deliveries as market demand accelerated, resulting in the highest volume quarter since 2014 and largest first quarter volume since 2012 for the company. This performance is a clear indication that our product portfolio is attractive and often underappreciated growth avenues and that the work that we have done on operational excellence is gaining traction.
Order rates outpaced revenue in the quarter, posting bookings of $2.3 billion, a 27% comparable organic increase. The growth was broad-based with all 5 segments contributing to the increase. This resulted in a seasonally high backlog of $2.2 billion, an increase of 39%. Since our earnings are issued among the first in the industrial sector, I suppose it is upon -- it's on us to explain the drivers of growth and their impact on seasonality and full year demand. I'm going to try to be careful with my choice of terms and comments not to cast unwarranted shade on a clearly positive market demand environment. There are several factors driving healthy customer activity. including pent-up demand from last year as a result of low-starting channel inventories in certain sectors. As I also mentioned in my opening remarks, this was further influenced by tight supply chains and materials inflation, positively contributing to seasonal demand and backlog build as our customers and channels position themselves to meet their forecasted demand. 
Importantly, before we get all wound up trying to quantify the impact of channel inventory stocking and inflationary prebuy and how it impacts quarterly demand, let's not lose sight of the fact that total marketplace demand is robust, which is reflected in our backlog and which also leads us to revise our revenue growth guidance upward for the full year to 10% to 12%. 
So put succinctly, it's not prebuy if we don't remove it from the full year revenue estimates. Still early in the year, we will continue to produce to meet customer demand and watch our backlog and order patterns carefully. We have more color on the drivers of demand and our revenue performance, including contribution of market share gains as we progress through the year. For now, we are focused on executing operationally in demanding conditions to win in the marketplace, but we clearly believe that favorable demand conditions remain durable through the year. 
Let's move to profitability. Q1 was solid with consolidated adjusted segment margin at 19.1%, 320 basis points higher versus the comparable quarter. This was supported by strong volumes, favorable mix of products delivered, positive pricing for continued operational discipline and efficiency initiatives, which more than offset input cost headwinds. 
Strong profitability and continued focus on working capital management resulted in seasonally strong free cash flow, which was up $110 million compared to last year's first quarter or the comparable period. 
With a solid Q1 under our belt, we look at the remainder of 2020 with constructive optimism. Strong order trends and a record backlog portend a robust top line outlook, and we have confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges. 
With that, we are raising our guidance for the year to 10% to 12% all-in revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $6.75 to $6.85 per share, a substantial step-up compared to our prior guidance. 
I will skip Slide 4, which provides a more detailed overview of our results for the first quarter, so let's move to Slide 5. Engineered Products revenue was up 2% organically as demand conditions improved modestly during the comparable period. Vehicle services entered the year with a strong order book and faced solid demand across all geographies and product lines. Industrial automation grew on automotive recovery and channel restocking, and aerospace and defense shipments were solid. The business remains booked well into the second half of the year. As expected, waste hauling was down year-over-year given a lower starting backlog entering Q1, which was further impacted by component availability issues that constrained shipments in the quarter. 
We have forecasted this business to be levered towards H2, and order trends and backlog reflect that. Same dynamic for industrial winches with revenue down in the quarter, but recovery in order rates, we expect a continued gradual recovery in this business over the year. Margin performance in the quarter was flat year-over-year as volume leverage and pricing offset the negative fixed cost absorption in the capital goods portion of the portfolio.
And Fueling Solutions was up 3% organically in the quarter on the strength of North American retail fueling, as well as our software and systems business in Europe. Activity in China remains subdued. Order backlogs are up 13%, and we expect our hanging hardware, vehicle wash and compliance-driven underground product offerings to contribute positively due to an increase in miles driven and construction seasonality as we make our way through the year. The segment posted another quarter of strong margin performance on higher volumes, productivity actions and mix, which is a continuation of the trajectory that we exited in 2020.
Sales in Imaging & Identification improved 4% organically. The core marking and coding business grew well on strong printer and services demand in North America and Asia. It was partially offset by a decline in consumables against the comparable quarter where customers stocked up on inks at the onset of the pandemic. We also saw a nice pickup in serialization software sales. Textile printer sales remained soft as global apparel and retail remains impacted by COVID. Ink consumable volumes were up as we significantly improved ink attachment rates, and we saw encouraging improvement in the pipeline in new printer sales as the quarter progressed. Margins improved slightly in the segment on higher volumes, and we were able to offset material cost inflation with strategic pricing during the quarter. 
Pumps & Process Solutions posted 18% organic growth in the quarter on improved volumes across all businesses, except precision components. Order rates and shipments for biopharma connectors and pumps continued to be strong. Industrial pumps had a solid quarter driven by improved end market conditions and distributor demand. And polymer processing shipments grew year-over-year on robust demand in Asia and the U.S. Precision components was down in the quarter, though demand conditions stabilized in hydrodynamic bearings and compression parts as well as broadly in China through new OEM builds remain impacted. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded by 890 basis points on strong volume, favorable mix and pricing. This team has moved the segment to best-in-class top line and bottom line metrics through a dedication to operational excellence, robust product development and innovation management and proactive and purposeful inorganic actions. It's a world-class collection of assets that we will continue to invest behind.
Refrigeration & Food Equipment continued its solid momentum from the second half of last year, posting 18% organic growth. Revenue and new orders in beverage can making more than doubled year-over-year. Food retail saw broad-based increases across its product lines as key retailers resumed capital investment in programs, plus we've seen good demand for some of our new product introductions and customer wins. Our natural refrigerant systems business, in particular, experienced robust demand in Europe and the U.S. as customers are adopting more environmentally friendly solutions. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in Asia and Europe across all end markets. Foodservice equipment was down in the quarter but saw stabilization in chain restaurant demand. Despite operational challenges in food retail due to availability issues with insulation raw materials, adjusted margin performance improved by 450 basis points supported by stronger volumes, productivity initiatives and cost actions we took in the middle of 2020, partially offset by input cost inflation. 
I'll pass it to Brad from here."

FX benefited top line by 3% or $51 million. Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by $15 million. We expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters. 
The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North America, Europe and Asia, our 3 largest geographic regions. The U.S., our largest market, posted 7% organic growth in the quarter on solid order rates in retail fueling, marking and coding, biopharma connectors, food retail and can making, among others, and was partially offset by delayed shipments in waste hauling. Europe grew by 13% in the quarter on strong shipments in vehicle aftermarket, biopharma industrial pumps and heat exchangers. All of Asia returned to growth and was up 20% organically driven by China, which was up 60% against a COVID-impacted comparable quarter in the prior year. 
Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 27% organically, reflecting the continued broad-based momentum we are seeing across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic bookings growth across all 5 segments. Overall, our backlog is currently up $626 million or 39% versus this time last year. positioning us well for the remainder of the year. 
Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide 7. On the top of the chart, adjusted segment EBIT was up nearly $100 million on margin improvement -- but margin improved several hundred basis points as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset input cost inflation. 
Going to the bottom of the chart. Adjusted net earnings improved by $60 million as higher segment EBIT more than offset higher taxes as well as higher corporate expenses, primarily related to compensation accruals and deal expenses. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, was approximately $21.7 million for the quarter compared to 21.5% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $6 million in the quarter or approximately $3 million lower than in 2020. Rightsizing and other costs were $4 million in the quarter or $3 million after tax. 
Now on Slide 8. We are pleased with the cash flow performance in the first quarter with free cash flow of $146 million or $110 million increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 8% of revenue in the first quarter, which is historically our lowest cash flow quarter due to seasonality of our production.

Order rates in waste handling improved significantly during the first quarter, though the shipment schedule will be levered towards the second half, and we are watching the supply chain here closely, which is -- have stabilized and expect gradual recovery through the second half of the year. 
As communicated at our investor meeting in November, we expect Fueling Solutions to post modern organic growth for the year. There was a known headwind from EMV roll-off in the U.S., but order trends support a number of positives offsetting it, including growth in systems and software, recovery in underground businesses and growth in vehicle wash. We also expect that Asia, China, in particular, should stabilize and become a net positive for us in the second half. The ICS acquisition, which we closed at the end of last year, is off to a very good start as vehicle wash market is recovering healthily. 
Imaging & ID is expected to perform well this year. Our core marking and coding business, our stalwarts in 2020, is expected to continue to deliver low- to mid-single-digit growth with services and serialization products positively impacting performance. Digital textile printing remained slow, although we saw a year-over-year improvement in ink tonnage sales in Q1 as we continue executing our strategy to attach consumables to machine sales. We expect recovery here in the second half. 
Pumps & Process Solutions should have another solid year. Demand for biopharma and hygienic applications remains robust, and trading conditions in industrial pumps rebounded quickly in the first quarter, and momentum should continue. Our recent investments in biopharma capacity were prescient, and we are well positioned to continue capitalizing on the secular growth story. Plastics and polymers is expected to deliver steady performance as the global shortage of plastic and rubber as well as petrochemical investments are driving increased investment in processing plants. precision Components have stabilized, and we expect it to contribute to year-over-year growth beginning in the second half of the year. 
If with large backlog and high order rates, Refrigeration & Food Equipment is expected to have a strong year. New orders in the core food retail businesses have been healthy in the last few quarters as retailers that had paused their remodel programs last year amidst the pandemic are restarting these strategic initiatives. 
Additionally, we are capitalizing on our leadership position in natural refrigerant systems, both in Europe and also in the U.S., where we believe the recent mandate in California will foretell a trend among the other 49 states to mandate the transition to more environmentally friendly solutions. We also see good growth in our specialty product line and small-format customer segment. Belvac continues to work through a record backlog and had another significant bookings quarter in Q1. They are booked for the year. 
Our heat exchanger business is seeing strong order rates across all verticals and geographies. We are investing in capacity and new capabilities in these 2 businesses and are well positioned to capture growth. Demand has stabilized in foodservice equipment at restaurant chains, and we expect the institutional business to recover in the second half as students return to schools and traffic in brews at stadiums and hotels. 
Our revised annual guidance is on Page 10. We covered the most pertinent of these items in the slides, and we summarized them here for your reference. 
And finally, on Slide 11 puts expected 2021 performance in a multiyear perspective. In our 2019 investor presentation, we highlighted how the changes to Dover's portfolio over the prior decade shaped a less cyclical business and provided attractive through-cycle returns. 2020 was proof of lower top line cyclicality in a demanding environment and our ability to protect profitability. Operational excellence and operating margin expansion has been our priority over the last couple of years and that we are on track to deliver more than 100 basis points of average margin expansion over that period, and we have the playbook and tools for this to continue. Dover is positioned to deliver attractive double-digit EPS growth in line with our long-term corporate targets communicated in 2019. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to thank everyone at Dover for their hard work delivering these results and continued perseverance. And that's the end of the presentation. So Andrey, we can open it up for Q&A."

The kind of rest of the year guidance, I just wanted to kind of get an idea of -- you mentioned there are these kind of like -- I think there were bookings tailwinds this quarter but not necessarily revenue tailwinds. But when I look at kind of the rest of the year, and I just kind of simply divide the rest of the year guide quarterly, just to get to a quarterly number. And keeping in mind the first quarter is usually like a pretty low number seasonally, it seems like sequentially through the rest of the year quarterly that you have EPS, EBIT kind of softening and actually down sequentially and sales basically kind of flattish for the rest of the year, just on a quarterly kind of simple quarterly divide it by 3 -- rest of the year divide it by 3. So what's -- is there something like -- a fundamental that will drop off, other than EMV? I mean you mentioned a lot of these businesses have a second half that actually looks pretty good. And anything we're missing on this front?"
174901,711123596,2254065,"Dover Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2021",2021-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","No. Look, I mean, at the end of the day, Q1 was stronger than we expected. So I think that we're quite pleased in our ability to pivot operationally to get the product out the door.

So I think that we're quite pleased in our ability to pivot operationally to get the product out the door. I think that we're probably being arguably conservative to get another quarter under our belt to see how much of that backlog and demand is being influenced by channel restocking and trying to get in front of raw material perceived price increases in the future. So -- and I'm not entirely clear right now how much of Q1 over performance was taken from Q2, which is seasonally when we kind of ramp, so it's usually a low Q1, big move in Q2, Q3 and then kind of run for cash in Q4. Whether we were that -- you just can't do the math and say, ""Well, historically, it's been this percentage of revenue and operating profit, and this is what the seasonality is. And if I take Q1 as a proxy and I run my spreadsheet, it kicks out an extraordinarily high number, both on the revenue side and the operating margin side.""
So from the revenue side, I think, fair enough, we may be a little conservative. We'd like to see our bookings go through Q2. I'll tell you, sitting here in April that it's not deteriorating, which is a good news. So that portends a pretty decent Q3 that we've got coming up, but we'd like to see how that develops over time because, make no mistake, there's a couple of things here. 
Operationally, it is getting kind of difficult out there in terms of sourcing raw materials, labor availability, a variety of different things out there. We had some headwinds in the first quarter, but I'd tell you that, operationally, we plowed through. We're not out of the woods yet. Right now, we missed shipments in both ESG and into -- in retail refrigeration because of component availability. I don't really know yet whether that's going to get better or worse. 
My final comment, and I know this is a long answer, but you're at the head of the line, and this is going to be the question we knew we were going to get, is from a margin point of view, and I think that I discussed this at the end of '20, the incremental margin expectation for Q2 because the comp is so good has been overstated on margin because of our ability to use furlough mechanisms that were subsidized by the government, meaning we could take production people off of our payroll because we had subsidies in place to account for it. So you actually have a snapback of costs. Now we're in pretty good shape because our revenue is up so much, so we should be able to absorb it. But I think, by and large, what I've seen that there's an expectation in industrial world where the incremental in Q2 margin performance is a lot higher than we'd expect.
The second answer on the margin performance of the balance of the year is we really expect to accelerate in refrigeration over the balance of the year, so we've got this big backlog. It's up to us to get it out. So the -- out of the growth that we expect in the balance of the year, a lot more of that growth is going to -- from refrigeration than it was in Q1. And as you know, that is diluted to margins as we go forward. So I would caution you not to take Q1 incremental margins and just multiply it by 3."

I guess over the balance of the year -- so number one, the answer is we're going to get to 20% earlier than we thought based on current trajectory. So what that means, I'm not putting a target out there yet. We'll give you one maybe in Q3. 
What we are going to fight against between now and the end of the year, we've discussed the mix impact on margins is inflationary input costs between raw materials, labor and price/cost. We -- as we discussed at the end of 2020, we were on the front foot in terms of getting price out there. So think about it in terms of inventory change. The inflation on the raw materials was not in our inventory, so you get positive price/cost early in the transition as long as you stay on the front foot. Now we're going to be really closely watching price/cost over the balance of the year in terms of net realization, so we would have expected to get the biggest benefit in Q1. And by and large, that's where we expect it. I mean the way it's looking, we may have to intervene on price again in certain of the businesses over the balance of the year. So -- and that's going to -- and that will impact the margin performance. 
So yes. I mean, look, 2020 when we put the target out there was 400 basis points improvement, I think, from the time period we put it out there. Clearly, I think we'll be revisiting those longer-term targets sometime this year."

That's the one that we said that we're relatively confident that we are in kind of a secular growth period for, we would say, 36 months from where we can see it.

I mean how long the transition from expanding capacity and can making in the transition from PET to aluminum, how long that goes remains to be seen. But we -- as Brad mentioned, I think, in his comments, we're booking well into '22 now. 
On the heat exchanger side, I don't -- I think that we are outgrowing the market, quite frankly. I think that we've got some unique positioning, especially in heat pumps. We are expanding capacity now. So based on new product launches and expanded capacity, I think that we can outgrow the market.

So that was a business because of its capacity utilization is running -- is converting at gross margin level right now, which is very healthy. We're watching it closely. Right now, it is actually a short-cycle business. We're trying to build our backlog, but we really don't have a lot of visibility. So I think that we're being prudent in terms of our second half estimates in terms of how long that goes.
On the industrial pump side, it's actually been quite robust also, but that's more channel inventory. Interestingly, we had a very good performance in China in the pump business in Q1, and it's been some time since we've seen that. And the margins were quite healthy. And you have to recall that management had been very proactive in taking costs out in '20, and so we have the roll-forward benefit on the industrial pump side on the margin moving into '21. So that was quite healthy. 
I think on pumps and polymers, this is a business that I think that the management team has effectively doubled the margin in the last 3 years. So gross margins in that business are healthy again. So overall, it's -- what's going to impact the margin the most is going to be mix. Even when precision components does come back in the second half, It's not overtly dilutive to it, slightly so. The bigger issue is going to be, how does demand hold up on single-use pumps in the second half of the year."

The Printing & ID business is performing, as expected. Clearly, the upside is if textile comes back in a robust fashion in the second half. Right now, we don't have the backlog that would support that thesis. But if it turns, we'll probably have a lot more color on that one at the end of the second quarter. DFS looks like it may have a point, if not 2. One of those points is based on the acquisition that we've made, so you get a point of growth there. When that rolls into organic or not, I have to look in the calendarization of blah, blah, blah. But just in terms of total -- that's why we gave out total growth early on here and didn't try to parse it between organic and inorganic, but we may get a point of growth. We'd like to take a real close look on OPW or the underground portion of it and see if we can develop some hanging hardware, but we'd expect that to get better over the year, offsetting what's likely to be the negative EMV headwind that we have on the aboveground side in the second half. 
I think that I just -- I answered Jeff Sprague's question about Pumps & Process Solutions, so I've gone through that one. 
And look, our backlog in DRFE, Belvac adding to its backlog doesn't do anything with the revenue. I mean they're going to -- it's purely execution now. How much of that backlog they can realize and we just expanded capacity there to help them do it. I think the outlier is going to be refrigeration. So we've got a real robust backlog that is a short-cycle business. So we don't have -- I think we may be eating into the beginning of Q3 right now in terms of orders.

The fact of the matter is, in Q1, the performance is based on a couple of things. Number one, we did not -- Our payables balance exiting '20 was not as high as it had been in previous quarters, so there wasn't a snapback in terms of making those payables in Q1 that we've seen in the past. And quite frankly, our conversion or velocity of working capital in Q1, because the revenue was what it was, was a lot higher than we would normally see. 
So look, and -- you hit the nail on the head, in absolute terms, if we're guiding the revenue up and the margin looks like it's proactive than in absolute dollars, then free cash flow should move at the same.

Right now, we don't see it. I can tell you that, right now, we're expanding at capacity again in the case that it's durable, but it's hard to say right now."

Look, we're raising prices -- look, this all started with raw materials. So you can go through our portfolio, clearly, that the capital goods side has got the biggest exposure to the raw materials, and they were on the front foot at the beginning. And from what we can see, so far, it looks like the entire complex is following along. Now it takes 90 to 180 days to see what real realization is because you get pricing out there, then you got inventory turns and blah, blah, blah. So that's where it started. 
But the fact of the matter is I get it that the fed doesn't want to recognize inflation, but there is inflation. And it's not just the raw materials because raw materials are in the subcomponents that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. And clearly, at the assembly level on labor, availability is becoming a problem, and that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time.
So it's now gone from -- it's the capital good side that are buying a lot of raw materials. Now it's moving into the assembled component portions of the business that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year. 
On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs. We ship a lot of product that's FOB, so we're not -- it's more inbound logistics costs than it is outbound logistics costs, but freight costs are going up because you're going to -- I mean, God forbid, you have to air freight anything right now. It's a bit of a negative. 
So we are going to be on it in terms of price/cost, and it's hard for us because of the disparity of the SKUs that we have in this portfolio. It's not like we're making cars. So we're going to be on it. And it's a trailing number, and we're going to have to do it as a combination of as the numbers come out and our intuition going in. But at worst, it's going to have to be a scenario of net neutral."

I think that the only one that we can really point to where there's an inflection of the demand environment is refrigeration, but we talked about that leading into '21, where we went through a 3- to 4-year period where the capital base was under invested by big-box retail. And now we're going into a cycle, we're calling it a 3-year cycle. Let's hope it's 4.

Our second quarter results were strong across the board, and we are especially pleased with the top line performance, considering the complicated operating environment. The demand environment in the quarter was robu",1304,"Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were strong across the board, and we are especially pleased with the top line performance, considering the complicated operating environment. The demand environment in the quarter was robust and continued the momentum from the first quarter, and despite posting a 30% organic top line growth, we exit Q2 with a sequentially higher order backlog. I'll focus on the bigger picture here and highlight again what we believe is underappreciated aspect of our portfolio, its organic growth potential. 
Our revenue in the second quarter was above the pre-pandemic comparable quarter in 2019 and resulted in the highest revenue first half of the year in recent Dover history, meaning that the majority of our markets are not simply recovering but are operating in a growth environment. New order bookings remain robust with all segments posting book-to-bill above 1, resulting in sequential comparable growth in backlog, as I mentioned earlier. Operating margin conversion was solid for the quarter as a result of good execution at the operating level and a healthy mix of products delivered in the quarter. 
All of this is well and good, but make no mistake, the operating environment remains very challenging. It's been 90 days since the last time we were asked the question about the duration of ""transitory inflation."" As we've discussed after the first quarter, we had some line of sight on raw materials cost trajectory coming into the year, which allowed us to get in front from a price cost perspective. We have also proactively given our operating companies some leeway on working capital decisions to build inventories based on the backlog trajectory. What we underestimated was the total cost impacts of a strained logistics system and tight labor market that shows no signs of abating. 
This has had 2 knock-on effects on our results: first, the absolute cost of inbound and outbound freight were materially higher; and second and more important, the costs associated with production line stoppages due to lack of labor and components caused by trends in time, uncertainty and overall supply chain tightness. I'll deal with the market dynamics and supply chain impact by business later in the presentation. But based on our experience so far, I am concerned about the notion that the current economy needs to be further stimulated and second-order implications of that line of thinking, and I'll leave it at that. 
Our teams have done a commendable job navigating these choppy waters and continue shipping products and driving robust margin conversion and strong cash flow. Overall, we believe that our operating model has been an advantage to us as we are largely a localized producer and are not overly reliant on extended supply chains. This is clearly reflected in our top line performance in the quarter. 
As we look to the second half of the year, our order backlogs make us confident in our top line trajectory. Our forecast do not incorporate much in the way of an improvement nor deterioration of the operating challenges that we've witnessed during the first half. We're just going to have to power through and work with our suppliers and customers to adapt to the prevailing conditions. We are raising our annual revenue growth guidance to 15% to 17% and our adjusted EPS guidance to $7.30 a share to $7.40 a share. We also expect stronger cash flow as a result of the improved margin performance. 
I'll skip to Slide 4, which provides a more detailed overview of our results in the quarter. Engineered Products revenue was up 25% organically. Vehicle services was just strong across all geographies and product lines and had record bookings during the quarter. Industrial and automation demand was strong across the automotive sector and in China. Aerospace & Defense posted an all-time record revenue during the second quarter. Waste handling is flat year-over-year as the business continues to wrestle with component and labor availability issues that are constraining product shipments. Importantly, waste handling bookings were robust and the backlog was up nearly 75% versus the prior year. Engineered Products is our most exposed segment to input and logistics cost inflation due to materials intensity, contractual pricing dynamics and relatively higher share of international sourcing in vehicle services. You can see it in the margin -- the segment's margin was flat year-over-year as strong volume leverage and pricing increases were offset by input costs and freight inflation as well as labor and component availability challenges. 
Fueling Solutions was up 25% organically in the quarter and the strength is above ground and below ground retail fueling globally, including some remaining tailwinds from the EMV opportunity in the U.S. following the April deadline. Vehicle wash has had -- has been strong this year, and our recent ICS acquisition integration and performance is ahead of plan. Activity in China and fuel transport remains subdued, but there are signs of Chinese operators reopening their tendering activity. Order backlogs were up 29%, and we expect our software and service business, hanging hardware, vehicle wash and compliance-driven underground product offerings to help offset the anticipated headwinds from the EMV roll off. The segment posted another strong sequential margin performance on higher volume strategic pricing initiatives, productivity actions and mix. 
Sales in Imaging and ID improved 20% organically, the core marking and coding business grew well on strong printer demand across all geographies, with China and India driving particularly strong performance. Serialization software also grew ahead of expectations. The digital texting printing business was up significantly against the comparable quarter, when much of their operations were locked down in Northern Italy last year, but nevertheless, the business remains impacted, though we are beginning to see growth in demand for large printers, particularly in Asia and continued growth in ink consumable volumes. Margins improved by 420 basis points on volume, leverage, pricing and productivity initiatives. 
Pumps and Process Solutions posted another banner quarter, a 34% organic growth on improved volumes across all businesses except precision components. Demand for biopharma connectors and pumps continue to be strong, driven by vaccine and non-COVID-related pharmaceutical tailwinds. Industrial pumps grew by over 20% on robust end customer demand, with particular strength in China. Polymer processing shipments grew year-over-year and continued strength in Asia and is gaining momentum in the U.S. market. Precision Components were slightly down in the quarter, though demand conditions have stabilized and are recovering well in some end markets and geography, giving us confidence in the second half trajectory, margins in the quarter expanded by 910 basis points on strong volumes, favorable mix and pricing. 
Top line growth in refrigeration and food equipment continued its impressive clip, posting a 44% organic growth. Revenue in the beverage can making doubled in the quarter and bookings nearly doubled as well. The business is now booked into late 2022. Food retail saw a broad-based growth across its product lines, door cases are now booking into 2022. And the demand for natural refrigerants is driving outside growth in our systems business in the U.S. and in Europe. Backlog in food retail is now double where it was last year. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in all geographies, with rebounding order rates in commercial HVAC in North America and record order intake in EMEA, extending lead times for heat pumps and boilers. Foodservice equipment was up in the quarter on a tough comp, chain, -- actually on an easy comp and chain restaurant demand is robust, but the institutional market is still recovering. Margins in the segment improved by 580 basis points, driven by strong volumes and productivity actions, partially offset by availability issues with insulation raw materials and labor and food retail operations we expect -- which we expect to subside in the second half. 
And I'll pass it on to Brad here."

I'm on Slide 6 of the presentation deck. On the top of the page is the revenue bridge. Our top line organic revenue increased by 30% in the quarter with all 5 segments posting growth, with particular strength in our Pumps and Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments. FX benefited the top line by about 5% or $68 million. Acquisitions added $19 million of revenue in the quarter. There were no year-over impacts from dispositions. 
The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North America, Europe and Asia, our 3 largest regions. The U.S., our largest market, posted 25% organic growth in the quarter on solid trading conditions in retail fueling, marking and coding, biopharma, food retail and can making. Europe grew by 30% on strong shipments in vehicle aftermarket, biopharma and industrial pumps and heat exchangers. All of Asia was up 38% organically on growth in biopharma, marking and coding, plastics and polymers, heat exchangers and retail fueling demand outside of China. China, which represents a little over half of our business in Asia, was up 33% organically in the quarter. 
Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 61% organically, reflecting continued broad-based momentum across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic growth across all 5 segments. 
Going to the earnings bridges now on Slide 7. On the top of the chart, adjusted EBIT was up $173 million and margin improved 400 basis points, as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset input cost inflation. Adjusted segment EBITDA was up 350 basis points. Going to the bottom of the chart. Adjusted net earnings improved by $135 million as higher segment EBIT more than offset higher taxes as well as higher corporate expenses, primarily relating to compensation accruals and deal expenses. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, was approximately 21.7% for the quarter compared to 21.6% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $11 million in the quarter or $9 million higher than 2020 for approximately $0.07 of a year-over-year EPS impact. Rightsizing and other costs were $11 million in the quarter or $8 million after tax. 
Now on Slide 8. We are pleased with the cash performance thus far this year, with free cash flow of $364 million, a $96 million increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 9% of revenue for the first half of the year, 80 basis points higher than the comparable period last year despite a significant investment in working capital and the impact of prior year tax deferrals that did not repeat this year. Also, as we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on delivering against our customers' strong order rates and build inventory to ensure we can meet the current demand in the second half of the year. 
With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich."

Let's try to pause here for a moment, because this is a complicated slide, but I think it's a transparent view of what we think is going to happen over the second half of the year and includes our current view of the outlook of the sec",1180,"Okay. Thanks, Brad. Let's try to pause here for a moment, because this is a complicated slide, but I think it's a transparent view of what we think is going to happen over the second half of the year and includes our current view of the outlook of the second half by segment, provides context of how we are thinking about full year guidance, which I'll get to shortly. 
Remember, the demand environment is strong across the portfolio. So let's not try to get overexcited about headwinds or mix commentary. We managed it in H1, and we'll do it again in H2, but this is the reality of the situation in terms of the dynamic of the business. We expect top line and engineered products to remain robust through the remainder of the year based on solid backlog and good bookings trajectory. Momentum in the vehicle aftermarket industrial automation should continue, while we expect the improved order rates and backlogs and solid waste handling and industrial winches to drive solid year-over-year growth in the second half. Aerospace and Defense is expected to be modestly down, largely as a result of a difficult year-over-year comparison on project deliveries. 
Supply chain constraints and cost inflation are expected to continue to have a material impact on the segment. Waste handling and automotive aftermarket businesses are our largest business exposed to the trifecta of raw materials inflation, extended supply chains and a larger proportion of assembly labor. Our management teams are winning in the marketplace, considering the headwinds, which is reflected in the growth rate in order books. But we are clearly at the point of having to defend our market position at the expense of the price/cost dynamic, which will be detrimental to near-term margins but not material -- slightly detrimental. We expect Fueling Solutions to provide organic growth for the full year above our initial expectations on the back of growth in systems and software, recovering underground demand and vehicle wash. Recall that above ground business has a tough second half due to the North American EMV volumes. 
Margins in Fueling Solutions will be up for the full year, though we expect modest margin compression in the second half relative to the first half, slightly lower volumes and negative product and geographic mix, which I think that we've covered at the end of Q1 as with less North America volume due to EMV and more international volume that's slightly diluted. Trading conditions in Imaging and ID are expected to continue their positive trajectory for the remainder of the year. Our core marking and coding business is expected to maintain its growth trajectory, with services and serialization products positively impacting performance. Digital textile printing is recovering, and we expect the end of the year, we will be well above 2020 but below its 2019 high watermark. We expect operating margins to remain stable in the second half. 
Pumps and Process Solutions should see a solid second half. Demand for biopharma and hygienic applications remain robust, with customers now placing orders into 2022. We are strategically investing in additional cleaning room capacity for this platform to support its growth, trading conditions in industrial pumps are strong and driven by robust and customer demand as opposed to channel stocking. Plastics and polymers is expected to be steady, though this business faces a difficult comparable period due to a strong performance last year. Precision Components will return to growth in the second half as OEM new builds will supplant increased activities at refineries and petrochemical plants. We expect margins to remain strong in this segment, but we may see some minor dilution due to mix on the back half, as our Precision Components business recovers but the absolute profit trajectory of this segment is in very good shape. 
With its large backlog and high sustained order rates, Refrigeration & Food Equipment will finish the year strong, with double-digit growth expected for all operating businesses. New orders in core food retail business have been healthy across the product segments and the tailwinds from our leadership position in natural refrigerants are driving outside growth for our systems business. We expect to begin to significantly ramp up shipments of our new digital door product. Belvac continues to work through its record backlog. They are now taking orders for late '22 and even into 2023. Our heat exchanger business is positioned well as they are seeing strong order rates across all verticals and geographies. We have been investing in capacity new capabilities in these 2 businesses and are well positioned to capture the growth. 
Foodservice equipment demand has normalized and returned to growth at restaurant change and institutional business continues to improve. We expect this business to post solid growth in the second half, albeit against a low comparable. We expect margins to continue their seasonally adjusted upward trajectory for the remainder of the year, improved volume leverage, productivity gains and positive product mix and business mix should more than offset operational challenges related to component and labor shortages, increased logistics costs and input cost inflation. 
Moving to Slide 10. We remain on the front foot investing behind our business to support the growth, productivity and long-term portfolio enhancement Organic high return on investment projects remain our top priority for capital allocation. On the left hand, you can see the sample of the current growth and productivity CapEx projects that we are working on that add up to $75 million of spend. The project mix is balanced between growth and productivity, with a skew towards new capacity and supporting long-term growth in key priority portions of our portfolio. 
Our next priority in capital allocation is strategic bolt-on acquisitions that enhance our long-term growth profile and attractiveness of our portfolio. You can see that with that all 4 of our recent acquisitions were in either digital or high-growth single-use pumps markets. These are small additions, but we are very excited about scaling up these highly innovative technologies as part of our global portfolio. We remain on the hunt for acquisitions and have a solid M&A pipeline as we enter the second half. Our current dry powder on a full year '21 basis is approximately $3.3 billion. 
Our revised annual guidance is on Page 11. We are increasing our top line forecast to reflect the durability and demand trends that we are seeing. We now expect to achieve 15% to 17% all-in revenue growth this year. Our $0.55 adjusted EPS guidance increase is mindful of the supply chain and input challenges we summarized earlier in the presentation, and we expect free cash flow generation to edge higher as well due to margin improvements. 
On the bottom of the page, we show our expected '21 performance in a multiyear perspective. We remain on track to deliver strong returns through a combination of robust organic revenue growth, strong margin expansion and disciplined capital allocation. Before wrapping up, I want to thank everybody at Dover for their perseverance and accomplishments executing in today's challenging environment. 
And with that, Andrey, we'll open it up to Q&A."

So what I was trying to make clear is one of the businesses that suffered greatly last year and is beginning to improve now is our Precision Components business, that is slightly dilutive to margins. But in terms of absolute profit, it's a positive. So I wouldn't get overly chuffed about that. 
On the refrigeration side, we expect third quarter margins to be the highest of the year, just based on seasonality and the size of our backlog and everything else. Quite frankly, we're a bit disappointed in the margin in Q2. I don't think that's the fault of management, but we've had a really difficult time with freight costs and components and labor availability. So on one hand, I think the effort on their part to get the product out the door was excellent. The bottom line is we disappointed a bunch of customers in our inability to get the product out because of the supply chain issues. So the trajectory is good, and as you'll see from the backlogs, this is more of a 2022 story now more than a '21 story."

I think that we discussed it a little bit at the end of Q1. Clearly, based on our backlogs of exiting Q1 and then Q2, because of the demand function was going to be higher than kind of what a normal seasonality would be, just because of where the demand was. So it's just purely a function where you could get it out the door or not at the end of the day. So that's the good news. So I don't think you can look at Q2 and just say, well, I'm going to go back and look at history, and then Q3 is this much higher than Q2 and then that it's going to spit out a number, as you said, that's just not realistic quite frankly. So as point number one, so I'd be careful about calculating seasonality based on history just because of the strength of the first half, just because of the recovery coming out of the pandemic. 
In terms of the backlog, yes, we'd have to break it down because we've got some long-cycle backlog. I mean we mentioned Belvac, which is booking into 2023 now, is a piece of that, that will just convert over time. We don't believe that there's double ordering going on right now. From what we can tell, it looks like it's just a recognition by the customer base of the constraints that are out in the system, that in previous periods, you just didn't have to put the orders in, you want to get in line. So that is what is expanding the backlog. I mean, I think you asked the question at the end of Q1 about this whole issue of channel stocking, destocking. And we took a close look, I mean we grew our industrial pumps business by 20% in the quarter. So we took over that actually. But -- so we took a close look at channel checks and we don't see that inventory building up at our distributors. It's just passing right through. So that's good news at the end of the day because it means it's fundamental demand. 
So I think it's 2 issues. We've got some long-cycle businesses that are booking out well further than historically they used to, and then I think on our short-cycle businesses, I think there's a recognition of the constraints in the supply chain that's just making everybody get in line further out than they normally would have."

If you've got very long supply chains and it's containerized freight coming out of Asia, back to North America to fulfill demand, you're suffering, quite frankly. 
On the labor side, it's purely in our operations that I have a higher propensity of assembly labor. And for all the reasons that we can understand, that's been difficult. I think it's not getting worse as we move through the second quarter, which is the good news. So hopefully, in September, when some of these government influence in terms of the labor market begins to roll off, that it will get better and everybody is going to go back to school in September. So our view right now is it's probably going to remain difficult through August. And I think that we're hopeful in September that the situation is better."

Our second quarter results were strong across the board, and we are especially pleased with the top line performance, considering the complicated operating environment. The demand environment in the quarter was robu",1303,"Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were strong across the board, and we are especially pleased with the top line performance, considering the complicated operating environment. The demand environment in the quarter was robust and continued the momentum from the first quarter. And despite posting a 30% organic top line growth, we exit Q2 with a sequentially higher order backlog. I'll focus on the bigger picture here and highlight again what we believe is underappreciated aspect of our portfolio, its organic growth potential.  
Our revenue in the second quarter was above the pre-pandemic comparable quarter in 2019 and resulted in the highest revenue first half of the year in recent Dover history, meaning that the majority of our markets are not simply recovering but are operating in a growth environment. New order bookings remain robust, with all segments posting book-to-bill above 1, resulting in sequential comparable growth in backlog, as I mentioned earlier. Operating margin conversion was solid for the quarter as a result of good execution at the operating level and a healthy mix of products delivered in the quarter.  
All of this is well and good, but make no mistake, the operating environment remains very challenging. It's been 90 days since the last time we were asked the question about the duration of ""transitory inflation."" As we've discussed after the first quarter, we had some line of sight on raw materials cost trajectory coming into the year, which allowed us to get in front from a price cost perspective. We have also proactively given our operating companies some leeway on working capital decisions to build inventories based on the backlog trajectory. What we underestimated was the total cost impacts of a strained logistics system and tight labor market that shows no signs of abating.  
This has had 2 knock-on effects on our results. First, the absolute cost of inbound and outbound freight were materially higher; and second and more important, the costs associated with production line stoppages due to lack of labor and components caused by trends in time, uncertainty and overall supply chain tightness. I'll deal with the market dynamics and supply chain impact by business later in the presentation. But based on our experience so far, I am concerned about the notion that the current economy needs to be further stimulated and second-order implications of that line of thinking, and I'll leave it at that.  
Our teams have done a commendable job navigating these choppy waters and continue shipping products and driving robust margin conversion and strong cash flow. Overall, we believe that our operating model has been an advantage to us as we are largely a localized producer and are not overly reliant on extended supply chains. This is clearly reflected in our top line performance in the quarter.  
As we look to the second half of the year, our order backlogs make us confident in our top line trajectory. Our forecast do not incorporate much in the way of an improvement nor deterioration of the operating challenges that we've witnessed during the first half. We're just going to have to power through and work with our suppliers and customers to adapt to the prevailing conditions. We are raising our annual revenue growth guidance to 15% to 17% and our adjusted EPS guidance to $7.30 a share to $7.40 a share. We also expect stronger cash flow as a result of the improved margin performance.  
I'll skip to Slide 4, which provides a more detailed overview of our results in the quarter. Engineered Products revenue was up 25% organically. Vehicle Services was strong across all geographies and product lines and had record bookings during the quarter. Industrial automation demand was strong across the automotive sector and in China. Aerospace & Defense posted an all-time record revenue during the second quarter. Waste handling is flat year-over-year as the business continues to wrestle with component and labor availability issues that are constraining product shipments. Importantly, waste handling bookings were robust, and the backlog was up nearly 75% versus the prior year. 
Engineered Products is our most exposed segment to input and logistics cost inflation due to materials intensity, contractual pricing dynamics and relatively higher share of international sourcing in vehicle services. You can see it in the margin -- the segment's margin was flat year-over-year as strong volume leverage and pricing increases were offset by input costs and freight inflation as well as labor and component availability challenges.  
Fueling Solutions was up 25% organically in the quarter and the strength is above ground and the below ground retail fueling globally, including some remaining tailwinds from the EMV opportunity in the U.S. following the April deadline. Vehicle Wash has had -- has been strong this year, and our recent ICS acquisition integration and performance is ahead of plan. Activity in China and fuel transport remains subdued, but there are signs of Chinese operators reopening their tendering activity. Order backlogs were up 29%, and we expect our software and service business, hanging hardware, vehicle wash and compliance-driven underground product offerings to help offset the anticipated headwinds from the EMV roll off. The segment posted another strong sequential margin performance on higher volume strategic pricing initiatives, productivity actions and mix.  
Sales in Imaging & ID improved 20% organically. The core marking and coding business grew well on strong printer demand across all geographies, with China and India driving particularly strong performance. Serialization software also grew ahead of expectations. The digital texting printing business was up significantly against the comparable quarter, when much of their operations were locked down in Northern Italy last year, but nevertheless, the business remains impacted, though we are beginning to see growth in demand for large printers, particularly in Asia and continued growth in ink consumable volumes. Margins improved by 420 basis points on volume, leverage, pricing and productivity initiatives.  
Pumps & Process Solutions posted another banner quarter, a 34% organic growth on improved volumes across all businesses except precision components. Demand for biopharma connectors and pumps continue to be strong, driven by vaccine and non-COVID-related pharmaceutical tailwinds. Industrial pumps grew by over 20% on robust end customer demand, with particular strength in China. Polymer processing shipments grew year-over-year and continued strength in Asia and is gaining momentum in the U.S. market. Precision Components were slightly down in the quarter, though demand conditions have stabilized and are recovering well in some end markets and geography, giving us confidence in the second half trajectory. Margins in the quarter expanded by 910 basis points on strong volumes, favorable mix and pricing.  
Top line growth in refrigeration and food equipment continued its impressive clip, posting a 44% organic growth. Revenue in the beverage can making doubled in the quarter and bookings nearly doubled as well. The business is now booked into late 2022. Food retail saw a broad-based growth across its product lines. Door cases are now booking into 2022. And the demand for natural refrigerants is driving outside growth in our systems business in the U.S. and in Europe. 
Backlog in food retail is now double where it was last year. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand, and all geographies was rebounding order rates in commercial HVAC in North America and record order intake in EMEA, extending lead times for heat pumps and boilers. Foodservice equipment was up in the quarter on a tough comp, chain, -- actually, on an easy comp and chain restaurant demand is robust, but the institutional market is still recovering. Margins in the segment improved by 580 basis points, driven by strong volumes and productivity actions, partially offset by availability issues with insulation raw materials and labor and food retail operations we expect -- which we expect to subside in the second half.  
And I'll pass it on to Brad here."

I'm on Slide 6 of the presentation deck. On the top of the page is the revenue bridge. Our top line organic revenue increased by 30% in the quarter, with all 5 segments posting growth, with particular strength in our Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments. FX benefited the top line by about 5%, or $68 million. Acquisitions added $19 million of revenue in the quarter. There were no year-over impacts from dispositions.
The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North America, Europe and Asia, our 3 largest regions. The U.S., our largest market, posted 25% organic growth in the quarter on solid trading conditions in retail fueling, marking and coding, biopharma, food retail and can making. Europe grew by 30% on strong shipments in vehicle aftermarket, biopharma and industrial pumps and heat exchangers. All of Asia was up 38% organically on growth in biopharma, marking and coding, plastics and polymers, heat exchangers and retail fueling demand outside of China. China, which represents a little over half of our business in Asia, was up 33% organically in the quarter. 
Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 61% organically, reflecting continued broad-based momentum across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic growth across all 5 segments. 
Going to the earnings bridges now on Slide 7. On the top of the chart, adjusted EBIT was up $173 million and margin improved 400 basis points, as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset input cost inflation. Adjusted segment EBITDA was up 350 basis points. 
Going to the bottom of the chart. Adjusted net earnings improved by $135 million as higher segment EBIT more than offset higher taxes as well as higher corporate expenses, primarily relating to compensation accruals and deal expenses. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, was approximately 21.7% for the quarter compared to 21.6% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $11 million in the quarter or $9 million higher than 2020 for approximately $0.07 of a year-over-year EPS impact. Rightsizing and other costs were $11 million in the quarter or $8 million after tax. 
Now on Slide 8. We are pleased with the cash performance thus far this year, with free cash flow of $364 million, a $96 million increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 9% of revenue for the first half of the year, 80 basis points higher than the comparable period last year despite a significant investment in working capital and the impact of prior year tax deferrals that did not repeat this year. Also, as we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on delivering against our customers' strong order rates and build inventory to ensure we can meet the current demand in the second half of the year. 
With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich."

Thanks, Brad. Let's try to pause here for a moment, because this is a complicated slide, but I think it's a transparent view of what we think is going to happen over the second half of the year and includes our current view of the outlook of the second half by segment, provides context of how we are thinking about full year guidance, which I'll get to shortly. 
Remember, the demand environment is strong across the portfolio, so let's not try to get overexcited about headwinds or mix commentary. We managed it in H1, and we'll do it again in H2, but this is the reality of the situation in terms of the dynamic of the business. We expect top line and engineered products to remain robust through the remainder of the year based on solid backlog and good bookings trajectory. Momentum in the vehicle aftermarket industrial automation should continue, while we expect the improved order rates and backlogs and solid waste handling and industrial winches to drive solid year-over-year growth in the second half. Aerospace & Defense is expected to be modestly down, largely as a result of a difficult year-over-year comparison on project deliveries. 
Supply chain constraints and cost inflation are expected to continue to have a material impact on the segment. Waste handling and automotive aftermarket businesses are our largest business exposed to the trifecta of raw materials inflation, extended supply chains and a larger proportion of assembly labor. Our management teams are winning in the marketplace, considering the headwinds, which is reflected in the growth rate in order books. But we are clearly at the point of having to defend our market position at the expense of the price/cost dynamic, which will be detrimental to near-term margins but not material -- slightly detrimental. We expect Fueling Solutions to provide organic growth for the full year, above our initial expectations on the back of growth in systems and software, recovering underground demand and vehicle wash. Recall that above ground business has a tough second half due to the North American EMV volumes. 
Margins in Fueling Solutions will be up for the full year, though we expect modest margin compression in the second half relative to the first half, slightly lower volumes and negative product and geographic mix, which I think that we've covered at the end of Q1 as with less North America volume due to EMV and more international volume that's slightly diluted. Trading conditions in Imaging & ID are expected to continue their positive trajectory for the remainder of the year. Our core marking and coding business is expected to maintain its growth trajectory, with services and serialization products positively impacting performance. Digital textile printing is recovering, and we expect the end of the year, we will be well above 2020 but below its 2019 high watermark. We expect operating margins to remain stable in the second half. 
Pumps & Process Solutions should see a solid second half. Demand for biopharma and hygienic applications remain robust, with customers now placing orders into 2022. We are strategically investing in additional cleaning room capacity for this platform to support its growth, trading conditions in industrial pumps are strong and driven by robust and customer demand as opposed to channel stocking. Plastics and polymers is expected to be steady, though this business faces a difficult comparable period due to a strong performance last year. Precision Components will return to growth in the second half as OEM new builds will supplant increased activities at refineries and petrochemical plants. We expect margins to remain strong in this segment, but we may see some minor dilution due to mix on the back half, as our Precision Components business recovers, but the absolute profit trajectory of this segment is in very good shape. 
With its large backlog and high sustained order rates, Refrigeration & Food Equipment will finish the year strong, with double-digit growth expected for all operating businesses. New orders in core food retail business have been healthy across the product segments, and the tailwinds from our leadership position in natural refrigerants are driving outside growth for our systems business. We expect to begin to significantly ramp up shipments of our new digital door product. 
Belvac continues to work through its record backlog. They are now taking orders for late '22 and even into 2023. Our heat exchanger business is positioned well as they are seeing strong order rates across all verticals and geographies. We have been investing in capacity and new capabilities in these 2 businesses and are well positioned to capture the growth. 
Foodservice equipment demand has normalized and returned to growth at restaurant change and institutional business continues to improve. We expect this business to post solid growth in the second half, albeit against a low comparable. We expect margins to continue their seasonally adjusted upward trajectory for the remainder of the year. Improved volume leverage, productivity gains and positive product mix and business mix should more than offset operational challenges related to component and labor shortages, increased logistics costs and input cost inflation. 
Moving to Slide 10. We remain on the front foot investing behind our business to support the growth, productivity and long-term portfolio enhancement. Organic high return on investment projects remain our top priority for capital allocation. On the left hand, you can see the sample of the current growth and productivity CapEx projects that we are working on. That add up to $75 million of spend. The project mix is balanced between growth and productivity, with a skew towards new capacity and supporting long-term growth in key priority portions of our portfolio. 
Our next priority in capital allocation is strategic bolt-on acquisitions that enhance the long-term growth profile and attractiveness of our portfolio. You can see that with that, all 4 of our recent acquisitions were in either digital or high-growth single-use pumps markets. These are small additions, but we are very excited about scaling up these highly innovative technologies as part of our global portfolio. We remain on the hunt for acquisitions and have a solid M&A pipeline as we enter the second half. Our current dry powder on a full year '21 basis is approximately $3.3 billion. 
Our revised annual guidance is on Page 11. We are increasing our top line forecast to reflect the durability and demand trends that we are seeing. We now expect to achieve 15% to 17% all-in revenue growth this year. Our $0.55 adjusted EPS guidance increase is mindful of the supply chain and input challenges we summarized earlier in the presentation, and we expect free cash flow generation to edge higher as well due to margin improvements. 
On the bottom of the page, we show our expected '21 performance in a multiyear perspective. We remain on track to deliver strong returns through a combination of robust organic revenue growth, strong margin expansion and disciplined capital allocation. 
Before wrapping up, I want to thank everybody at Dover for their perseverance and accomplishments executing in today's challenging environment. 
And with that, Andrey, we'll open it up to Q&A."

On the refrigeration side, we expect third quarter margins to be the highest of the year, just based on seasonality and the size of our backlog and everything else. Quite frankly, we're a bit disappointed in the margin in Q2. I don't think that's the fault of management, but we've had a really difficult time with freight costs and components and labor availability. So on one hand, I think the effort on their part to get the product out the door was excellent. The bottom line is we disappointed a bunch of customers in our inability to get the product out because of the supply chain issues. So the trajectory is good, and as you'll see from the backlogs, this is more of a 2022 story now more than a '21 story."

I think, normally, you guys convert your first half orders relatively close as a percentage into sales from first half to second half. Obviously, that suggests like a kind of a stupidly high revenue number for the year relative to your guidance, like $700 million higher. Obviously, there's supply constraints and things may be getting pushed into '22. 
Can you maybe just talk about like the mechanics of this backlog, what's converting -- what's different when it comes to the conversion from orders into sales this cycle, if you will? I mean, I'm sure it's much more extended, obviously, this cycle. Maybe like just mechanically, is there double ordering going on? Is there -- are you guys pushing deliveries into '22? Just a little more of the mechanics around that."

I think that we discussed it a little bit at the end of Q1. Clearly, based on our backlogs of exiting Q1 and then Q2, because of the demand function was going to be higher than kind of what a normal seasonality would be, just because of where the demand was. So it's just purely a function where you could get it out the door or not at the end of the day. So that's the good news. 
So I don't think you can look at Q2 and just say, well, I'm going to go back and look at history, and then Q3 is this much higher than Q2 and then that it's going to spit out a number. As you said, that's just not realistic, quite frankly. So that's point number one. So I'd be careful about calculating seasonality based on history just because of the strength of the first half, just because of the recovery coming out of the pandemic. 
In terms of the backlog, yes, we'd have to break it down because we've got some long-cycle backlog. I mean we mentioned Belvac, which is booking into 2023 now, is a piece of that, that will just convert over time. We don't believe that there's double ordering going on right now. From what we can tell, it looks like it's just a recognition by the customer base of the constraints that are out in the system, that in previous periods, you just didn't have to put the orders in, you want to get in line. 
So that is what is expanding the backlog. I mean, I think you asked the question at the end of Q1 about this whole issue of channel stocking, destocking. And we took a close look. I mean we grew our industrial pumps business by 20% in the quarter, so we took over that actually. But -- so we took a close look at channel checks and we don't see that inventory building up at our distributors. It's just passing right through. So that's good news at the end of the day because it means it's fundamental demand. 
So I think it's 2 issues. We've got some long-cycle businesses that are booking out well further than, historically, they used to. And then I think on our short-cycle businesses, I think there's a recognition of the constraints in the supply chain that's just making everybody get in line further out than they normally would have."

Because the fact of the matter is you run the risk of demand destruction in the short term. And that's not good. 
So part of my comment about Engineered Products, especially around ESG and VSG, is at a certain point, if we go negative in terms of price cost, but the volume remains robust and the installed base goes up, that's a better trade because we believe that some of these supply chain constraints in raw materials will roll off, hopefully, sooner than later. And do you really go back to your core customers and say, ""Sorry, but here comes another price increase.""

I think that we're just trying to be transparent, Joe, right? It's very -- we could have put up the second quarter results and said everything is great, and see you next quarter and gotten away with it. But I think that we have to recognize that there are some issues that need to be overcome. 
To us, I don't think that we should get overly excited about it. It's just the facts are the facts. We've dealt with them in H1. If anything, it becomes more of a mix issue in Q2 and that's not problematic. So as I mentioned before, DRFE is going to have its best quarter of the year from a revenue and an operating margin point of view. So that's great in terms of absolute profit, but it is dilutive to overall group margins. 
So am I going to tell them to slow down to protect the margin? No, at the end of the day. And that's the case and there's a couple other of our businesses. I mean, if precision components on the back half, revenue increases, but it's slightly dilutive to a, let's call it, a very robust margin that we're clocking at Pumps & Process Solutions. Again, I don't think it's overly problematic. But we're just trying to guide everybody of -- hey, look at the margin in Q2, but read from a seasonality point of view. If I go back and look at history, Q3 is x percent higher than Q2. So let me just model that and run down the field. I think that would we give you a number that we would like to get to, but I'm not entirely sure just because of the pull forward in terms of the demand and the operating leverage that we're getting in Q2."

Dover Corporation and its operating companies had a solid quarter. The performance stats indicate that our product strategies, coupled with our ongoing productivity initiatives, continued to deliver top line growth, margin accretion and attractive cash flow to our investors. Our revenue and bookings growth continued to outpace our pre-pandemic levels, and we exit the quarter with a record high and sequentially increased backlog while posting top line growth of 15% over the comparable period. Demand strength was broad-based as each segment posted year-over-year growth in bookings and a book-to-bill above 1. 
Revenue growth product -- positive product mix and ongoing productivity initiatives drove comparable operating margins up, resulting in a 31% increase in U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share. Our free cash flow performance was strong with an 18% year-over-year increase despite significant investments we've made in inventory as we begin to reap the benefits of our investments in the centralization of financial processing activities. 
We continue to enhance and improve our portfolio with several acquisitions completed in the last 3 months and the divestiture of our commercial foodservice business announced last week. Our organic investments and capacity expansions and productivity projects are on track, providing us the building blocks for the future top line growth and margin expansion. 
As one of the first multi-industrials to report each quarter and because of our wide end market exposures, we have the pleasure to be the operating environment bellwether, so let's get on the front foot here by providing some color on inflationary inputs, labor and supply chain challenges so that we have time to discuss the constructive demand environment for 2022 in the Q&A. 
Let me start by saying that we're particularly concerned that there have been no discernible policy changes, particularly in the U.S. to deal with these headwinds, and in fact, many proposed policies run the risk of extending their [indiscernible] We take no satisfaction in the fact that we've been telegraphing these issues all year and incorporating them into our forecast to the businesses that bear the brunt of these challenges, which I'll expand upon during the segment review. We have taken the appropriate actions to offset these headwinds moving into 2022, and we are comforted by the fact that we have been given the opportunity to demonstrate the resilience of our business model and the strength of the breadth of our product and geographic market exposure that are ultimately reflected in these quarterly results. 
To be clear, we are very constructive about 2022 demand for our products and services and remain optimistic that there will be a recognition that protecting the duration of the current strong economic demand environment needs proactive policy decisions. We are raising our full year EPS guidance as a result of our strong year-to-date performance. Our updated forecast do not incorporate any material improvement nor deterioration of the challenging operating environment in the fourth quarter. Our priorities remain the same, supporting our customers with products and services for the long term and the health and welfare of our employees. 
I'll skip to Slide 4, which provides a more detailed review of our results for the third quarter. So let's move to Slide 5. Engineered Products revenue was up 14% organically with a significant portion of the growth from pricing actions. Vehicle Services posted a strong top line quarter and market indicators remain positive, with vehicle miles driven recovering and average vehicle age continuing to increase. Industrial automation demand was up double digits with strong activity in Americas and China. 
Environmental Services Group revenue was up year-over-year and its backlog remains strong moving into 2022. Aerospace and Defense posted a decline year-over-year, largely a result to changes in program shipment timing. The margin performance in the quarter was unfortunately what we expected to occur as we progress through the year. Our Engineered Products segment, as we've discussed previously, has the largest exposure to raw materials, assembly labor as a percentage of cost of goods and supply chain complexity. As such, it is more than just a price cost issue where even an equilibrium drives negative margin performance. It is exasperated by numerous component supply issues that necessitated us to intermittently curtail production to stabilize the manufacturing system in the quarter. 
Our management team is doing exactly what we'd expect of them to protect profitability in the short term while managing the relationships with our strategically important customers. I have absolute confidence that the profit margin in the segment will bounce back as we move into '22 as a result of actions already taken in price and as raw materials and supply chain constraints moderate as can be seen in the raw materials futures and stabilizing container shipping rates. 
Fueling Solutions was up 3% organically in the quarter on solid demand in North America for above-ground and below-ground retail fueling. We believe our production schedule and delivery times are driving share gains, particularly in the above-ground category. Vehicle wash posted another strong quarter with some encouraging customer conversion and cross-selling benefits from our recent ICS acquisition. Activity in China remains subdued, driven by the lasting impacts of COVID and near-term uncertainty related to energy supply. Fuel transport components were negative for the quarter but we believe that this is expected to improve moving forward. Margins in the segment declined 150 basis points in the quarter as productivity headwinds from supply chain constraints and subcomponents and negative mix more than offset higher volumes and pricing. We have taken the appropriate actions on pricing to counter these headwinds going forward. 
Sales in Imaging & Identification grew 7% organically. The core marketing and coating business grew well on good demand for printers and consumables. Serialization software also grew ahead of expectations, and we are working to add additional resources here as we integrate the recently acquired Blue Byte brand management software into our solutions. The digital textile printing business was up significantly year-over-year against a low bar comparable quarter and is continuing its gradual recovery. Margins in Imaging and ID improved by 250 basis points as volume leverage, pricing and productivity initiatives more than offset input cost inflation. 
Pumps and Process Solutions posted another solid quarter at 25% organic growth. Demand for biopharma connectors and pumps continue to be strong. We continue to expand clean room capacity for our biopharma connectors and single-use pumps in the period, and we are encouraged by specification wins in Amtech biopharma flow meters, which we acquired last year. Industrial pumps were up based on broad-based end customer demand with particular strength in China. 
Precision Components was up year-over-year as compression OEM and aftermarket businesses continued their recovery. Polymer Processing was down in the quarter due to a combination of shipment timing and a very strong third quarter from the prior year, though new order rates remained strong and outlook is positive moving into 2022. Margins in the quarter expanded by a robust 630 basis points on strong volume, fixed cost absorption, favorable product mix and pricing. 
Top line results in refrigeration and food equipment remained strong, posting 16% organic growth. Revenue in beverage can-making equipment doubled in the quarter. The business is booked into late '22 and is taking orders for '23. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in all geographies, led by residential heating and industrial end markets and a recovery in the global commercial HVAC demand. Order intakes continue to exceed our ability to ship, so we are adding additional capacity in 2 geographies to ensure that we can meet forecasted demand in 2022. 
Demand in food retail remains robust with elevated bookings and backlogs across all our product lines. However, much like our Engineered Products business, we have a difficult time with labor constraints and, in particular, subcomponent supply, which has necessitated significant operational cost in logistics production curtailments and, in one case, deferment of a delivery into 2022. Again, management is straddling cost recovery actions and meeting demands of our customers but it clearly comes with a cost. Margins were largely flat in the quarter

China, which represents approximately half of our business in Asia was up 8% organically in the quarter. 
Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 25% organically, reflecting the continued broad-based momentum across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic growth across all 5 segments. Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide 7. On the top of the chart, adjusted segment EBIT was up $64 million and adjusted EBIT margin improved 80 basis points as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset cost inflation and production stoppages. 
Going to the bottom chart. Adjusted net earnings improved by $57 million as higher segment EBIT and lower corporate expenses more than offset higher taxes. Deal expense in the quarter were $3 million. The effective tax rate for the third quarter, excluding tax discrete benefits, was approximately 21.8% compared to 21.5% in the prior year. And our effective tax rate estimate pre-discrete for Q4 in the full year remains unchanged at 21% to 22%. Discrete tax benefits were $8 million for the quarter or $4 million higher than in 2020 for approximately $0.03 of year-over-year EPS impact. Rightsizing and other costs were a $2 million reduction to adjusted earnings in the quarter as a onetime recovery related to a cancellation settlement more than offset our ongoing productivity and rightsizing initiatives. 
Now on Slide 8. We are pleased with the cash performance thus far this year, with cash -- with free cash flow of $667 million, a $104 million increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 11% of revenue year-to-date despite a nearly $250 million investment in working capital. As we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on delivering against our customers' strong order rates, and we are carrying high inventory levels to ensure we can meet current demand for the rest of the year and into next year.

I'm pleased to report that our activity since then has aligned well with those priorities, and we remain busy adding logistic bolt-ons that will support the long-term growth of our core businesses. As you can see that we are investing in the highest priority platforms with an emphasis on high growth, high gross margin products and solutions. 
We remain disciplined in our approach to acquisitions. And despite the challenging asset prices in today's environment, we have acquired 7 bolt-on acquisitions year-to-date that meet our investment return criteria, including 2 in the third quarter and 1 that closed last week. The most recent deals highlighted in green were CDS, an industrial 3D visualization software, which we expect to grow in third-party revenues and also adopt across the Dover portfolio in our journey towards digitizing the front end of our businesses, lowering our transaction costs. 
SP, which complements our Aerospace and Defense business, a software-driven signal intelligence solutions and , which is an emerging leader in LNG and hydrogen dispensing solutions. Each transaction is a modest addition to our aggregate portfolio, but we are very excited about scaling up these innovative and strategic technologies over time and the positive impact to EPS as these investments mature. We remain on the hunt for acquisitions and have a solid M&A pipeline that aligns well with our portfolio priorities. 
We also took advantage of recent market activity in the food equipment sector to sell Unified Brands, our professional cooking equipment business for commercial foodservice operators. The deal was announced in early October and is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Unified Brands represents less than 2% of our overall revenue and its sale will have a negligible impact on our '21 adjusted EPS. I would like to thank the management and employees of Unified Brands for the many years of service in the Dover family. 
As we look to the end of the year, demand outlook remains favorable across the majority of the portfolio. Backlogs and bookings remain robust and we expect to post strong organic growth in Q4. Overall, we remain on track to deliver strong returns this year through a combination of robust growth in revenue, operating profit and cash flow, coupled with disciplined capital allocation. We also look forward to closing out this year and laying the foundation for what we believe to be a positive demand environment in 2022. 
We have clarity about the nature of the inflationary input and supply disruption costs that we incurred in Q3 and expect to queue in Q4 due to the challenging operating environment, and we have conviction that we can turn them into profitability tailwinds as conditions improve and the calendar progresses from here. 
Before wrapping up, I would like to thank Dover for all their preservers and accomplishments, executing in today's environment. And with that, let's turn it to Q&A."

I'm not an economist. We've been having -- if you go back and look at our comments all year long, this notion of transitory inflation and blaming used car prices has been naive at best. It's been manageable for corporates as corporates have priced inflation but that is a how long is a piece of string argument.

We had projected it to get materially better in Q3. And it got a little bit better as we exited Q3 but the first couple of months were quite difficult. So I'm not overly concerned on our ability to get to high watermarks. And we've got some relatively robust projections for revenue growth for 2022 and we've got the footprint to deliver it.

So what's driving the recovery? I think a couple of things. From a Dover point of view, I think that the portfolio is a lot different than it was in the past. I think that clearly, it looks like we're moving into a CapEx cycle in a lot of our end markets. We discussed refrigeration before, but that seems -- we are getting quite proactive about the energy complex, for example. And I think that we've got some market exposures with the biopharma platform that we've had in the past that you can't compare.

Dover Corporation and its operating companies had a solid quarter. The performance stats indicate that our product strategies, coupled with our ongoing productivity initiatives, continued to deliver top line growth, margin accretion and attractive cash flow to our investors. Our revenue and bookings growth continued to outpace our pre-pandemic levels, and we exit the quarter with a record high and sequentially increased backlog while posting top line growth of 15% over the comparable period. Demand strength was broad-based as each segment posted year-over-year growth in bookings and a book-to-bill above 1. 
Revenue growth product -- positive product mix and ongoing productivity initiatives drove comparable operating margins up, resulting in a 31% increase in U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share. Our free cash flow performance was strong with an 18% year-over-year increase despite significant investments we've made in inventory as we begin to reap the benefits of our investments in the centralization of financial processing activities. 
We continue to enhance and improve our portfolio with several acquisitions completed in the last 3 months and the divestiture of our commercial foodservice business announced last week. Our organic investments and capacity expansions and productivity projects are on track, providing us the building blocks for the future top line growth and margin expansion. 
As one of the first multi-industrials to report each quarter and because of our wide end market exposures, we have the pleasure to be the operating environment bellwether, so let's get on the front foot here by providing some color on inflationary inputs, labor and supply chain challenges so that we have time to discuss the constructive demand environment for 2022 in the Q&A. 
Let me start by saying that we're particularly concerned that there have been no discernible policy changes, particularly in the U.S., to deal with these headwinds. And in fact, many proposed policies run the risk of extending their delays. We take no satisfaction in the fact that we've been telegraphing these issues all year and incorporating them into our forecast to the businesses that bear the brunt of these challenges, which I'll expand upon during the segment review. 
We have taken the appropriate actions to offset these headwinds moving into 2022, and we are comforted by the fact that we have been given the opportunity to demonstrate the resilience of our business model and the strength of the breadth of our product and geographic market exposure that are ultimately reflected in these quarterly results. 
To be clear, we are very constructive about 2022 demand for our products and services and remain optimistic that there will be a recognition that protecting the duration of the current strong economic demand environment needs proactive policy decisions. 
We are raising our full year EPS guidance as a result of our strong year-to-date performance. Our updated forecast do not incorporate any material improvement nor deterioration of the challenging operating environment in the fourth quarter. Our priorities remain the same, supporting our customers with products and services for the long term and the health and welfare of our employees. 
I'll skip to Slide 4, which provides a more detailed review of our results for the third quarter. So let's move to Slide 5. Engineered Products revenue was up 14% organically with a significant portion of the growth from pricing actions. Vehicle services posted a strong top line quarter, and market indicators remain positive with vehicle miles driven recovering and average vehicle age continuing to increase. Industrial automation demand was up double digits with strong activity in Americas and China. 
Environmental Services Group revenue was up year-over-year, and its backlog remained strong moving into 2022. Aerospace and defense posted a decline year-over-year, largely a result to changes in program shipment timing. The margin performance in the quarter was unfortunately what we expected to occur as we progress through the year. 
Our Engineered Products segment, as we've discussed previously, has the largest exposure to raw materials, assembly labor as a percentage of cost of goods and supply chain complexity. As such, it is more than just a price/cost issue where even an equilibrium drives negative margin performance. It is exasperated by numerous component supply issues that necessitated us to intermittently curtail production to stabilize the manufacturing system in the quarter. Our management team is doing exactly what we'd expect of them to protect profitability in the short term while managing the relationships with our strategically important customers. I have absolute confidence that the profit margin in the segment will bounce back as we move into '22 as a result of actions already taken in price and as raw materials and supply chain constraints moderate as can be seen in the raw materials futures and stabilizing container shipping rates.
Fueling Solutions was up 3% organically in the quarter on solid demand in North America for above-ground and below-ground retail fueling. We believe our production schedule and delivery times are driving share gains, particularly in the above-ground category. Vehicle wash posted another strong quarter with some encouraging customer conversion and cross-selling benefits from our recent ICS acquisition. Activity in China remained subdued driven by the lasting impacts of COVID and near-term uncertainty related to energy supply. Fuel transport components were negative for the quarter, but we believe that this is expected to improve moving forward. Margins in the segment declined 150 basis points in the quarter as productivity headwinds from supply chain constraints and subcomponents and negative mix more than offset higher volumes and pricing. We have taken the appropriate actions on pricing to counter these headwinds going forward. 
Sales in Imaging & Identification grew 7% organically. The core marking and coating business grew well on good demand for printers and consumables. Serialization software also grew ahead of expectations, and we are working to add additional resources here as we integrate the recently acquired Blue Bite brand management software into our solutions. The digital textile printing business was up significantly year-over-year against a low bar comparable quarter and is continuing its gradual recovery. Margins in Imaging & ID improved by 250 basis points as volume leverage, pricing and productivity initiatives more than offset input cost inflation. 
Pumps & Process Solutions posted another solid quarter at 25% organic growth. Demand for biopharma connectors and pumps continued to be strong. We continue to expand clean room capacity for our biopharma connectors and single-use pumps in the period, and we are encouraged by specification wins in Em-tec biopharma flow meters, which we acquired last year. Industrial pumps were up based on broad-based end customer demand with particular strength in China. 
Precision Components was up year-over-year as compression OEM and aftermarket businesses continued their recovery. Polymer processing was down in the quarter due to a combination of shipment timing and a very strong third quarter from the prior year, though new order rates remained strong and outlook is positive moving into 2022. Margins in the quarter expanded by a robust 630 basis points on strong volume, fixed cost absorption, favorable product mix and pricing. 
Top line results in Refrigeration & Food Equipment remained strong, posting 16% organic growth. Revenue in beverage can-making equipment doubled in the quarter. The business is booked into late '22 and is taking orders for '23. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in all geographies, led by residential heating and industrial end markets, and a recovery in the global commercial HVAC demand. Order intakes continue to exceed our ability to ship, so we are adding additional capacity in 2 geographies to ensure that we can meet forecasted demand in 2022. 
Demand in Food Retail remains robust with elevated bookings and backlogs across all our product lines. However, much like our Engineered Products business, we have a difficult time with labor constraints, and in particular, subcomponent supply, which has necessitated significant operational cost in logistics intermittent production curtailments, and in one case, a deferment of a delivery into 2022. Again, management is straddling cost recovery actions and meeting demands of our customers, but it clearly comes with a cost. Margins were largely flat in the quarter as excellent operating performance in SWEP and Belvac offset refrigeration headwinds despite the smaller revenue base.
I'll pass it to Brad here."

Let's go to Slide 6. On the top is the revenue bridge. Our top line organic revenue increased by 13% in the quarter with all 5 segments posting growth with strong demand in our Engineered Products, Pumps & Process Sol",503,"Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 6. On the top is the revenue bridge. Our top line organic revenue increased by 13% in the quarter with all 5 segments posting growth with strong demand in our Engineered Products, Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments. FX benefited the top line by about 1% or $21 million. Acquisitions added $18 million of revenue in the quarter. There was no year-over-year impact from dispositions. 
The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North America and Europe, our 2 largest regions, and modest growth across Asia and the rest of the world. The U.S., our largest market, posted 16% organic growth in the quarter on solid trading conditions in retail fueling, industrial automation, biopharma and can-making. Europe grew by 16% in the quarter on strong shipments in marking, coating, biopharma and industrial pumps, can-making and heat exchangers. All of Asia was up 5% organic on growth of biopharma and industrial pumps and heat exchangers, partially offset by year-over-year declines in polymer processing, below-ground retail fueling and fuel transport. China, which represents approximately half of our business in Asia, was up 8% organically in the quarter.
Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 25% organically, reflecting the continued broad-based momentum across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic growth across all 5 segments. 
Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide 7. On the top of the chart, adjusted segment EBIT was up $64 million, and adjusted EBIT margin improved 80 basis points as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset cost inflation and production stoppages. 
Going to the bottom chart. Adjusted net earnings improved by $57 million as higher segment EBIT and lower corporate expenses more than offset higher taxes. Deal expense in the quarter were $3 million. 
The effective tax rate for the third quarter, excluding tax discrete benefits, was approximately 21.8% compared to 21.5% in the prior year. And our effective tax rate estimate pre-discrete for Q4 in the full year remains unchanged at 21% to 22%. Discrete tax benefits were $8 million for the quarter or $4 million higher than in 2020 for approximately $0.03 of year-over-year EPS impact. 
Rightsizing and other costs were a $2 million reduction to adjusted earnings in the quarter as a onetime recovery related to a cancellation settlement more than offset our ongoing productivity and rightsizing initiatives.
Now on Slide 8. We are pleased with the cash performance thus far this year with cash -- with free cash flow of $667 million, a $104 million increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 11% of revenue year-to-date despite a nearly $250 million investment in working capital. 
As we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on delivering against our customers' strong order rates, and we are carrying high inventory levels to ensure we can meet current demand for the rest of the year and into next year. 
Let me turn it back to Rich."

I'm on Slide 9, which is a familiar format we used during the Investor Day in 2019 to describe our inorganic growth priorities. I'm pleased to report that our activity since then has aligned well with those priorities, and we remain busy adding logical and logistic bolt-ons that will support the long-term growth of our core businesses as you can see that we are investing in the highest priority platforms with an emphasis on high growth, high gross margin products and solutions.
We remain disciplined in our approach to acquisitions. And despite the challenging asset prices in today's environment, we have acquired 7 bolt-on acquisitions year-to-date that meet our investment return criteria, including 2 in the third quarter and 1 that closed last week. The most recent deals highlighted in green were CDS, an industrial 3D visualization software, which we expect to grow in third-party revenues and also adopt across the Dover portfolio in our journey towards digitizing the front end of our businesses, lowering our transaction costs; SP, which complements our aerospace and defense business, a software-driven signal intelligence solutions; and LIQAL, which is an emerging leader in LNG and hydrogen dispensing solutions. Each transaction is modest addition to our aggregate portfolio, but we are very excited about scaling up these innovative and strategic technologies over time and the positive impact to EPS as these investments mature. We remain on the hunt for acquisitions and have a solid M&A pipeline that aligns well with our portfolio priorities.
We also took advantage of recent market activity in the food equipment sector to sell Unified Brands, our professional cooking equipment business for commercial foodservice operators. The deal was announced in early October and is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Unified Brands represents less than 2% of our overall revenue, and its sale will have negligible impact on our '21 adjusted EPS. I would like to thank the management and employees of Unified Brands for the many years of service in the Dover family.
As we look to the end of the year, demand outlook remains favorable across the majority of the portfolio. Backlogs and bookings remain robust, and we expect to post strong organic growth in Q4. 
Overall, we remain on track to deliver strong returns this year through a combination of robust growth in revenue, operating profit and cash flow, coupled with disciplined capital allocation. We also look forward to closing out this year and laying the foundation for what we believe to be a positive demand environment in 2022.
We have clarity about the nature of the inflationary input and supply disruption costs that we have incurred in Q3 and expect to queue in Q4 due to the challenging operating environment, and we have conviction that we can turn them into profitability tailwinds as conditions improve and the calendar progresses from here. 
Before wrapping up, I would like to thank Dover for all their perseverance and accomplishments executing in today's environment. 
And with that, let's turn it to Q&A."

You just -- the logistics, if you think about refrigeration units, you think about ESG truck bodies, you think about vehicle lifts, you just get to the point where the cost of reworking those goods, putting in those last pieces of component parts as they arrive, the math doesn't make sense. And it gets really complicated, and then you just say we need to stop. Sometimes, you stop for 2 or 3 days. Sometimes, you stop for a shift, depending on inventory deliveries and everything else. But I would tell you that it would -- a lot of it is driven by the size of the goods, if you think about it that way. I mean if you're thinking about it like a pump, you can -- we've got enough warehousing space to take that. If you're thinking about truck bodies and you're thinking about refrigeration units, you get to the point where you're just better off taking the whole machine down for 2 or 3 days.

So where we are, and I think that I gave you the number, it was $25 million to $30 million of negativity in the 2 segments that you see dilution in the quarter. We expect that to compress some in Q4 which is driven by 2 things. One is the revenue in Q4 relative to Q3 and the fact that you've got a roll forward and the catch-up on pricing as you work off older-dated backlog. 
So as I was -- back to the question I was asked before, all things being equal, as that older-dated backlog reprices itself because of pricing actions taken through the year, that it becomes a negative -- it becomes a positive moving into Q1 under the assumption that things don't get worse from here and under the assumption that the market structure, the pricing in the market structure remains as it is today, which we believe it's going to, by the way."
