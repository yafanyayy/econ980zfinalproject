Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I hope that 2021 is off to a great start for all of you and that you and your loved ones are safe, healthy and ready for an exciting year ahead. As I reflect on the extraordinary events of 2020, it's clear we are living in a time unlike any other in our history. Without question, the COVID-19 pandemic changed nearly every aspect of our lives. For some, the impact has been and continues to be devastating. Our hearts and our support continue to go out to those suffering or facing great loss. 
Despite the rapidly changing landscape, our focus has remained clear. Ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers and partners, keeping our data centers safely operating around the world and continuing to be a source of strength for our communities. I'd like to take a moment here to thank our employees for not only enduring but excelling in the face of adversity and for powerfully demonstrating our commitment to be in service to: in service to each other, to our customers, to our shareholders, and to the communities in which we live and operate. 
In the midst of all that has transpired, our business model has proven resilient, and we continue to innovate, execute and deliver for our customers. We closed over 17,500 deals in 2020, reflecting the strength of our value proposition and highlighting the tremendous scale and momentum of our go-to-market engine. We expanded our scale and reach, both organically and through M&A, solidifying our position as a leading digital infrastructure provider in Canada, entering the Mexico market and announcing our GPX transaction in India, which we believe will be an ideal springboard in this large and growing market. We completed 16 new expansions, our most active build year ever, and have a sizable construction road map still ahead to support our backlog and healthy pipeline. 
We've introduced transformative capabilities on Equinix Fabric and Network Edge, revolutionizing the way enterprises connect to digital infrastructure and we launched Equinix Metal, a fully automated and interconnected bare metal as a service offering that provides even greater flexibility for customers to place their digital infrastructure where they need it, when they need it. We also had a very active year in the capital markets, leveraging our investment-grade ratings to refinance our debt, driving substantial interest savings into the business as reflected in our AFFO per share metric. 
For the year, we delivered $6 billion in revenue, completing our 72nd consecutive quarterly top line increase and amazing 18 years of continuous revenue growth. In terms of the road ahead, one post-pandemic reality is already clear: our world is increasingly and inescapably more digital. Digital is reshaping our everyday lives and is impacting every element of our customers' businesses, not just how they interact with their customers, but how they interact with their data, how they collaborate and innovate, how they support their employees, how they engage partners, how they architect their network. Everything is changing. Digital transformation is reshaping the competitive landscape across every sector of the global economy and is fueling demand for a new generation of digital infrastructure. Infrastructure that is more distributed, more cloud connected and more flexible, characteristics that represent the hallmarks of Platform Equinix. As service providers build out their infrastructure to capture burgeoning digital demand and enterprise customers embrace hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice, Equinix continues to play a key role as a nexus for advancing their digital transformation journeys. 
We believe that the overall market for digital infrastructure will continue to expand significantly, creating a massive long-term opportunity for those providers able to adapt to the evolving needs of digital buyers. We believe Equinix is uniquely positioned to capture this expanding addressable market, and we entered 2021 with a clear set of priorities to build on our market leadership, reinforce our competitive advantage and invest in targeted ways to position us for sustained value creation. 
First, supporting our people and strengthening our extraordinary culture will continue to be at the center of our strategy. People are foundational to how we will navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead. And our goal is to ensure that our culture creates a sense of opportunity and belonging for all our employees, affording us a durable source of competitive advantage. This year, we're expanding our award-winning sustainability ambitions, a priority that has resonated with both employees and customers as diversity, inclusion, social justice and climate change all remain front and center on the global stage. Equinix is an important component of greening digital infrastructure, and we have seen a significant increase in customer interest in this area. We continue to expand our efforts around renewables coverage, energy efficiency projects, green building certifications as well as our pursuit of science-based targets and innovative techniques to push sustainability forward in all 3 regions. 
Second, we will focus on simplifying and scaling our business to drive long-term operating leverage and enhance our customer experience. This will include targeted efforts aimed at streamlining and automating, ordering and billing, enabling channel self-service and delivering enhanced digital engagement options for our customers. In parallel, we'll continue to evolve and scale our highly productive go-to-market engine, investing in more quota-bearing headcount and leveraging our growing channel to amplify our reach to prosecute the opportunity in front of us. 
Third, we'll continue to expand our global reach with an ambitious plan across both retail and xScale in direct response to customer demand. And fourth, we'll accelerate our digital services business, adding new product capabilities, expanding market availability and augmenting our go-to-market motion, all aimed at accelerating new customer acquisition and positioning us for future growth as we drive attach rate across our expansive customer base. 
Turning to our results. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full year were $6 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% year-over-year and AFFO per share grew 12% year-over-year. Interconnection revenues grew 14% year-over-year, driven by strong adoption of Equinix Fabric and solid interconnection ads. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. 
Our longer-term product road map and platform vision continue to advance to support our position as the world's digital infrastructure company. We now have over 392,000 interconnections and continue to build out ecosystem density across our metros. In Q4, we added an incremental 7,700 interconnections, more than our top 15 competitors combined, fueled by continued strength in network and cloud connectivity. 
Internet exchange saw significant increases, both in port capacity and traffic growth, with peak traffic up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 43% year-over-year, driven by cloud, content and gaming segments. Equinix Fabric also saw strong growth, driven by port additions as well as existing customers upgrading to higher speed connections and increasing their use of our intrametro offering. We also launched a new capability that allows Equinix Fabric users to quickly and easily connect to any other customer on Platform Equinix, unlocking the full value of our scaled digital ecosystems. And with Equinix Fabric integration built into both Network Edge and Equinix Metal, digital leaders are finding it easier than ever to use Equinix to create and connect their foundational infrastructure. In its first quarter as an Equinix branded product, Equinix Metal demonstrated solid momentum and is now available in 8 global metros, with plans for an additional 10 markets early this year. 
On the xScale side of our business, we continue to be very pleased with our JV strategy and are making significant progress expanding the reach and scale of that business. As planned, xScale is enabling us to extend our product set, capture hyperscale demand and deepen cloud density, while leveraging our balance sheet with the JV structure. We have an ambitious plan for 2021 and are resourcing xScale to accelerate growth. Plans include incrementing our existing JVs, entering in new markets such as Australia and evaluating new options to broaden our reach and leverage our existing land bank. We currently have 8 xScale builds underway, spanning all 3 regions and are moving forward with the second phase of Tokyo 12, given early success in this market. 
Now let me cover highlights from the verticals. Our Network vertical, again, achieved record bookings, driven by carriers upgrading core, edge and mobile networks to address shifting traffic patterns resulting from the pandemic as well as continued strength in enterprise resale. Network service providers have proven to be some of our most productive channel partners, which has led to sustained momentum in this vertical. New wins and expansions included Ciena Networks, a Danish network provider, connecting to partners in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and London, as well as a Fortune 500 cable operator, leveraging Equinix to rearchitect core infrastructure for cloud access to support video-on-demand caching and delivery. 
Our Financial Services vertical also had a record quarter, led by multinational financial services firms, with particular strength in the Americas. Expansions included a Global 2000 fintech player, expanding their equity options present to access our dense financial ecosystem and a Fortune 500 insurance company, implementing a hybrid cloud strategy on Platform Equinix. 
Our Content and Digital Media vertical saw particular strength in video and digital advertising as companies are investing to bring their services directly to consumers. New wins, including one of the largest shopping and e-commerce retail groups, deploying infrastructure to support digital e-commerce activities and Index Exchange, a top independent global ad tech marketplace expanding compute nodes to manage increasing traffic from customers. 
Our Cloud & IT vertical delivered solid bookings, increasing density and coverage of software-as-a-service providers and winning new cloud on-ramps in smaller markets, including Dubai and Melbourne. Expansions included Fortinet, a global cybersecurity platform provider, expanding to support scale and user experience and ServiceNow, deploying infrastructure closer to users in Europe to optimize performance, enhance user experience and support their rapid growth. 
Our Enterprise vertical had a strong quarter driven by health care and retail as telehealth and digital initiatives see continued momentum. Work-from-home and collaboration-related use cases remain active, although less than peak pandemic levels as enterprises shift their focus back to broader digital transformation initiatives. New enterprise wins included Atrium Health, the largest health system in the Southeastern U.S. deploying digital infrastructure to enable compliant, multi-cloud and business partner interconnection as well as a Fortune 500 manufacturing company deploying digital infrastructure at Equinix to facilitate cloud connection. 
And our channel program had another great quarter, accounting for 35% of bookings. We saw particular strength with our hyperscale and technology alliance partners, capturing wins across a wide range of industry segments focused on digital transformation efforts as well as pandemic response. New partner wins included a Canadian automobile parts manufacturer, accessing our Network & Cloud density to interconnect to the connected car and broader automotive ecosystems. We continue to expect channel bookings to be an important pillar of our go-to-market strategy in 2021 and beyond. 
Now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."

As Charles noted, we're living in unique times, and I hope you and your families are healthy and well.

As Charles noted, we're living in unique times, and I hope you and your families are healthy and well. Despite the challenges of 2020, the Equinix team rallied at all levels of the organization and delivered another strong year for our investors, our customers and our employees. We ended the year on a high note with record gross bookings, strong inter and intra-reaching deal flow activity, positive net pricing actions and a healthy sales pipeline as we head into 2021. Also, we ended the year with significant backlog of cabinets booked but not yet installed. And consistent with my prior quarter's comment, we anticipate a meaningful increase in our cabinets billing metric in the first half of 2021. 
So simply put, we continue to drive value on both the top line and at a per share level. And our core strategy as the world's digital infrastructure company continues to separate us from our peers. In the year ahead, we're leaning into our product and services initiatives, scaling and automating our business and investing to expand our platform. We're also managing substantial construction activity at a level previously not seen. With 44 major expansion projects currently underway across 30 markets and 20 countries, including 8 xScale builds. Our build efforts are dollar-weighted towards major metros that generate over $100 million in revenues. Both the OpEx and CapEx investments are driving and supporting the continued volume of high-quality interconnection rich wins across both our direct and indirect channels, resulting in durable, long-term value creation for our shareholders. 
We've also been active in the capital markets, benefiting from our investment-grade ratings that helped drove down our cost of borrow. Over the past 2 years, we raised over $11.5 billion in capital, funding the growth and scale of the business, while lowering our overall blended cost to borrow by approximately 160 basis points, another value driver, as reflected in our AFFO per share metrics. 
Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $1.564 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year and better than expectations, in part due to strong NRR activity, although offset in part by a one-off accounting adjustment. We enjoyed another quarter of net positive pricing actions, a strong reflection of how our operating model differs from our peers. Q4 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $9 million benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Looking forward, we expect NRR activity to decrease in Q1, although step up again in Q2. 
Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $711 million or 45% of revenues, up 5% over the same quarter last year, outperforming our expectations due to favorable revenue mix, strong operating performance and lower utility costs. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, included a $4 million net FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 AFFO was $517 million, meaningfully above our expectations on a constant currency basis due to strong operating performance while absorbing seasonally higher recurring CapEx investments, a similar scenario to prior years. Consistent with AFFO, our operating cash flows increased significantly in the quarter, largely due to strong collection activities. Interconnection revenues were greater than 18% of recurring revenues, showing continued strong momentum across each of our regions, both on a dollar basis and as a percent of our recurring revenues. 
Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were our fastest-growing revenue regions on a year-over-year normalized basis, both growing 11%, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw its third consecutive quarter of record gross bookings with firm pricing, a high mix of midsized deals and our highest number of new logos in 2 years. Additionally, the team continued to sell across the global platform, delivering on our second consecutive quarter of record exports to the other 2 regions. Americas interconnection adds remained strong. Cabinet billing trended back to normal levels, and we expect a large step-up in cabinet billing in the first half of 2021.  Bell Canada assets had a good start under the Equinix banner and our integration efforts remain on track. 
Our EMEA region saw solid bookings in the quarter, including our best intra region in 2 years, with firm pricing led by activity in both our Amsterdam and Frankfurt markets. Revenue growth remains strong, although we expect some 2021 moderation as we lap past our successful cross-connect repricing initiative in 2020. Also, we're investing broadly in our growth and emerging markets, or GEMs to meet the anticipated demand in these edge metros. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had its second best gross bookings quarter with a solid mix of small ecosystem accretive deals in our Singapore and Japan businesses. Utilization rates remain high. We expect to bring new capacity online over the coming quarters in key markets to ease the anticipated capacity constraints. 
And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. At year-end, our balance sheet is greater than $27 billion, including unrestricted cash of approximately $1.6 billion, a meaningful decrease over the prior quarter due to the close of the Bell Canada asset acquisition and the settlement of debt refinanced in the quarter. Also, we moved our Paris 9 asset into the EMEA JV and closed our Japan JV with GIC in December. As a result, net of our equity investment, the JVs reimburses over $300 million in the quarter. At year-end, our xScale joint ventures had total assets on their balance sheet of greater than $1 billion, including the capital deployed. In 2021, you should continue to expect a meaningful increase in xScale activity. 
Our net debt levels remain low relative to our peers at 3.8x our Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA within our targeted range. Over the past 2 years, we refinanced a large portion of our historically high-yield debt structure. Yet, we still have another $1.8 billion of debt to refinance over the coming quarters, which at current rates, would result in another $50 million plus of annualized interest savings. 
Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $834 million, including a recurring CapEx of $74 million a meaningful increase over the prior quarter, but as expected. Our construction and procurement teams continue to actively manage our expansion pipeline, delivering capacity at robust build levels, while incorporating the health, safety and well-being of our internal and external teams. Over the past year, we've experienced an average construction delay of a few weeks due to the pandemic, a trend that we will continue to monitor and assess. 
In Q4, we opened 4 new expansion projects, D.C., Frankfurt, Paris and São Paulo. Additionally, we added 7 projects to our expansion tracking sheet, including our entrée Genoa link in support of the subsea cable landing station opportunity. Genoa 1 will have a direct fiber access to [ Mellon 5, ] our new flagship facility in this metro later to open in Q1. We continue to expand our ownership, acquiring land for development in Genoa, Madrid, Mexico City, Milan and São Paulo. Revenues from owned assets currently represent about 55%. 
Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 147 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, a step down over the prior quarter due to the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on our non-U.S. stabilized assets. As a reminder, similar to prior years, we plan to update our stabilized asset summary on the Q1 earnings call. 
Please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending GPX India acquisition. Starting with revenues for 2021, we expect top line growth of 10% to 11%, reflecting the continued momentum in the business and favorable FX rates relative to the prior year. On a normalized basis, revenues are expected to grow 7% to 8% over the prior year. MRR churn is expected to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter for the year. For Q1, we expect the MRR churn to be at the lower end of this range. We expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 47%, excluding integration costs, the result of operating leverage in the business, offset by investments in our product, xScale and business simplification initiatives. We expect to incur $30 million of integration costs in 2021 for various acquisitions. 
2021 AFFO was expected to grow 10% to 12% compared to the previous year. AFFO per share is expected to grow 8% to 10%, including integration costs. We've excluded any capital market activities here. 2021 CapEx is expected to be $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion, including approximately $180 million of recurring CapEx spend, which represents about 3% of our revenues. This guidance also includes approximately $250 million of on-balance sheet spend related to xScale projects, which we expect to be reimbursed for in the future as we move or sell assets into either our current or future JVs. And finally, we expect our 2021 cash dividends to increase to slightly greater than $1 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year or an 8% increase on a per share basis. 
So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles."

Undoubtedly, as with all times of transition and transformation, there will continue to be challenges ahead. But I am as optimistic as ever about our business and the opportunity to serve our customers, partners and shareholders as the world's digital infrastructure company. We need to continue to invest in extending our market leadership and ensuring our long-term relevance to the expansive opportunity presented by digital transformation. 
As a society and as a company, we learned a lot in 2020. And I believe there are plethora of silver linings that will come from this past year.

I think that we're seeing, as we've talked about in the past, it's getting harder and harder to grow on a very -- a much larger base. And I think -- and doing that while maintaining a level of discipline on the strategy. And so that's definitely our focus. We believe that that's the way to continue to drive value creation. We're seeing strong uptake in terms of customers being resonant with the value proposition, but it does take a lot of productivity to drive the bookings that are going to fuel the kind of growth rates that we're seeing at given the size of the business overall. 
I think in terms of the investments, yes, we do believe that those are going to continue to translate to us sustaining and hopefully maybe increasing growth rates over time. But I think -- and I think we've already seen that. I think without the investments that we've made in the past, into our product teams, in particular, and into other areas of business like xScale, I think -- I don't think we would have seen growth that we saw in 2020. And so I think it has been a an opportunity for us to invest in the business and generate returns. 
I think one factor on operating margins, I think, in 2020, going into 2021, 2020 was an unusual year. And I think it was a difficult time for our world overall. I think we made a decision to both continue to invest in our people in various ways that we've given you visibility to in our last several calls and give them confidence that they'd have their jobs. And I stand by that decision is the right one for the company, and I'm confident that the long-term return on that decision is compelling. 
But it's -- interestingly, I think as we -- I guess, partially expected, employee turnover fell significantly. Because I think as people sought the security of a really strong employer like Equinix, and they probably fell even more than we anticipated. And really, to some degree, reduces your range emotion of the business. I think when it falls and yet you're wanting to continue to evolve and adapt your workforce to the changing needs of business and the strategy at hand, you're left with the decision as to whether add and kind of overrun where you thought you were going to be from a headcount standpoint or whether you delay doing that in an effort to sort of stay tighter on the expense side. Like many, we probably ended somewhere in between. And -- but undoubtedly, I think that's a contributing factor in terms of growth of SG&A as a percentage of revenue. 
And reversing that trend is a priority for us in 2021 and beyond. But we do like we needed to make these investments need to continue these investments in the business because I think the opportunity associated with the digital transformation sort of needs of our customers are significant, and I think we're uniquely positioned to play into those. Keith, anything you want to add, buddy?"

I think the other thing that's very telling about '21 over '20, and particularly as you look into Q1, there's a meaningful step down in our nonrecurring revenue. And as we've said before, it tends to be lumpy. We said there'd be a step-up in Q2. That ties in nicely to the incremental cabinet additions that we should -- we expect as a business. And so that's sort of playing in too. 
The other thing that we can't lose sight of is the level of price increases that went through last year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that we're going to lap over that. And so you get -- you don't get the same benefit, but you get it in your run rate. And then the last thing I would just say is that we continue to invest in xScale, and I talked about a lot of activity taking place there. But we're not yet banking on that as it relates to how the year will progress, either in fees or contribution from our equity interest in the JV and so that's sort of what's going on with the business. 
And again, when you look at overall, 10% to 11%, recognizing normalized is 7% to 8%. I'll tell you, maybe just one other thing that really comes to note here. Again, the Americas region grew about 4%, as I said last quarter in my prepared remarks. As you come through Q1, you'll continue to see relatively modest growth in the Americas, but then you'll see the acceleration through the last 3 quarters of the year. And that's what was really exciting about what we see in the plan. So part of it is just timing based, part of it is the impact of nonrecurring revenue, part of it is the price increases. But overall, we feel very confident in the numbers that we'll put forth here."

And we saw a little bit of timing, adverse timing again this quarter and a little bit of unforecasted churn that pushed us up to [ 2.6%]. So I'm a tad reluctant to tell you we're back in range in Q1, but I do believe that's our firm expectation. 
So we -- I would say that there -- if you look at it, there were several churns over the last couple of quarters that were from acquired assets that were the types of deployments that we wouldn't generally be targeting. And so I don't think it's a fundamental sort of issue in the business as it is, I think, some of the things that weren't -- aren't really part of our strategy moving through. The other thesis that's similar to that is about 20 bps of the Q4 churn, was associated with large, lower margin managed services deal in Europe. And so again, I think when you back those things out, you're really looking at sort of a level of churn performance within the business that's pretty consistent with our expectations. 
Churn is definitely a focus for us in the year ahead. And I do think kind of where we land on a full year on a revenue basis is going to really depend on where we can land in the churn range that we forecasted through the course of the year. So it's going to be a critical area of focus for us. But nothing fundamental that we're seeing just volatility in terms of or just movement in terms of people evolving their architectures and the normal frictional churn that exists in our business. But I think nothing beyond that."

It's really a core part of the value proposition and fuels the rest of the business in terms of the strength of the value proposition when it comes to digital transformation. 
You mentioned specifically pricing, obviously, we had tremendous success implementing a pricing sort of normalization effort in Europe over the course of 2020. We're largely through that now. And so as Keith said, that's impacting the year-over-year compare on revenue growth in Europe, but we're now seeing those benefits sort of built into our run rate. 
In terms of broader opportunity for pricing adjustments, I think that we're continuing -- we'll continue to evaluate that. I don't -- I wouldn't see anything meaningful on the horizon for us there. I think we, obviously, just coming off the European adjustments. But I think that we do have to continue to look at both our underlying costs and the trajectory of those. and whether or not adjustments are needed for us to continue to maintain our margin profile. And then also, the real focus for us is looking at the value delivered to our customers. And we do think it is it is so substantial as they look at implementing Equinix Fabric, for example, as a foundational part of their hybrid multi-cloud architectures that we feel comfortable that we're going to be able to continue to get strong pricing from the interconnection offerings. 
And then last point, Keith did mention we're expecting sort of strong cabinet adds because of the strong backlog. And yes, that's going to -- it is going to continue to fuel interconnection, because we're seeing really good sort of ratios in terms of -- because we're maintaining a level of discipline in the strategy, and we're not reliant on these super large footprint deals that are poorly interconnected. We are seeing cabinets fuel interconnection growth. And so overall, I think those things will move nicely in tandem."

Sure. Yes, I mean, I talked about that we're really seeing digital take off and be a Board-level priority for people, and it's changing the way, as I said, people think about not only electronic commerce and digital interaction with their customers, but how they think about data and how they're using AI to create competitive advantage, how they're architecting their networks. And those last 2 examples are 2 really good ones of that are central to what we have in our funnel today and what's fueling our strong bookings on a quarter-over-quarter level. And that is that people thinking about using Equinix as a nexus for their data, locating their data there, intersecting it with cloud services across the globe to create insights and egress those insights to the people within the business that need them. And then network re-architecture has been bread and butter for us for a very long time in Equinix Fabric and then things like Network Edge and now Metal even adding to the mix there, really substantially improving the way people can and accelerate in the way people are thinking about network re-architecture. 
And in terms of how it's affecting our -- I would just say this. I think that if you look at our mix of business, if you look at the kind of volumes that we're doing, 17,500 transactions over the course of the year, it is we're really focused on those sort of -- on those sweet spots in our business where we can demonstrate differentiated value. And I think that's why we're seeing such strong pricing. We continue to see positive pricing actions and firm even spot pricing, in many ways, in our business because I think the value proposition is so strong. And so -- and I -- but I do think it's still at a point where these are not really short sales cycles. There's a lot of solution selling still being done with us and through -- and in combination with our partners. And it's why we need to continue to invest in re-architecting and refining and adding capabilities to our selling organization, including scaling our channel. And so those are areas of investment we're making. 
And I do think that the prospect is, over time, those -- I would say that I don't think sales cycles are lengthening. And in fact, if anything, I think they're starting to shorten, in particular, follow-on sales cycles, meaning after you've already brought a customer in, that first win with the customer is still -- it can be pretty extended. But follow-on sales cycles, I think, are shortening. And I think that hopefully, that points to us continuing to add even further productivity from the selling engine going forward."

I mean I do think that we're seeing -- in fact, if you look over a multiyear period, I think you've seen a pretty substantial acceleration of the enterprise component of our business. And I think that is really tapping into the traditional service provider density that we -- and ecosystem density that we have as well as our geographic reach and how that plays into hybrid and multi-cloud and distributed architecture as an end state for enterprise customers. 
And so it's interesting because if you are -- the way we report externally, it has network service. We talk about our Network segment, our Financial Services segment and then Enterprise. In reality, all of those 3 segments have significant enterprise components because our enterprise resale and the Network vertical is reported there in terms of how we look at that, but we have a meaning piece of that -- meaningful piece, which is enterprise business that's sold through a network service provider partner. And then on the Financial Services side, yes, we have our trading ecosystem, but actually, the larger piece of that is Enterprise Financial Services business. And obviously, Enterprise I mean, financial services is one of the markets with a very large IT spend and a very, I think, thoughtful and aggressive agenda about moving to hybrid and multi-cloud as their long-term architecture. 
So all that has created this enterprise momentum for our business over the last several years and I think that absolutely continues into 2021. And like I said, I think that our selling engine is quite productive. It's not yet -- I don't think we're -- we haven't crossed the chasm by any means, but I actually think that's a -- it's really a good thing when you look at the overall Equinix thesis because I think you're looking at a very large addressable market, and we're still in the early innings of tapping that market. And so that means that solution selling takes a little bit longer to get people over the hurdle and really get them through thinking about their hybrid and multi-cloud end state and how we play in that. But as you -- I think as you get them over the hurdle, there's just a lot more wallet share to be gained. And so I think there is an acceleration opportunity for us. And I would expect enterprise to over-index as a segment for us in 2021."

One of the things we spoke of last quarter was there are a number of one-off items that we're going through the quarter. And so then you look at the guide that we offered in Q1 and then for the year. 
I think it's important when one of the things we said is we'll see a recovery of that. There's some one-off costs that were in Q3. They were benefiting us or one of benefits, I should say, there's one-off costs in Q4. But when you look into Q1, you get to see an EBITDA performance that is substantially up relative to what you would have previously maybe anticipated. Q1 tends to be one of our lower EBITDA quarters. But you can see that we're stepping it up on adjusted $19 million to $39 million. So it gives you a sense of meaningful step-up in the quarter, and that includes absorbing $10 million -- net $10 million, but I would refer to as seasonal costs. 
And then as you look through the tail end or through the next 3 quarters, typically, you'd see -- typically what you'd see in how we're modeling it is for EBITDA margins would continue to increase throughout the year. And then you sort of take that thinking on a lot of what Charles has said, and then you sort of translate that into our AFFO. Again, one of the things we said if you look at it in total, AFFO is growing nicely. When you look at it at the share level, it's growing 8% to 10%. So the fact of the matter is, if you back out integration costs, which are, again, they're specific to -- generally to the acquisition of Bell Canada, you're going to see our AFFO per share grow about 10% to 12% this coming year. 
So there's a lot of value coming into the business. There's a lot of value coming from xScale. But there's still the potential of much more to come if we execute against our strategy. And as I said in at least in my prepared remarks, there is a tremendous amount of activity that we will be embarking upon through this year with xScale. And we're optimistic that, that will continue to drive more value to not only the margin line, but also to our core metric, which is AFFO per share."

And I think that expanded operating margins are and -- are still a priority for us going forward. 
And again, I think we -- rather than try to squeeze it too tight and not make enough room to open up the longer-term opportunity, we made a decision to make those investments this year, and we think that's the right one.

And so there are deals that we've signed, effectively, they're booked, just not installed. And so we are going to see that momentum. And that's why we have the confidence not only in where we think the revenues will go, but also the momentum that we see through the rest of the year."

If you're talking about, I think, the broader U.S. colo market beyond our U.S. and Americas colo market, I do think there is -- the dynamics may create pressure on that market and which is why I think we need to continue to distinguish ourselves and",248,"Yes. If you're talking about, I think, the broader U.S. colo market beyond our U.S. and Americas colo market, I do think there is -- the dynamics may create pressure on that market and which is why I think we need to continue to distinguish ourselves and focus our -- be very disciplined about our targeting and how we're prosecuting the business. 
I think there's always a continuum in terms of the strength of the value proposition and therefore, how differentiated you can be on pricing. But again, I would point to the fact that we, across our regions are our quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating positive -- net positive pricing actions, meaning that when we do have a reprice, for example, those are generally being offset by our ability to sustain pricing increases in our contracts, which I think is a really good sign for the business in terms of our ability to do that. 
So I think undifferentiated colo is going to continue to struggle to maintain price points. And people are either -- are looking for either lowering price and/or looking for new ways or new markets, a lot of them tilting towards hyperscale, which they're certainly not going to find a lot of relief on pricing there. And so I do think the broader market has a translation or a challenge there. But I think we've -- we're not immune from that, but I think we're substantially more insulated, and I think our metrics really demonstrate that."

Is the goal ultimately to maintain 8% to 10% AFFO per share growth, one way or the other?

So specifically, as it relates to our capital market activity, again, we're very specific about we didn't want to include anything in the guidance. So again, if you take out integration cost, AFFO per share will grow 10% to 12%. So we feel really good about where we are. And as you will -- I think many of you will recall, based on the June 2018 Analyst Day, we thought anywhere from 8% to 12% was a reasonable growth rate for AFFO, and we're tracking well against those models that we developed back in 2018. 
That all said, when you look at what we plan to do this year, we have a very large capital build the thing I think of the most is how do we go to our lowest cost of capital, which is basically incremental debt. And so what you're going to see is we're going to refinance out of the debt as appropriate. We'll pick our timing accordingly. We'll get, over some period of time, the annualized benefit of $50 million plus. And then to the extent that we can or we have capacity, we theoretically could raise a little bit more debt because, again, that would be our cheapest source of capital. 
As you're also aware, we do have our ATM program. Last year, we announced a $1.5 billion program, but we'll use that appropriate as market conditions allow, we would walk through the door, to the extent they don't, then we would preserve that capital for a later date. But again, we're always going to bring a little bit of balance to our capital structure. We're going to make sure that we have liquidity on our balance sheet. We have the cash right now. As we announced in our prepared remarks, $1.6 billion plus $2 billion of incremental liquidity from our line. And I'm just -- I remain very optimistic about the amount of cash that we generate in the business as well as the return of capital from the JV as we continue to invest in building out some of these assets, we'll get some more incremental capital from our JV partners as we scale the business. 
So again, Colby, I think it's a great question. 8% to 10% is sort of a very comfortable range and where we feel we can deliver through 2021. And we'll update you further on -- I think we're going to do the June -- at the June Analyst Day, we'll update you a little bit further on our longer-term view of what we think we can accomplish as a company."

We're also investing in the go-to-market motion to continue to adapt that. We're currently executing with an overlay and continuing to refine our thinking on how best to scale that market, but accelerating our overall digital services portfolio, which would include Fabric and Metal and Network Edge and others is a clear priority for us in the year ahead, as I said in our prepared remarks. 
So we're really excited, we believe because you did put that in the context of -- we think that, that can continue to drive yields. We think return on invested capital for those offerings is going to be very attractive over time. And we think, importantly, they're really responsive to the needs of our customers as they think about how digital transformation, what their digital transformation journey looks like. So you'll hear a lot more from us on what the multiyear view is for those products as we move towards Analyst Day. 
And then Fed, look, we actually -- we're bullish. We think that there's more opportunity we -- and I think it's something that we're putting a little bit of energy behind. And I can't speak in significant depth on.

Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I hope that 2021 is off to a great start for all of you and that you and your loved ones are safe, healthy and ready for an exciting year ahead. As I reflect on the extraordinary events of 2020, it's clear we are living in a time unlike any other in our history. Without question, the COVID-19 pandemic changed nearly every aspect of our lives. For some, the impact has been and continues to be devastating. Our hearts and our support continue to go out to those suffering or facing great loss.
Despite the rapidly changing landscape, our focus has remained clear, ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees, customers and partners, keeping our data centers safely operating around the world and continuing to be a source of strength for our communities. I would like to take a moment here to thank our employees for not only enduring but excelling in the face of adversity and for powerfully demonstrating our commitment to be in service to: in service to each other, to our customers, to our shareholders and to the communities in which we live and operate.
In the midst of all that has transpired, our business model has proven resilient, and we continue to innovate, execute and deliver for our customers. We closed over 17,500 deals in 2020, reflecting the strength of our value proposition and highlighting the tremendous scale and momentum of our go-to-market engine. We expanded our scale and reach, both organically and through M&A, solidifying our position as a leading digital infrastructure provider in Canada, entering the Mexico market and announcing our GPX transaction in India, which we believe will be an ideal springboard in this large and growing market. We completed 16 new expansions, our most active build year ever, and have a sizable construction road map still ahead to support our backlog and healthy pipeline.
We've introduced transformative capabilities on Equinix Fabric and Network Edge, revolutionizing the way enterprises connect to digital infrastructure. And we launched Equinix Metal, a fully automated and interconnected Bare Metal as a Service offering that provides even greater flexibility for customers to place their digital infrastructure where they need it, when they need it. We also had a very active year in the capital markets, leveraging our investment-grade ratings to refinance our debt, driving substantial interest savings into the business as reflected in our AFFO per share metric.
For the year, we delivered $6 billion in revenue, completing our 72nd consecutive quarterly top line increase, an amazing 18 years of continuous revenue growth. In terms of the road ahead, one post-pandemic reality is already clear: our world is increasingly and inescapably more digital. Digital is reshaping our everyday lives and is impacting every element of our customers' businesses, not just how they interact with their customers, but how they interact with their data, how they collaborate and innovate, how they support their employees, how they engage partners, how they architect their network. Everything is changing.
Digital transformation is reshaping the competitive landscape across every sector of the global economy and is fueling demand for a new generation of digital infrastructure, infrastructure that is more distributed, more cloud-connected and more flexible, characteristics that represent the hallmarks of Platform Equinix. As service providers build out their infrastructure to capture burgeoning digital demand and enterprise customers embrace hybrid and multicloud as the architecture of choice, Equinix continues to play a key role as a nexus for advancing their digital transformation journeys.
We believe that the overall market for digital infrastructure will continue to expand significantly, creating a massive long-term opportunity for those providers able to adapt to the evolving needs of digital buyers. We believe Equinix is uniquely positioned to capture this expanding addressable market, and we entered 2021 with a clear set of priorities to build on our market leadership, reinforce our competitive advantage and invest in targeted ways to position us for sustained value creation.
First, supporting our people and strengthening our extraordinary culture will continue to be at the center of our strategy. People are foundational to how we will navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead. And our goal is to ensure that our culture creates a sense of opportunity and belonging for all our employees, affording us a durable source of competitive advantage. This year, we're expanding our award-winning sustainability ambitions, a priority that has resonated with both employees and customers as diversity, inclusion, social justice and climate change all remain front and center on the global stage.
Equinix is an important component of greening digital infrastructure, and we have seen a significant increase in customer interest in this area. We continue to expand our efforts around renewables coverage, energy efficiency projects, green building certifications as well as our pursuit of science-based targets and innovative techniques to push sustainability forward in all 3 regions.
Second, we will focus on simplifying and scaling our business to drive long-term operating leverage and enhance our customer experience. This will include targeted efforts aimed at streamlining and automating, ordering and billing, enabling channel self-service and delivering enhanced digital engagement options for our customers. In parallel, we'll continue to evolve and scale our highly productive go-to-market engine, investing in more quota-bearing headcount and leveraging our growing channel to amplify our reach to prosecute the opportunity in front of us.
Third, we'll continue to expand our global reach with an ambitious plan across both retail and xScale in direct response to customer demand. And fourth, we'll accelerate our digital services business, adding new product capabilities, expanding market availability and augmenting our go-to-market motion, all aimed at accelerating new customer acquisition and positioning us for future growth as we drive attach rate across our expansive customer base.
Turning to our results. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full year were $6 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% year-over-year. And AFFO per share grew 12% year-over-year. Interconnection revenues grew 14% year-over-year driven by strong adoption of Equinix Fabric and solid interconnection adds. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis.
Our longer-term product road map and platform vision continue to advance to support our position as the world's digital infrastructure company. We now have over 392,000 interconnections and continue to build out ecosystem density across our metros. In Q4, we added an incremental 7,700 interconnections, more than our top 15 competitors combined, fueled by continued strength in network and cloud connectivity.
Internet exchange saw significant increases, both in port capacity and traffic growth, with peak traffic up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 43% year-over-year driven by cloud, content and gaming segments. Equinix Fabric also saw strong growth driven by port additions as well as existing customers upgrading to higher speed connections and increasing their use of our inter-metro offering. We also launched a new capability that allows Equinix Fabric users to quickly and easily connect to any other customer on Platform Equinix, unlocking the full value of our scaled digital ecosystems. And with Equinix Fabric integration built into both Network Edge and Equinix Metal, digital leaders are finding it easier than ever to use Equinix to create and connect their foundational infrastructure.
In its first quarter as an Equinix-branded product, Equinix Metal demonstrated solid momentum and is now available in 8 global metros, with plans for an additional 10 markets early this year.
On the xScale side of our business, we continue to be very pleased with our JV strategy and are making significant progress expanding the reach and scale of that business. As planned, xScale is enabling us to extend our product set, capture hyperscale demand and deepen cloud density, while leveraging our balance sheet with the JV structure. We have an ambitious plan for 2021 and are resourcing xScale to accelerate growth. Plans include incrementing our existing JVS, entering in new markets such as Australia and evaluating new options to broaden our reach and leverage our existing land bank. We currently have 8 xScale builds underway, spanning all 3 regions, and are moving forward with the second phase of Tokyo 12, given early success in this market.
Now let me cover highlights from the verticals. Our network vertical again achieved record bookings driven by carriers upgrading core, edge and mobile networks to address shifting traffic patterns resulting from the pandemic as well as continued strength in enterprise resale. Network service providers have proven to be some of our most productive channel partners, which has led to sustained momentum in this vertical. New wins and expansions included Telia Networks, a Danish network provider, connecting to partners in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and London, as well as a Fortune 500 cable operator, leveraging Equinix to rearchitect core infrastructure for cloud access to support video-on-demand caching and delivery.
Our financial services vertical also had a record quarter, led by multinational financial services firms, with particular strength in the Americas. Expansions included a Global 2000 fintech player, expanding their equity options present to access our dense financial ecosystem, and a Fortune 500 insurance company, implementing a hybrid cloud strategy on Platform Equinix.
Our content and digital media vertical saw particular strength in video and digital advertising as companies are investing to bring their services directly to consumers. New wins, including one of the largest shopping and e-commerce retail groups, deploying infrastructure to support digital e-commerce activities and Index Exchange, a top independent global ad tech marketplace, expanding compute nodes to manage increasing traffic from customers.
Our cloud & IT vertical delivered solid bookings, increasing density and coverage of Software-as-a-Service providers and winning new cloud on-ramps in smaller markets, including Dubai and Melbourne. Expansions included Fortinet, a global cybersecurity platform provider, expanding to support scale and user experience, and ServiceNow, deploying infrastructure closer to users in Europe to optimize performance, enhance user experience and support their rapid growth.
Our enterprise vertical had a strong quarter driven by health care and retail as telehealth and digital initiatives see continued momentum. Work-from-home and collaboration-related use cases remain active, although less than peak pandemic levels as enterprises shift their focus back to broader digital transformation initiatives. New enterprise wins included Atrium Health, the largest health system in the Southeastern U.S., deploying digital infrastructure to enable compliant, multicloud and business partner interconnection as well as a Fortune 500 manufacturing company, deploying digital infrastructure at Equinix to facilitate cloud connection.
And our channel program had another great quarter, accounting for 35% of bookings. We saw particular strength with our hyperscale and technology alliance partners, capturing wins across a wide range of industry segments, focused on digital transformation efforts as well as pandemic response. New partner wins included a Canadian automobile parts manufacturer, accessing our network and cloud density to interconnect to the connected car and broader automotive ecosystems. We continue to expect channel bookings to be the important pillar of our go-to-market strategy in 2021 and beyond.
Now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."

Despite the challenges of 2020, the Equinix team rallied at all levels of the organization and delivered another strong year for our investors, our customers and our employees. We ended the year on a high note with record gross bookings, strong inter and intra-reaching deal flow activity, positive net pricing actions and a healthy sales pipeline as we head into 2021. Also, we ended the year with significant backlog of cabinets booked but not yet installed. And consistent with my prior quarter's comment, we anticipate a meaningful increase in our cabinets billing metric in the first half of 2021.
So simply put, we continue to drive value on both the top line and at a per share level. And our core strategy as the world's digital infrastructure company continues to separate us from our peers. In the year ahead, we're leaning into our product and services initiatives, scaling and automating our business and investing to expand our platform. We're also managing substantial construction activity at a level previously not seen, with 44 major expansion projects currently underway across 30 markets and 20 countries, including 8 xScale builds. Our build efforts are dollar-weighted towards major metros that generate over $100 million in revenues.
Both the OpEx and CapEx investments are driving and supporting the continued volume of high-quality interconnection-rich wins across both our direct and indirect channels, resulting in durable, long-term value creation for our shareholders. We've also been active in the capital markets, benefiting from our investment-grade ratings that helped drove down our cost of borrow. Over the past 2 years, we raised over $11.5 billion in capital, funding the growth and scale of the business, while lowering our overall blended cost to borrow by approximately 160 basis points, another value driver as reflected in our AFFO per share metrics.
Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $1.564 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year and better than expectations, in part due to strong NRR activity, although offset in part by a one-off accounting adjustment. We enjoyed another quarter of net positive pricing actions, a strong reflection of how our operating model differs from our peers. Q4 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $9 million benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Looking forward, we expect NRR activity to decrease in Q1, although step up again in Q2.
Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $711 million or 45% of revenues, up 5% over the same quarter last year, outperforming our expectations due to favorable revenue mix, strong operating performance and lower utility costs. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, included a $4 million net FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 AFFO was $517 million, meaningfully above our expectations on a constant currency basis due to strong operating performance while absorbing seasonally higher recurring CapEx investments, a similar scenario to prior years. Consistent with AFFO, our operating cash flows increased significantly in the quarter, largely due to strong collection activities.
Interconnection revenues were greater than 18% of recurring revenues, showing continued strong momentum across each of our regions, both on a dollar basis and as a percent of our recurring revenues.
Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were our fastest-growing revenue regions on a year-over-year normalized basis, both growing 11%, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw its third consecutive quarter of record gross bookings, with firm pricing, a high mix of midsized deals and our highest number of new logos in 2 years. Additionally, the team continued to sell across the global platform, delivering on our second consecutive quarter of record exports to the other 2 regions. Americas interconnection adds remained strong. Cabinets billing trended back to normal levels, and we expect a large step-up in cabinet billing in the first half of 2021.
Bell Canada assets had a good start under the Equinix banner, and our integration efforts remain on track.
Our EMEA region saw solid bookings in the quarter, including our best intra-region in 2 years and firm pricing led by activity in both our Amsterdam and Frankfurt markets. Revenue growth remains strong, although we expect some 2021 moderation as we lap past our successful cross-connect repricing initiative in 2020. Also, we're investing broadly in our Growth and Emerging Markets, or GEMs, to meet the anticipated demand in these edge metros.
And finally, the Asia Pacific region had its second best gross bookings quarter with a solid mix of small ecosystem-accretive deals in our Singapore and Japan businesses. Utilization rates remain high. We expect to bring new capacity online over the coming quarters in key markets to ease the anticipated capacity constraints.
And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. At year-end, our balance sheet is greater than $27 billion, including unrestricted cash of approximately $1.6 billion, a meaningful decrease over the prior quarter due to the close of the Bell Canada asset acquisition and the settlement of debt refinanced in the quarter. Also, we moved our Paris 9 asset into the EMEA JV and closed our Japan JV with GIC in December. As a result, net of our equity investment, the JVs reimbursed us over $300 million in the quarter. At year-end, our xScale joint ventures had total assets on their balance sheet of greater than $1 billion, including the capital deployed. In 2021, you should continue to expect a meaningful increase in xScale activity.
Our net debt levels remain low relative to our peers at 3.8x our Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA, within our targeted range. Over the past 2 years, we refinanced a large portion of our historically high-yield debt structure. Yet, we still have another $1.8 billion of debt to refinance over the coming quarters, which, at current rates, would result in another $50 million plus of annualized interest savings.
Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $834 million, including a recurring CapEx of $74 million, a meaningful increase over the prior quarter, but as expected. Our construction and procurement teams continue to actively manage our expansion pipeline, delivering capacity at robust build levels, while incorporating the health, safety and wellbeing of our internal and external teams. Over the past year, we've experienced an average construction delay of a few weeks due to the pandemic, a trend that we will continue to monitor and assess.
In Q4, we opened 4 new expansion projects, D.C., Frankfurt, Paris and São Paulo. Additionally, we added 7 projects to our expansion tracking sheet, including our entrée into Genoa link, in support of the subsea cable landing station opportunity. Genoa 1 will have a direct fiber access to Milan 5, our new flagship facility in this metro, slated to open in Q1. We continue to expand our ownership, acquiring land for development in Genoa, Madrid, Mexico City, Milan and São Paulo. Revenues from owned assets currently represent about 55%.
Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 147 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, a step-down over the prior quarter due to the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar on our non-U.S. stabilized assets. As a reminder, similar to prior years, we plan to update our stabilized asset summary on the Q1 earnings call.
Now please refer to slides 11 through 15 for our summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending GPX India acquisition. Starting with revenues for 2021, we expect top line growth of 10% to 11%, reflecting the continued momentum in the business and favorable FX rates relative to the prior year. On a normalized basis, revenues are expected to grow 7% to 8% over the prior year. MRR churn is expected to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter for the year. For Q1, we expect the MRR churn to be at the lower end of this range.
We expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 47%, excluding integration costs, the result of operating leverage in the business, offset by investments in our product, xScale, and business simplification initiatives. We expect to incur $30 million of integration costs in 2021 for various acquisitions.
2021 AFFO is expected to grow 10% to 12% compared to the previous year. AFFO per share is expected to grow 8% to 10%, including integration costs. We've excluded any capital market activities here. 2021 CapEx is expected to be $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion, including approximately $180 million of recurring CapEx spend, which represents about 3% of our revenues. This guidance also includes approximately $250 million of on-balance sheet spend related to xScale projects, which we expect to be reimbursed for in the future as we move or sell assets into either our current or our future JVs. And finally, we expect our 2021 cash dividends to increase to slightly greater than $1 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year or an 8% increase on a per share basis.
So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles."

In closing, as 2020 showed us, our world is a very dynamic place. I'm proud of how we have navigated and adapted through this challenging environment, and I'm pleased with our increasing momentum in unlocking the tremendous opportunity ahead. We had a strong finish to the year, delivering across each of our areas of strategic focus, all while maintaining a disciplined and long-term-oriented approach to our capital allocation and shareholder return strategies.
Undoubtedly, as with all times of transition and transformation, there will continue to be challenges ahead. But I am as optimistic as ever about our business and the opportunity to serve our customers, partners and shareholders as the world's digital infrastructure company. We need to continue to invest in extending our market leadership and ensuring our long-term relevance to the expansive opportunity presented by digital transformation.
As a society and as a company, we learned a lot in 2020. And I believe there are a plethora of silver linings that will come from this past year. We enter 2021 filled with gratitude, ready to tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead and collectively energized by the pursuit of our purpose: to be the platform where the world comes together, enabling the innovations that enrich our work, life and planet. So let me stop there and open it up for questions."

I think that we're seeing, as we've talked about in the past, it's getting harder and harder to grow on a very -- a much larger base. And I think -- and doing that while maintaining a level of discipline on the strategy. And so that's definitely our focus. We believe that that's the way to continue to drive value creation. We're seeing strong uptake in terms of customers being resonant with the value proposition, but it does take a lot of productivity to drive the bookings that are going to fuel the kind of growth rates that we're seeing at -- given the size of the business overall.
I think in terms of the investments, yes, we do believe that those are going to continue to translate to us, sustaining and hopefully maybe increasing growth rates over time. But I think -- and I think we've already seen that. I think without the investments that we've made in the past, into our product teams, in particular, and into other areas of business like xScale, I think -- I don't think we would have seen the growth that we saw in 2020. And so I think it has been an opportunity for us to invest in the business and generate returns.
I think one factor on operating margins, I think, in 2020, going into 2021, 2020 was an unusual year. And I think it was a difficult time for our world overall. I think we made a decision to both continue to invest in our people in various ways that we've given you visibility to in our last several calls and give them confidence that they would have their jobs. And I stand by that decision, is the right one for the company, and I'm confident that the long-term return on that decision is compelling.
But it's -- interestingly, I think as we -- I guess, partially expected, employee turnover fell significantly because I think as people sought the security of a really strong employer like Equinix. And they probably fell even more than we anticipated and really, to some degree, reduces your range of motion as a business. I think when it falls and yet you're wanting to continue to evolve and adapt your workforce to the changing needs of the business and the strategy at hand, you're left with the decision as to whether you add and kind of overrun where you thought you were going to be from a headcount standpoint or whether you delay doing that in an effort to sort of stay tighter on the expense side. Like many, we probably ended somewhere in between. And -- but undoubtedly, I think that's a contributing factor in terms of growth of SG&A as a percentage of revenue.
And reversing that trend is a priority for us in 2021 and beyond. But we do feel like we needed to make these investments -- need to continue these investments in the business because I think the opportunity associated with the digital transformation, sort of needs of our customers, are significant, and I think we're uniquely positioned to play into those.
Keith, anything you want to add, buddy?"
28202,700826507,2203897,"Equinix, Inc.

I think the other thing that's very telling about '21 over '20, and particularly as you look into Q1, there's a meaningful step-down in our nonrecurring revenue. And as we've said before, it tends to be lumpy. We said there would be a step-up in Q2. That ties in nicely to the incremental cabinet additions that we should -- we expect as a business. And so that's sort of playing into it.
The other thing that we can't lose sight of is the level of price increases that went through last year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that we're going to lap over that. And so you get -- you don't get the same benefit that you get in your run rate.
And then the last thing I would just say is that we continue to invest in xScale, and I talked about a lot of activity taking place there. But we're not yet banking on that as it relates to how the year will progress, either in fees or contribution from our equity interest in the JV. And so that's sort of what's going on with the business.
And again, when you look at overall, 10% to 11%, recognizing normalized is 7% to 8%, I'll tell you maybe just one other thing that really comes to note here. Again, the Americas region grew about 4%, as I said last quarter in my prepared remarks. As you come through Q1, you'll continue to see relatively modest growth in the Americas, but then you'll see the acceleration through the last 3 quarters of the year. And that's what was really exciting about what we see in the plan. So part of it is just timing-based, part of it is the impact of nonrecurring revenue, part of it is the price increases. But overall, we feel very confident in the numbers that we'll put forth here."

I think it's more a sustained -- the sustained performance, having really moved through, I think, a lot of the churn that we were seeing associated with the Verizon assets and some of the churn that occurred through there and I think a stabilization of business and really several really productive bookings quarters from the Americas bookings index."

In fact, we had -- in the last call, we had said that this quarter we expected to be back in range. And we saw a little bit of timing, adverse timing again this quarter and a little bit of unforecasted churn that pushed us up to 2.6%. So I'm a tad reluctant to tell you we're back in range in Q1, but I do believe that's our firm expectation.
So we -- I would say that there -- if you look at it, there were several churns over the last couple of quarters that were from acquired assets, that were the types of deployments that we wouldn't generally be targeting. And so I don't think it's a fundamental sort of issue in the business as it is, I think some of the things that weren't -- aren't really part of our strategy moving through.
The other thesis that's similar to that is about 20 bps of the Q4 churn was associated with a large lower-margin managed services deal in Europe. And so again, I think when you back those things out, you're really looking at sort of a level of churn performance within the business that's pretty consistent with our expectations.
Churn is definitely a focus for us in the year ahead. And I do think kind of where we land on a full year on a revenue basis is going to really depend on where we can land in the churn range that we forecasted through the course of the year. So it's going to be a critical area of focus for us. But nothing fundamental that we're seeing, just volatility in terms of -- or just movement in terms of people evolving their architectures and the normal frictional churn that exists in our business. But I think nothing beyond that."

You mentioned specifically pricing. Obviously, we had tremendous success implementing a pricing sort of normalization effort in Europe over the course of 2020. We're largely through that now. And so as Keith said, that's impacting the year-over-year compare on revenue growth in Europe, but we're now seeing those benefits sort of built into our run rate.
In terms of broader opportunity for pricing adjustments, I think that we're continuing -- we'll continue to evaluate that. I don't -- I wouldn't see anything meaningful on the horizon for us there. I think we -- obviously, it's just coming off the European adjustments. But I think that we do have to continue to look at both our underlying costs and the trajectory of those and whether or not adjustments are needed for us to continue to maintain our margin profile. And then also, the real focus for us is looking at the value delivered to our customers. And we do think it is so substantial as they look at implementing Equinix Fabric, for example, as a foundational part of their hybrid multicloud architectures, that we feel comfortable that we're going to be able to continue to get strong pricing from the interconnection offerings.
And then last point, Keith did mention we're expecting sort of strong cabinet adds because of the strong backlog. And yes, that's going to -- it is going to continue to fuel interconnection because we're seeing really good sort of ratios in terms of -- because we're maintaining a level of discipline in the strategy and we're not reliant on these super large footprint deals that are poorly interconnected, we are seeing cabinets fuel interconnection growth. And so overall, I think those things will move nicely in tandem."

Sure. Yes, I mean, I talked about that we're really seeing digital take off and be a Board-level priority for people, and it's changing the way, as I said, people think about not only electronic commerce and digital interaction with their customers, but how they think about data and how they're using AI to create competitive advantage, how they're architecting their networks. And those last 2 examples are 2 really good ones of -- that are central to what we have in our funnel today and what's fueling our strong bookings on a quarter-over-quarter level. And that is that people thinking about using Equinix as a nexus for their data, locating their data there, intersecting it with cloud services across the globe to create insights and egress those insights to the people within the business that need them.
And then network rearchitecture has been bread and butter for us for a very long time in Equinix Fabric and then things like Network Edge and now with Metal even adding to the mix there, really substantially improving the way people can -- and accelerating the way people are thinking about network rearchitecture.
And in terms of how it's affecting our -- I would just say this. I think that if you look at our mix of business, if you look at the kind of volumes that we're doing, 17,500 transactions over the course of the year, it is -- we're really focused on those sort of -- on those sweet spots in our business, where we can demonstrate differentiated value. And I think that's why we're seeing such strong pricing. We continue to see positive pricing actions and firm even spot pricing, in many ways, in our business because I think the value proposition is so strong. And so -- and I -- but I do think it's still at a point where these are not really short sales cycles. There's a lot of solution selling still being done with us and through -- and in combination with our partners. And it's why we need to continue to invest in rearchitecting and refining and adding capabilities to our selling organization, including scaling our channel. And so those are areas of investment we're making.
And I do think that the prospect is, over time, that those -- I would say that I don't think sales cycles are lengthening. And in fact, if anything, I think they're starting to shorten, in particular, follow-on sales cycles, meaning after you've already brought a customer in. That first win with the customer is still -- it can be pretty extended. But follow-on sales cycles, I think, are shortening. And I think that, hopefully, that points to us continuing to add even further productivity from the selling engine going forward."

I mean I do think that we're seeing -- in fact, if you look over a multiyear period, I think you've seen a pretty substantial acceleration of the enterprise component of our business. And I think that is really tapping into the traditional service provider density that we -- and ecosystem density that we have as well as our geographic reach and how that plays into hybrid and multicloud and distributed architecture as an end state for enterprise customers.
And so it's interesting because if you are -- the way we report externally, it has network service. We talk about our network segment, our financial services segment and then enterprise. In reality, all of those 3 segments have significant enterprise components because our enterprise resale and the network vertical is reported there in terms of how we look at that, but we have a meaning piece of that -- meaningful piece, which is enterprise business that's sold through a network service provider partner.
And then on the financial services side, yes, we have our trading ecosystem, but actually, the larger piece of that is enterprise financial services business. And obviously, enterprise -- I mean, financial services is one of the markets with a very large IT spend and a very, I think, thoughtful and aggressive agenda about moving to hybrid and multicloud as their long-term architectures.
So all that has created this enterprise momentum for our business over the last several years. And I think that absolutely continues into 2021. And like I said, I think that our selling engine is quite productive. It's not yet -- I don't think we're -- we haven't crossed the chasm by any means, but I actually think that's a -- it's really a good thing when you look at the overall Equinix thesis because I think you're looking at a very large addressable market. And we're still in the early innings of tapping that market. And so that means that solution selling takes a little bit longer to get people over the hurdle and really get them through thinking about their hybrid and multicloud end state and how we play in that. But as you -- I think as you get them over the hurdle, there's just a lot more wallet share to be gained. And so I think there is an acceleration opportunity for us. And I would expect enterprise to over-index as a segment for us in 2021."

And one of the things we spoke of last quarter was there are a number of one-off items that were going through the quarter. And so then you look at the guide that we offered in Q1 and then for the year.
I think it's important when -- one of the things we said is we'll see a recovery of that. There are some one-off costs that were in Q3. They were benefiting us or are one-off benefits, I should say. There's one-off costs in Q4. But when you look into Q1, you get to see an EBITDA performance that is substantially up relative to what you would have previously maybe anticipated. Q1 tends to be one of our lower EBITDA quarters. But you can see that we're stepping it up, unadjusted $19 million to $39 million. So it gives you a sense of meaningful step-up in the quarter, and that includes absorbing $10 million -- net $10 million that I would refer to as seasonal costs.
And then as you look through the tail end or through the next 3 quarters, typically, you would see -- typically, what you would see in how we're modeling it is EBITDA margins would continue to increase throughout the year. And then you sort of take that thinking and a lot of what Charles has said, and then you sort of translate that into our AFFO. Again, one of the things we said, if you look at it in total, the AFFO is growing nicely. When you look at it at the share level, it's growing 8% to 10%. So the fact of the matter is, if you back out integration costs, which are, again, they're specific to -- generally to the acquisition of Bell Canada, you're going to see our AFFO per share grow about 10% to 12% this coming year.
So there's a lot of value coming into the business. There's a lot of value coming from xScale. But there's still the potential of much more to come if we execute against our strategy. And as I said, in at least in my prepared remarks, there is a tremendous amount of activity that we will be embarking upon through this year with xScale. And we're optimistic that, that will continue to drive more value to not only the margin line, but also to our core metric, which is AFFO per share."

And I referred to some of those in my prepared remarks, and I think those are areas that we do need to bend the cost curve in the business. And I think that expanded operating margins are and -- are still a priority for us going forward.
And again, I think we -- rather than try to squeeze it too tight and not make enough room to open up the longer-term opportunity, we made a decision to make those investments this year, and we think that's the right one. Over -- but I think we also need to make sure that we're seeing those investments translate into operating leverage over time.

And then, as I said, first quarter, you're going to feel, in the guide that we give you, it goes a little bit soft, but predominantly, soft in the sense that I would expect more of it. We're taking about $20 million out of the nonrecurring line in the first quarter. And so what you're really seeing is the momentum pick up from the installed cabs -- pardon me, the backlog to the installed cabinets in Q1 and then in Q2.
And so there are deals that we've signed. Effectively, they're booked, just not installed. And so we are going to see that momentum. And that's why we have the confidence not only in where we think the revenues will go, but also the momentum that we will see through the rest of the year."

I think there's always a continuum in terms of the strength of the value proposition and therefore, how differentiated you can be on pricing. But again, I would point to the fact that we, across our regions, are quarter-over-quarter demonstrating positive -- net positive pricing actions, meaning that when we do have a reprice, for example, those are generally being offset by our ability to sustain pricing increases in our contracts, which I think is a really good sign for the business in terms of our ability to do that.
So I think undifferentiated colo is going to continue to struggle to maintain price points. And people are either -- are looking for -- they're either lowering price and/or looking for new ways or new markets, a lot of them tilting towards hyperscale, which they're certainly not going to find a lot of relief on pricing there. And so I do think the broader market has a translation or a challenge there.

So again, if you take out integration cost, AFFO per share will grow 10% to 12%. So we feel really good about where we are. And as you will -- I think many of you will recall, based on the June 2018 Analyst Day, we thought anywhere from 8% to 12% was a reasonable growth rate for AFFO, and we're tracking well against those models that we developed back in 2018.
That all said, when you look at what we plan to do this year, we have a very large capital build. The thing I think of the most is how do we go to our lowest cost of capital, which is basically incremental debt. And so what you're going to see is we're going to refinance out of the debt as appropriate. We'll pick our timing accordingly. We'll get, over some period of time, the annualized benefit of $50 million plus. And then to the extent that we can or we have capacity, we theoretically could raise a little bit more debt because, again, that would be our cheapest source of capital.
As you're also aware, we do have our ATM program. Last year, we announced a $1.5 billion program, but we'll use that appropriately as market conditions allow. We would walk through the door. To the extent they don't, then we would -- we preserve that capital for a later date. But again, we're always going to bring in a little bit of balance to our capital structure. We're going to make sure that we have liquidity on our balance sheet. We have the cash right now. As we announced in our prepared remarks, $1.6 billion plus $2 billion of incremental liquidity from our line. And I'm just -- I remain very optimistic about the amount of cash that we generate in the business as well as the return of capital from the JV as we continue to invest in building out some of these assets. We'll get some more incremental capital from our JV partners as we scale the business.
So again, Colby, I think it's a great question. 8% to 10% is sort of a very comfortable range and where we feel we can deliver in 20 -- through 2021. And we'll update you further on -- I think we're going to do the June -- at the June Analyst Day, we'll update you a little bit further on our longer-term view of what we think we can accomplish as a company."

Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to the year, delivering one of the strongest net bookings quarters in our history, fueled by strong demand across our platform, our lowest churn quart",1638,"Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to the year, delivering one of the strongest net bookings quarters in our history, fueled by strong demand across our platform, our lowest churn quarter in many years and continued momentum in our Americas business. With the addition of the Bell Canada assets, we are now the market leader in 19 of the 26 countries in which we operate. And we are delighted to now be the market leader in retail colocation across all 3 regions of the world, taking the #1 spot in Asia Pacific for the first time this quarter. 
Our bookings performance continues to highlight the consistency and scale of our go-to-market engine, executing 4,300 deals with more than 3,200 customers. We have a robust build pipeline to support this demand, including 36 major projects underway across 28 markets in 19 countries, one of our most active build years ever. 
We fully recognize that COVID remains a very acute issue with continued tragic impacts in key markets around the world, including India and Brazil. Our hearts go out to our colleagues and customers in those markets, and we are actively taking steps to support those communities. But as we navigate toward a post-pandemic world, we believe Equinix remains uniquely well positioned. Digital transformation continues to accelerate, and businesses across a broad range of verticals are recognizing that their infrastructure can be a key source of competitive advantage in an increasingly digital world. 
Demand is as strong as ever, with global IT spend expected to rebound above pre-pandemic levels as enterprises increase hybrid cloud spending and service providers build out their delivery platforms to tap into this demand. Against this backdrop, we remain focused on the clear set of priorities I outlined at the start of the year: investing in our people and culture, simplifying and scaling our business, accelerating our digital services and expanding our global reach, both through our retail footprint and our rapidly growing xScale business. 
While we're delighted with our business results, we are also highly attuned to our responsibilities as a market leader and continue to advance a bold sustainability agenda across all dimensions of ESG. Supporting our people and strengthening our culture continue to be foundational to our strategy. And in a time where it matters more than ever, our vision remains clear: for Equinix to be a place where every employee every day can confidently say, ""I'm safe, I belong and I matter."" And for our workforce at all levels to better reflect and represent the communities in which we operate. 
In early April, we hosted our second annual Days of Understanding, where thousands of our employees around the world attended workshops to listen, learn and promote a culture of mutual understanding and inclusion as we continue to build and foster an engaged diverse workforce. Our people show up every day inspired by our purpose: to be the platform where the world comes together, enabling the innovations that enrich our work, life and planet. 
As we pursue this purpose, we are also deeply committed to our role as an important component in greening digital infrastructure. We recently published our 2020 corporate sustainability highlights, and I am proud that Equinix once again achieved more than 90% renewable energy coverage for our global data center footprint and received an A- score for our CDP Climate Change Survey, a leading environmental rating system focused on climate-related transparency and action. 
In January, we announced, alongside other providers, the formation of the European Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, committed to ensuring data centers in Europe are carbon neutral by 2030. We continue to invest significant resources in our ESG leadership, and we'll roll out additional global ambitions over the coming quarters in both our environmental and social initiatives. 
Now turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3. Revenues for Q1 were $1.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 10% year-over-year and AFFO was meaningfully ahead of our expectations. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our leading interconnection franchise continues to perform well, with revenues substantially outpacing colocation, growing 13% year-over-year, driven by the continued strength of Equinix Fabric. We now have over 398,000 interconnections and added more organic interconnections year-over-year than the next 10 competitors combined. 
In Q1, we added an incremental 6,700 interconnections, fueled by hyperscaler build-outs and strong enterprise demand, offset by a slight seasonal increase in network grooming activity. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 9% quarter-over-quarter and 28% year-over-year, driven by the cloud and network segments. Equinix Fabric also saw strong growth driven by expanded use of our inter-metro offering and continued diversification of end destinations. 
More than 2,500 customers are now on Fabric, and we remain focused on driving higher attach rates for this product across our platform. We're also seeing strong customer interest in our Equinix Metal offering and continue to deliver on our commitment to expand the availability and feature set of this offering, enabling as-a-service consumption of our value proposition across 18 global metros. 
On the xScale side of our business, we're accelerating our pace and continue to make meaningful progress on our ambitious plans for 2021 as rapid growth of the digital economy drives increased demand for global cloud connectivity. With our xScale facilities, hyperscale companies can add large footprint core deployments to their existing network and on-ramp footprints at Equinix, enabling faster time to market and offering direct interconnection to a vibrant ecosystem with their customers and strategic partners. 
Our more than $3 billion program, financed with the support of our JV partners, will develop over 290 megawatts across our first 2 JVs with several more already in the works. We are broadening our reach with the first building of our Dublin 5 campus, which is JV-ready and already 100% pre-leased to a major hyperscaler. Additionally, after quarter end, we pre-leased our entire London 11 asset. These 2 deals alone represent nearly 40 megawatts of capacity fully committed in advance of delivery. 
Now let me cover highlights from our verticals. Please note that we updated our customer segmentation approach to better reflect industry classifications and use cases as well as combined our financial services and enterprise segments to reflect the true scale and momentum of the enterprise opportunity. Going forward, we'll report under these 4 key verticals. 
Our network vertical saw strong bookings, led by the previously mentioned strength in the Americas as firms expand their capabilities and capacity for digital business and momentum begins to build for industrial 5G applications. A meaningful part of our network vertical is resale, an indication of the momentum of our channel efforts as we work with partners to deliver more complete solutions to support enterprise digital transformation. 
Expansions this quarter included British Telecom, a leading telecommunications provider, optimizing network and connecting to multi-cloud for their global enterprise end customers; and Alestra, one of the first Mexican cloud service providers leveraging Equinix Fabric to provide a multi-cloud product offering; and SUB.CO, a leading subsea cable system development firm deploying a cable node to establish the first route between Oman and Australia. 
Content and digital media achieved solid bookings as indoor entertainment continues to drive activity in the social media, gaming and streaming platforms. Expansions included marquee wins like Roblox expanding across Platform Equinix to support their rapidly growing user base and big data requirements as well as a global edge cloud provider expanding capacity and deploying network nodes to support accelerating demand for video content. 
Our cloud and IT vertical delivered strong bookings, led by hyperscalers continuing their global growth. And it's worth noting that these bookings results do not include the previously referenced xScale wins, which are additive to this strong retail performance. Q1 was also an exceptional quarter in terms of cloud on-ramp additions, with 21 new on-ramp wins in the quarter, roughly equivalent to our cumulative volume over the prior 4 quarters and representing a 75% share of on-ramps launched in our metros. As a result, Equinix customers can now enjoy low-latency access to multiple clouds in 31 metros across the globe, including 8 of the world's top 10 metros by GDP. 
Expansions this quarter included a Fortune 30 software provider deploying infrastructure to support digital transformation and IT initiatives, and Everest, an Australian cloud services provider specializing in health care, expanding to meet country-specific data compliance requirements and improve user experience. 
Our enterprise vertical continued to be a major contributor to overall bookings performance, driven by strength in the retail and financial services subsegments as enterprises shift from pandemic initiatives such as work-from-home and collaboration to a broader focus on digital transformation. Expansions included CME Group, a top global financial derivatives exchange expanding their footprint to support growing demand of matching engines resulting from a new platform launch, as well as a leading global airline re-architecting to connect to their preferred network and cloud partners and tap into our growing transportation ecosystem. 
And our channel program continues to deliver exceptional results, contributing more than 30% of our bookings and accounting for over 60% of our new logos. We had great wins with resellers and alliance partners, including AT&T, Dell and IBM, across a wide range of industry segments focused on digital transformation efforts and COVID-19 response. 
Partner wins included working with Verizon, utilizing their Network-as-a-Service strategy to help a large U.S. health care provider modernize their mission-critical contact center and leverage a new cloud architecture supporting 12 million members across the U.S., as well as a win with a global Canadian manufacturer deploying in Canada and Germany for WAN optimization and cloud access, utilizing Cisco's SD-WAN solution interconnected to Equinix Fabric. Now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."
28202,710358824,2261543,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. On the heels of a record end to 2020, we delivered a great Q1 with strong gross bookings, in fact, our best Q1 ever and our second best net bookings quarter ever with solid performance across virtually all",1347,"Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. On the heels of a record end to 2020, we delivered a great Q1 with strong gross bookings, in fact, our best Q1 ever and our second best net bookings quarter ever with solid performance across virtually all of our key metrics. 
Our platform continues to shine with strong inter and reaching activity, with a high interest in our expanded product and service capabilities further separating us from our peers. Interconnection revenues now represent 19% of our recurring revenues, reflecting our continued interconnection momentum. With a great start to 2021 and increased visibility over the rest of the year, we're raising our guidance substantially across revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share on a constant currency basis. 
Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q1 revenues were $1.596 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year, our 73rd quarter of top line revenue growth due to strong business performance led by the Americas. As expected, nonrecurring revenue decreased quarter-over-quarter to 5% of revenues. But as noted on our last earnings call, we anticipate a meaningful rebound in Q2 NRR due to forecasted custom installation work across a number of markets, highlighting the inherent lumpiness of this revenue source. 
Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $6 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $773 million or 48% of revenues, up 10% over the same quarter last year, significantly outperforming our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower net utility costs. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs. 
Global Q1 AFFO was $627 million, meaningfully above our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower seasonal recurring capital expenditures. Q1 global MRR churn was 2%, a meaningful step down with lower churn across all 3 regions. This improved churn is a reflection of our continued discipline strategy of selling the platform for the right customer with the right application and into the right footprint. For 2021, we continue to expect MRR churn to average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter. 
Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were the fastest MRR-growing regions on a year-over-year normalized basis at 10% and 9%, respectively, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw continued momentum with record price-adjusted gross and net bookings, firm pricing and a large step-up in cabinets billing. We're seeing good momentum across many markets in the region, with particular spends in Dallas, New York and the smaller metros of Denver and Mexico City. 
We have a strong booked but unbilled backlog and continue to expect a large step-up in billing cabinets through the first half of 2021, as partially experienced in Q1 and with more to follow in Q2. Based on this momentum, we expect the Americas normalized quarterly revenue growth rate for the remainder of the year to be at or near 6% or better. 
Also, our power hedging strategy minimized the impact of our business from the utility price spikes in Texas during the extreme weather situation in February. Our power hedging program, along with our world-class operational management, ensured we also protected our customers from these price spikes as well. There is no incremental revenue due to this unexpected weather situation. Separately, our Texas and Oklahoma wind farm settlements trended positively during this quarter. 
Our EMEA region saw strong bookings in the quarter, including healthy exports and record intra-region activity. Although our flat markets remain core to the region's booking engine, we're also seeing increased customer interest in our edge metros, with strong momentum in Dublin, Madrid and Stockholm and our new market of Muscat and our soon-to-be-open Bordeaux facility. Revenue growth remained strong although moderated from previous levels as expected, as we lap past our successful cross-connect repricing initiative. Interconnection revenue stepped up to 13% of recurring revenues showing continued momentum. 
And finally, the Asia Pacific region had solid net bookings with good pricing and strong enterprise and cloud growth led by our Singapore and Japan businesses. Utilization rates continue to remain high, but we've opened capacity in key markets this quarter and will add additional capacity through 2021 to ease potential inventory constraints. 
And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1.8 billion, an increase over the prior quarter, largely due to our inaugural euro-denominated green bond refinancing, which raised EUR 1.1 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 66 basis points. As a result, Equinix now has the lowest weighted average cost of debt capital and the longest weighted average maturity of any publicly traded data center company. We also expect to refinance our remaining U.S. dollar high-yield bond over the near term, further driving down our average cost of debt. 
Our net debt levels remain low relative to our peers at 3.7x our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA. We continue to work alongside our credit rating agencies and are pleased to announce that earlier today, S&P upgraded Equinix to BBB flat and widened our leverage tolerance to 5x. One, we're very appreciative of the continued support we get from S&P, and importantly, we're delighted with this increased financial flexibility. Looking forward, as stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth opportunities while creating long-term value for our shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $564 million, including recurring CapEx of $20 million. We opened 8 new retail projects this quarter, adding 7,400 cabinets, including a new IBX in Milan. On the xScale side of the business, we opened 3 new facilities in London, Paris and Tokyo, adding an initial 28 megawatts of capacity in our JVs. All this hyperscale capacity has been presold. We also purchased land and buildings for development in Montreal and Mexico City. Revenues from owned assets represent 56% of our total revenues now. 
Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our now 154 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Also consistent with prior years, during Q1, we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise. Our stabilized asset count increased by net 7 IBXs. These stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. 
And now please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending GPX India acquisition, which is expected to close in Q2 nor any future capital market activities. 
For the full year 2021, we're raising our underlying revenue guidance by $40 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $33 million, primarily due to strong operating performance and favorable net utility costs. This guidance implies a normalizing constant currency growth rate of 7% to 8% year-over-year and an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 47%. And given the operating momentum of the business, we're raising our 2021 AFFO by $26 million to grow between 10% and 12% on a normalized and constant currency basis compared to the previous year. 
We're also raising our 2021 AFFO per share to range -- to now grow between 9% and 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis. 2021 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.725 billion and $2.975 billion, including approximately $180 million of recurring CapEx spend, which represents about 3% of revenues. This guidance also includes an incremental $200 million of balance sheet xScale projects, funds that we expect to recover after contributing these investments into our current and our future JVs. So let me stop here. I'll turn the call back to Charles."

But I would say that I think that we are -- we continue to believe, and as we've talked about this many times, that the best -- our best way of managing churn is to continue to be really disciplined in our targeting and our execution of the go-to-market engine. And I think that we're seeing that the mix of business continues to be right on the money for what we want. 
I think we're selling a lot of business into that -- the sweet spot of sort of small to midsized interconnection-heavy applications and use cases. And again, I think that's going to bode well for us over time. So I mentioned this in several other forums, which is we have been, the last 2 quarters, up towards the high end of the range and even slightly over in Q4 but now down right at the bottom of the range. And I think we're really seeing positive trending on the churn. 
So -- and we have efforts underway to really identify all of the -- really project out and look at churn risk in the business in a very sophisticated way, identify, get ahead of it, and I think we're seeing real dividends from that."

So xScale, I'm just wondering, you've outlined stuff that's opened up, stuff that's kind of in the pipeline. Is that the right kind of cadence to think about going forward or could that potentially accelerate? And if you could remind us how that translates into fee income. There's like 4 different ways you get paid but some of that may be more front-loaded than others before, where you would get the revenue before -- or recognize revenues before the customer actually moves in. 
And then on Slide 23, just on the lease renewals. I'm wondering what would be a realistic remaining pipeline to think about that would enable you to convert leased properties to owned properties. Or is it mainly a matter of managing your renewals going forward?"

Jonathan, why don't I start with a little bit of color on xScale at a macro level? And then, Keith, if you want to jump in and share a little bit more on the fee streams and their impact and flow through into the business, that would be great and then we'll pick up the second question. 
But look, we're delighted with, I think, the efforts of Krupal and the whole xScale team and the group of people supporting them from within the core Equinix as well as the support we're getting from our partner, GIC is things are really humming in terms of the xScale business. Obviously, we talked about the fact that we've had great pre-leasing activity on the facilities that we put out there. 
I think there is an opportunity for us to increase the pace, and we're going to come back to you at the Analyst Day and really talk about kind of what we would see as the scope of opportunity for xScale going forward. As you'll recall, we talked about that in 2018 at the Analyst Day. And I think that we were -- we certainly -- I said it in a number of other forums that we're trending more towards the high end of that. And I think we'll give more clarity on what's possible, we think, in the xScale business. 
But we're targeting the pieces of the pie out there that we think are really strategically important and add to the overall platform value. And again, we're seeing really good momentum in the business right now. And I do think there's an opportunity for us to continue to pick up the pace. So Keith, why don't you comment on the fee streams and impact in the flow through?"

So Jon, as it relates to the fees, there's 4 fee streams, 2 are recurring in nature and 2 are nonrecurring. And then the fifth, if you will, stream of value that comes in is below the line through income equity through affiliated entities. So basically, that's our equity ownership in the business. Having said all of that, you are starting to see the momentum pick up as we announced in our prepared remarks. 
We introduced 3 new assets in this quarter and all of them are presold. And so it gives you a sense of the momentum is picking up quite substantially with a fairly robust opportunity in front of us. So what you're going to start to see in the coming quarters is some nonrecurring aspects of the fee income, but you're really going to start to see a ramp-up of the recurring fee stream as well. And again, we'll talk more about it on the June Analyst Day. But suffice it to say, it is exciting to see the momentum coming from that team. Yes, so let me just leave it there. I think we answered your question."

And then the second one, as you're talking about, Jon, about the leased properties, there's a number of transactions that we are currently in the middle of. They are -- we have negotiated the purchase price -- the purchase of those acquisitions. It's built into our forward guide, no surprise to you, both as it relates to cash but also the anticipated consumption of those lease arrangements inside our financials. 
So we are continuing to acquire where we can. There are some that clearly are more important than others. And so where we can, we will focus on those that are the most important, yet at the same time as we think about our future growth, I think if my memory serves, roughly 75% of all of our future growth right now is on property that is owned or we have a long-term arrangement with for a grand lease. And it's 75% is going into major metros, notwithstanding the fact that we still have 30-plus -- over 35 projects underway across the world in many, many metros in many countries. 
So all that said is you'll start to see that continue to go up. It takes time. And then I should say we'll answer when we close a bit. Suffice it to say there are some transactions that we are anticipating to announce over the not-too-distant future."

One of the things when we report, there's 2 aspects to it. And there's the, if you will, the fundamental business that would compare apple-to-apple versus the APAC region, the EMEA region and then there's the corporate overlay. 
So if I tell you more specifically about the Americas region, in and of itself without the corporate overlay, margins are continuing to improve largely because we have very strong interconnection activity, where we continue to grow our customer base and our scale and we're driving more profitability into the business. So that's the, if you will, the easy response. 
The second part is that just timing of expenses. As you know, between Q3, 4 and then this quarter, there had been some movement of costs around different quarters, and as a result, we start to see the benefit of those -- of that movement in Q4. And specifically as it relates to Q1 though, again, one of the comments we made was that we have a very strong utility cost of power hedging program. Our operational team operate our businesses very, very effectively the assets, particularly in the Americas, in this particular case, vis-à-vis Texas. And so we have a strong hedging program that protected us against those spikes in price. 
But we also have a wind farm arrangement where both in Texas and in Oklahoma, we have wind farms, and so we had some benefit attached to that. And then there's some seasonality around our repairs and maintenance expense. But overall, you're seeing fundamentally a U.S. business or Americas business that is performing exceedingly well and continue to drive margin into its financials, offset by the corporate investments that we've been making."

Some markets are more competitive than other markets, and you're looking at unlevered anywhere from sort of unlevered returns of 8% to 12% at the project level. We get a fee stream on top of that, and then, of course, we put some debt on the business. 
So as a result, when you look at hopefully, Equinix position, our return profile is as good, if not better, than what we've shared. Now having said all of that, if you ask me on a specific project, there will be some variation. But the team under Krupal's leadership are working really well not only with our construction team but with our JV partners to make sure that we get the right returns and we're negotiating appropriately with the various hyperscalers to get a good long-term contract. 
So overall, again, I would just say that there's no material variance from what we said [indiscernible] it's a little bit better. And as Charles made in his prior comments, in fact, there's probably a broader or bigger appetite over the coming quarters and years, given the momentum that we're seeing that you'll see maybe us do more than we originally anticipated from the June 2018 Analyst Day."

We do anticipate that we will retire it over the nearer term, as I said. There's a relatively strong positive impact associated with that. And again, I'll let everybody do the math on what and why that is. But it will be a blend of perhaps 5-, 7-, 10-, maybe even 30-year terms, to the extent that we go out that far. Some of it will be green, that would be -- that tends to be on the shorter end of the curve. 
And then the only other thing I would say is to the extent that we can, we will take advantage of there's -- the opportunity to make sure that we can retire some of our foreign debt where possible and arbitrage over a favorable sort of interest rate environment. And the last thing I'd just want to say is, again, we're delighted with the work that our treasury team has been doing under Melanie's leadership to negotiate with S&P and get a favorable upgrade. 
But what was really important here is more financial flexibility. And as many of you have asked over both in our private sessions but also on some of the calls, we've always wanted to have more financial flexibility as it relates to debt, and no surprise to everybody, debt's our cheapest source of capital. And as a result, you will see us continue to focus on refinancing the debt and then also using debt, where appropriate, with some balance to equity to make sure that we create this long-term investment portfolio that we're -- that we've announced. And from our perspective, I just think it was the best of all situations today that not only getting that upgrade but also having the flexibility to drive down our cost of capital."

So it seems that for some of the projects, before they enter into the joint venture, you're taking some of this on balance sheet, you're running some of this on balance sheet from just a high-level perspective.

One is what is how is the underlying business performing and is $40 million an uplift. The second part is what currency. And based on the forecast rates that we're using, there's a $61 million downdraft. 
Frankly, if I took the spot rates from today, which we don't do the day of, obviously, we have forecast rates, that $61 million would be cut in half, if not by more, just to give you a perspective. Having said all of that, when you look at the fundamental underlying business, it's all about the rounding. Again, what you've done -- what we've done is we've taken a step up, added $40 million of revenue on a $6 billion business. And now you're starting to see us move up into the range in the 7% to 8% range. So before the bottom end of the range was slightly below 7%, now you basically -- you're well into the range on the 7% to 8%. 
Again, this is the first step that we've made since the Q4 earnings call. Again, there's momentum in the business, and we're just delighted by the ability to be able to raise $40 million on the underlying business."

And so it will be the sale or disposition of that construction and progress into the JV. And so basically, it's a gross-up, if you will.

This quarter, that actually reversed to when we annualized the impact so there was a $61 million headwind. But as I said in one of my other responses, that's based on our forecast rates that we used when we re-forecasted the year and we're giving you the guidance. How you use the spot rates of today, there basically is that $61 million would drop actually by $45 million. So it tells you that the U.S. dollar weakened again. 
So again, we try and bring a lot of discipline to how we message it. It's at the point in time when you do the forecast. We are not projecting forward on what might happen. If it does happen, then you'll see a benefit, and you'll see that benefit primarily because roughly 60% of our revenues are earned in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. And so when the U.S. dollar weakens, again, recognize we do have some hedges and they take time to burn off, then you'll see an uplift in revenue accordingly. So hopefully, that answers your question. And -- so let me stop there and just see if I did answer your question."

Now I kind of understand some of the nuances around that. If you could just indulge me with 1 more. I mean, when you -- at the beginning of the year, there was a lot of concern just around extension of sales cycles, whether it was in the hyperscale side or whether it was on the enterprise side. Could you just talk a little bit about -- again, it seems like given your stellar quarter and some of the comments you've made about your verticals, that, that really isn't a concern anymore. Is that a fair statement?"

We -- I mean, honestly, we haven't really experienced that other than, I think, in the very acute periods of COVID where people were trying to sort of just figure out how to make the transition to work from home and really dealing with matters of survival. We did not see any sort of extension -- significant extension of the selling cycle. In fact, I would say that I think what we're finding is that we're improving our skill set and capability of delivering the sort of the digital transformation-oriented messaging to our enterprise prospects and seeing good momentum in terms of bringing those sales cycles down. 
And so we haven't seen that. Hyperscale sales cycles are a little longer but I wouldn't say they have protracted. In fact, I think we've made really good progress with several of our key hyperscale customers trying to define more repeatable terms that we can do business under, which is compressing the time frame in which we can get deals done. And it's been -- that's been an important priority for us and one that we have really put a lot of energy into of late, and it's really important to our partners and customers. 
So I would say no, I feel good about sales cycle right now. In fact, I think when we're looking at our funnel, we're seeing a very deep funnel, and we're feeling like conversion rates and conversion timing support optimism about the remainder of the year, which is all kind of reflected in our guidance."

So on the 2Q guidance, you mentioned you're using a wider range, just given what could be some, I guess, volatility within the nonrecurring portion. I was wondering if you could just give us some sense of what you're thinking NRR might look like. And could we step back up to the levels we saw in the fourth quarter? And is that a better assumption going forward? 
And then secondly, just a point of clarification on your CapEx guidance. You maintained the guidance at $2.125 billion to $2.315 billion for the nonrecurring portion, but is that including the $425 million to $475 million for xScale? It felt like you were saying in your prepared remarks that it is included, but the way at least the press release looks like reads -- at least reads to me like it's excluded. So I just want to get a clarification there. 
And then just real quickly, as it relates to the Analyst Day, obviously, xScale is going to be a big focus. It's been a big focus of questions this evening. What else are you planning? Like what is the big focus? I mean, where do you think that investors are maybe a little bit off in terms of their thinking of the company and really want to make sure you're going to be hitting home on."

We'll talk about what we're doing to continue to evolve our go-to-market and to respond to that, including how we're -- what we're doing on the channel side of things.

But I think in terms of -- I think we're very pleased with the nature of our relationship with GIC.

I think it's just that's the nature of the hyperscale community today is that the largest end of that is taking up more of the overall demand or providing more of the overall demand. So it's concentrated at some level. 
But we have had significant success beyond sort of the 3 or 4 that would pop to mind for people right off the top of their head. And so I think we're going to continue to evaluate those opportunities. But -- and I would say that we're really continuing to build on a strong relationship we've had with that full hyperscale community for a very long time because as I talked about with our -- when I characterized our hyperscale relationships at the Analyst Day in 2018, we -- they are amongst our largest customers, many of them, and that is a lot of it on the backs of really the important role that we play in terms of their network nodes, their on-ramps and other elements of their infrastructure outside of sort of availability zones and really large core deployments that might be more of the focus of xScale. 
So it's a very multifaceted relationship that we have with them. They're critical. We believe that as people adopt hybrid and multicloud as the architecture of choice, we think doing that at Equinix is really going to be a key priority for them in terms of both superior economics and performance. And so the relationships that we have with the xScale -- or with the hyperscalers are very important to us.

Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to the year, delivering one of the strongest net bookings quarters in our history, fueled by strong demand across our platform, our lowest churn quarter in many years and continued momentum in our Americas business. With the addition of the Bell Canada assets, we are now the market leader in 19 of the 26 countries in which we operate. And we are delighted to now be the market leader in retail colocation across all 3 regions of the world, taking the #1 spot in Asia Pacific for the first time this quarter.
Our bookings performance continues to highlight the consistency and scale of our go-to-market engine, executing 4,300 deals with more than 3,200 customers. We have a robust build pipeline to support this demand, including 36 major projects underway across 28 markets in 19 countries, one of our most active build years ever.
We fully recognize that COVID remains a very acute issue with continued tragic impacts in key markets around the world, including India and Brazil. Our hearts go out to our colleagues and customers in those markets, and we are actively taking steps to support those communities. But as we navigate toward a post-pandemic world, we believe Equinix remains uniquely well positioned. Digital transformation continues to accelerate, and businesses across a broad range of verticals are recognizing that their infrastructure can be a key source of competitive advantage in an increasingly digital world.
Demand is as strong as ever, with global IT spend expected to rebound above pre-pandemic levels as enterprises increase hybrid cloud spending and service providers build out their delivery platforms to tap into this demand. Against this backdrop, we remain focused on the clear set of priorities I outlined at the start of the year: investing in our people and culture, simplifying and scaling our business, accelerating our digital services and expanding our global reach, both through our retail footprint and our rapidly growing xScale business. 
While we're delighted with our business results, we are also highly attuned to our responsibilities as a market leader and continue to advance a bold sustainability agenda across all dimensions of ESG. Supporting our people and strengthening our culture continue to be foundational to our strategy. And in a time where it matters more than ever, our vision remains clear: for Equinix to be a place where every employee every day can confidently say, ""I'm safe. I belong. And I matter."" And for our workforce at all levels to better reflect and represent the communities in which we operate.
In early April, we hosted our second annual days of understanding, where thousands of our employees around the world attended workshops to listen, learn and promote a culture of mutual understanding and inclusion as we continue to build and foster an engaged diverse workforce. Our people show up every day inspired by our purpose: to be the platform where the world comes together, enabling the innovations that enrich our work, life and planet.
As we pursue this purpose, we are also deeply committed to our role as an important component in greening digital infrastructure. We recently published our 2020 corporate sustainability highlights, and I am proud that Equinix once again achieved more than 90% renewable energy coverage for our global data center footprint and received an A- score for our CDP Climate Change Survey, a leading environmental rating system focused on climate-related transparency and action.
In January, we announced, alongside other providers, the formation of the European Climate Neutral Data Center Pact, committed to ensuring data centers in Europe are carbon-neutral by 2030. We continue to invest significant resources in our ESG leadership, and we'll roll out additional global ambitions over the coming quarters in both our environmental and social initiatives.
Now turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3. Revenues for Q1 were $1.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 10% year-over-year, and AFFO was meaningfully ahead of our expectations. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our leading interconnection franchise continues to perform well with revenues substantially outpacing colocation, growing 13% year-over-year, driven by the continued strength of Equinix Fabric. We now have over 398,000 interconnections and added more organic interconnections year-over-year than the next 10 competitors combined.
In Q1, we added an incremental 6,700 interconnections, fueled by hyperscaler build-outs and strong enterprise demand, offset by a slight seasonal increase in network grooming activity. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 9% quarter-over-quarter and 28% year-over-year, driven by the cloud and network segments. Equinix Fabric also saw strong growth driven by expanded use of our inter-metro offering and continued diversification of end destinations.
More than 2,500 customers are now on Fabric, and we remain focused on driving higher attach rates for this product across our platform. We're also seeing strong customer interest in our Equinix Metal offering and continue to deliver on our commitment to expand the availability and feature set of this offering, enabling as-a-service consumption of our value proposition across 18 global metros.
On the xScale side of our business, we're accelerating our pace and continue to make meaningful progress on our ambitious plans for 2021 as rapid growth of the digital economy drives increased demand for global cloud connectivity. With our xScale facilities, hyperscale companies can add large footprint core deployments to their existing network and on-ramp footprints at Equinix, enabling faster time to market and offering direct interconnection to a vibrant ecosystem with their customers and strategic partners.
Our more than $3 billion program financed with the support of our JV partners will develop over 290 megawatts across our first 2 JVs with several more already in the works. We are broadening our reach with the first building of our Dublin 5 campus, which is JV-ready and already 100% pre-leased to a major hyperscaler. Additionally, after quarter end, we pre-leased our entire London 11 asset. These 2 deals alone represent nearly 40 megawatts of capacity fully committed in advance of delivery.
Now let me cover highlights from our verticals. Please note that we updated our customer segmentation approach to better reflect industry classifications and use cases as well as combined our financial services and enterprise segments to reflect the true scale and momentum of the enterprise opportunity. Going forward, we'll report under these 4 key verticals.
Our network vertical saw strong bookings led by the previously mentioned strength in the Americas as firms expand their capabilities and capacity for digital business, and momentum begins to build for industrial 5G applications. A meaningful part of our network vertical is resale, an indication of the momentum of our channel efforts as we work with partners to deliver more complete solutions to support enterprise digital transformation.
Expansions this quarter include British Telecom, a leading telecommunications provider, optimizing network and connecting to multi-cloud for their global enterprise end customers; and Alestra, one of the first Mexican cloud service providers leveraging Equinix Fabric to provide a multi-cloud product offering; and SUB.CO, a leading subsea cable system development firm deploying a cable node to establish the first route between Oman and Australia.
Content and digital media achieved solid bookings as indoor entertainment continues to drive activity in the social media, gaming and streaming platforms. Expansions included marquee wins like Roblox expanding across Platform Equinix to support their rapidly growing user base and big data requirements as well as a global edge cloud provider expanding capacity and deploying network nodes to support accelerating demand for video content.
Our cloud and IT vertical delivered strong bookings led by hyperscalers continuing their global growth. And it's worth noting that these bookings results do not include the previously referenced xScale wins, which are additive to this strong retail performance. Q1 was also an exceptional quarter in terms of cloud on-ramp additions with 21 new on-ramp wins in the quarter, roughly equivalent to our cumulative volume over the prior 4 quarters and representing a 75% share of on-ramps launched in our metros. As a result, Equinix customers can now enjoy low-latency access to multiple clouds in 31 metros across the globe, including 8 of the world's top 10 metros by GDP.
Expansions this quarter included a Fortune 30 software provider deploying infrastructure to support digital transformation and IT initiatives; and Everest, an Australian cloud services provider specializing in health care, expanding to meet country-specific data compliance requirements and improve user experience.
Our enterprise vertical continued to be a major contributor to overall bookings performance, driven by strength in the retail and financial services subsegments as enterprises shift from pandemic initiatives such as work from home and collaboration to a broader focus on digital transformation. Expansions included CME Group, a top global financial derivatives exchange, expanding their footprint to support growing demand of matching engines resulting from a new platform launch; as well as a leading global airline re-architecting to connect to their preferred network and cloud partners and tap into our growing transportation ecosystem.
And our channel program continues to deliver exceptional results, contributing more than 30% of our bookings and accounting for over 60% of our new logos. We had great wins with resellers and alliance partners, including AT&T, Dell and IBM, across a wide range of industry segments focused on digital transformation efforts and COVID-19 response.
Partner wins included working with Verizon, utilizing their Network-as-a-Service strategy to help a large U.S. health care provider modernize their mission-critical contact center and leverage a new cloud architecture supporting 12 million members across the U.S.; as well as a win with a global Canadian manufacturer deploying in Canada and Germany for WAN optimization and cloud access, utilizing Cisco's SD-WAN solution interconnected to Equinix Fabric.
Now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."
28202,710358824,2261658,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. On the heels of a record end to 2020, we delivered a great Q1 with strong gross bookings, in fact, our best Q1 ever and our second best net bookings quarter ever with solid performance across virtually all",1346,"Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. On the heels of a record end to 2020, we delivered a great Q1 with strong gross bookings, in fact, our best Q1 ever and our second best net bookings quarter ever with solid performance across virtually all of our key metrics.
Our platform continues to shine with strong inter- and intra-region activity, with a high interest in our expanded product and service capabilities further separating us from our peers. Interconnection revenues now represent 19% of our recurring revenues, reflecting our continued interconnection momentum. With a great start to 2021 and increased visibility over the rest of the year, we're raising our guidance substantially across revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share on a constant currency basis.
Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q1 revenues were $1.596 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year, our 73rd quarter of top line revenue growth, due to strong business performance led by the Americas.
As expected, nonrecurring revenue decreased quarter-over-quarter to 5% of revenues. But as noted on our last earnings call, we anticipate a meaningful rebound in Q2 NRR due to forecasted custom installation work across a number of markets, highlighting the inherent lumpiness of this revenue source. Q1 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $6 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates.
Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $773 million or 48% of revenues, up 10% over the same quarter last year, significantly outperforming our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower net utility costs. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs.
Global Q1 AFFO was $627 million, meaningfully above our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower seasonal recurring capital expenditures. Q1 global MRR churn was 2%, a meaningful step-down with lower churn across all 3 regions. This improved churn is a reflection of our continued discipline strategy of selling the platform for the right customer with the right application and into the right footprint. For 2021, we continue to expect MRR churn to average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter.
Turning to our regional highlights whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were the fastest MRR-growing regions on a year-over-year normalized basis at 10% and 9%, respectively, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw continued momentum with record price-adjusted gross and net bookings, firm pricing and a large step-up in cabinets billing. We're seeing good momentum across many markets in the region with particular spend in Dallas, New York and the smaller metros of Denver and Mexico City.
We have a strong booked but unbilled backlog and continue to expect a large step-up in billing cabinets through the first half of 2021, as partially experienced in Q1 and with more to follow in Q2. Based on this momentum, we expect the Americas normalized quarterly revenue growth rate for the remainder of the year to be at or near 6% or better.
Also, our power hedging strategy minimized the impact to our business from the utility price spikes in Texas during the extreme weather situation in February. Our power hedging program, along with our world-class operational management, ensured we also protected our customers from these price spikes as well. There is no incremental revenue due to this unexpected weather situation. Separately, our Texas and Oklahoma wind farm settlements trended positively during this quarter.
Our EMEA region saw strong bookings in the quarter, including healthy exports and record intra-region activity. Although our flat markets remain core to the region's booking engine, we're also seeing increased customer interest in our edge metros, with strong momentum in Dublin, Madrid and Stockholm and our new market of Muscat and our soon-to-be-open Bordeaux facility. Revenue growth remained strong although moderated from previous levels, as expected, as we lap past our successful cross-connect repricing initiative. Interconnection revenue stepped up to 13% of recurring revenues, showing continued momentum.
And finally, the Asia Pacific region had solid net bookings with good pricing and strong enterprise and cloud growth led by our Singapore and Japan businesses. Utilization rates continue to remain high, but we've opened capacity in key markets this quarter and will add additional capacity through 2021 to ease potential inventory constraints.
I'm now looking at our capital structure. Please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1.8 billion, an increase over the prior quarter, largely due to our inaugural euro-denominated green bond refinancing, which raised EUR 1.1 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 66 basis points. As a result, Equinix now has the lowest weighted average cost of debt capital and the longest weighted average maturity of any publicly traded data center company. We also expect to refinance our remaining U.S. dollar high-yield bond over the near term, further driving down our average cost of debt.
Our net debt levels remain low relative to our peers at 3.7x our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA. We continue to work alongside our credit rating agencies and are pleased to announce that earlier today, S&P upgraded Equinix to BBB flat and widened our leverage tolerance to 5x. One, we're very appreciative of the continued support we get from S&P, and importantly, we're delighted with this increased financial flexibility. Looking forward, as stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth opportunities while creating long-term value for our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $564 million, including recurring CapEx of $20 million. We opened 8 new retail projects this quarter, adding 7,400 cabinets, including a new IBX in Milan. On the xScale side of the business, we opened 3 new facilities in London, Paris and Tokyo, adding an initial 28 megawatts of capacity in our JVs. All this hyperscale capacity has been presold. We also purchased land and buildings for development in Montreal and Mexico City. Revenues from owned assets represent 56% of our total revenues now.
Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our now 154 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Also consistent with prior years, during Q1, we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise. Our stabilized asset count increased by net 7 IBXs. These stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.
And now please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending GPX India acquisition, which is expected to close in Q2, nor any future capital market activities.
For the full year 2021, we're raising our underlying revenues guidance by $40 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $33 million, primarily due to strong operating performance and favorable net utility costs. This guidance implies a normalizing constant currency growth rate of 7% to 8% year-over-year and an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 47%.
And given the operating momentum of the business, we're raising our 2021 AFFO by $26 million to grow between 10% and 12% on a normalized and constant currency basis compared to the previous year. We're also raising our 2021 AFFO per share to range -- to now grow between 9% and 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis.
2021 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.725 billion and $2.975 billion, including approximately $180 million of recurring CapEx spend, which represents about 3% of revenues. This guidance also includes an incremental $200 million of balance sheet xScale projects, funds that we expect to recover after contributing these investments into our current and our future JVs.
So let me stop here. I'll turn the call back to Charles."

But I would say that I think that we are -- we continue to believe, and as we've talked about this many times, that the best -- our best way of managing churn is to continue to be really disciplined in our targeting and our execution of the go-to-market engine. And I think that we're seeing that the mix of business continues to be right on the money for what we want.
I think we're selling a lot of business into that -- the sweet spot of sort of small to midsized interconnection-heavy applications and use cases. And again, I think that's going to bode well for us over time. So I mentioned this in several other forums, which is we have been -- the last 2 quarters, up towards the high end of the range and even slightly over in Q4 but now down right at the bottom of the range. And I think we're really seeing positive trending on the churn. So -- and we have efforts underway to really identify all of the -- really project out and look at churn risk in the business in a very sophisticated way, identify, get ahead of it, and I think we're seeing real dividends from that."

Or could that potentially accelerate? And if you could remind us how that translates into fee income. There's like 4 different ways you get paid, but some of that may be more front-loaded than others before, where you would get the revenue before -- or recognize revenues before the customer actually moves in.
And then on Slide 23, just on the lease renewals, I'm wondering what would be a realistic remaining pipeline to think about that would enable you to convert leased properties to owned properties. Or is it mainly a matter of managing your renewals going forward?"

But look, we're delighted with -- and see efforts of Krupal and the whole xScale team and the group of people supporting them from within the core Equinix as well as the support we're getting from our partner, GIC, is things are really humming in terms of the xScale business. Obviously, we talked about the fact that we've had great pre-leasing activity on the facilities that we've put out there. I think there is an opportunity for us to increase the pace, and we're going to come back to you at the Analyst Day and really talk about kind of what we would see as the scope of opportunity for xScale going forward.
As you'll recall, we talked about that in 2018 at the Analyst Day. And I think that we were -- we certainly -- I said it in a number of other forums that we're trending more towards the high end of that. And I think we'll give more clarity on what's possible, we think, in the xScale business. But we're targeting the pieces of the pie out there that we think are really strategically important and add to the overall platform value. And again, we're seeing really good momentum in the business right now. And I do think there's an opportunity for us to continue to pick up the pace.

Now having said all of that, you are starting to see the momentum pick up as we announced in our prepared remarks. We introduced 3 new assets in this quarter, and all of them are presold. And so it gives you a sense that the momentum is picking up quite substantially with a fairly robust opportunity in front of us. So what you're going to start to see in the coming quarters is some nonrecurring aspects of the fee income, but you're really going to start to see a ramp-up of the recurring fee stream as well.
And again, we'll talk more about it on the June Analyst Day. But suffice it to say, it is exciting to see the momentum coming from that team. Yes, so let me just leave it there. I think I -- I think we answered your question."

They are -- we have negotiated the purchase price -- the purchase of those acquisitions. It's built into our forward guide, no surprise to you, both as it relates to cash but also the anticipated consumption of those lease arrangements inside our financials.
So we are continuing to acquire where we can. There are some that clearly are more important than others. And so where we can, we will focus on those that are the most important. Yet at the same time, as we think about our future growth, I think if my memory serves, roughly 75% of all of our future growth right now is on property that is owned or we have a long-term arrangement with for a grand lease. And it's -- 75% is going into major metros, notwithstanding the fact that we still have 30-plus -- over 35 projects underway across the world in many, many metros in many, many countries.
So all that said is you'll start to see that continue to go up. It takes time. And then we'll -- I should say we'll answer when we close a bit, suffice it to say there are some transactions that we are anticipating to announce over the not-too-distant future."

One of the things when we report, there's 2 aspects to it. There's the, if you will, the fundamental business that would compare apple-to-apple versus the APAC region, the EMEA region, and then there's the corporate overlay. So if I tell you more specifically about the Americas region in and of itself without the corporate overlay, margins are continuing to improve largely because we have very strong interconnection activity, where we continue to grow our customer base and our scale and we're driving more profitability into the business. So that's the -- if you will, the easy response.
The second part is that just timing of expenses. As you know, between Q3, 4 and then this quarter, there have been some movement of costs around different quarters. And as a result, we start to see the benefit of those -- of that movement in Q4. And specifically, as it relates to Q1, though, again, one of the comments we made was that we have a very strong utility cost of power hedging program. Our operational team operate our businesses very, very effectively the assets, particularly in the Americas, in this particular case, vis-à-vis Texas. And so we have a strong hedging program that protected us against those spikes in price.
But we also have a wind farm arrangement where, both in Texas and in Oklahoma, we have wind farms, and so we had some benefit attached to that. And then there's some seasonality around our repairs and maintenance expense. But overall, you're seeing fundamentally a U.S. business or Americas business that is performing exceedingly well and continue to drive margin into its financials, offset by the corporate investments that we've been making."

So as it relates to xScale, look, number one, it's going to be very market-dependent, right? Some markets are more competitive than other markets, and you're looking at unlevered anywhere from sort of unlevered returns of 8% to 12% at the project level. We get a fee stream on top of that, and then, of course, we put some debt on the business. So as a result, when you look at hopefully, Equinix position, our return profile is as good, if not better, than what we've shared.
Now having said all of that, if you ask me on a specific project, there'll be some variation. But the team under Krupal's leadership are working really well, not only with our construction team but with our JV partners, to make sure that we get the right returns and we're negotiating appropriately with the various hyperscalers to get a good long-term contract.
So overall, again, I would just say that there's no material variance from what we said [ depending ] it's a little bit better. And as Charles made in his prior comments, in fact, there's probably a broader or bigger appetite over the coming quarters and years, given the momentum that we're seeing that you'll see maybe us do more than we originally anticipated from the June 2018 Analyst Day."

Some of it will be green. That would be -- that tends to be on the shorter end of the curve.
And then the only other thing I would say is to the extent that we can, we will take advantage of there's -- the opportunity to make sure that we can retire some of our foreign debt where possible and arbitrage over a favorable sort of interest rate environment.
And the last thing I'd just want to say is, again, we're delighted with the work that our treasury team has been doing under Melanie's leadership to negotiate with S&P and get a favorable upgrade. But what was really important here is more financial flexibility. And as many of you have asked over both in our private sessions but also on some of the calls, we've always wanted to have more financial flexibility as it relates to debt. And no surprise to everybody, debt's our cheapest source of capital.
And as a result, you will see us continue to focus on refinancing the debt and then also using debt, where appropriate, with some balance to equity to make sure that we create this long-term investment portfolio that we're -- that we've announced. And from our perspective, I just think it was the best of all situations today that not only getting that upgrade but also having the flexibility to drive down our cost of capital."

One is what is -- how is the underlying business performing and is $40 million an uplift. The second part is what currency. And based on the forecast rates that we're using, there's a $61 million downdraft.
If I -- frankly, if I took the spot rates from today, which we don't do the day of. We -- obviously, we have forecast rates, that $61 million would be cut in half, if not by more, just to give you a perspective. Having said all of that, when you look at the fundamental underlying business, it's all about the rounding. Again, what you've done -- what we've done is we've taken a step up, added $40 million of revenue on a $6 billion business. And now you're starting to see us move up into the range in the 7% to 8% range. So before, the bottom end of the range was slightly below 7%, now you basically -- you're well into the range of the 7% to 8%.
Again, this is the first step that we've made since the Q4 earnings call. Again, there's momentum in the business, and we're just delighted by the ability to be able to raise $40 million on the underlying business."

And then the other 2 regions sort of down the middle, there's some aspect due to our prior pricing uplift in Europe, sort of have -- we're lapping through, if you will, those price increases and some of the accounting adjustments we made last year. But the reality is that overall, the business is performing well across our platform, and that's what excites us most.
But if I was to say one specific thing, it's the Americas business. We're just delighted by the momentum that we're seeing. Charles made the comment in his prepared remarks. There's over 4,000 transactions with over 3,000 customers in the quarter. We're operating at a scale that is just so substantial. And by the way, our pipeline is exceedingly strong.

But ultimately, when we get that reimbursement from the joint venture, it comes through a different line. And so it will be the sale or disposition of that construction and progress into the JV. And so basically, it's a gross-up, if you will.
And so that's how it gets represented. But going forward, as Charles said, our objective is to do most of this work inside the JV instead of on our balance sheet.

I think if you were to step back and say, what is the overall bias to the U.S. dollar, it's for the U.S. dollar to get weaker. And that is something that we anticipate. Having said all of that, when we go through our exercise to forecast and re-forecast a given quarter, we have to look at the prevailing rates irrespective of what they might be in the future.
And so as a company, when we -- on the Q4 call, if you recall, we took out -- there's $106 million, if you will, wind at our back from the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the basket of currencies that we operate in. This quarter, that actually reversed to when we annualized the impact, so there was a $61 million headwind. But as I said in one of my other responses, that's based on our forecast rates that we used when we re-forecasted the year and we're giving you the guidance. If I use the spot rates of today, there basically is -- that $61 million would drop actually by $45 million. So it tells you that the U.S. dollar weakened again.
So again, we try and bring a lot of discipline to how we message it. It's at the point in time when you do the forecast. We are not projecting forward on what might happen. If it does happen, then you'll see a benefit, and you'll see that benefit primarily because roughly 60% of our revenues are earned in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. And so when the U.S. dollar weakens, again, recognize we do have some hedges and they take time to burn off, then you'll see an uplift in revenue accordingly. So hopefully, that answers your question. And -- but let me stop there and just see if I did answer your question."

We did not see any sort of extension -- significant extension of the selling cycle. In fact, I would say that I think what we're finding is that we're improving our skill set and capability of delivering the sort of the digital transformation-oriented messaging to our enterprise prospects and seeing good momentum in terms of bringing those sales cycles down.
And so we haven't seen that. Hyperscale sales cycles are a little longer, but I wouldn't say they have protracted. In fact, I think we've made really good progress with several of our key hyperscale customers trying to define more repeatable terms that we can do business under, which is compressing the time frame in which we can get deals done. And it's been -- and that's been an important priority for us and one that we have really put a lot of energy into of late, and it's really important to our partners and customers.
So I would say no, I feel good about the sales cycle right now. In fact, I think when we're looking at our funnel, we're seeing a very deep funnel, and we're feeling like conversion rates and conversion timing support optimism about the remainder of the year, which is all kind of reflected in our guidance."

We'll also talk about our road map for digital services and how we're adding to and scaling capabilities like Network Edge and Equinix Metal and maybe what we have on the horizon in terms of how those digital services are really going to be responsive to how our customers are thinking about consuming and adapting their digital infrastructure for the world ahead. And I think that right now, we continue to see great momentum, great response from our customers, and we're eager to share those things coming in June."

Because I do think there are markets where we've seen that because I think Keith quoted 8% to 12% as sort of yields that we're looking at in terms of a range, and there are markets that are at the -- certainly at the low end of that were -- due to a variety of circumstances and just the overall competitive nature of the market.
But I think in terms of -- I think we're very pleased with the nature of our relationship with GIC. We think that we can continue to extend that and have other JVs of similar ilk around the world under very favorable set of terms. We find ourselves to be a very attractive partner based on the engagement that we've had as we've looked at these JVs. And so we expect we're going to be able to get very favorable terms for those partnerships and have them be very much a win-win.

It is, to some degree, concentrated. I think it's just that's the nature of the hyperscale community today is that the largest end of that is taking up more of the overall demand or providing more of the overall demand. So it's concentrated at some level. 
But we have had significant success beyond sort of the 3 or 4 that would pop to mind for people right off the top of their head. And so I think we're going to continue to evaluate those opportunities. But I -- and I would say that we're really continuing to build on a strong relationship we've had with that full hyperscale community for a very long time. Because as I talked about with our -- when I characterized our hyperscale relationships at the Analyst Day in 2018, we -- they are amongst our largest customers, many of them. And that is a lot of it on the backs of really the important role that we play in terms of their network nodes, their on-ramps and other elements of their infrastructure outside of sort of availability zones and really large core deployments that might be more of the focus of xScale.
So it's a very multifaceted relationship that we have with them. They're critical. We believe that as people adopt hybrid and multicloud as the architecture of choice, we think doing that at Equinix is really going to be a key priority for them in terms of both superior economics and performance. And so the relationships that we have with the xScale -- or with the hyperscalers are very important to us. And it's certainly, to some degree, concentrated from a demand basis, but we're continuing to strive to extend that to a larger portfolio of customers."

Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As reflected on our results, we are seeing significant momentum in our business as digital transformation outpaces previous expectations. Technology spend is accelerating, and Equinix remains uniquely positioned as traditional technology markets continue to shift to as a service consumption models and hybrid multi-cloud is widely adopted as the architecture of choice. 
The pandemic has highlighted that digital infrastructure is not just a business enabler, but a primary source of competitive advantage for digital leaders across all industries. And we continue to see a multitude of trends driving infrastructure that is more distributed, more on-demand and more ecosystem connected than ever before, playing to our distinctive strengths. Our results reflect strong performance across our geographies, tremendous momentum in our market-leading interconnection franchise and deep customer demand across our expanding portfolio of services. 
Against this robust demand backdrop, we had a great second quarter, delivering record bookings fueled by continued momentum in our Americas business and a strong quarter from Equinix Metal. We processed more than 4,600 deals in the quarter across more than 3,200 customers, demonstrating both the scale and the consistency of our go-to-market machine. We achieved our 74th consecutive quarter of top line growth and are pleased to have been recently been included in the Fortune 500, an exciting milestone made possible by the confidence our customers place in Equinix and by the incredible commitment into action of our 10,000-plus employees around the world. 
And we continue to expand our global platform with 35 projects underway across 25 markets in 19 countries, with Q2 openings in Bordeaux, Helsinki and Silicon Valley. Aligned with our values and our purpose, we're also proud to share further enhancements to our old commitments on sustainability, leading in across all elements of ESG.In early June, we became the first in the data center industry to commit to being climate neutral by 2030, backed by science-based targets, an aggressive green financing plan and a comprehensive sustainability agenda. Aligned with the current climate agreement, this commitment is a critical step to ensuring Equinix continues to advance investments and innovations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and greening our customers' digital supply chains. 
Additionally, as part of our ongoing focus on diversity, inclusion and belonging and our commitment to wellbeing, we recently hosted our Second Annual We Connect event, a 24-hour virtual gathering led by our employee connection networks and our DIB and wellbeing teams. This event celebrates equality, diversity and connection and offers our employees an opportunity to listen, to learn and to engage and create these conversations as we build a culture and a community that can have a meaningful, sustainable impact on the future of our world. 
Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $1.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7% year-over-year, and AFFO was again meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Interconnection revenues grew 12% year-over-year with solid unit adds and healthy pricing. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our global interconnection franchise continues to perform well. We now have over 406,000 total interconnections on our industry-leading platform. In Q2, we added an incremental 7,800 interconnections and now have 15 metros with more than 10,000 total interconnections, a reflection of the scaled digital ecosystems that drive our differentiated value proposition. 
Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 31% year-over-year. And we're seeing IX diversify as large-scale period expands to a broader base of enterprise customers.  Equinix Fabric saw excellent growth across all 3 regions, driven by healthy unit growth and increasing yields as customers expand usage of higher bandwidth connections to interconnect regional and global footprints. More than 2,600 customers are now on Fabric, and we continue to see strong attach rates as businesses diversify their end destinations and evolve their connectivity needs in support of highly-distributed infrastructure and the adoption of higher multi-cloud. 
Turning to Digital Infrastructure services, customers are responding very positively as we augment our portfolio to enable physical infrastructure delivered at software speed. We had strong bookings with Equinix Metal this quarter, including our largest win to date with our channel partner, [ Avance ] for a blockchain company, building a network of validation nodes across 8 markets. Our network edge offering showed meaningful acceleration with average deal size increasing nicely as enterprise customers are deploying a diverse set of virtualized network functions from our marketplace vendors. Importantly, and as expected, digital infrastructure services are also driving strong cross-selling activity and interconnection pull-through, with nearly 1,000 vertical connections already provisioned to support these deployments. 
Shifting to our xScale initiative, we continue to expand our plans in light of robust market demand and positive customer feedback. Late in the quarter, we announced agreements for additional joint ventures with GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund. When closed and fully built out, the total investment between Equinix and GIC in our xScale data center portfolio, we will be nearly $7 billion across 32 facilities globally, with more than 600 megawatts of power capacity. We currently have 7 xScale builds under development across all 3 regions, and we pre-leased our entire Frankfurt 9 assay in Q2, representing 18 megawatts of capacity fully committed in advance of delivery. With this deal, we have now have -- have now leased more than 100 megawatts of xScale capacity and 100% of our open capacity at least. We are actively engaged with partners to develop entry plans and other expansion markets globally, including Australia. 
Now let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical delivered strong bookings across all 3 regions, with particular strength in APAC as traditional carriers continue to invest and specialty telecom firms evolve their portfolios to address demand for cloud, mobile, IP services and over-the-top delivery. New wins and expansions this quarter, including the [ KayW ], a local telecom service provider, leveraging interconnection to better serve low latency financial customers. [ Crosslay Fiber ], a leading provider of network services deploying in our London 4 and Paris 7 IBXs to support the first new subsea cable laid across the U.S. channel in nearly 20 years. And a global telecommunications provider expanding their presence to new locations, including Milan and Bordeaux. 
Our cloud and IT vertical saw continued momentum over indexing Europe as organizations accelerate hybrid multiplied adoption. Expansions this quarter included Zoom, a leading video communications platform, expanding coverage and scale to support market demand and a cloud-delivered enterprise network security provider deploying infrastructure to support offerings in new locations. Our enterprise vertical achieved record bookings, with broad global strength punctuated by an exceptionally strong quarter in the Americas across several subsegments, including health care, consumer services, business and professional services and retail. 
New wins and expansions included Red Bull, a major sports energy drink manufacturer, deploying infrastructure across all 3 regions to take advantage of Equinix' cloud ecosystem. A leading global cosmetics retailer deploying digital infrastructure to optimize their network, move out of legacy data centers and locate private infrastructure adjacent to their cloud providers. And a Fortune 500 global insurance provider optimizing their infrastructure to support multi-cloud. 
Content and digital media also achieved solid bookings led by growth in CDM, publishing and digital media and gaming, as digital transformation continues to shape this vertical. Expansions included StackPath, a leading edge computing and services provider, deploying infrastructure across multiple edge locations; [ Earnest Research ], a leading data analytics company, transforming network topology and interconnecting to multiple for cross-platform ethics; and [ i3D.net ], a leading provider of application hosting and infrastructure services, deploying on Platform Equinix to enable a consistent high-performance gaming experience globally. 
And our channel program continues to outperform, delivering a record quarter and accounting for over 35% of bookings. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and use cases including multiple Equinix Metal and edge deals as the channel embraces our digital infrastructure services. We saw continued strength from alliance partners like AWS, Cisco, Dell, Google, IBM and Microsoft. And we also had success with key resellers around the world, including a win with HPV for [ Rollers Group ], a leading Australian retailer, to modernize and scale their payments platform, which processes over 30 million transactions per day. 
So now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."

No surprise, we were ea",1312,"Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. I hope you and your families are well and enjoying the summer months. So let me start by saying it was great to spend time with many of you, albeit virtually at our June Analyst Day. No surprise, we were eager to share our plans on how we tend to scale, extend and innovate the business over the coming years to drive long-term shareholder value, meaning more revenues, higher margins and more cash flows. 
With respect to the quarter, the business continues to perform exceedingly well, as the macro environment for digital infrastructure continues to drive favorable demand. In fact, we exceeded our expectations. There are many highlights to share with you from the quarter. To start, we had record bookings activity at both the company and the Americas regional level. We enjoyed robust channel activity and lower-than-planned churn. Interconnection additions were solid, both physically and virtually, and our digital infrastructure service lines, which include edge and metal, are gaining momentum. Simply put, we're continuing to execute against the goals highlighted at the Analyst Day. And given our performance, we're raising our guidance across each of revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share for the year. 
Now let me cover the results for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $1.658 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year due to strong business performance across our platform, led by the Americas region. And as expected, nonrecurring revenues increased quarter-over-quarter to 7% of revenues due to a meaningful step-up in xScale joint venture fees in APAC and EMEA and custom installation work across all 3 regions. As you can appreciate, nonrecurring revenues are inherently lumpy and therefore, as a result, we expect our Q3 nonrecurring revenues to decrease by $8 million compared to Q2. Our backlog of booked-but-yet-to-be-built cabinets has increased slightly, despite the 4,200 increase in billing cabinets in the quarter. Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included an $11 million benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. 
Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $797 million or 48% of revenues, up 7% over the same quarter last year, meaningfully outperforming our expectations due to strong operating performance and timing of spend. Q2 included a planned rebound in repairs and maintenance spending and higher utility costs relative to Q1. Q2 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, includes a $6 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs. Total Q2 AFFO was $632 million, including a $25 million recurring CapEx increase compared to the prior quarter, above our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower integration costs. 
Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC had the highest year-over-year revenue growth of 11%, owed by the Americas and EMEA regions, both at 8%. The EMEA revenue growth rate reflects the lapping of the significant interconnection price increases and other one-off positive adjustments from last year. We expect the EMEA growth rate to return to normalized levels in Q4. The Americas region saw continued strength with our second consecutive quarter of record bookings, as 6 of our 7 largest markets improved over the prior year. Also, we're enjoying healthy booking activity across our smaller markets, too, including Atlanta, Boston, Denver and Seattle. Deals were focused on retail interconnected deployments with healthy pricing. And the Americas region also benefited from strong imports from the other 2 regions, a reflection of our continued focus on platform selling. 
Our EMEA region had a strong quarter led by Dublin and Stockholm and our newly-opened Bordeaux market as well as high exports to the other 2 regions. Enterprise has contributed approximately 1/3 of the region's bookings, up significantly over the prior year. We're also seeing good momentum across our flat markets. And the EMEA region benefited from nonrecurring revenues related to xScale fees earned from the pre-lease of our entire Frankfurt 9 and London 11 buildings, 37 megawatts of demand. And finally, Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter, led by Singapore and Japan with strong regional bookings. Pricing for small- and medium-sized deals remain strong, and we're seeing good traction with Equinix Metal. The APAC region's quarterly MRR growth was partially constrained due to COVID-related capacity delays in Singapore and political uncertainty in our Hong Kong market. 
And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to Slides 8 and 9. We ended the quarter with cash of about $1.8 billion, and our net debt leverage ratio is 3.8x our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, highlighting the financial flexibility and strategic advantage we have relative to anyone else in our space. In May, we raised $2.6 billion, including an incremental $1 billion in green notes. Since Equinix' inaugural investment-grade issuance in late 2019, we've reduced our annualized interest expense by approximately $196 million, offset in part by the incremental debt capital raised. Our blended cost of [ borrow ] is now the lowest in the industry at approximately 1.7% and our weighted average maturity is nearly 10 years. We also raised $100 million of ATM equity in the quarter. We continue to expect to use both debt and equity to fund our future business needs with an increased leading towards debt capital. 
Turning to Slide 10 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $692 million, including recurring CapEx of $45 million. We opened 3 new retail projects this quarter, including new IBXs in Bordeaux and Silicon Valley. We also purchased lab for development in Frankfurt and Helsinki. Revenues from owned assets now represents 58% of our total revenue due to the acquisition of our Singapore 3 IBXs. On the xScale side of the business, after quarter end, we contributed our Dublin 5 asset to the EMEA joint venture in return for net proceeds after our 20% equity contribution of $49 million. 
Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 11. Our 153 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 86% utilized and generated a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross [ PP&E ] invested. Looking forward, we expect to exit the year closer to the top end of our stabilized asset growth rate, in part due to strong Americas revenue growth. 
Please refer to Slides 12 through 16 for our updated summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending GPX India acquisition, which is expected to close in Q3. For the full year 2021, we're raising our revenue guidance by $50 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $27 million, primarily due to strong operating performance and favorable FX rates, although slightly offset due to the timing of spend as we proactively pulled forward expenditures to mitigate supply chain risks. This guidance implies a normalized and constant currency revenue growth rate of approximately 8% in midpoint compared to the prior year and an adjusted EBITDA margin of greater than 47%. And given the operating momentum of the business, we're raising our 2021 AFFO guidance by $15 million, growing 10% to 12% on a normalized and constant currency basis compared to the previous year, while also increasing our AFFO per share range. 
2021 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.7 billion and $3 billion, including an approximate $450 million of on-balance sheet xScale CapEx, a significant portion, which is expected to be reimbursed by either the current or future JVs and $193 million of recurring CapEx spend, a slight increase over the prior quarter due to timing of spend as we mitigate supply chain risks. 
So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles."

The momentum behind digital transformation is as robust as ever and shows no signs of letting up. As a world digital infrastructure company, Equinix plays a unique role in this evolving story and is positioned to be both a catalyst and a key beneficiary as we partner with customers to unlock the enormous promise of digital, both economically and socially. 
As we discussed at our recent Analyst Day, we are focused on 3 strategic levers as we execute on this transformational opportunity. First, we will continue to scale, doubling down on the strength of our core business, investing to further scale our go-to-market machine to win new customers, putting our capital to work to add capacity in existing markets and executing on targeted operational improvements to standardize, simplify and automate, driving expanded operating margins and providing a better experience for customers and partners. Second, we will extend the reach of our platform and accelerate our aspirations in xScale. By the end of this year, we'll be in 66 markets around the world and see continued opportunities for expansion in growth across both retail and xScale. And third, we will continue to innovate across our portfolio supporting scalability, self-service and energy efficiency across our colo estate, delivering advanced features to sustain momentum in our market-leading interconnection franchise and driving adoption of our digital infrastructure services to deepen our relevance to customers. 
Our ability to scale, extend and innovate starts with our people and with our commitment to building a diverse and inclusive workplace for every person every day can confidently say, ""I'm safe, I belong, and I matter."" We show up every day with an in service to, mindset, starting by being in service to each other, which enables us in turn to be in service to our customers, to our communities and to you, our shareholders. Purpose creates passion, and we are inspired by ours to be the platform where the world comes together, serving as an enabling force for our customers and unlocking their incredible potential to deliver the innovations that enrich our work, our life and our planet.

Let me take the first one and then we'll -- let me take the first question. First and foremost, when we came up the Analyst Day, one of the questions we spend a lot of energy talking about was the AFFO per share growth rate in the first -- sorry, in 2022 relative to the broader guide. 
The reason I said it was going to be in the bottom half of the range instead of the top half of the range was, one, it was a reflection of all the investments we're making across our portfolio this year, not only as it relates to xScale but also our digital infrastructure services and all the efficiency initiatives. And so we were absorbing the full annualized impact of those costs in 2022. As a result, it tends to cause us to be a little bit more dilutive on the per share metric relative to the broader guide. In addition, of course, you're -- you've got a very strong guide for this year as well. And so we've had the benefit of refinancing out of the majority of our high-yield debt and so you've got a little bit of wind at your back and you won't have that wind at your back next year. So that's the primary reason. 
Relative to the comments we made about this year and raising our guide, probably not a big surprise to many of you as we saw a lot of this coming and it's reflected in our long-term model. That all said, we saw the ability to move our numbers up. But it's a 5-year plan, as you can appreciate. And so I wouldn't say that we're changing the trajectory on the guide for Analyst Day, just because we had one good quarter that doesn't feel like the right thing to do. 
Secondly, as it relates to the ATM, like anything, we are going to use a little bit of debt and equity. This was really commensurate with our commitment to our rating agencies to tap periodically, the ATM facility, but we've dramatically reduced what we anticipate that we would otherwise use. And as a result, you saw $100 million. But the message that I had in the prepared remarks was really the leanest towards debt capital on a go-forward basis for obvious reasons, when the cost of that debt capital, and even over the last few weeks has continued to trend downwards. And so that will be a lean on a go-forward basis. 
So there is always going to be a little bit of a blend. But again, I want to make sure that everybody fully appreciates we want to use the debt capacity that we have on our balance sheet to its fullest advantage, while still at the same time, maintaining very positive relationship with our rating agencies."

And so -- and just qualitatively in the conversations we were having with customers and so that's why we were kind of signaling that optimism. I think that has definitely translated how we expected it. And I think I would say that this quarter was even stronger than I think we would have thought it was going to be, and that's as reflected in our results and therefore, in the adaptation of our guide. And so I think the business is just a really strong quarter from an enterprise perspective. As I said in the sort of script, we -- across all 3 regions, across a variety of sectors, enterprise bookings were very strong. [indiscernible] channel is a big part of that, working not only in terms of pursuing hybrid cloud opportunities with our key alliance partners and the cloud players, but also with our reseller sort of portfolio of partners. 
And so yes, I think we're seeing it in line or better than we had thought. And I think we expect to continue to see sustained output and growth from the enterprise segment. And probably over-indexing again, Cloud and IT and enterprise have been over-indexing for a very long time now. And enterprise just seems to be just a tear in terms of its growth right now."

And so I think there's a long way to go in terms of people who still have a lot of legacy IT architecture that they're looking to adapt to that sort of hybrid multi-cloud world. 
And then the other comment I would make is that the pace of change itself is just continuing to accelerate. And so I think that the technology life cycles and refresh cycles are shortening. I think people are thinking differently about how that -- as I said in my comments, a number of very large technology markets are dislocating as they shift to as a service and as we talked about at Analyst Day, that provides an upside opportunity for us to get a bit more wallet share as those things are delivered as a service, with Equinix as a point of nexus for consuming those services because we're getting both the underlying service prides themselves locating infrastructure at Equinix, and then we're often able to deliver those services on the platform aligned with things like Fabric and Metal and other things that are allowing us more wallet share. 
And so I think we're -- it's still early days. I think there is a long period of IT architecture and digital transformation investment in front of us for the foreseeable future."

You obviously highlighted your ESG initiatives. But any color around how you see that evolving? And how that -- Equinix is positioned for that would be great."

Thanks for the question, Simon. I'll take the one around supply chain. Suffice it to say, we've been investing quite heavily as you've heard us speak about in our procurement and strategic sourcing initiatives under a very strong leadership. And as a result, we are getting ahead of some of the perceived constraints in the marketplace. And we're not -- so it's not only managing our access into the production cycles for this year, but it's also contemplating our consumption needs for next year. That marries up nicely with also the inflationary exposure that one might otherwise have. By entering into broader commitments, you can mitigate some of that inflationary pressure as well. 
Now that all said, I think we're making some great -- we're having great successes in working with our partners, our vendors and our suppliers. And then I would also go on to say that inherent in our contracts is a lot of inflationary protection. So there's the aspect of supply and demand, and then there's the aspect of pricing. And again, we're very confident that our contracts more appropriately contemplate the exposure, to the extent that you've got a higher inflationary environment over the coming years. And so from both perspective, we want to see that and then both to make sure that we protect our interest and revenue, but we also have access to deliver demand and support the cost model. And I think we're doing a good job of that as a company. You, Charles, do you want to talk about the Singapore?"

I mean they're a little bit there in terms of -- I think the question of -- are -- specifically as it relates to Singapore, I think there is -- there was a COVID-related delay in terms of the timing of that facility that created a little bit of a revenue headwind relative to the timing, because demand for that is so strong for us that we had planned on that coming online a little bit earlier, and so we're seeing a little bit less, despite that, delivered a really strong quarter. 
And I do think there is a broader phenomenon, as you described, in terms of markets, thinking about how they're going to allocate capacity and deal with the demand for data centers and the environmental impact. What I would say is that that's exactly why we are making the level of commitment into ESG and in particularly, the environmental side that we are. I think we're really positioned to tell a story there as is now the leader going out and saying, we're going to be climate neutral by 2030. I think we're going to be in a position to really partner with municipalities to say, ""Hey, look, there's a ton of economic and social benefit being driven by digital."" 
I talked about that at the Analyst Day to the tune of $100 trillion and people want to tap into that, but they want to do so responsibly. And I think our ability to make the investments in ESG is going to continue to be something that really differentiates us. And that's not true only in Asia by any means, there's a number of markets around the world facing those same things. And honestly, I think that's going to be a thing, one of the areas where we continue to separate ourselves from the pack. 
On the added piece of color on the prior question, too, on the supply chain sort of constraints and issues now. As I've talked to some people about it, there's really kind of 3 areas in our business where you think about it. You have the data center build side of things. There because of our size, our market leadership, et cetera, I think we feel like we're in a very good position to gain access to the equipment we need to continue to hit our delivery dates. And so feeling in a good position there, but obviously continuing to monitor trends. 
Then you have the networking side of our business where maybe we're a little less positioned. But what we've done is really said, okay, we're going to go ahead and make investments to mitigate risk there. And in fact, that's an area where we have real success. And again, that showed up a bit in the quarter and in our guide as we think about pulling some costs in. And then the third level of it is really at the digital infrastructure services line with things like Metal and that's an area where it's a smaller business for us. And so it will be less impactful, but we are looking there about how we can partner with a number of folks to mitigate supply chain impact there, especially since we had just came off a very strong bookings quarter for Metal, and so we want to be -- make sure that we continue to sustain that momentum."

One, our -- the relationship that we have with what we refer to as our alliance partner group, we mentioned several of them in the script, again, the usual suspects, AWS, Microsoft, Oracle, et cetera, those are posts that we are partnering with as enterprises think through their demand for hybrid infrastructure, we -- they are aligned to advance sales cycles for their public cloud services. And in order to do so, they have to have a comprehensive answer for the customer in terms of the hybrid infrastructure story. And so together, that's a very much a one-and-one-equals-three kind of story, and we can bring that to a customer and have really been effective in winning business together. And so we're seeing real strength there. 
On the reseller side, people that are combining value in certain ways with Equinix value to solve customer problems, we're seeing a nice uptick there. And what I would say is we're seeing more concentration in terms of a smaller number of our really well, highly-capable resellers, delivering more of the revenue. And I think that's a good general dynamic for us. And in terms of the investments we're making, the big area there is really to continue to upgrade our processes and systems, which to be very honest, were not designed channel-ready from the beginning and continue to adapt those to be more channel-friendly. So the quoting, ordering, customer support can all be done in ways that support a customer of a customer or a customer by a channel partner in this case. And so the adaptation of our systems is a -- that's a multiyear sort of trajectory. But that's really the area -- some of the key areas that we're making investments to really better serve channel partners."

I think that -- I do think that success with our -- as we're seeing channels channel partners embrace some of our newer services like Metal and Network Edge, Network Edge is almost inherently sort of a channel service because we're partnering both with people that are providing their virtualized network functions and then with providers who are bringing that to market in tandem with other value. I think we're seeing a bias towards continued strength in the channel, but we also have a continued great success with our direct selling team. And so both are growing nicely. 
So I don't know, channel has been over-indexing a bit. And so I think we will trend towards higher numbers. But it's hard to predict, I think, exactly where we're in. I think if the newer services really accelerate, I think that could bring us to higher channel percentages faster. And in terms of impact on margins, we -- they're really not particularly meaningful in terms of -- our current model is slightly higher cost in that we often are double comping on commissions when we have our direct team partnering with channels. But when you look at the customer lifetime value of these contracts, the implication of that to margins is actually quite small. And given the very attractive profile in terms of return on capital and margin of some of these newer services, I don't feel like that's going to be a significant drag on margins. And in fact, I think our other areas of margin expansion are going to overpower those."

Clearly, you're right. The -- we had a really good quarter, something that we foreshadowed for the last 2 quarters, particularly around the West Coast of the U.S., and so great success, in particular with the cable landing station. That all said, we've introduced some new capacity in the Silicon Valley 11 asset, has come online. And so when you look at the overall utilization rate, it's still in the mid- to low-70s. 
That said, we're going to continue to have success in the Americas. Charles alluded to and I've mentioned it. And so I would assume that, that utilization level is going to continue to move up as we consume the inventory of the assets we've built. I'd also add just on that basis. And I made it -- maybe commented in my prepared remarks, the amount of booked-but-yet-to-be-billed inventory is up slightly, despite all of the inventory that we've -- all of the inventory that moves into the building queues. And so that's a real positive. So it gives you a sense that there has been substantial bookings already that will consume that inventory. 
The other thing I think is really worthy of note this quarter and that matter through the rest of the year, we anticipate that we'll continue to be selling into what was historically known as Verizon assets. We've seen a real nice move up in, as we said, 6 of the 7 markets plus some of the smaller markets in the U.S. and that includes much of the capacity related to the formally known as Verizon assets. 
So we're excited about the momentum. I think you're going to see the Americas region continue to perform well as we said last quarter and we were telling you this quarter through the rest of the year, and we'll update you on '22 when we get there. But overall, we're just delighted by the success we've seen on the heels of all this opportunity."

And interestingly, via channel isn't necessarily showing up in customer count because oftentimes, those are -- the customer of record is the channel partner. And so it's actually -- there's even more strength than sort of appear on the face of the results overall. 
But -- and in terms of where they're coming from, I think we're having pretty uniform success geographically. So there's no one region that is significantly outpacing the others. Obviously, a really strong quarter for the Americas, and that selling team, I think, has been doing an exceptional job, but we're also seeing good new logo capture across the other regions as well. 
And in terms of how it translates into the business, you do see that new logos over-index on a growth rate perspective from vis-a-vis existing customers. And so I think they have the opportunity to -- if we can continue to do that, that's really why when we talk about this three-legged strategy, right, of scale, extend, innovate. Scale is, hey, the customers are buying. And so let's continue to get new customers and add capacity in existing markets to serve them. Then extending in terms of new geographies to increase wallet share and then the innovation side, which is really bringing in new services and the ability to capture more wallet over time in terms of the service types. And so I think it gives us really, a multidimensional growth opportunity that's really showing up. 
So new customers definitely -- I mean, look, we still get the bulk of our bookings from existing customers. And that's sort of always good news in that our customers are expanding. There's less friction than that, there's lower cost to acquire, customer lifetime values continue to go up. But new customers are definitely lifeblood for the business as well. And so we're having focus there and real success there, but it's fairly uniform across geos and across our product set."

There were some favorable tax adjustments associated with the closing of some matters in the quarter. And as a result, because to the tax line, you have to keep pure, and you'll see that there's basically a substantial decrease in tax. It was primarily in relation to a transaction we did in Australia vis-a-vis [ Metronode ], where we're identifying by the other party. And as a result, you've got the benefit on the tax line and you impaired your assets on the other line. And so net-net, it has no meaningful impact on the P&L, but it gets disclosed separately and it's grossed up. And so how it sort of shows itself independent in the other income and expense line. So that's what happened there. But again, as it relates to AFFO, there is no meaningful move, because it was embedded in the other lines. 
Then as it relates to the margin question, yes, we've done very well in the first 2 quarters of the year. As we continue to say, we want to guide you to what we think will happen for the year. No surprise. And although for the year, we're seeing greater than 47%, we are making a relatively meaningful investment. Q2, we added, net roughly 250 heads to the organization. Q3 and Q4, we're going to add another 700 to 800 heads to the organization. As a result, you're absorbing the human capital that we need to invest in our growth. And so that's one aspect of it. 
Two, you've got the seasonal impact of utilities in the Americas that's coming through. And then three, because in Q1, Q2, we've had the benefit of a number of nonrecurring revenue items that don't carry a lot of costs with them, so the JV fees when we sell an asset, and we've got a sales fee or we get development fee, as you know, and as you can see in our results, it comes through on the revenue line, but there's very old a drag to the bottom line. And so it's going to be inherently lumpy and we just don't see a lot of that through the second half of the year. If anything, as I mentioned, nonrecurring revenue will be down in Q3 over Q2. But then it's going to flat line in Q4, and there will be another one-off fee that likely gets recorded in the fourth quarter. But bottom line, that's [indiscernible]."

Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As reflected on our results, we are seeing significant momentum in our business as digital transformation outpaces previous expectations. Technology spend is accelerating, and Equinix remains uniquely positioned as traditional technology markets continue to shift to as-a-service consumption models and hybrid multicloud is widely adopted as the architecture of choice.  
The pandemic has highlighted that digital infrastructure is not just a business enabler, but a primary source of competitive advantage for digital leaders across all industries, and we continue to see a multitude of trends driving infrastructure that is more distributed, more on-demand and more ecosystem connected than ever before, playing to our distinctive strengths. Our results reflect strong performance across our geographies, tremendous momentum in our market-leading interconnection franchise and deep customer demand across our expanding portfolio of services.  
Against this robust demand backdrop, we had a great second quarter, delivering record bookings fueled by continued momentum in our Americas business and a strong quarter from Equinix Metal. We processed more than 4,600 deals in the quarter across more than 3,200 customers, demonstrating both the scale and the consistency of our go-to-market machine. We achieved our 74th consecutive quarter of top line growth and are pleased to have been recently been included in the Fortune 500, an exciting milestone made possible by the confidence our customers place in Equinix and by the incredible commitment and passion of our 10,000-plus employees around the world.  
And we continue to expand our global platform with 35 projects underway across 25 markets in 19 countries, with Q2 openings in Bordeaux, Helsinki and Silicon Valley. Aligned with our values and our purpose, we're also proud to share further enhancements to our old commitments on sustainability, leaning in across all elements of ESG. 
In early June, we became the first in the data center industry to commit to being climate neutral by 2030, backed by science-based targets, an aggressive green financing plan and a comprehensive sustainability agenda. Aligned with the current climate agreement, this commitment is a critical step to ensuring Equinix continues to advance investments and innovations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and greening our customers' digital supply chains. 
Additionally, as part of our ongoing focus on diversity, inclusion and belonging and our commitment to well-being, we recently hosted our Second Annual WeConnect event, a 24-hour virtual gathering led by our employee connection networks and our DIB and well-being teams. This event celebrates equality, diversity and connection and offers our employees an opportunity to listen, to learn and to engage in courageous conversations as we build a culture and a community that can have a meaningful, sustainable impact on the future of our world.  
Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $1.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7% year-over-year, and AFFO was again meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Interconnection revenues grew 12% year-over-year with solid unit adds and healthy pricing. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our global interconnection franchise continues to perform well. We now have over 406,000 total interconnections on our industry-leading platform. In Q2, we added an incremental 7,800 interconnections and now have 15 metros with more than 10,000 total interconnections, a reflection of the scaled digital ecosystems that drive our differentiated value proposition.  
Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 31% year-over-year. And we're seeing IX diversify as large-scale peering expands to a broader base of enterprise customers. Equinix Fabric saw excellent growth across all 3 regions, driven by healthy unit growth and increasing yields as customers expand usage of higher bandwidth connections to interconnect regional and global footprints. More than 2,600 customers are now on Fabric, and we continue to see strong attach rates as businesses diversify their end destinations and evolve their connectivity needs in support of highly-distributed infrastructure and the adoption of hybrid multicloud.  
Turning to digital infrastructure services, customers are responding very positively as we augment our portfolio to enable physical infrastructure delivered at software speed. We had strong bookings with Equinix Metal this quarter, including our largest win to date with our channel partner, Avant, for a blockchain company, building a network of validation nodes across 8 markets. 
Our network edge offering showed meaningful acceleration with average deal size increasing nicely as enterprise customers are deploying a diverse set of virtualized network functions from our marketplace vendors. Importantly, and as expected, digital infrastructure services are also driving strong cross-selling activity and interconnection pull-through with nearly 1,000 vertical connections already provisioned to support these deployments. 
Shifting to our xScale initiative. We continue to expand our plans in light of robust market demand and positive customer feedback. Late in the quarter, we announced agreements for additional joint ventures with GIC, Singapore sovereign well fund. When closed and fully built out, the total investment between Equinix and GIC in our xScale data center portfolio, we will be nearly $7 billion across 32 facilities globally, with more than 600 megawatts of power capacity. 
We currently have 7 xScale builds under development across all 3 regions, and we pre-leased our entire Frankfurt 9 asset in Q2, representing 18 megawatts of capacity fully committed in advance of delivery. With this deal, we have -- now have -- have now leased more than 100 megawatts of xScale capacity and 100% of our open capacity at least. We are actively engaged with partners to develop entry plans and other expansion markets globally, including Australia.  
Now let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical delivered strong bookings across all 3 regions, with particular strength in APAC as traditional carriers continue to invest and specialty telecom firms evolve their portfolios to address demand for cloud, mobile, IP services and over-the-top delivery. New wins and expansions this quarter, including McKay Brothers, a local telecom service provider, leveraging interconnection to better serve low latency financial customers. Crosslake Fibre, a leading provider of network services deploying in our London 4 and Paris 7 IBXs to support the first new subsea cable laid across the U.S. channel in nearly 20 years and a global telecommunications provider expanding their presence to new locations, including Milan and Bordeaux.  
Our cloud and IT vertical saw continued momentum over indexing Europe as organizations accelerate hybrid multicloud adoption. Expansions this quarter included Zoom, a leading video communications platform, expanding coverage and scale to support market demand and a cloud-delivered enterprise network security provider deploying infrastructure to support offerings in new locations. Our enterprise vertical achieved record bookings, with broad global strength punctuated by an exceptionally strong quarter in the Americas across several subsegments, including health care, consumer services, business and professional services and retail.  
New wins and expansions included Red Bull, a major sports energy drink manufacturer, deploying infrastructure across all 3 regions to take advantage of Equinix' cloud ecosystem; a leading global cosmetics retailer deploying digital infrastructure to optimize their network, move out of legacy data centers and locate private infrastructure adjacent to their cloud providers; and a Fortune 500 global insurance provider optimizing their infrastructure to support multicloud. Content and digital media also achieved solid bookings led by growth in CDM, publishing and digital media and gaming, as digital transformation continues to shape this vertical. Expansions included StackPath, a leading edge computing and services provider, deploying infrastructure across multiple edge locations; Earnest Research, a leading data analytics company, transforming network topology and interconnecting to multiple cloud across Platform Equinix; and i3D.net, a leading provider of application hosting and infrastructure services, deploying on Platform Equinix to enable a consistent high-performance gaming experience globally.  
And our channel program continues to outperform, delivering a record quarter and accounting for over 35% of bookings. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and use cases including multiple Equinix Metal and edge deals as the channel embraces our digital infrastructure services. We saw continued strength from alliance partners like AWS, Cisco, Dell, Google, IBM and Microsoft. And we also had success with key resellers around the world, including a win with HPE for Woolworths Group, a leading Australian retailer, to modernize and scale their payments platform, which processes over 30 million transactions per day.  
So now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."

I hope you and your families are well and enjoying the summer months. So let me start by saying it was great to spend time with many of you, albeit virtually at our June Analyst Day. No surprise, we were ea",1314,"Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. I hope you and your families are well and enjoying the summer months. So let me start by saying it was great to spend time with many of you, albeit virtually at our June Analyst Day. No surprise, we were eager to share our plans on how we intend to scale, extend and innovate the business over the coming years to drive long-term shareholder value, meaning more revenues, higher margins and more cash flows.  
With respect to the quarter, the business continues to perform exceedingly well, as the macro environment for digital infrastructure continues to drive favorable demand. In fact, we exceeded our expectations. There are many highlights to share with you through the quarter. To start, we had record bookings activity at both the company and the Americas regional level. We enjoyed robust channel activity and lower-than-planned churn. Interconnection additions were solid, both physically and virtually, and our digital infrastructure service lines, which include edge and metal, are gaining momentum. Simply put, we're continuing to execute against the goals highlighted at the Analyst Day. And given our performance, we're raising our guidance across each of revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share for the year.  
Now let me cover the results for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $1.658 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year due to strong business performance across our platform, led by the Americas region. And as expected, nonrecurring revenues increased quarter-over-quarter to 7% of revenues due to a meaningful step-up in xScale joint venture fees in APAC and EMEA and custom installation work across all 3 regions. As you can appreciate, nonrecurring revenues are inherently lumpy and therefore, as a result, we expect our Q3 nonrecurring revenues to decrease by $8 million compared to Q2.  
Our backlog of ""booked but yet to be built"" cabinets has increased slightly, despite the 4,200 increase in billing cabinets in the quarter. Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included an $11 million benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. 
Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $797 million or 48% of revenues, up 7% over the same quarter last year, meaningfully outperforming our expectations due to strong operating performance and the timing of spend. Q2 included a planned rebound in repairs and maintenance spending and higher utility costs relative to Q1. Q2 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, includes a $6 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs. Total Q2 AFFO was $632 million, including a $25 million recurring CapEx increase compared to the prior quarter, above our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower integration costs. 
Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC had the highest year-over-year revenue growth of 11%, owned by the Americas and EMEA regions, both at 8%. The EMEA revenue growth rate reflects the lapping of the significant interconnection price increases and other one-off positive adjustments from last year. We expect the EMEA growth rate to return to normalized levels in Q4. The Americas region saw continued strength with our second consecutive quarter of record bookings, as 6 of our 7 largest markets improved over the prior year. Also, we're enjoying healthy booking activity across our smaller markets, too, including Atlanta, Boston, Denver and Seattle. Deals were focused on retail interconnected deployments with healthy pricing. And the Americas region also benefited from strong imports from the other 2 regions, a reflection of our continued focus on platform selling. 
Our EMEA region had a strong quarter led by Dublin and Stockholm and our newly-opened Bordeaux market as well as high exports to the other 2 regions. Enterprise has contributed approximately 1/3 of the region's bookings, up significantly over the prior year. We're also seeing good momentum across our flat markets. And the EMEA region benefited from nonrecurring revenues related to xScale fees earned from the pre-lease of our entire Frankfurt 9 and London 11 buildings, 37 megawatts of demand. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter, led by Singapore and Japan with strong regional bookings. Pricing for small- and medium-sized deals remain strong, and we're seeing good traction with Equinix Metal. The APAC region's quarterly MRR growth was partially constrained due to COVID-related capacity delays in Singapore and political uncertainty in our Hong Kong market. 
And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to Slides 8 and 9. We ended the quarter with cash of about $1.8 billion, and our net debt leverage ratio is 3.8x our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, highlighting the financial flexibility and strategic advantage we have relative to anyone else in our space. 
In May, we raised $2.6 billion, including an incremental $1 billion in green notes. Since Equinix' inaugural investment-grade issuance in late 2019, we've reduced our annualized interest expense by approximately $196 million, offset in part by the incremental debt capital raised. Our blended cost to borrow is now the lowest in the industry at approximately 1.7% and our weighted average maturity is nearly 10 years. We also raised $100 million of ATM equity in the quarter. We continue to expect to use both debt and equity to fund our future business needs with an increase leading towards debt capital. 
Turning to Slide 10 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $692 million, including recurring CapEx of $45 million. We opened 3 new retail projects this quarter, including new IBXs in Bordeaux and Silicon Valley. We also purchased lab for development in Frankfurt and Helsinki. Revenues from owned assets now represents 58% of our total revenues due to the acquisition of our Singapore 3 IBXs. On the xScale side of the business, after quarter end, we contributed our Dublin 5 asset to the EMEA joint venture in return for net proceeds after our 20% equity contribution of $49 million. 
Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 11. Our 153 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 86% utilized and generated a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E  invested. Looking forward, we expect to exit the year closer to the top end of our stabilized asset growth rate, in part due to strong Americas revenue growth. 
Please refer to Slides 12 through 16 for our updated summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending GPX India acquisition, which is expected to close in Q3. For the full year 2021, we're raising our revenue guidance by $50 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $27 million, primarily due to strong operating performance and favorable FX rates, although slightly offset due to the timing of spend as we proactively pulled forward expenditures to mitigate supply chain risks. This guidance implies a normalized and constant currency revenue growth rate of approximately 8% in midpoint compared to the prior year and an adjusted EBITDA margin of greater than 47%. And given the operating momentum of the business, we're raising our 2021 AFFO guidance by $15 million, growing 10% to 12% on a normalizing constant currency basis compared to the previous year, while also increasing our AFFO per share range. 
2021 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.7 billion and $3 billion, including an approximate $450 million of on-balance sheet xScale CapEx, a significant portion, which is expected to be reimbursed by either the current or future JVs and $193 million of recurring CapEx spend, a slight increase over the prior quarter due to timing of spend as we mitigate supply chain risks. 
So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles."

The momentum behind digital transformation is as robust as ever and shows no signs of letting up. As a world digital infrastructure company, Equinix plays a unique role in this evolving story and is positioned to be both a catalyst and a key beneficiary as we partner with customers to unlock the enormous promise of digital, both economically and socially. 
As we discussed at our recent Analyst Day, we are focused on 3 strategic levers as we execute on this transformational opportunity. First, we will continue to scale, doubling down on the strength of our core business, investing to further scale our go-to-market machine to win new customers, putting our capital to work to add capacity in existing markets and executing on targeted operational improvements to standardize, simplify and automate, driving expanded operating margins and providing a better experience for customers and partners. Second, we will extend the reach of our platform and accelerate our aspirations in xScale. By the end of this year, we'll be in 66 markets around the world and see continued opportunities for expansion in growth across both retail and xScale. And third, we will continue to innovate across our portfolio supporting scalability, self-service and energy efficiency across our colo estate, delivering advanced features to sustain momentum in our market-leading interconnection franchise and driving adoption of our digital infrastructure services to deepen our relevance to customers. 
Our ability to scale, extend and innovate starts with our people and with our commitment to building a diverse and inclusive workplace for every person every day can confidently say, ""I'm safe, I belong and I matter."" We show up every day with an in-service-to mindset, starting by being in service to each other, which enables us in turn to be in service to our customers, to our communities and to you, our shareholders. Purpose creates passion, and we are inspired by ours to be the platform where the world comes together, serving as an enabling force for our customers and unlocking their incredible potential to deliver the innovations that enrich our work, our life and our planet.

Let me take the first one and then we'll -- let me take the first question. First and foremost, when we came up the Analyst Day, one of the questions we spend a lot of energy talking about was the AFFO per share growth rate in the first -- sorry, in 2022 relative to the broader guide. 
The reason I said it was going to be in the bottom half of the range instead of the top half of the range was, one, it was a reflection of all the investments we're making across our portfolio this year, not only as it relates to xScale but also our digital infrastructure services and all the efficiency initiatives. And so we were absorbing the full annualized impact of those costs in 2022. As a result, it tends to cause us to be a little bit more dilutive on the per share metric relative to the broader guide. In addition, of course, you're -- you've got a very strong guide for this year as well. And so we've had the benefit of refinancing out of the majority of our high-yield debt and so you've got a little bit of wind at your back and you won't have that wind at your back next year. So that's the primary reason. 
Relative to the comments we made about this year and raising our guide, probably not a big surprise to many of you as we saw a lot of this coming and it's reflected in our long-term model. That all said, we saw the ability to move our numbers up. But it's a 5-year plan, as you can appreciate. And so I wouldn't say that we're changing the trajectory on the guide for Analyst Day, just because we had one good quarter that doesn't feel like the right thing to do. 
Secondly, as it relates to the ATM, like anything, we are going to use a little bit of debt and equity. This was really commensurate with our commitment to our rating agencies to tap periodically, the ATM facility, but we've dramatically reduced what we anticipate that we would otherwise use. And as a result, you saw $100 million. But the message that I had in the prepared remarks was really the leanest towards debt capital on a go-forward basis for obvious reasons, one, the cost of that debt capital, and even over the last few weeks has continued to trend downwards. And so that will be a lean on a go-forward basis. 
So there is always going to be a little bit of a blend. But again, I want to make sure that everybody fully appreciates we want to use the debt capacity that we have on our balance sheet to its fullest advantage, while still at the same time, maintaining very positive relationship with our rating agencies."

It's just something is top of mind for us, as Keith said, I think the lean is definitely towards debt for the obvious reasons.

And so -- and just qualitatively in the conversations we were having with customers and so that's why we were kind of signaling that optimism. I think that has definitely translated how we expected it. And I think I would say that this quarter was even stronger than I think we would have thought it was going to be, and that's as reflected in our results and therefore, in the adaptation of our guide. And so I think the business is just a really strong quarter from an enterprise perspective. As I said in the sort of script, we -- across all 3 regions, across a variety of sectors, enterprise bookings were very strong. [indiscernible] channel is a big part of that, working not only in terms of pursuing hybrid cloud opportunities with our key alliance partners and the cloud players, but also with our reseller sort of portfolio of partners. 
And so yes, I think we're seeing it in line or better than we had thought. And I think we expect to continue to see sustained output and growth from the enterprise segment. And probably over-indexing again, Cloud and IT and enterprise have been over-indexing for a very long time now. And enterprise just seems to be just on a tear in terms of its growth right now."

And so I think there's a long way to go in terms of people who still have a lot of legacy IT architecture that they're looking to adapt to that sort of hybrid multi-cloud world. 
And then the other comment I would make is that the pace of change itself is just continuing to accelerate. And so I think that the technology life cycles and refresh cycles are shortening. I think people are thinking differently about how that -- as I said in my comments, a number of very large technology markets are dislocating as they shift to as a service and as we talked about at Analyst Day, that provides an upside opportunity for us to get a bit more wallet share as those things are delivered as a service, with Equinix as a point of nexus for consuming those services because we're getting both the underlying service prior to themselves locating infrastructure at Equinix, and then we're often able to deliver those services on the platform aligned with things like Fabric and Metal and other things that are allowing us more wallet share. 
And so I think we're -- it's still early days. I think there is a long period of IT architecture and digital transformation investment in front of us for the foreseeable future."

You obviously highlighted your ESG initiatives. But any color around how you see that evolving? And how that -- Equinix is positioned for that would be great."

Thanks for the question, Simon. I'll take the one around supply chain. Suffice it to say, we've been investing quite heavily as you've heard us speak about in our procurement and strategic sourcing initiatives under a very strong leadership. And as a result, we are getting ahead of some of the perceived constraints in the marketplace. And we're not -- so it's not only managing our access into the production cycles for this year, but it's also contemplating our consumption needs for next year. That marries up nicely with also the inflationary exposure that one might otherwise have. By entering into broader commitments, you can mitigate some of that inflationary pressure as well. 
Now that all said, I think we're making some great -- we're having great successes in working with our partners, our vendors and our suppliers. And then I would also go on to say that inherent in our contracts is a lot of inflationary protection. So there's the aspect of supply and demand, and then there's the aspect of pricing. And again, we're very confident that our contracts more appropriately contemplate the exposure, to the extent that you've got a higher inflationary environment over the coming years. And so from both perspectives, we want to squeeze that and then both to make sure that we protect our interest and revenue, but we also have access to deliver demand and support the cost model. And I think we're doing a good job of that as a company. You, Charles, do you want to talk about the Singapore?"

I mean they're a little bit there in terms of -- Yes, I think the question of -- are -- specifically as it relates to Singapore, I think there is -- there was a COVID-related delay in terms of the timing of that facility that created a little bit of a revenue headwind relative to the timing, because demand for that is so strong for us that we had planned on that coming online a little bit earlier, and so we're seeing a little bit less, despite that, delivered a really strong quarter. 
And I do think there is a broader phenomenon, as you described, in terms of markets, thinking about how they're going to allocate capacity and deal with the demand for data centers and the environmental impact. What I would say is that, that's exactly why we are making the level of commitment into ESG and in particularly, the environmental side that we are. I think we're really positioned to tell a story there as is now the leader going out and saying, we're going to be climate neutral by 2030. I think we're going to be in a position to really partner with municipalities to say, ""Hey, look, there's a ton of economic and social benefit being driven by digital."" 
I talked about that at the Analyst Day to the tune of $100 trillion and people want to tap into that, but they want to do so responsibly. And I think our ability to make the investments in ESG is going to continue to be something that really differentiates us. And that's not true only in Asia by any means, there's a number of markets around the world facing those same things. And honestly, I think that's going to be a thing, one of the areas where we continue to separate ourselves from the pack. 
I wanted to add a piece of color on the prior question, too, on the supply chain sort of constraints and issues now. As I've talked to some people about it, there's really kind of 3 areas in our business where you think about it. You have the data center build side of things. There because of our size, our market leadership, et cetera, I think we feel like we're in a very good position to gain access to the equipment we need to continue to hit our delivery dates. And so feeling in a good position there, but obviously continuing to monitor trends. 
Then you have the networking side of our business where maybe we're a little less positioned. But what we've done is really said, okay, we're going to go ahead and make investments to mitigate risk there. And in fact, that's an area where we have real success. And again, that showed up a bit in the quarter and in our guide as we think about pulling some costs in. And then the third level of it is really at the digital infrastructure services line with things like Metal and that's an area where it's a smaller business for us. And so it will be less impactful, but we are looking there about how we can partner with a number of folks to mitigate supply chain impact there, especially since we had just came off a very strong bookings quarter for Metal, and so we want to be -- make sure that we continue to sustain that momentum."

Yes, really incredibly strong performance from the channel and spend that way for every quarter for as far back as I can remember, we've just been really delivering well in that arena. I would say that there's a few things. One, our -- the relationship that we have with what we refer to as our alliance partner group, we mentioned several of them in the script, again, the usual suspects, AWS, Microsoft, Oracle, et cetera, those are folks that we are partnering with as enterprises think through their demand for hybrid infrastructure, we -- they are aligned to advance sales cycles for their public cloud services. And in order to do so, they have to have a comprehensive answer for the customer in terms of the hybrid infrastructure story. And so together, that's a very much a ""one and one equals three"" kind of story, and we can bring that to a customer and have really been effective in winning business together. And so we're seeing real strength there. 
On the reseller side, people that are combining value in certain ways with Equinix value to solve customer problems, we're seeing a nice uptick there. And what I would say is we're seeing more concentration in terms of a smaller number of our really well, highly-capable resellers, delivering more of the revenue. And I think that's a good general dynamic for us. And in terms of the investments we're making, the big area there is really to continue to upgrade our processes and systems, which to be very honest, were not designed channel-ready from the beginning and continue to adapt those to be more channel-friendly. So the quoting, ordering, customer support can all be done in ways that support a customer of a customer or a customer by a channel partner in this case. And so the adaptation of our systems is a -- that's a multiyear sort of trajectory. But that's really the area -- some of the key areas that we're making investments to really better serve channel partners."

So I think you're probably referring to statements I've made in the past have that I see no reason why we couldn't be 50%. I don't know exactly when that will occur. I think that -- I do think that success with our -- as we're seeing channels channel partners embrace some of our newer services like Metal and Network Edge, Network Edge is almost inherently sort of a channel service because we're partnering both with people that are providing their virtualized network functions and then with providers who are bringing that to market in tandem with other value. I think we're seeing a bias towards continued strength in the channel, but we also have a continued great success with our direct selling team. And so both are growing nicely. 
So I don't know, channel has been over-indexing a bit. And so I think we will trend towards higher numbers. But it's hard to predict, I think, exactly where we're in. I think if the newer services really accelerate, I think that could bring us to higher channel percentages faster. And in terms of impact on margins, we -- they're really not particularly meaningful in terms of -- our current model is slightly higher cost in that we often are double comping on commissions when we have our direct team partnering with channels. But when you look at the customer lifetime value of these contracts, the implication of that to margins is actually quite small. And given the very attractive profile in terms of return on capital and margin of some of these newer services, I don't feel like that's going to be a significant drag on margins. And in fact, I think our other areas of margin expansion are going to overpower those."

The -- we had a really good quarter, something that we foreshadowed for the last 2 quarters, particularly around the West Coast of the U.S., and so great success, in particular with the cable landing station. That all said, we've introduced some new capacity in the Silicon Valley 11 asset, has come online. And so when you look at the overall utilization rate, it's still in the mid- to low-70s. 
That said, we're going to continue to have success in the Americas. Charles alluded to and I've mentioned it. And so I would assume that, that utilization level is going to continue to move up as we consume the inventory of the assets we've built. I'd also add just on that basis. And I made it -- maybe commented in my prepared remarks, the amount of booked-but-yet-to-be-billed inventory is up slightly, despite all of the inventory that we've -- all of the inventory that moves into the building queues. And so that's a real positive. So it gives you a sense that there has been substantial bookings already that will consume that inventory. 
The other thing I think is really worthy of note this quarter and that matter through the rest of the year, we anticipate that we'll continue to be selling into what was historically known as Verizon assets. We've seen a real nice move up in, as we said, 6 of the 7 markets plus some of the smaller markets in the U.S. and that includes much of the capacity related to the formally known as Verizon assets. 
So we're excited about the momentum. I think you're going to see the Americas region continue to perform well as we said last quarter and we were telling you this quarter through the rest of the year, and we'll update you on '22 when we get there.

And interestingly, via channel isn't necessarily showing up in customer count because oftentimes, those are -- the customer of record is the channel partner. And so it's actually -- there's even more strength than sort of appear on the face of the results overall. 
But -- and in terms of where they're coming from, I think we're having pretty uniform success geographically. So there's no one region that is significantly outpacing the others. Obviously, a really strong quarter for the Americas, and that selling team, I think, has been doing an exceptional job, but we're also seeing good new logo capture across the other regions as well. 
And in terms of how it translates into the business, you do see that new logos over-index on a growth rate perspective from vis-a-vis existing customers. And so I think they have the opportunity to -- if we can continue to do that, that's really why when we talk about this three-legged strategy, right, of scale, extend, innovate. Scale is, hey, the customers are buying. And so let's continue to get new customers and add capacity in existing markets to serve them. Then extending in terms of new geographies to increase wallet share and then the innovation side, which is really bringing in new services and the ability to capture more wallet over time in terms of the service types. And so I think it gives us really, a multidimensional growth opportunity that's really showing up. 
So new customers definitely -- I mean, look, we still get the bulk of our bookings from existing customers. And that's sort of always good news in that our customers are expanding. There's less friction than that, there's lower cost to acquire, customer lifetime values continue to go up. But new customers are definitely lifeblood for the business as well. And so we're having focus there and real success there, but it's fairly uniform both across geos and across our product set."

And then secondly, you've done just over, I think, 48% margin in the first half. You're guiding to just over 47% for the year. So obviously, an implied downtick in the back half. Where are we most likely going to see that? Is that COGS? Or is it sales and marketing? Or is it G&A?"

There were some favorable tax adjustments associated with the closing of some matters in the quarter. And as a result, because to the tax line, you have to keep pure, and you'll see that there's basically a substantial decrease in tax. It was primarily in relation to a transaction we did in Australia vis-a-vis Metronode, where we're indemnified by the other party. And as a result, you've got the benefit on the tax line and you impaired your assets on the other line. And so net-net, it has no meaningful impact on the P&L, but it gets disclosed separately and it's grossed up. And so it showed -- it sort of shows itself independent in the other income and expense line. So that's what happened there. But again, as it relates to AFFO, there is no meaningful move, because it was embedded in the other lines. 
Then as it relates to the margin question, yes, we've done very well in the first 2 quarters of the year. As we continue to say, we want to guide you to what we think will happen for the year. No surprise. And although for the year, we're seeing greater than 47%, we are making a relatively meaningful investment. Q2, we added, net roughly 250 heads to the organization. Q3 and Q4, we're going to add another 700 to 800 heads to the organization. As a result, you're absorbing the human capital that we need to invest in our growth. And so that's one aspect of it. 
Two, you've got the seasonal impact of utilities in the Americas that's coming through. And then three, because in Q1, Q2, we've had the benefit of a number of nonrecurring revenue items that don't carry a lot of costs with them, so the JV fees when we sell an asset, and we've got a sales fee or we get development fee, as you know, and as you can see in our results, it comes through on the revenue line, but there's very old a drag to the bottom line. And so it's going to be inherently lumpy and we just don't see a lot of that through the second half of the year. If anything, as I mentioned, nonrecurring revenue will go down in Q3 over Q2. But then it's going to flat line in Q4, and there will be another one-off fee that likely gets recorded in the fourth quarter. But bottom line, that's what's going on..."

Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As reflected on our results, we are seeing significant momentum in our business as digital transformation outpaces previous expectations. Technology spend is accelerating, and Equinix remains uniquely positioned as traditional technology markets continue to shift to as-a-service consumption models and hybrid multicloud is widely adopted as the architecture of choice.  
The pandemic has highlighted that digital infrastructure is not just a business enabler, but a primary source of competitive advantage for digital leaders across all industries, and we continue to see a multitude of trends driving infrastructure that is more distributed, more on-demand and more ecosystem connected than ever before, playing to our distinctive strengths. Our results reflect strong performance across our geographies, tremendous momentum in our market-leading interconnection franchise and deep customer demand across our expanding portfolio of services.  
Against this robust demand backdrop, we had a great second quarter, delivering record bookings fueled by continued momentum in our Americas business and a strong quarter from Equinix Metal. We processed more than 4,600 deals in the quarter across more than 3,200 customers, demonstrating both the scale and the consistency of our go-to-market machine. We achieved our 74th consecutive quarter of top line growth and are pleased to have been recently been included in the Fortune 500, an exciting milestone made possible by the confidence our customers place in Equinix and by the incredible commitment and passion of our 10,000-plus employees around the world.  
And we continue to expand our global platform with 35 projects underway across 25 markets in 19 countries, with Q2 openings in Bordeaux, Helsinki and Silicon Valley. Aligned with our values and our purpose, we're also proud to share further enhancements to our old commitments on sustainability, leaning in across all elements of ESG. 
In early June, we became the first in the data center industry to commit to being climate neutral by 2030, backed by science-based targets, an aggressive green financing plan and a comprehensive sustainability agenda. Aligned with the current climate agreement, this commitment is a critical step to ensuring Equinix continues to advance investments and innovations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and greening our customers' digital supply chains. 
Additionally, as part of our ongoing focus on diversity, inclusion and belonging and our commitment to well-being, we recently hosted our Second Annual WeConnect event, a 24-hour virtual gathering led by our employee connection networks and our DIB and well-being teams. This event celebrates equality, diversity and connection and offers our employees an opportunity to listen, to learn and to engage in courageous conversations as we build a culture and a community that can have a meaningful, sustainable impact on the future of our world.  
Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $1.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7% year-over-year, and AFFO was again meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Interconnection revenues grew 12% year-over-year with solid unit adds and healthy pricing. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our global interconnection franchise continues to perform well. We now have over 406,000 total interconnections on our industry-leading platform. In Q2, we added an incremental 7,800 interconnections and now have 15 metros with more than 10,000 total interconnections, a reflection of the scaled digital ecosystems that drive our differentiated value proposition.  
Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 31% year-over-year. And we're seeing IX diversify as large-scale peering expands to a broader base of enterprise customers. Equinix Fabric saw excellent growth across all 3 regions, driven by healthy unit growth and increasing yields as customers expand usage of higher bandwidth connections to interconnect regional and global footprints. More than 2,600 customers are now on Fabric, and we continue to see strong attach rates as businesses diversify their end destinations and evolve their connectivity needs in support of highly-distributed infrastructure and the adoption of hybrid multicloud.  
Turning to digital infrastructure services, customers are responding very positively as we augment our portfolio to enable physical infrastructure delivered at software speed. We had strong bookings with Equinix Metal this quarter, including our largest win to date with our channel partner, Avant, for a blockchain company, building a network of validation nodes across 8 markets. 
Our network edge offering showed meaningful acceleration with average deal size increasing nicely as enterprise customers are deploying a diverse set of virtualized network functions from our marketplace vendors. Importantly, and as expected, digital infrastructure services are also driving strong cross-selling activity and interconnection pull-through with nearly 1,000 vertical connections already provisioned to support these deployments. 
Shifting to our xScale initiative. We continue to expand our plans in light of robust market demand and positive customer feedback. Late in the quarter, we announced agreements for additional joint ventures with GIC, Singapore sovereign well fund. When closed and fully built out, the total investment between Equinix and GIC in our xScale data center portfolio, we will be nearly $7 billion across 32 facilities globally, with more than 600 megawatts of power capacity. 
We currently have 7 xScale builds under development across all 3 regions, and we pre-leased our entire Frankfurt 9 asset in Q2, representing 18 megawatts of capacity fully committed in advance of delivery. With this deal, we have -- now have -- have now leased more than 100 megawatts of xScale capacity and 100% of our open capacity at least. We are actively engaged with partners to develop entry plans and other expansion markets globally, including Australia.  
Now let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical delivered strong bookings across all 3 regions, with particular strength in APAC as traditional carriers continue to invest and specialty telecom firms evolve their portfolios to address demand for cloud, mobile, IP services and over-the-top delivery. New wins and expansions this quarter, including McKay Brothers, a local telecom service provider, leveraging interconnection to better serve low latency financial customers. Crosslake Fibre, a leading provider of network services deploying in our London 4 and Paris 7 IBXs to support the first new subsea cable laid across the U.S. channel in nearly 20 years and a global telecommunications provider expanding their presence to new locations, including Milan and Bordeaux.  
Our cloud and IT vertical saw continued momentum over indexing Europe as organizations accelerate hybrid multicloud adoption. Expansions this quarter included Zoom, a leading video communications platform, expanding coverage and scale to support market demand and a cloud-delivered enterprise network security provider deploying infrastructure to support offerings in new locations. Our enterprise vertical achieved record bookings, with broad global strength punctuated by an exceptionally strong quarter in the Americas across several subsegments, including health care, consumer services, business and professional services and retail.  
New wins and expansions included Red Bull, a major sports energy drink manufacturer, deploying infrastructure across all 3 regions to take advantage of Equinix' cloud ecosystem; a leading global cosmetics retailer deploying digital infrastructure to optimize their network, move out of legacy data centers and locate private infrastructure adjacent to their cloud providers; and a Fortune 500 global insurance provider optimizing their infrastructure to support multicloud. Content and digital media also achieved solid bookings led by growth in CDM, publishing and digital media and gaming, as digital transformation continues to shape this vertical. Expansions included StackPath, a leading edge computing and services provider, deploying infrastructure across multiple edge locations; Earnest Research, a leading data analytics company, transforming network topology and interconnecting to multiple cloud across Platform Equinix; and i3D.net, a leading provider of application hosting and infrastructure services, deploying on Platform Equinix to enable a consistent high-performance gaming experience globally.  
And our channel program continues to outperform, delivering a record quarter and accounting for over 35% of bookings. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and use cases including multiple Equinix Metal and edge deals as the channel embraces our digital infrastructure services. We saw continued strength from alliance partners like AWS, Cisco, Dell, Google, IBM and Microsoft. And we also had success with key resellers around the world, including a win with HPE for Woolworths Group, a leading Australian retailer, to modernize and scale their payments platform, which processes over 30 million transactions per day.  
So now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."

No surprise, we were ea",1314,"Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. I hope you and your families are well and enjoying the summer months. So let me start by saying it was great to spend time with many of you, albeit virtually at our June Analyst Day. No surprise, we were eager to share our plans on how we intend to scale, extend and innovate the business over the coming years to drive long-term shareholder value, meaning more revenues, higher margins and more cash flows.  
With respect to the quarter, the business continues to perform exceedingly well, as the macro environment for digital infrastructure continues to drive favorable demand. In fact, we exceeded our expectations. There are many highlights to share with you through the quarter. To start, we had record bookings activity at both the company and the Americas regional level. We enjoyed robust channel activity and lower-than-planned churn. Interconnection additions were solid, both physically and virtually, and our digital infrastructure service lines, which include edge and metal, are gaining momentum. Simply put, we're continuing to execute against the goals highlighted at the Analyst Day. And given our performance, we're raising our guidance across each of revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share for the year.  
Now let me cover the results for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $1.658 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year due to strong business performance across our platform, led by the Americas region. And as expected, nonrecurring revenues increased quarter-over-quarter to 7% of revenues due to a meaningful step-up in xScale joint venture fees in APAC and EMEA and custom installation work across all 3 regions. As you can appreciate, nonrecurring revenues are inherently lumpy and therefore, as a result, we expect our Q3 nonrecurring revenues to decrease by $8 million compared to Q2.  
Our backlog of ""booked but yet to be built"" cabinets has increased slightly, despite the 4,200 increase in billing cabinets in the quarter. Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included an $11 million benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. 
Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $797 million or 48% of revenues, up 7% over the same quarter last year, meaningfully outperforming our expectations due to strong operating performance and the timing of spend. Q2 included a planned rebound in repairs and maintenance spending and higher utility costs relative to Q1. Q2 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, includes a $6 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs. Total Q2 AFFO was $632 million, including a $25 million recurring CapEx increase compared to the prior quarter, above our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower integration costs. 
Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC had the highest year-over-year revenue growth of 11%, owned by the Americas and EMEA regions, both at 8%. The EMEA revenue growth rate reflects the lapping of the significant interconnection price increases and other one-off positive adjustments from last year. We expect the EMEA growth rate to return to normalized levels in Q4. The Americas region saw continued strength with our second consecutive quarter of record bookings, as 6 of our 7 largest markets improved over the prior year. Also, we're enjoying healthy booking activity across our smaller markets, too, including Atlanta, Boston, Denver and Seattle. Deals were focused on retail interconnected deployments with healthy pricing. And the Americas region also benefited from strong imports from the other 2 regions, a reflection of our continued focus on platform selling. 
Our EMEA region had a strong quarter led by Dublin and Stockholm and our newly-opened Bordeaux market as well as high exports to the other 2 regions. Enterprise has contributed approximately 1/3 of the region's bookings, up significantly over the prior year. We're also seeing good momentum across our flat markets. And the EMEA region benefited from nonrecurring revenues related to xScale fees earned from the pre-lease of our entire Frankfurt 9 and London 11 buildings, 37 megawatts of demand. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter, led by Singapore and Japan with strong regional bookings. Pricing for small- and medium-sized deals remain strong, and we're seeing good traction with Equinix Metal. The APAC region's quarterly MRR growth was partially constrained due to COVID-related capacity delays in Singapore and political uncertainty in our Hong Kong market. 
And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to Slides 8 and 9. We ended the quarter with cash of about $1.8 billion, and our net debt leverage ratio is 3.8x our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, highlighting the financial flexibility and strategic advantage we have relative to anyone else in our space. 
In May, we raised $2.6 billion, including an incremental $1 billion in green notes. Since Equinix' inaugural investment-grade issuance in late 2019, we've reduced our annualized interest expense by approximately $196 million, offset in part by the incremental debt capital raised. Our blended cost to borrow is now the lowest in the industry at approximately 1.7% and our weighted average maturity is nearly 10 years. We also raised $100 million of ATM equity in the quarter. We continue to expect to use both debt and equity to fund our future business needs with an increase leading towards debt capital. 
Turning to Slide 10 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $692 million, including recurring CapEx of $45 million. We opened 3 new retail projects this quarter, including new IBXs in Bordeaux and Silicon Valley. We also purchased lab for development in Frankfurt and Helsinki. Revenues from owned assets now represents 58% of our total revenues due to the acquisition of our Singapore 3 IBXs. On the xScale side of the business, after quarter end, we contributed our Dublin 5 asset to the EMEA joint venture in return for net proceeds after our 20% equity contribution of $49 million. 
Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 11. Our 153 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 86% utilized and generated a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E  invested. Looking forward, we expect to exit the year closer to the top end of our stabilized asset growth rate, in part due to strong Americas revenue growth. 
Please refer to Slides 12 through 16 for our updated summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending GPX India acquisition, which is expected to close in Q3. For the full year 2021, we're raising our revenue guidance by $50 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $27 million, primarily due to strong operating performance and favorable FX rates, although slightly offset due to the timing of spend as we proactively pulled forward expenditures to mitigate supply chain risks. This guidance implies a normalized and constant currency revenue growth rate of approximately 8% in midpoint compared to the prior year and an adjusted EBITDA margin of greater than 47%. And given the operating momentum of the business, we're raising our 2021 AFFO guidance by $15 million, growing 10% to 12% on a normalizing constant currency basis compared to the previous year, while also increasing our AFFO per share range. 
2021 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.7 billion and $3 billion, including an approximate $450 million of on-balance sheet xScale CapEx, a significant portion, which is expected to be reimbursed by either the current or future JVs and $193 million of recurring CapEx spend, a slight increase over the prior quarter due to timing of spend as we mitigate supply chain risks. 
So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles."

The momentum behind digital transformation is as robust as ever and shows no signs of letting up. As a world digital infrastructure company, Equinix plays a unique role in this evolving story and is positioned to be both a catalyst and a key beneficiary as we partner with customers to unlock the enormous promise of digital, both economically and socially. 
As we discussed at our recent Analyst Day, we are focused on 3 strategic levers as we execute on this transformational opportunity. First, we will continue to scale, doubling down on the strength of our core business, investing to further scale our go-to-market machine to win new customers, putting our capital to work to add capacity in existing markets and executing on targeted operational improvements to standardize, simplify and automate, driving expanded operating margins and providing a better experience for customers and partners. Second, we will extend the reach of our platform and accelerate our aspirations in xScale. By the end of this year, we'll be in 66 markets around the world and see continued opportunities for expansion in growth across both retail and xScale. And third, we will continue to innovate across our portfolio supporting scalability, self-service and energy efficiency across our colo estate, delivering advanced features to sustain momentum in our market-leading interconnection franchise and driving adoption of our digital infrastructure services to deepen our relevance to customers. 
Our ability to scale, extend and innovate starts with our people and with our commitment to building a diverse and inclusive workplace for every person every day can confidently say, ""I'm safe, I belong and I matter."" We show up every day with an in-service-to mindset, starting by being in service to each other, which enables us in turn to be in service to our customers, to our communities and to you, our shareholders. Purpose creates passion, and we are inspired by ours to be the platform where the world comes together, serving as an enabling force for our customers and unlocking their incredible potential to deliver the innovations that enrich our work, our life and our planet.

Given the acceleration you're still seeing in this quarter and the bump you've seen here, can you speak to what the trajectory looks like heading into next year? 
And then separately as a follow-up, I'm just curious about the ATM in the quarter. I think, Keith, you talked about significant incremental debt capacity, given sort of the leeway offered by the agencies and a little surprise to see the equity raise in the quarter."

Let me take the first one and then we'll -- let me take the first question. First and foremost, when we came up the Analyst Day, one of the questions we spend a lot of energy talking about was the AFFO per share growth rate in the first -- sorry, in 2022 relative to the broader guide. 
The reason I said it was going to be in the bottom half of the range instead of the top half of the range was, one, it was a reflection of all the investments we're making across our portfolio this year, not only as it relates to xScale but also our digital infrastructure services and all the efficiency initiatives. And so we were absorbing the full annualized impact of those costs in 2022. As a result, it tends to cause us to be a little bit more dilutive on the per share metric relative to the broader guide. In addition, of course, you're -- you've got a very strong guide for this year as well. And so we've had the benefit of refinancing out of the majority of our high-yield debt and so you've got a little bit of wind at your back and you won't have that wind at your back next year. So that's the primary reason. 
Relative to the comments we made about this year and raising our guide, probably not a big surprise to many of you as we saw a lot of this coming and it's reflected in our long-term model. That all said, we saw the ability to move our numbers up. But it's a 5-year plan, as you can appreciate. And so I wouldn't say that we're changing the trajectory on the guide for Analyst Day, just because we had one good quarter that doesn't feel like the right thing to do. 
Secondly, as it relates to the ATM, like anything, we are going to use a little bit of debt and equity. This was really commensurate with our commitment to our rating agencies to tap periodically, the ATM facility, but we've dramatically reduced what we anticipate that we would otherwise use. And as a result, you saw $100 million. But the message that I had in the prepared remarks was really the leanest towards debt capital on a go-forward basis for obvious reasons, one, the cost of that debt capital, and even over the last few weeks has continued to trend downwards. And so that will be a lean on a go-forward basis. 
So there is always going to be a little bit of a blend. But again, I want to make sure that everybody fully appreciates we want to use the debt capacity that we have on our balance sheet to its fullest advantage, while still at the same time, maintaining very positive relationship with our rating agencies."

It's just something is top of mind for us, as Keith said, I think the lean is definitely towards debt for the obvious reasons.

And so -- and just qualitatively in the conversations we were having with customers and so that's why we were kind of signaling that optimism. I think that has definitely translated how we expected it. And I think I would say that this quarter was even stronger than I think we would have thought it was going to be, and that's as reflected in our results and therefore, in the adaptation of our guide. And so I think the business is just a really strong quarter from an enterprise perspective. As I said in the sort of script, we -- across all 3 regions, across a variety of sectors, enterprise bookings were very strong. [indiscernible] channel is a big part of that, working not only in terms of pursuing hybrid cloud opportunities with our key alliance partners and the cloud players, but also with our reseller sort of portfolio of partners. 
And so yes, I think we're seeing it in line or better than we had thought. And I think we expect to continue to see sustained output and growth from the enterprise segment. And probably over-indexing again, Cloud and IT and enterprise have been over-indexing for a very long time now. And enterprise just seems to be just on a tear in terms of its growth right now."

And then the other comment I would make is that the pace of change itself is just continuing to accelerate. And so I think that the technology life cycles and refresh cycles are shortening. I think people are thinking differently about how that -- as I said in my comments, a number of very large technology markets are dislocating as they shift to as a service and as we talked about at Analyst Day, that provides an upside opportunity for us to get a bit more wallet share as those things are delivered as a service, with Equinix as a point of nexus for consuming those services because we're getting both the underlying service prior to themselves locating infrastructure at Equinix, and then we're often able to deliver those services on the platform aligned with things like Fabric and Metal and other things that are allowing us more wallet share. 
And so I think we're -- it's still early days. I think there is a long period of IT architecture and digital transformation investment in front of us for the foreseeable future."

And we're not -- so it's not only managing our access into the production cycles for this year, but it's also contemplating our consumption needs for next year. That marries up nicely with also the inflationary exposure that one might otherwise have. By entering into broader commitments, you can mitigate some of that inflationary pressure as well. 
Now that all said, I think we're making some great -- we're having great successes in working with our partners, our vendors and our suppliers. And then I would also go on to say that inherent in our contracts is a lot of inflationary protection. So there's the aspect of supply and demand, and then there's the aspect of pricing. And again, we're very confident that our contracts more appropriately contemplate the exposure, to the extent that you've got a higher inflationary environment over the coming years. And so from both perspectives, we want to squeeze that and then both to make sure that we protect our interest and revenue, but we also have access to deliver demand and support the cost model.

And I do think there is a broader phenomenon, as you described, in terms of markets, thinking about how they're going to allocate capacity and deal with the demand for data centers and the environmental impact. What I would say is that, that's exactly why we are making the level of commitment into ESG and in particularly, the environmental side that we are. I think we're really positioned to tell a story there as is now the leader going out and saying, we're going to be climate neutral by 2030. I think we're going to be in a position to really partner with municipalities to say, ""Hey, look, there's a ton of economic and social benefit being driven by digital."" 
I talked about that at the Analyst Day to the tune of $100 trillion and people want to tap into that, but they want to do so responsibly. And I think our ability to make the investments in ESG is going to continue to be something that really differentiates us. And that's not true only in Asia by any means, there's a number of markets around the world facing those same things. And honestly, I think that's going to be a thing, one of the areas where we continue to separate ourselves from the pack. 
I wanted to add a piece of color on the prior question, too, on the supply chain sort of constraints and issues now. As I've talked to some people about it, there's really kind of 3 areas in our business where you think about it. You have the data center build side of things. There because of our size, our market leadership, et cetera, I think we feel like we're in a very good position to gain access to the equipment we need to continue to hit our delivery dates. And so feeling in a good position there, but obviously continuing to monitor trends. 
Then you have the networking side of our business where maybe we're a little less positioned. But what we've done is really said, okay, we're going to go ahead and make investments to mitigate risk there. And in fact, that's an area where we have real success. And again, that showed up a bit in the quarter and in our guide as we think about pulling some costs in. And then the third level of it is really at the digital infrastructure services line with things like Metal and that's an area where it's a smaller business for us. And so it will be less impactful, but we are looking there about how we can partner with a number of folks to mitigate supply chain impact there, especially since we had just came off a very strong bookings quarter for Metal, and so we want to be -- make sure that we continue to sustain that momentum."

Yes, really incredibly strong performance from the channel and spend that way for every quarter for as far back as I can remember, we've just been really delivering well in that arena. I would say that there's a few things. One, our -- the relationship that we have with what we refer to as our alliance partner group, we mentioned several of them in the script, again, the usual suspects, AWS, Microsoft, Oracle, et cetera, those are folks that we are partnering with as enterprises think through their demand for hybrid infrastructure, we -- they are aligned to advance sales cycles for their public cloud services. And in order to do so, they have to have a comprehensive answer for the customer in terms of the hybrid infrastructure story. And so together, that's a very much a ""one and one equals three"" kind of story, and we can bring that to a customer and have really been effective in winning business together. And so we're seeing real strength there. 
On the reseller side, people that are combining value in certain ways with Equinix value to solve customer problems, we're seeing a nice uptick there. And what I would say is we're seeing more concentration in terms of a smaller number of our really well, highly-capable resellers, delivering more of the revenue. And I think that's a good general dynamic for us. And in terms of the investments we're making, the big area there is really to continue to upgrade our processes and systems, which to be very honest, were not designed channel-ready from the beginning and continue to adapt those to be more channel-friendly. So the quoting, ordering, customer support can all be done in ways that support a customer of a customer or a customer by a channel partner in this case. And so the adaptation of our systems is a -- that's a multiyear sort of trajectory. But that's really the area -- some of the key areas that we're making investments to really better serve channel partners."

So I think you're probably referring to statements I've made in the past have that I see no reason why we couldn't be 50%. I don't know exactly when that will occur. I think that -- I do think that success with our -- as we're seeing channels channel partners embrace some of our newer services like Metal and Network Edge, Network Edge is almost inherently sort of a channel service because we're partnering both with people that are providing their virtualized network functions and then with providers who are bringing that to market in tandem with other value. I think we're seeing a bias towards continued strength in the channel, but we also have a continued great success with our direct selling team. And so both are growing nicely. 
So I don't know, channel has been over-indexing a bit. And so I think we will trend towards higher numbers. But it's hard to predict, I think, exactly where we're in. I think if the newer services really accelerate, I think that could bring us to higher channel percentages faster. And in terms of impact on margins, we -- they're really not particularly meaningful in terms of -- our current model is slightly higher cost in that we often are double comping on commissions when we have our direct team partnering with channels. But when you look at the customer lifetime value of these contracts, the implication of that to margins is actually quite small. And given the very attractive profile in terms of return on capital and margin of some of these newer services, I don't feel like that's going to be a significant drag on margins. And in fact, I think our other areas of margin expansion are going to overpower those."

Clearly, you're right. The -- we had a really good quarter, something that we foreshadowed for the last 2 quarters, particularly around the West Coast of the U.S., and so great success, in particular with the cable landing station. That all said, we've introduced some new capacity in the Silicon Valley 11 asset, has come online. And so when you look at the overall utilization rate, it's still in the mid- to low-70s. 
That said, we're going to continue to have success in the Americas. Charles alluded to and I've mentioned it. And so I would assume that, that utilization level is going to continue to move up as we consume the inventory of the assets we've built. I'd also add just on that basis. And I made it -- maybe commented in my prepared remarks, the amount of booked-but-yet-to-be-billed inventory is up slightly, despite all of the inventory that we've -- all of the inventory that moves into the building queues. And so that's a real positive. So it gives you a sense that there has been substantial bookings already that will consume that inventory. 
The other thing I think is really worthy of note this quarter and that matter through the rest of the year, we anticipate that we'll continue to be selling into what was historically known as Verizon assets. We've seen a real nice move up in, as we said, 6 of the 7 markets plus some of the smaller markets in the U.S. and that includes much of the capacity related to the formally known as Verizon assets. 
So we're excited about the momentum. I think you're going to see the Americas region continue to perform well as we said last quarter and we were telling you this quarter through the rest of the year, and we'll update you on '22 when we get there.

And so it's actually -- there's even more strength than sort of appear on the face of the results overall. 
But -- and in terms of where they're coming from, I think we're having pretty uniform success geographically. So there's no one region that is significantly outpacing the others. Obviously, a really strong quarter for the Americas, and that selling team, I think, has been doing an exceptional job, but we're also seeing good new logo capture across the other regions as well. 
And in terms of how it translates into the business, you do see that new logos over-index on a growth rate perspective from vis-a-vis existing customers. And so I think they have the opportunity to -- if we can continue to do that, that's really why when we talk about this three-legged strategy, right, of scale, extend, innovate. Scale is, hey, the customers are buying. And so let's continue to get new customers and add capacity in existing markets to serve them. Then extending in terms of new geographies to increase wallet share and then the innovation side, which is really bringing in new services and the ability to capture more wallet over time in terms of the service types. And so I think it gives us really, a multidimensional growth opportunity that's really showing up. 
So new customers definitely -- I mean, look, we still get the bulk of our bookings from existing customers. And that's sort of always good news in that our customers are expanding. There's less friction than that, there's lower cost to acquire, customer lifetime values continue to go up. But new customers are definitely lifeblood for the business as well. And so we're having focus there and real success there, but it's fairly uniform both across geos and across our product set."

There were some favorable tax adjustments associated with the closing of some matters in the quarter. And as a result, because to the tax line, you have to keep pure, and you'll see that there's basically a substantial decrease in tax. It was primarily in relation to a transaction we did in Australia vis-a-vis Metronode, where we're indemnified by the other party. And as a result, you've got the benefit on the tax line and you impaired your assets on the other line. And so net-net, it has no meaningful impact on the P&L, but it gets disclosed separately and it's grossed up. And so it showed -- it sort of shows itself independent in the other income and expense line. So that's what happened there. But again, as it relates to AFFO, there is no meaningful move, because it was embedded in the other lines. 
Then as it relates to the margin question, yes, we've done very well in the first 2 quarters of the year. As we continue to say, we want to guide you to what we think will happen for the year. No surprise. And although for the year, we're seeing greater than 47%, we are making a relatively meaningful investment. Q2, we added, net roughly 250 heads to the organization. Q3 and Q4, we're going to add another 700 to 800 heads to the organization. As a result, you're absorbing the human capital that we need to invest in our growth. And so that's one aspect of it. 
Two, you've got the seasonal impact of utilities in the Americas that's coming through. And then three, because in Q1, Q2, we've had the benefit of a number of nonrecurring revenue items that don't carry a lot of costs with them, so the JV fees when we sell an asset, and we've got a sales fee or we get development fee, as you know, and as you can see in our results, it comes through on the revenue line, but there's very old a drag to the bottom line. And so it's going to be inherently lumpy and we just don't see a lot of that through the second half of the year. If anything, as I mentioned, nonrecurring revenue will go down in Q3 over Q2. But then it's going to flat line in Q4, and there will be another one-off fee that likely gets recorded in the fourth quarter. But bottom line, that's what's going on..."

Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We had a great quarter achieving our 75th consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth and a record Q3 on bookings, a clear signal of strong market demand. Our results were fueled by continued strength in our Americas business and robust performance for our channel program globally as key partners continue to see Platform Equinix as a point of nexus for digital transformation solutions. 
The pandemic has triggered an accelerated need to digitize business models in virtually every segment of the economy, and our strong results reflect this increasing demand for digital infrastructure. And Equinix remains uniquely positioned to help customers as they shift towards distributed, hybrid and multicloud as a clear architecture of choice. 
As we continue to strengthen our position as the world digital infrastructure company, our focus remains on creating distinctive and durable value for our customers and our shareholders, driving growth and scale in our market leading colocation franchise, expanding our relevance to the cloud ecosystem through xScale and tapping into massive sources of incremental demand by adapting to evolving customer needs with a rapidly growing digital services business. 
Turning to our results. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q3 were $1.7 million, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 4% year-over-year, and AFFO was in line with our expectations. Interconnection revenues continue to outpace colocation revenues growing 11% year-over-year driven by solid physical cross-connect growth and broad adoption of Equinix Fabric. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. 
We processed more than 4,200 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers, highlighting the reach, scale and predictability of our booking digit. We have a solid demand pipeline as we look to the final quarter of the year, and we continue to add capacity to service this demand with 11 major projects delivered this quarter in key markets like Frankfurt, New York and Singapore and 31 more major projects underway across 23 markets in 16 countries. 
Our global interconnection franchise continues to thrive with over 414,000 total interconnection on our industry-leading platform. In Q3, we added an incremental 7,800 interconnections now have at least one major cloud on-ramp in 42 metros around the world, 2x more than the nearest competitor, a clear indication that Equinix is the home of the interconnected cloud. 
Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 6% quarter-over-quarter and 30% year-over-year to over 21 terabits per second as traffic growth remains robust. Equinix Fabric saw excellent growth, continuing to significantly overindexed within the broader interconnection portfolio. More than 2,800 customers are now on Fabric with attach rates moving up into the right as businesses diversify their end destinations and service providers integrate Fabric into their own solutions. 
In September, we extended Platform Equinix into our 27th country with the close of our GPX acquisition, entering the strategic Indian market. Our 2 data centers in Mumbai for a network that is campus with more than 350 international and local companies, including 6 on-ramps to the world's leading cloud service providers and a robust network ecosystem. GPX represents an ideal entry point into this top 10 GDP country, and we expect to expand our operations significantly in India over the coming years as we tap into this rapidly growing market. 
In parallel with our tremendous retail success, we continue to expand our xScale basis. In October, we announced plans to expand in Australia with an agreement to establish a $575 million joint venture with PGIM Real Estate to develop 2 data centers in Sydney, which will provide more than 55 megawatts of capacity when fully built. Also, during the quarter, we closed the first phase of our previously announced EMEA 2 joint venture with GIC and signed 2 megawatts with a hyperscaler in Frankfurt. We currently have 8 x-scale builds under development, including our newly announced Matrade 3, Mexico C3 and Sidney 9 assets. which will collectively add 25 megawatts of capacity when they opened in the first half of 2022. The total investment of our various hyperscale joint ventures when closed and fully built out is now expected to be more than $7.5 billion across 34 facilities globally with more than 675 megawatts of power capacity. 
Turning to our digital infrastructure services. Our Equinix Metal business saw strong revenue growth in cloud native and service provider customers continue to embrace the ability to deploy physical infrastructure at software speed. And Network Edge saw robust growth as established customers purchase more virtual network functions across additional metrics. By year-end, we expect Network Edge to be available in 25 metros around the world. 
So now let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical continues to be a foundation for the business with strength in the quarter in cable and satellite subsegments and continued momentum in joint go-to-market with our top network partners across the globe. Expansions this quarter included Zayo Group, a global communications infrastructure company, adding interconnection and colocation capacity to support demand; Vocus, Australia's leading specialist fiber and network solutions provider, building infrastructure in both Sydney and Melbourne to offer network services; and Hurricane Electric, a global network service provider utilizing Equinix Fabric to allow enterprise customers to access their IP transit product at scale and in real time. 
Our enterprise vertical saw another strong quarter led by manufacturing and fintech and record channel activity. New wins and expansions included a Fortune 100 manufacturing company, deploying global network hubs to enable their SaaS analytics offering; a leading technology manufacturer deploying a custom liquid-cooled environment and solution center to support the next generation of high-performance compute; and a Fortune 250 online retailer and e-commerce platform deploying across Platform Equinix with low latency, cloud-adjacent network hubs to support their retail branded sites. 
Our cloud and IT vertical saw a particular strength in the Americas as industry-specific cloud solutions continue to be a catalyst for innovation and new growth. Expansions this quarter included Adobe, a leading cloud software provider deploying infrastructure to support its platforms and optimize sustainable participation in key digital markets and ecosystems; Wasabi, a U.S.-based object storage company, expanding their offering on Equinix Fabric into APAC and EMEA, enabling customers to easily connect their bare metal workloads posted on Equinix Bell; and a top 5 global software provider deploying core metals to support their growing user base and demand in both Mexico City and Sao Paulo. 
Content and digital media had a great opening this quarter with resurgence in this vertical being led by APAC and broad-based strength in the gaming and streaming subsegments as consumer demand for at-home digital services remains strong. Expansions this quarter included Netflix, a global streaming service expanding cross-platform Equinix in new and existing markets to support OTT delivery; Kingsoft, a Chinese cloud provider expanding into [indiscernible] to support rapid sales growth; and a top 3 content distributor extending coverage and scale for its growing platform and the delivery of new and existing security solutions. 
And our channel program continues to shine, delivering another robust quarter. This important go-to-market [ ocean ] accounted for over 35% of total bookings, nearly half of our enterprise bookings and more than 60% of our new logos in the quarter. We are benefiting from tremendous momentum in hybrid cloud adoption and seeing particular strength on the joint enterprise pursuit with our key alliance partners such as AT&T, AWS, Dell, HPE and Microsoft. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and included a marquee win with NVIDIA, IBM and SBA or Continental Group, a worldwide automotive parts supplier building an interconnected global network to optimize workloads and speed up AI training for their advanced driver assistance systems. 
So now let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter."

And once again, we met our expectations or better. We had a very solid quarter. The macro environment for digital infrastructure continues to drive expanding market opportunities as demonstrated by another outstanding bookings quarter both at the gross and the net level from our industry-leading go-to-market engine. Our bookings backlog remains both significant and elevated as we work to install the substantial volume of business closed through the past few quarters, and our forward-looking pipeline is extremely healthy in all of our regions. 
Our channel sales activity was the best in our history, and our global platform delivered healthy inter- and intra-region activity. We had firm MRR per cabinet yields with yet again net positive pricing actions, a validation of a differentiated operating model compared to others in our space. On a year-to-date basis, our global design and construction and ops teams have delivered more than 18,000 cabinets of retail capacity and 40 megawatts of xScale inventory while also rolling out critical network infrastructure assets across our targeted markets in support of our Fabric, Network Edge and metal service offerings. 
We've seen no major delays to date in delivering new capacity despite general market concerns related to supply chain challenges, a reflection of the efforts put forth by our best-in-class procurement and strategic sourcing teams. 
Now let me cover the results for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $1.675 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year due to strong business performance across our platform led by the Americas region. 
Nonrecurring revenues represented about 7% of revenues due to an increase in custom installation work and EMEA xScale joint venture fees. For Q4, we expect NRR to trend downward decreasing sequentially by approximately $12 million due to lower xScale fees and the timing of large customer installations. 
Q3 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $6 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $786 million or 47% of revenues, at the high end of our guidance expectations due to timing of spend and low integration costs. Q3 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $3 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates $3 million of integration costs. 
Total Q3 AFFO was $628 million, the result of strong operating performance consistent with our expectations. Similar to prior years, we expect seasonally higher levels of recurring CapEx in Q4 as our operating teams work to complete the 2021 projects. 
Global Q3 MRR churn was 2.1%. We continue to expect MRR churn for the full year to be at the lower end of our target quarterly range of 2% to 2.5%. 
Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. The APAC region's revenue grew 11% year-over-year, followed by the Americas at 7% and EMEA at 6%. As previously discussed, we expect the EMEA growth rate to return to normalized levels in Q4 as we lap interconnection price increases and the other one-off positive adjustments from last year. 
The Americas region saw continued strength with our third consecutive quarter of record bookings with a broad distribution across metros, including some of our smaller markets, such as Boston, Denver, Mexico City, Seattle and Toronto. The Americas sales teams continue to sell the global platform with a notable increase in activity coming from our Canadian team and benefit derived from the transaction with Bell Canada, which is outperforming our expectations. 
Our EMEA region had a solid quarter with strength coming from our Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Madrid markets as enterprise customers and the channel drive bookings. And as we aim to meet high sustainability and efficiency standards while progressing towards our 2030 science-based targets, new builds like our recently opened Fabric ABX serve as a model to land in the cityscape of positively contributing to the local micro climate. 
And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter with momentum across all of our metros led by Singapore. New deal activity focused on small- to medium-sized deployments with firm pricing and continued strength in our cross-border selling. Our Hong Kong market saw a nice rebound in bookings performance, although it continues to feel constrained given the market uncertainty. 
And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with cash of about $1.4 billion, and our net debt leverage ratio remains low, particularly relative to our industry peers. Our balance sheet remains highly flexible and liquid, and we have a low AFFO cash payout ratio. With regards to our outstanding debt, we have minimal near-term exposure to potentially rising interest rates with 95% of our debt fixed and a weighted average maturity of over 9 years. 
Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $678 million, including recurring CapEx of $48 million. We opened 11 new projects this quarter, including new IBXs in Frankfurt, Osaka and Singapore have purchased land for development in Barcelona, Frankfurt and Helsinki. On the xScale side of the business, we opened our Sao Paulo 5 and Frankfurt 9 assets. We also closed the first phase of our EMEA 2 joint venture with GIC for net cash proceeds at our 20% equity contribution of approximately $140 million, including $34 million coming from the contribution of our Safala 5 asset into the joint venture after quarter end. On a separate note, we continue to actively manage our partners and suppliers and have built up an appropriate inventory of part components as we hedge against supply chain challenges in support of our business needs. Finally, total recurring revenues from owned assets stepped up to 59% due to the acquisition of our Citi One and CD2IBXs. 
Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 153 stabilized assets increased recurring revenue by 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 86% utilized and generated 27% cash-on-cash return on the group PPD invested. We expect to exit the year closer to the top end of our stabilized asset growth range, in part due to strong Americas revenue growth. 
Now please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note, our guidance now includes the anticipated results from the GPX India acquisition, which closed in September. For the full year 2021, we expect revenues to grow approximately 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our updated revenue guidance implies our largest ever quarterly step-up in recurring revenues on a normalized basis, a reflection of our continued strong execution. Revenues include about $5 million from the GPX acquisition and reflect updated FX rates. 
We expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin before integration costs to be greater than 47% and now include about $3 million from the GPX acquisition and reflect updated FX rates. We expect to spend $18 million of integration costs in 2021, and we expect 2021 AFFO to grow 10% to 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis compared to the prior year and to deliver AFFO per share growth of 9% to 10%. Our AFFO guidance includes some AFFO impacting accelerated spend, including recurring CapEx and elevated cash commissions associated with our strong bookings performance. 2021 CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $3 billion, including about $450 million of on-balance sheet xScale CapEx, a significant portion of which has been or will be reimbursed by the JVs, and $193 million of recurring CapEx spend at the midpoint. 
So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles."

And I think it's been really encouraging. We're really seeing strength with our top channel partners and really our top alliance partners, in particular, who are really engaged in joint enterprise pursuit with us in terms of pursuing hybrid multi-cloud opportunities and people implementing hybrid architectures. 
And so in fact, I'll give you a stat. We had our top 4 alliance partners in this quarter accounted for 10% of the total bookings, and that's not 10% of the channel book, but that's 10% of the total bookings. So really strong momentum with the channel partners. 
And it's across a number of verticals and it's across a number of use cases, but real strength in terms of how people are thinking about using corporate data to draw insights, how they therefore want to store that data centrally, act on it from a variety of cloud resources and then also AI as a key driver. In fact, we had a big win, a big joint win with NVIDIA on that front, as we talked about in the script. And so really great progress there. And I think the range of use cases is really strong.

We're getting the right kinds of deployments, right kinds of customers, right kinds of use cases. And I think that's a lot of credit to our sales and marketing team in terms of what they're doing from a targeting perspective and to our commercial teams in terms of how we're really sort of focusing the business.

I'll start and then Keith can jump in if you want to add anything. But I'd say this, other than some small onetime items on the power side that had a slight impact on our Q4 guide, we're seeing power costs pretty much come in where we expected for the remainder of the year and into early next year. I think there's -- it's more going to be the longer-term volatility into 2022 that we're really looking at. But as you said, similar to currency, we've got a pretty extensive hedging program, and that really feathers in our hedges over a multiyear period. And we're about 85% hedged in the unregulated markets, which represent most of our largest markets. And so our contracts do allow for us to adjust pricing based on underlying costs, and we're actively working to implement adjustments where we think that's appropriate. 
But again, you guys, I think, recognize our business is different in that we're more heavily circuit-based on our power mix, so whereas it's a little more seamless to pass through those costs in the meter power environment. It takes a little more finance to do that in the circuit-based power environment. But I would say that we are -- as I said, we're actively working on that in terms of how to do it. And I'd say that our experience in Europe with the cross-connect pricing increases over the last couple of years really give us some confidence that we'll be able to go get that done effectively. So no doubt there's more volatility in the energy markets. So we're watching those closely, and we're going to continue to adapt our strategies accordingly."

As it relates to sort of the deal structuring between PGIM and GIC is very similar in many ways, the construct was developed off contracting structure with the GIC when we work with PGIM. Again, delighted to have another partner in a different market and in support of our Australian business. 
As it relates to sort of our ability to the performance this quarter, again, as you've heard from some of our prior calls, we've basically sold out most of the capacity that we've delivered to market, and so we're very eager to continue our builds. We have 8 builds currently underway in xScale, and the team is working very hard to identify customer -- appropriate customers for that capacity plus more. So I'd just leave you with it's an exciting time for us in the xScale space. We're putting the money to work. And as Charles alluded to in his prepared remarks, $7.5 billion of capital is going to be deployed across 34 assets, and we still have more to talk about. 
So why don't I leave it there and just recognize that xScale in of itself right now is not a big component of our revenues and our AFFO, but it does create some of the lumpiness that you've seen in the nonrecurring line, which we highlighted in our prepared remarks. Q4, we just don't expect as much of that nonrecurring revenue as we've seen before. But certainly, as we look into '22 and beyond, we'll start to see that step up again from a nonrecurring perspective, and then you'll also see more of the recurring fees come into play for xScale."

And Jon, on the other one, I'd say, one, look, I haven't been -- I'm as optimistic as I've ever been, I guess, on the business, how it's performing, what the magnitude of the opportunity ahead is. A little bit of noise in the quarter here, but I think that we had a -- we continue -- the business continues to perform. The fundamentals are very strong, 8,000 interconnection adds in the quarter. 3,000 billable cab adds. Record bookings really for the past 3 quarters, at least seasonally adjusted in terms of -- this was our best Q3 ever this quarter. Great degree of predictability churn, as I said, at the low end. Firm pricing, we had another quarter of positive pricing adjustments as Keith talked about in the script, and we continue to see good momentum on our new markets. 
If you look at big markets that we're relatively earlier entrant in, in terms of in places like Mexico and now India, huge opportunities in front of us there to over-index and growth on those -- in those markets. And then digital services is really -- our customers are responding really well to those products, even though they're at an earlier stage of growth. 
So I think as I look into 2022 in terms of headwinds, tailwinds, et cetera, we feel really good about the bookings momentum. We feel really good about the pricing and our relevance to customers and therefore our ability to support firm price points. Churn looks good. Good deal mix is going to continue to be absolutely key to maintaining that. As I said, I think the headwinds, more on making sure that we continue to -- we talked a little bit about power as a potential headwind there in some areas. We talked about, I think, continuing to drive operational efficiencies in the business. It's going to be a key focus for us to drive operating leverage. 
And then continuing to work the backlog. I think we've got a big backlog, partially because we've got some big deals that have gone into that. We've got to continue to work them through that backlog. Certain deal types to have slightly longer book-to-bill, and I think we're seeing that as part of the complexity of implementing these more multi-vendor, hybrid multi-cloud kind of deals. And so we're continuing to sort of hone our capabilities there. So if we can continue to drive those things, I think we'll be able to really take advantage of the bookings momentum that's there. And obviously, we'll give you a color on all of that as we go into the 2022 guidance."

I would say that was back in the early days. I was here in the 2011, '12 time frame when we really set about honing our sales process and driving greater deal commercial scrutiny, et cetera. 
And I think that -- so we had a little bit of elevated churn as we work through that process. And then we had a little bit during the period of time when we kind of digested some of the Verizon assets. We talked about the fact over a few -- several quarters ago where we had deals that candidly just we're outside of the traditional sweet spot that we would be focused on, and I think it's the right long-term value-creating decision for us to let those kind of things go and use that space and that capacity for advancing the strategy that we're really focused on. 
And so now you're seeing that. And as I've always said, the most -- the best way to avoid losing a deal, to get the right deal in the door to begin with, and so that's where our focus is.

Yes. I mean when we say firm pricing, one of the big things we talked about is when we had net positive pricing actions in the quarter, so we essentially take the -- what we're getting in terms of uplifts on our pricing, our accelerators, if you will, or increased price increases that are contractually built in. We offset that against any potential downward movement that might occur on a rerates. 
Our business tends to move in a little bit of a soft tune that it's -- we'll see these price escalators over a kind of a 3- to 5-year contract. We'll get a renewal that might have some rerate, and then we'll kind of go through that cycle again. But in any given quarter, we're seeing those positive pricing -- overall positive pricing adjustments. And that's just, I think, a reflection of our ability to sustain those higher price points. 
As you can see in the Americas, actually, in all of the -- we've been sort of moving MRR per cab up and to the right for a long period of time. We've seen some really strong movement in EMEA over the last couple of years because of the interconnection price increasing. I think we were slightly down in the U.S. on a constant currency basis, but that can go up and depend on the timing of installs and those kind of things. And so I mean, 23.93 per cab is just an exceptional number. And so I think if you look at that relative to the rest of the industry, I think you would find it to be sort of far and away the best kind of yield in the industry. 
And so -- and in terms of normalizing that for large footprint, we really aren't doing any really large footprint in the U.S. We occasionally will do an anchor deal in a facility, but we're not really active in the hyperscale or xScale kind of space in the U.S., and we've kind of talked about why that is in the past. And if you look at the -- even in the other markets, we're doing that now almost strictly through the xScale business and through the joint venture, and so that's not rolling into the results that you see here. That really only rolls into our sort of core financials in the form of fees and other things that we think are quite accretive to the overall financial picture. So that's kind of picture on pricing. 
Pricing, I think, on xScale continues to be competitive, certainly, which is why returns in that business are a little lower, but that's also why we decided to go do this through joint ventures where 80% that capital is through a financial partner."

And then you've been very active on the xScale. But in terms of other M&A, how are you thinking about the landscape out there? Or is this going to be more focused on sort of small tuck-ins from here?"

So I'd start by saying that, generally, I think our team has done just an exceptional job navigating the current reality as it relates to supply chain around the world. Our bottom line message has been and continues to be that we really aren't seeing any meaningful negative impacts to our business, but that doesn't just magically happen. It happens by our team doing really great work to go and make sure that we are mitigating the risks that are out there. 
The way I check, we talk about it internally, is really 4 kind of levels to the supply chain potential risks. The first one is really facility level. Or in other words, are those constraints out there impacting our ability projects on time and on budget? And while we've seen some modest level of delays on a few projects, those are typically actually more associated with COVID delays than they are supply chain, candidly. As Casey noted in the script, we've actually taken on some inventory or contractual forward commits to the tune of about $100 million that is giving us the confidence to be able to make sure that we can deliver our projects on time. That, combined with the fact that we've got a huge number of projects underway, and they're all over the world and we can move and step around, typically, it's fungible between sort of projects. And so the team, the construction team, the procurement team, the sourcing team have just done a phenomenal job in terms of mitigating that in terms of IBX availability and the delivery time lines. 
The next level on it is really at the services level. In other words, our underlying services, particularly our network-related services like Fabric, Connect, et cetera and metal. Are we -- do we have the capacity to support the forecast there? And what we've done there is we've just forward purchased several quarters of capacity to give us the confidence that we can support that, and so feeling good about that as well. 
The third level is really deployment level. In other words, case materials and other things that are needed as people build out their cages, and we've also stockpiled there. Occasionally, there are circumstances where people have nonstandard items that cause delays. But if they're sticking within the sort of the middle of the bell curve in terms of what their needs are, we're not seeing any delays there. 
And then customer level delays is sort of the last level, which is our customers delayed in terms of getting their IT equipment to load into the deployments. And if not, are they delaying or asking for delays for commencement and those kind of things? And again, while we've seen a few of those things, they're just in the grand steel -- scope of things and in the scale of our business are just not particularly meaningful. 
So there's some -- there's probably a little bit of pressure on costs in some areas. We've been able to take advantage of our scale, I think, to mitigate that. We're continuing to -- people often ask the question as to whether cost to build is inflationary or not. I would tell you that I think we're -- we've been able to keep up with it from a design standpoint and continuing to optimize our designs faster than costs are going up, so we're trying to keep ahead of the game there. But I think our team has done a really terrific job of managing those things, and I do think that we're -- we expect that things will start to stabilize over the course of 2022 from a supply chain perspective. So long answer there, but hopefully, that gives you some perspective."

The first one is, when you look at what's happening on the network side for network customers, are you seeing an increasing amount of telecom and wireless companies place their core network infrastructure in your facilities rather than having their own mobile switching offices that they might have had in kind of the more legacy years of the telecom landscape? And what kind of opportunity that is for you as you look at wireless and 5G trying to take more services to the edge?

The -- I would say on the network side, I'd say it's a mixed bag. I think that there is a movement towards people viewing third-party facilities, particularly facilities like Equiix, where there's large degrees of aggregation as logical places to put portions of their core infrastructure. That said, I think these companies are also -- have a long history of building on in their own facilities, and I think that is -- there are still a lot of forces within those companies that want that to continue. And so I think we've been very active on the business development front, and we have seen some there and in terms of how they might think about quoting certain portions of their core 5G infrastructure, for example, into our facilities. And we have the Dallas proof-of-concept center there that we've been actively working with both equipment providers as well as service providers on sort of proving out some of those potential value propositions. 
So I think we're still -- that will happen over a long course. I do think we're more successful with people who are coming into those markets as disruptors because they think differently about it. And so -- and I do think there are some pretty interesting opportunities there. And we're working with a few. I want to say the names right now, but I'm not sure that they are publicly that I can, so I won't. And -- but there's some interesting things going on there. 
As to the tower side, we've been -- we believe there is some synergy between sort of companies that have broad-based real estate assets that are sort of proximate to communications infrastructure, which is sort of the definition of tower companies. And I can see why and understand why they may have an interest in data center assets and how they fit in potentially to their portfolio. But I would tell you that for the most part, we see a strong demand for traffic at the edge there to a very significant majority of that traffic to go back to the aggregated edge, and that's really our sweet spot. That's where our differentiation is. Definitely, there are use cases that where mobile edge compute out further, things like [ chapter ] automation and those kind of things. I think there are real use cases that 5G is going to be able to accelerate, and we're certainly keeping our eyes on that and being active there from a business development standpoint. But I do think that -- I think it's more likely that we would partner in some way with those folks over time. It's not necessarily obvious to me that those have to live under same ownership structure. So -- but I think we'll just have to continue to see how the markets play out. Keith, I don't know if you have a different view on that."

Charles, in response to Jonathan Atkin's question regarding your outlook on 2022, my take from your response was the top line looks fine, but your concern is around margins. whether it's operational efficiencies or in particular, power costs. And as it relates to the question around power costs, I feel you may have created more questions and answers so far on this call, and I'd love to get a little bit more detail. Specifically, you guys, I think, had talked about it at your Analyst Day in June, seeing margins go up just modestly in 2022. I'm curious if you still think that, that's possible. 
Secondly, you mentioned that you hedge in unregulated markets around 85%. How far out are those hedges? Does it seem like you're suggesting that you're okay with power costs going into 2022 but not necessarily for the full year? 
And then as it relates to the potential impact of power, do you think at the end of the day, this could be up 25 basis point impact, 50 basis point impact, hundreds of basis point impact? Just anything that gives us a better sense because my concern personally is that we could now be in a situation where margins go down in 2022. 
And then just lastly, as it relates to AFFO, it looks like AFFO guidance implies a pretty meaningful step down in the fourth quarter. Is that just the maintenance CapEx component that you talked about, Keith? Or is there something else there? And what's the better jump-off point as we look to go into 2022? Is it the third quarter? Or is it the fourth quarter?"

I think that we did talk about driving efficiencies, and I think the pursuit of the 50% margin target is something we continue to be focused on, and that's an area where we continue to have work to do. Exactly at what pace we can do that and what that implies for the 2022 margin, I don't know, and I do think it will require us to dig in deeper on power. And I don't think we're yet in a position where we can quantify any of that for you other than in terms of the hedging that we -- I mean they are multiyear hedges, but they're feathered in and so, obviously, do become less impactful as you look further out. And so I do think that there's more risk as you go out, but I think the good part of that is that it gives us time to determine what our approach is going to be to -- passing those costs through and assessing how to do that and to what degree that is -- how much recovery we can see there. And we don't know the answers to all these things, and so I think we're going to track those. We're going to look at the markets where there's volatility. And I think that's something where, unfortunately, I think we'll just have to come back to you when we look -- as we look into the 2022 guidance and give you more perspective on that."

Number one is what's happening quarter-over-quarter, what's going on in Q4. There was a reference that we made and that we accelerated some costs into this year. So that's number one both from a recurring CapEx perspective and some operating spend. We did that for a number of reasons and part of it is supply chain specific. 
The other part, as we alluded to in the prepared remarks, when you look at AFFO in and of itself, Q4 is historically one of our lower-performing AFFO quarters. That's why we don't guide on a quarterly basis. We give you the annual number and say this is what we will do, and we recognize things will move around. But the reality is Q4 always tends to be a higher recurring CapEx quarter, and that's what you're seeing in the guide where we delivered at $193 million at midpoint. So it gives you a real big step-up in our recurring CapEx for Q4. 
The other thing, as we've said, that we've had a lot of success in the business. And as a result, the cash payout attributed to commissions is more substantial than we originally anticipated in Q4, and that's reflected in the guidance. And that's AFFO impacting, on EBITDA impacting. And so there's a lot of nuances. But overall, when you look at the fundamental business, it's performed better than we anticipated for every single quarter of the year. We're delivering against the expectations we have set. And as you -- I think you know well that we've raised our guide both on revenue, EBITDA and AFFO throughout the year, and we're at a point now where we feel comfortable and now we're focusing on 2022.

The pandemic has triggered an accelerated need to digitize business models in virtually every segment of the economy, and our strong results reflect this increasing demand for digital infrastructure. And Equinix remains uniquely positioned to help customers as they shift towards distributed, hybrid and multicloud as the clear architecture of choice.
As we continue to strengthen our position as the world's digital infrastructure company, our focus remains on creating distinctive and durable value for our customers and our shareholders, driving growth and scale in our market-leading colocation franchise, expanding our relevance to the cloud ecosystem through xScale and tapping into massive sources of incremental demand by adapting to evolving customer needs with a rapidly growing digital services business.
Turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3. Revenues for Q3 were $1.7 million, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 4% year-over-year. And AFFO was in line with our expectations. Interconnection revenues continue to outpace colocation revenues, growing 11% year-over-year driven by solid physical cross-connect growth and broad adoption of Equinix Fabric. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis.
We processed more than 4,200 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers, highlighting the reach, scale and predictability of our bookings vision. We have a solid demand pipeline as we look to the final quarter of the year, and we continue to add capacity to service this demand with 11 major projects delivered this quarter in key markets like Frankfurt, New York and Singapore and 31 more major projects underway across 23 markets in 16 countries.
Our global interconnection franchise continues to thrive, with over 414,000 total interconnections on our industry-leading platform. In Q3, we added an incremental 7,800 interconnections that now have at least one major cloud on-ramp in 42 metros around the world, 2x more than the nearest competitor, a clear indication that Equinix is the home of the interconnected cloud.
Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 6% quarter-over-quarter and 30% year-over-year to over 21 terabits per second as traffic growth remains robust. Equinix Fabric saw excellent growth, continuing to significantly overindex within the broader interconnection portfolio. More than 2,800 customers are now on Fabric, with attach rates moving up into the right as businesses diversify their end destinations and service providers integrate Fabric into their own solutions.
In September, we extended Platform Equinix into our 27th country with the close of our GPX acquisition, entering the strategic Indian market. Our 2 data centers in Mumbai form a network-dense campus with more than 350 international and local companies, including 6 on-ramps to the world's leading cloud service providers and a robust network ecosystem. GPX represents an ideal entry point into this top 10 GDP country, and we expect to expand our operations significantly in India over the coming years as we tap into this rapidly growing market.
In parallel, with our tremendous retail success, we continue to expand our xScale business. In October, we announced plans to expand into Australia with an agreement to establish a $575 million joint venture with PGIM Real Estate to develop 2 data centers in Sydney, which will provide more than 55 megawatts of capacity when fully built.
Also, during the quarter, we closed the first phase of our previously announced EMEA 2 Joint Venture with GIC and signed 2 megawatts with a hyperscaler in Frankfurt. We currently have 8 xScale builds under development, including our newly announced Madrid 3, Mexico C3 and Sydney 9 assets. which will collectively add 25 megawatts of capacity when they open in the first half of 2022. The total investment of our various hyperscale joint ventures, when closed and fully built out, is now expected to be more than $7.5 billion across 34 facilities globally, with more than 675 megawatts of power capacity.
Turning to our digital infrastructure services. Our Equinix Metal business saw strong revenue growth as cloud native and service provider customers continue to embrace the ability to deploy physical infrastructure at software speed. And Network Edge saw robust growth as established customers purchase more virtual network functions across additional metros. By year-end, we expect Network Edge to be available in 25 metros around the world.
So now, let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical continues to be a foundation for the business, with strength in the quarter in cable and satellite subsegments and continued momentum in joint go-to-market with our top network partners across the globe. Expansions this quarter included Zayo Group, a global communications infrastructure company, adding interconnection and colocation capacity to support demand; Vocus, Australia's leading specialist fiber and network solutions provider, building infrastructure in both Sydney and Melbourne to offer network services; and Hurricane Electric, a global network service provider utilizing Equinix Fabric to allow enterprise customers to access their IP transit product at scale and in real time.
Our enterprise vertical saw another strong quarter, led by manufacturing and fintech and record channel activity. New wins and expansions included a Fortune 100 manufacturing company, deploying global network hubs to enable their SaaS analytics offering; a leading technology manufacturer, deploying a custom liquid-cooled environment and solution center to support the next generation of high-performance compute; and a Fortune 250 online retailer and e-commerce platform, deploying across Platform Equinix with low-latency, cloud-adjacent network hubs to support their retail-branded sites.
Our cloud and IT vertical saw particular strength in the Americas as industry-specific cloud solutions continue to be a catalyst for innovation and new growth. Expansions this quarter included Adobe, a leading cloud software provider, deploying infrastructure to support its platforms and optimize sustainable participation in key digital markets and ecosystems; Wasabi, a U.S.-based object storage company, expanding their offering on Equinix Fabric into APAC and EMEA, enabling customers to easily connect their bare metal workloads posted on Equinix Metal; and a top 5 global software provider, deploying core nodes to support their growing user base and demand in both Mexico City and Sao Paulo.
Content and digital media had a great bookings quarter, with resurgence in this vertical being led by APAC and broad-based strength in the gaming and streaming subsegments as consumer demand for at-home digital services remains strong. Expansions this quarter included Netflix, a global streaming service expanding cross-platform Equinix to new and existing markets to support OTT delivery; Kingsoft, a Chinese cloud provider expanding into Singapore to support rapid sales growth; and a top 3 content distributor extending coverage and scale for its growing platform in the delivery of new and existing security solutions.
And our channel program continues to shine, delivering another robust quarter. This important go-to-market motion accounted for over 35% of total bookings, nearly half of our enterprise bookings and more than 60% of our new logos in the quarter. We are benefiting from tremendous momentum in hybrid cloud adoption and seeing particular strength from the joint enterprise pursuit with our key alliance partners, such as AT&T, AWS, Dell, HPE and Microsoft. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and included a marquee win with Nvidia, IBM and SVA for Continental Group, a worldwide automotive parts supplier, building an interconnected global network to optimize workloads and speed up AI training for their advanced driver assistance systems.
So now, let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter."

And once again, we met our expectations or better. We had a very solid quarter. The macro environment for digital infrastructure continues to drive expanding market opportunities as demonstrated by another outstanding bookings quarter, both at the gross and the net level, from our industry-leading go-to-market engine. Our bookings backlog remains both significant and elevated as we work to install the substantial volume of business closed through the past few quarters. And our forward-looking pipeline is extremely healthy in all of our regions.
Our channel sales activity was the best in our history, and our global platform delivered healthy inter- and intra-region activity. We had firm MRR per cabinet yields, with yet again net positive pricing actions, a validation of a differentiated operating model compared to others in our space.
On a year-to-date basis, our global design and construction and ops teams have delivered more than 18,000 cabinets of retail capacity and 40 megawatts of xScale inventory, while also rolling out critical network infrastructure assets across our targeted markets in support of our Fabric, Network Edge and metal service offerings.
We've seen no major delays to date in delivering new capacity despite general market concerns related to supply chain challenges, a reflection of the efforts put forth by our best-in-class procurement and strategic sourcing teams.
Now let me cover the results for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $1.675 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year due to strong business performance across our platform, led by the Americas region.
Nonrecurring revenues represented about 7% of revenues due to an increase in custom installation work and EMEA xScale joint venture fees. For Q4, we expect NRR to trend downward, decreasing sequentially by approximately $12 million due to lower xScale fees and the timing of large customer installations.
Q3 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $6 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $786 million or 47% of revenues, at the high end of our guidance expectations due to timing of spend and low integration costs. Q3 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $3 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $3 million of integration costs.
Total Q3 AFFO was $628 million, the result of strong operating performance, consistent with our expectations. Similar to prior years, we expect seasonally higher levels of recurring CapEx in Q4 as our operating teams work to complete the 2021 projects.
Global Q3 MRR churn was 2.1%. We continue to expect MRR churn for the full year to be at the lower end of our target quarterly range of 2% to 2.5%.
Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. APAC region's revenue grew 11% year-over-year, followed by the Americas at 7% and EMEA at 6%. As previously discussed, we expect the EMEA growth rate to return to normalized levels in Q4 as we lap interconnection price increases and the other one-off positive adjustments from last year.
The Americas region saw continued strength with our third consecutive quarter of record bookings, with a broad distribution across metros, including some of our smaller markets, such as Boston, Denver, Mexico City, Seattle and Toronto. The Americas sales teams continue to sell the global platform, with a notable increase in activity coming from our Canadian team, a benefit derived from the transaction with Bell Canada, which is outperforming our expectations.
Our EMEA region had a solid quarter, with strength coming from our Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Madrid markets as enterprise customers and the channel drive bookings. And as we aim to meet high sustainability and efficiency standards while progressing towards our 2030 science-based targets, newbuilds like our recently opened Frankfurt IBX serve as a model to blend in the cityscape, positively contributing to the local micro climate.
And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter, with momentum across all of our metros, led by Singapore. New deal activity focused on small- to medium-sized deployments, with firm pricing and continued strength in our cross-border selling. Our Hong Kong market saw a nice rebound in bookings performance, although it continues to feel constrained given the market uncertainty.
And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with cash of about $1.4 billion, and our net debt leverage ratio remains low, particularly relative to our industry peers. Our balance sheet remains highly flexible and liquid, and we have a low AFFO cash payout ratio. With regards to our outstanding debt, we have minimal near-term exposure to potentially rising interest rates, with 95% of our debt fixed and a weighted average maturity of over 9 years.
Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $678 million, including recurring CapEx of $48 million. We opened 11 new projects this quarter, including new IBXs in Frankfurt, Osaka and Singapore, have purchased land for development in Barcelona, Frankfurt and Helsinki.
On the xScale side of the business, we opened our Sao Paulo 5 and Frankfurt 9 assets. We also closed the first phase of our EMEA 2 Joint Venture with GIC for net cash proceeds after our 20% equity contribution of approximately $140 million, including $34 million coming from the contribution of our Sao Paulo 5 asset into the joint venture after quarter end.
On a separate note, we continue to actively manage our partners and suppliers and have built up an appropriate inventory of arching components as we hedge against supply chain challenges in support of our business needs.
Finally, total recurring revenues from owned assets stepped up to 59% due to the acquisition of our Sydney 1 and Sydney 2 IBXs.
Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 153 stabilized assets increased recurring revenue by 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 86% utilized and generated 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. We expect to exit the year closer to the top end of our stabilized asset growth range, in part due to strong Americas revenue growth.
Now please refer to slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note, our guidance now includes the anticipated results from the GPX India acquisition, which closed in September.
For the full year 2021, we expect revenues to grow approximately 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our updated revenue guidance implies our largest-ever quarterly step-up in recurring revenues on a normalized basis, a reflection of our continued strong execution. Revenues include about $5 million from the GPX acquisition and reflect updated FX rates.
We expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin before integration costs to be greater than 47% and now include about $3 million from the GPX acquisition and reflect updated FX rates. We expect to spend $18 million of integration costs in 2021, and we expect 2021 AFFO to grow 10% to 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis compared to the prior year and to deliver AFFO per share growth of 9% to 10%.
Our AFFO guidance includes some AFFO impacting accelerated spend, including recurring CapEx and elevated cash commissions associated with our strong bookings performance. 2021 CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $3 billion, including about $450 million of on-balance sheet xScale CapEx, a significant portion of which has been or will be reimbursed by the JVs, and $193 million of recurring CapEx spend at the midpoint.
So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles."

The pandemic has been a driving force for digital transformation. And as businesses seek to respond to this imperative, the infrastructure underpinning these services must keep pace.

We are evolving the way we design, create and deliver our products and services to fuel our growth and meet the changing needs of our customers.
To that end, I would also like to welcome Ron Guerrier to our Board of Directors. As a veteran CIO to Fortune 500 corporations and government, Ron brings a unique perspective to the Equinix Board as we continue to innovate our digital infrastructure offerings for the digital leaders of today and tomorrow.
I would like to close by expressing my gratitude to our more than 10,000 employees, whose commitment to keep our customers at the center of everything we do continues to drive our market leadership.

And most of those, about 60%, are coming through channel, as we talked about in the script. So we're seeing a big uptick, as I said, more than 35% of the bookings coming through the channel. And I think it's been really encouraging. We're really seeing strength with our top channel partners and really our top alliance partners, in particular, who are really engaged in joint enterprise pursuit with us in terms of pursuing hybrid multicloud opportunities and people implementing hybrid architectures.
And so, in fact, I'll give you a stat. We had our top 4 alliance partners in this quarter accounted for 10% of the total bookings, and that's not 10% of the channel book, but that's 10% of the total bookings. So really strong momentum with the channel partners.
And it's across a number of verticals and it's across a number of use cases, but real strength in terms of how people are thinking about using corporate data to draw insights, how they therefore want to store that data centrally, act on it from a variety of cloud resources and then also AI as a key driver. In fact, we had a big win, a big joint win with NVIDIA on that front, as we talked about in the script. And so really great progress there, and I think the range of use cases is really strong. We had, in fact, an event today that we call Connect that was -- we had, I think, about 500 registrations for that event, for enterprises talking about a variety of use cases implemented on Fabric. And so we're seeing some really good momentum."

But I would say this, other than some small onetime items on the power side that had a slight impact on our Q4 guide, we're seeing power costs pretty much come in where we expected for the remainder of the year and into early next year. I think there's -- it's more going to be the longer-term volatility into 2022 that we're really looking at. But as you said, similar to currency, we've got a pretty extensive hedging program, and that really feathers in our hedges over a multiyear period.
And we're about 85% hedged in the unregulated markets, which represent most of our largest markets. And so our contracts do allow for us to adjust pricing based on underlying costs, and we're actively working to implement adjustments where we think that's appropriate.
But again, you guys, I think, recognize our business is different, in that we're more heavily circuit-based on our power mix, so whereas it's a little more seamless to pass through those costs in the metered-power environment, it takes a little more finesse to do that in the circuit-based power environment. But I would say that we are -- as I said, we're actively working on that in terms of how to do it. And I would say that our experience in Europe with the cross-connect pricing increases over the last couple of years really give us some confidence that we'll be able to go get that done effectively. So no doubt there's more volatility in the energy markets, so we're watching those closely, and we're going to continue to adapt our strategies accordingly."

Again, delighted to have another partner in a different market and in support of our Australian business.
As it relates to sort of our ability to the performance this quarter, again, as you've heard from some of our prior calls, we've basically sold out most of the capacity that we've delivered to market, and so we're very eager to continue our builds. We have 8 builds currently underway in xScale, and the team is working very hard to identify customer -- appropriate customers for that capacity, plus more. And so I would just leave you with it's an exciting time for us in the xScale space. We're putting the money to work. And as Charles alluded to in his prepared remarks, $7.5 billion of capital is going to be deployed across 34 assets, and we still have more to talk about.
So why don't I leave it there and just recognize that xScale in and of itself right now is not a big component of our revenues and our AFFO, but it does create some of the lumpiness that you've seen in the nonrecurring line, which we highlighted in our prepared remarks. Q4, we just don't expect as much of that nonrecurring revenue as we've seen before. But certainly, as we look into '22 and beyond, we'll start to see that step up again from a nonrecurring perspective, and then you'll also see more of the recurring fees come into play for xScale."

The fundamentals are very strong: 8,000 interconnection adds in the quarter; 3,000 billable cab adds; record bookings really for the past 3 quarters, at least seasonally adjusted in terms of -- this was our best Q3 ever this quarter; great degree of predictability churn, as I said, at the low end; firm pricing, we had another quarter of positive pricing adjustments that Keith talked about in the script; and we continue to see good momentum on our new markets.
If you look at big markets that we're a relatively earlier entrant in, in terms of, think of places like Mexico and now India, huge opportunities in front of us there to overindex in growth on those -- in those markets. And then digital services is really -- our customers are responding really well to those products, even though they're at an earlier stage of growth.
So I think as I look into 2022 in terms of headwinds, tailwinds, et cetera, we feel really good about the bookings momentum. We feel really good about the pricing and our relevance to customers and therefore our ability to support firm price points. Churn looks good. Good deal mix is going to continue to be absolutely key to maintaining that. As I said, I think the headwinds, more on making sure that we continue to -- we talked a little bit about power as a potential headwind there in some areas. We talked about, I think, continuing to drive operational efficiencies in the business. It's going to be a key focus for us to drive operating leverage.
And then continuing to work the backlog. I think we've got a big backlog, partially because we've got some big deals that have gone into that. We've got to continue to work them through that backlog. Certain deal types to have slightly longer book-to-bill, and I think we're seeing that as part of the complexity of implementing these more multi-vendor, hybrid multicloud kind of deals. And so we're continuing to sort of hone our capabilities there. So if we can continue to drive those things, I think we'll be able to really take advantage of the bookings momentum that's there. And obviously, we'll give you a color on all of that as we go into the 2022 guidance."

I would say that was back in the early days. I was here in the 2011, '12 time frame, when we really set about honing our sales process and driving greater deal commercial scrutiny, et cetera.
And I think that -- so we had a little bit of elevated churn as we worked through that process. And then we had a little bit during the period of time when we kind of digested some of the Verizon assets. We talked about the fact that over a few -- several quarters ago, where we had deals that candidly just were outside of the traditional sweet spot that we would be focused on, and I think it's the right long-term value-creating decision for us to let those kind of things go and use that space and that capacity for advancing the strategy that we're really focused on.
And so now you're seeing that. And as I've always said, the most -- the best way to avoid losing a deal is get the right deal in the door to begin with. And so that's where our focus is. I think our sales teams are really doing an exceptional job of that. Our new sales leader, Arquelle Shaw, in the U.S. is just a dynamite sales leader, doing an incredible job and has got a great leadership team across the board there. And so -- and I got to give some credit to Jon Lin too, our President of the Americas. Just a great team really driving that thing."

Yes. I mean when we say firm pricing, one of the big things we've talked about is when we had net positive pricing actions in the quarter, so we essentially take the -- what we're getting in terms of uplifts on our pricing, our accelerators, if you will, or increased -- price increases that are contractually built in. We offset that against any potential downward movement that might occur in a release.
Our business tends to move in a little bit of a sawtooth, in that it's -- we'll see these price escalators over a kind of a 3- to 5-year contract. We'll get a renewal that might have some re-rates, and then we'll kind of go through that cycle again. But in any given quarter, we're seeing those positive pricing -- overall positive pricing adjustments. And that's just, I think, a reflection of our ability to sustain those higher price points.
As you can see, in the Americas, actually, in all of the -- we've been sort of moving MRR per cab up into the right for a long period of time. We've seen some really strong movement in EMEA over the last couple of years because of the interconnection price increasing. I think we were slightly down in the U.S. on a constant currency basis, but that can go up and depend on the timing of installs and those kind of things. And so, I mean, 23.93 per cab is just an exceptional number. And so I think if you look at that relative to the rest of the industry, I think you would find it to be sort of, far and away, the best kind of yield in the industry.
And so -- and in terms of normalizing that for a large footprint, we really aren't doing any really large footprint in the U.S. We occasionally will do an anchor deal in a facility, but we're not really active in the hyperscale or xScale kind of space in the U.S., and we've kind of talked about why that is in the past. And if you look at the -- even in the other markets, we're doing that now almost strictly through the xScale business and through the joint venture, and so that's not rolling into the results that you see here. That really only rolls into our sort of core financials in the form of fees and other things that we think are quite accretive to the overall financial picture. So that's kind of the picture on pricing.
Pricing, I think, on xScale continues to be competitive, certainly, which is why returns in that business are a little lower, but that's also why we decided to go do this through joint ventures, where 80% that capital is through a financial partner."

So I would start by saying that, generally, I think our team has done just an exceptional job navigating the current realities as it relates to supply chain around the world. Our bottom line message has been and continues to be that we really aren't seeing any meaningful negative impacts to our business. But that doesn't just magically happen. It happens by our team doing really great work to go and make sure that we are mitigating the risks that are out there.
The way I talk, we talk about it internally, is really 4 kind of levels to the supply chain potential risks. The first one is really facility level, or in other words, are those constraints out there impacting our ability to deliver projects on time and on budget. And while we've seen some modest level of delays on a few projects, those are typically actually more associated with COVID delays than they are supply chains, candidly.
And in case you noted in the script, we've actually taken on some inventory or contractual forward commits to the tune of about $100 million that is giving us the confidence to be able to make sure that we can deliver our projects on time. That, combined with the fact that we've got a huge number of projects underway, and they're all over the world and we can move stuff around, typically, it's fungible between sort of projects, and so the team, the construction team, the procurement team, the sourcing team have just done a phenomenal job in terms of mitigating that in terms of IBX availability and the delivery time lines.
The next level on it is really at the services level. In other words, are our underlying services, particularly our network-related services like Fabric, Connect, et cetera, and metal, are we -- do we have the capacity to support the forecast there? And what we've done there is we've just forward-purchased several quarters of capacity to give us the confidence that we can support that, and so feeling good about that as well.
The third level is really deployment level, in other words, cage materials and other things that are needed as people build out their cages. And we've also stockpiled there. Occasionally, there are circumstances where people have nonstandard items that cause delays. But if they're sticking within the sort of the middle-of-the-bell curve in terms of what their needs are, we're not seeing any delays there.
And then customer level delays is sort of the last level of it, which is our customers delayed in terms of getting their IT equipment to load into the deployments. And if not, are they delaying or asking for delays for commencement and those kind of things. And again, while we've seen a few of those things, they're just in the grand scheme -- scope of things and in the scale of our business are just not particularly meaningful.
So there's some -- there's probably a little bit of pressure on costs in some areas. We've been able to take advantage of our scale, I think, to mitigate that. We're continuing to -- people often ask the question as to whether cost-to-build is inflationary or not. I would tell you that I think we're -- we've been able to keep up with it from a design standpoint and continuing to optimize our designs faster than costs are going up. So we're trying to keep ahead of the game there. But I think our team has done a really terrific job of managing those things, and I do think that we're -- we expect that things will start to stabilize over the course of 2022 from a supply chain perspective. So long answer there, but hopefully, that gives you some perspective."

The -- I would say on the network side, I would say it's a mixed bag. And I think that there is a movement towards people viewing third-party facilities, particularly facilities like Equinix, where there's large degrees of aggregation as logical places to put portions of their core infrastructure. That said, I think these companies are also -- have a long history of building on in their own facilities, and I think that is -- there are still a lot of forces within those companies that want that to continue.
And so I think we've been very active on the business development front. And we have seen some success there and in terms of how they might think about putting certain portions of their core 5G infrastructure, for example, into our facilities. And we have the Dallas proof-of-concept center there that we've been actively working with both equipment providers as well as service providers on sort of proving out some of those potential value propositions.
So I think we're still -- that will happen over a long course. I do think we're more successful with people who are coming into those markets as disruptors because they think differently about it. And so -- and I do think there are some pretty interesting opportunities there, and we're working with a few. I want to say the names right now, but I'm not sure that they are publicly -- that I can, so I won't. And -- but there's some interesting things going on there.
As to the tower side, we've been -- we believe there is some synergy between sort of companies that have broad-based real estate assets that are sort of proximate to communications infrastructure, which is sort of the definition of tower companies. And I can see why and understand why they may have an interest in data center assets and how they fit in potentially to their portfolio.
But I would tell you that, for the most part, we see a strong demand for traffic at the edge there to a very significant majority of that traffic to go back to the aggregated edge. And that's really our sweet spot. That's where our differentiation is. Definitely, there are use cases that -- where mobile edge compute, out further, things like shop floor automation and those kind of things. I think they are really use cases that 5G is going to be able to accelerate. And we're certainly keeping our eyes on that and being active in there from a business development standpoint.
But I do think that -- I think it's more likely that we would partner in some way with those folks over time. It's not necessarily obvious to me that those have to live under same ownership structure. So -- but I think we'll just have to continue to see how the markets play out.

Are you seeing any characteristics that are starting to get more exciting about this market than what you're seeing elsewhere or sort of recent in the same sort of scenario?"

And so I think that's different in terms of -- if you look at the broad Americas because I think there's opportunities in LATAM for us. Obviously, we've already announced projects in Brazil. I think we bring some very distinctive advantages there.
I do think there's a ton of demand. And as we've always said, we're not going to say we're religiously out of the business of doing that, but I think it would have to be under a special set of circumstances in terms of why we think that fits with the strategy because we're -- the strategy, as you'll recall, is that we wanted to use those as opportunities to further our position in the cloud ecosystem, continue to invest in the relationship with the major cloud service providers and sort of broader set of hyperscalers and use that to create this advantage and overall position in the cloud ecosystem.
We feel very good about our position, particularly in the U.S. And whether or not the xScale would be particularly accretive to that, I think, is an open question. So -- but we're not -- we're definitely not -- it's not out of the question that we would do that. I just think it's -- I think, right now, there are a lot of opportunities for us in other markets that we think are more attractive."

And good on the team, that they're also selling the global platform out of Canada into our other assets around the world.
As it specifically relates to the Americas business, I think it's -- it goes back to some of the fundamentals that Charles alluded to. We're targeting the right customers with the right applications and putting them in the right places. And at the same -- by the same token, we've got an inventory set that really caters to a diverse set of customers across the U.S. or the Americas as a whole. And so between the assets we serve, the customers we target and the delivery of services that are additive to colocation and interconnection, I just think we're in a much better space or position. And as a result, we're going to win more than our fair share of the businesses out there."

And as it re",274,"Charles, in response to Jonathan Atkin's question regarding your outlook on 2022, my take from your response was the top line looks fine, but your concern is around margins, whether it's operational efficiencies or in particular, power costs. And as it relates to the question around power costs, I feel you may have created more questions than answers so far on this call. And I would love to get a little bit more detail. Specifically, you guys, I think, had talked about it at your Analyst Day in June, seeing margins go up just modestly in 2022. I'm curious if you still think that that's possible.
Secondly, you mentioned that you hedge in unregulated markets, around 85%. How far out are those hedges? Because it seems like you're suggesting that you're okay with power costs going into 2022, but not necessarily for the full year.
And then as it relates to the potential impact of power, do you think at the end of the day, this could be a 25 basis point impact, 50 basis point impact, hundreds of basis point impact? Just anything that gives us a better sense because my concern personally is that we could now be in a situation where margins go down in 2022.
And then just lastly, as it relates to AFFO, it looks like AFFO guidance implies a pretty meaningful step-down in the fourth quarter. Is that just the maintenance CapEx component that you talked about, Keith? Or is there something else there? And what's the better jump-off point as we look to go into 2022? Is it the third quarter? Or is it the fourth quarter?"

And I'm not sure we'll be able to give you all the answers there, but I would say -- and obviously, we're not going to kind of give you a 2022 guide. But I would say that your -- generally, I would say, we continue to feel good about the momentum in the business from a bookings and a demand perspective. I think that we did talk about driving efficiencies, and I think the pursuit of the 50% margin target is something we continue to be focused on, and that's an area where we continue to have work to do. Exactly at what pace we can do that and what that implies for the 2022 margin, I don't know. And I do think it will require us to dig in deeper on power.
And I don't think we're yet in a position where we can quantify any of that for you other than in terms of the hedging that we -- I mean, they are multiyear hedges, but they're feathered in and so obviously do become less impactful as you look further out. And so I do think that there's more risk as you go out. But I think the good part of that is that it gives us time to determine what our approach is going to be to passing those costs through and assessing how to do that and to what degree that is -- how much recovery we can see there.
And we don't know the answers to all those things, and so I think we're going to track those. We're going to look at the markets where there's volatility. And I think that's something where, unfortunately, I think, we'll just have to come back to you when we look into the -- as we look into the 2022 guide and give you more perspective on that."

Number one is what's happening quarter-over-quarter, what's going on in Q4. And there was a reference that we made in that we accelerated some costs into this year. So that's number one, both from a recurring CapEx perspective and some operating spend. And we did that for a number of reasons, and part of it is supply chain-specific.
The other part, as we alluded to in the prepared remarks, when you look at AFFO in and of itself, Q4 is historically one of our lower-performing AFFO quarters. That's why we don't guide on a quarterly basis. We give you the annual number and say this is what we will do, and we recognize things will move around. But the reality is Q4 always tends to be a higher recurring CapEx quarter, and that's what you're seeing in the guide, that we've delivered at $193 million at midpoint. So it gives you a real sense of the big step-up in our recurring CapEx for Q4.
The other thing, as we've said, that we've had a lot of success in the business. And as a result, the cash payout attributed to commissions is more substantial than we originally anticipated in Q4, and that's reflected in the guide. And that's AFFO impacting, not EBITDA impacting. And so there's a lot of nuances.
But overall, when you look at the fundamental business, it's performed better than we anticipated for every single quarter of the year. We're delivering against the expectations we have set. And as you -- I think you know well that we've raised our guide both on revenue, EBITDA and AFFO throughout the year, and we're at a point now where we feel comfortable and now we're focusing on 2022. And that's where the energy of the business is again focused on."
