I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $2.6 billion or $5.35 per common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $2.7 billion or 5.18 cents per share. In",681,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. 
In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $2.6 billion or $5.35 per common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $2.7 billion or 5.18 cents per share. Included in EPS for the quarter were 2 small adjusting items, which are outlined on the slide. Net of these adjusting items, earnings per share for the quarter was $5.29. Full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $5.79. In addition to the adjusting items in the quarter, we recorded an equity investment gain of $60 million or $0.10 per share related to our equity stake in Snowflake. For the full year, the investment gain was $535 million or around $0.89 per share. 
Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail. In the fourth quarter, we released $593 million of allowance, primarily in our card business. Economic assumptions underlying our allowance included unemployment of around 8% at the end of 2021 and the impacts of the $900 billion stimulus package passed in December. The release was driven by the strong credit performance we have observed and by the new stimulus bill. In our allowance, we continue to assume that the relationship between the economic metrics and credit quickly reverts to a historical norm, and we've added significant additional qualitative factors for COVID-related uncertainty. In our commercial business, we charged off certain energy loans and released allowance for these specific reserves that were previously established for those loans. 
Turning to Slide 5. You can see the allowance coverage levels declined modestly from the prior quarters across our segments but remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Our Domestic Card coverage is now at 10.8%, while our branded card portfolio coverage is 12.7%. Recall that the difference between these metrics is driven by loss-sharing agreements in our partnership portfolios. Coverage in our consumer and commercial businesses also remained elevated at 3.9% and 2.2%, respectively. 
Moving to Slide 6. I'll discuss our liquidity position. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 145%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Our liquidity reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity declined slightly from the third quarter to end the year at approximately $144 billion, including about $41 billion in cash driven by continued strong deposits. 
Turning to Slide 7. You can see that our net interest margin increased 37 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 6.05%. The increase was largely driven by higher card loan revenue margin as strong credit results led to lower suppression, the impact of third and fourth quarter deposit pricing actions and a modest decline in our cash balance, which was partially offset by lower yields on cash and securities. 
Lastly, turning to Slide 8. I will cover our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.7% at the end of the fourth quarter, up 70 basis points from the third quarter and 150 basis points higher than a year ago. We continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%, which includes a buffer over our capital requirements under the SCB framework of 10.1%. And as we close out 2020, we have approximately 270 basis points or around $8 billion of capital in excess of our CET1 target. 
Following the latest stress test results released by the Federal Reserve last month and in light of the strong capital position I just described, we expect to restore our quarterly dividend back to $0.40 per share in the first quarter, pending Board approval. Our Board of Directors has also authorized the repurchase of up to $7.5 billion of the company's common stock inclusive of share repurchase capacity of up to approximately $500 million in the first quarter based on the Fed's current trailing 4-quarter average earnings rule. The timing and amount of stock repurchase activity will be informed by our outlook on the economy as well as actual forecasted levels of capital, earnings and growth. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich."

As I think everyone on this call knows, Scott shared with me in November that he would be leaving Capital One to join a tech startup. While he will be here through March 15, this will be Scott's last earnings call. So I want to take a moment and thank you, Scott, for giving so much of your life to Capital One over this past decade, including the last 5 years as our CFO. You've built strong relationships with our shareholders and across the investment community, and you've always brought their external perspectives to our work inside of Capital One. You've been a key adviser and partner for me and for the Board and a strong leader in our company. I'm particularly grateful for the legacy you've built, transforming finance technology, strengthening processes and controls, building a great team of talented leaders, including your successor, Andrew Young. We will miss you, and I'm sure you will continue to do great things. 
With that, let me turn to our Domestic Card business. Exceptional credit performance was the biggest driver of Domestic Card financial results in the quarter. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.69%, a 163 basis point improvement year-over-year and a 95 basis point improvement from the sequential quarter. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.42%, 151 basis points better than the prior year. The delinquency rate was up 21 basis points from the linked quarter, consistent with typical seasonal patterns. Fourth quarter provision for credit losses improved by $1.1 billion year-over-year driven by the allowance release that Scott discussed and lower charge-offs. 
Several factors are driving continued credit strength. Consumers are behaving cautiously, spending less, saving more and paying down debt. These behaviors have been amplified by the cumulative effect of unusually large government stimulus and widespread forbearance across the banking industry. Our own long-standing resilience choices put us in a strong position going into the pandemic. And our strategic investments in digital technology and transformation are paying off in enhanced capabilities and underwriting that are powering our performance and response to the pandemic. 
Strikingly strong consumer credit has persisted throughout 2020, even after the expiration of several parts of the CARES Act. Uncertainty about future credit trends remains high, especially in the context of an evolving pandemic that is difficult to predict. As Scott discussed, that uncertainty informs our allowance for credit loss. We believe that each incremental month of favorable credit reduces the cumulative losses through the downturn rather than just delaying the impact. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, Domestic Card ending loan balances were down $20.1 billion or 17% year-over-year driven by 3 factors: cautious consumer behavior, reduced spending and demand for new credit, and drove payment rates to historically high levels. Our marketing pullbacks at the outset of the downturn put additional pressure on loan balances, and we moved a partnership portfolio to held for sale in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the move to held for sale, ending loans declined about 15%. Fourth quarter average loans declined 16% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the expected seasonal ramp drove ending loans up by about 3%. 
Purchase volume continued to rebound from the sharp declines early in the pandemic. For the full year, purchase volume was down 2% in 2020. Fourth quarter purchase volume was essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter. That compares to a year-over-year decline of about 30% in the first weeks of the pandemic. Quarterly purchase volume increased 10% from the sequential quarter, consistent with the expected seasonality and the continued rebound. Despite the rebound, purchase volume growth is still down compared to the double-digit growth we were seeing before the pandemic. 
Fourth quarter revenue declined 7% year-over-year as a result of the decrease in average loans, partially offset by higher revenue margin. The revenue margin was up 121 basis points year-over-year to 16.91%, largely driven by 2 factors: strong credit drove lower revenue suppression; and year-over-year, net interchange revenue in the numerator of the margin is essentially flat, while average loan balances, the denominator of the margin calculation, are down 16%. 
Noninterest expense was down $186 million or 8% from the fourth quarter of last year, largely driven by our choice to pull back on Domestic Card marketing when the pandemic hit. Total company marketing trends are largely driven by Domestic Card. Fourth quarter marketing for the total company was down 21% year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, total company marketing increased significantly in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, future marketing will be impacted by how things play out with the pandemic and the economy. In the midst of the pandemic, we're finding opportunities, and we are leaning into them. These opportunities are enhanced by our tech transformation. The ultimate level of our 2021 marketing will depend on our continuing real-time assessment of the marketplace. 
Slide 12 summarizes fourth quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Driven by our auto business, ending loans increased 9% year-over-year. Average loans grew 10% for the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year. 
When the COVID downturn began, we tightened our underwriting box in auto to focus on the most resilient asset. We believe that several factors drove our growth. The auto market rebound has been stronger for larger franchise dealers, the part of the market where we're focused. 
Our digital products and services drove growth in direct-to-consumer originations and growth with dealers who want to provide a low-touch car buying experience in response to social distancing. And our dealer relationship strategy put us in a strong position to grow high-quality auto loans. Fourth quarter auto originations were down 2% year-over-year. Competition picked up late in the third quarter and continued to increase in the fourth quarter. 
Fourth quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $36.7 billion or 17% year-over-year driven by the stimulus-driven surge in deposits in the second quarter. Average deposits were up 19% for the fourth quarter and up 15% for the full year. Our average deposit interest rate decreased 73 basis points year-over-year and 19 basis points from the linked quarter as we reduced deposit pricing in response to the market interest rate environment and competitive dynamics. 
Fourth quarter Consumer Banking revenue increased 18% from the prior year quarter. Annual revenue was up 4%. Both increases were driven by growth in auto loans and retail deposits. Annual growth was negatively impacted by differences in the timing of Federal Reserve rate cuts, preceding our deposit pricing reduction. Noninterest expense in Consumer Banking was up 1% year-over-year. 
Fourth quarter provision for credit losses improved by $275 million year-over-year driven by lower charge-offs and a modest allowance release in our auto business. Fourth quarter credit results in our auto business remain unusually strong even after seasonal linked quarter increases in 24 basis points in the auto charge-off rate and 102 basis points in the delinquency rate. Year-over-year, the charge-off rate improved 143 basis points to 0.47% and the delinquency rate improved 210 basis points to 4.78%. Strong auto credit is the result of several factors. In addition to the same general drivers of Domestic Card credit strength, auto credit also benefited from very strong auction values. And our auto forbearance is having a temporary positive impact, particularly on delinquency rates. We've provided updated auto forbearance information on appendix Slide 18. We expect auto credit metrics to increase from their unusually low levels as auction prices normalize and the temporary impacts of COVID forbearance play out. 
Moving to Slide 13. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Fourth quarter ending loan balances were up 2% year-over-year driven by growth in selected C&I and CRE specialties. Average loans were also up 2% for the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. Quarterly average deposits increased 21% from the fourth quarter of 2019, and average -- annual average deposits grew to 14% in 2020 as middle market customers continued to bolster their liquidity. Fourth quarter revenue was up 10% from the prior year quarter. Annual revenue was up 6% for the year. Annual revenue growth from higher loan and deposit volumes and higher noninterest income was partially offset by lower net interest margin. Noninterest expense for the quarter increased by 1% year-over-year. 
Provision for credit losses improved by $90 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The allowance release that Scott discussed was partially offset by higher charge-offs largely related to our oil and gas portfolio. Our oil and gas exposure declined year-over-year. We've provided a breakout of our oil and gas portfolio composition and reserves on appendix Slide 19. 
The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate for the quarter was 0.45%. The criticized performing loan rate for the quarter increased compared to both the prior year and linked quarters to 9.5% driven by downgrades in our commercial real estate portfolio. The criticized nonperforming loan rate rose modestly from the prior year quarter to 0.9%. 
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and how we're positioned for the future. It's not a surprise that the pandemic shaped our 2020 results. For the full year, total company loan balances declined 5%. Annual revenue was essentially flat, including $535 million in gains on our Snowflake investment. Noninterest expense was down 3%, with a decline in marketing and relatively flat operating expense. Provision for credit losses increased by $4 billion. And earnings per share rebounded from negative territory early in the year to $5.18 for the full year, down significantly from 2019. 
Three key themes are evident in our 2020 results. The pandemic pressured top line loan balances and revenue, particularly in the first half of the year. On the bottom line, strikingly strong credit resulted in a return to positive trajectory and record profitability in the second half of the year. And our long-standing strategic choices put us in a strong position to respond to both the near-term challenges and the emerging opportunities. 
Turning first to the near-term challenges. Domestic Card loan balances declined sharply as cautious consumers, stimulus and widespread industry forbearance drove historically high payment rates and reduced demand. Lower loan balances put pressure on revenue, efficiency and scale. The operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments was 46%. It was 46.9%, excluding Snowflake gains. The flip side of this top line pressure was exceptionally strong consumer credit performance, which drove 2 consecutive quarters of record earnings in the second half of 2020. And strong second half earnings, coupled with a smaller balance sheet, enabled us to increase our CET1 ratio to 13.7%. Today, we've announced our intent to raise the quarterly dividend to its prior level of $0.40 per share subject to Board approval, and we've also discussed our plan -- we also discussed our plan for up to $7.5 billion of share repurchases, which our Board has already approved. 
Throughout 2020, we have been well served by the choices we made before the downturn began. Since our founding days, we've hardwired resilience into the choices we've made on credit, capital and liquidity through good times and bad. As a result, we entered the downturn with strong and resilient credit trends of fortified balance sheet and deep experience in successfully navigating through prior periods of stress, including the Great Recession. Our investments to transform our technology and how we work and our efforts to drive the company to digital are paying off. Our transformation is powering our response to the downturn and putting us in a strong position for emerging opportunities as the pandemic plays out. 
Pulling way up despite the pressures of the pandemic in the near term, nothing has changed about where we think our businesses are headed or the long-term strategic opportunities that are being created as sweeping digital change continues to transform banking. As we manage through the near-term challenges, we also continue to focus on the things that create long-term value when delivered and sustained over time, continuing to transform our technology from the ground up, capitalizing on our transformation to drive innovation and growth, generating positive operating leverage and improving efficiency, and managing capital efficiently and effectively, including significant capital distribution. 
And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

It's been honestly just a privilege to be at this company, and it's certainly a tough place to leave, but let me turn to your question. In terms of the allowance, you're right that when you look at our coverage levels versus our current level of losses and delinquencies, there's a big gap. And I would just point out that, that is -- because right now, our allowance is built to absorb a very wide range of outcomes, which gives sense -- which is sensible, given kind of the circumstances that we are in at the moment. And so I think that the biggest driver of where the allowance might go and what might drive our leases is, frankly, just certainty. And narrowing down the range of possible outcomes, I think, could come from things like macroeconomic factors like unemployment or pandemic-specific variables like broader rollouts of the vaccine, reduced restrictions on people's movements and activities and things like that. So to me, it feels like that certainty is more likely to happen over time versus a step function. So I think we'll see the allowance kind of play out in measured ways over time."

As you know, this is -- while there are certain things that are sort of fixed -- mostly fixed about our marketing expenditures, a lot of it is based on real-time assessment of prospects for resilient growth in the competitive marketplace. 
But let me just kind of pull up and talk about our journey this year with respect to marketing. We pulled back early in the crisis but have since increased marketing spend, as you saw in Q4. And as expected, the increase from Q3 was meaningfully higher than typical seasonal patterns. Right now, we are seeing opportunities to invest. We continue to invest in our brand and our national banking strategy. And in our card business, we're leaning in where we see signs of strength. And we feel pretty good about our origination opportunities, and these are enhanced by our tech transformation as well. So we're keeping a very watchful eye on the marketplace, but we do see opportunities, and we're investing in them. 
And with respect to efficiency, we still believe that we're on the path to achieve the efficiency targets that we had set -- that we had talked about in prior years driven by growth and digital productivity gains really enabled by our tech transformation. 
The pandemic has really impacted the timing of when we get there, particularly on revenue growth. Now we feel good about our current revenue trajectory, and we're still on the same efficiency journey, but how the pandemic and the recession will play out remain uncertain and how the growth opportunity unfolds. And also the sort of the great credit paradox with the strength of credit also comes the high payment rates, which, certainly, it's a great thing for the overall financial performance of the company, but it's another thing that holds back the growth. So we're leaning in to really -- in the growth opportunities, but -- and we're on the same kind of -- heading to the same destinations we talked about before, but we're not giving guidance about the timing."

In the first quarter, we'll be limited to $500 million. I mentioned that based on the Fed rules.

And one thing that's been so striking about banking products and even banking products relative to credit card products is the stickiness and the inertia inherent in the customer relationships that have existed sometimes for many decades. And so one of the challenges for any digital bank is how do you go after that inertia and create something compelling enough to cause people to switch. And so it's really nice being on, in a sense, the right side of history because we can see the direction things go. What I'm struck by is the amount of acceleration that we've seen in these inevitable trends this year. So that's a good thing for us, and we want to capitalize on that. 
Now the other -- along the way, not surprisingly, we've seen the rise of some very intriguing banking fintechs. And we watch with great interest their strategies. In many cases, they have very nice digital customer experiences. In some cases, they have created strategies that the banking industry didn't come up with. And we look with interest in that and, in many ways, root for their success because it's all part of the same -- their success is a manifestation also of the accelerating change in customer behavior and the opportunity for digital banks. So we have a lot of respect for some of the players. We're impressed by their innovation, and we're energized by their success and the success that we're having. And so as a result, we're leaning in -- continuing to lean in and leaning in a little harder on our own banking strategy."

And I have a lot of respect for and I'm impressed by some of the things -- the success of the point-of-sale lending products. And point-of-sale lending has, of course, existed since really the beginning of lending itself. I think what's striking here is the way that it exists, of course, in the e-commerce space, the way it's got shelf space right there on the -- at the checkout page, the -- some of the elegance of the digital technology, and interestingly, right now, sort of financially how this marketplace works because the striking thing to me is that right now, merchants are actually paying the bill as opposed to consumers. And that tends to create a healthy marketplace. It tends to create better selection dynamics. Then very often, you see in some of these short-term lending products, they tend to have very high effective APRs and things that can sometimes lead to adverse selection. So I think to me, the thing that I'm most interested in watching from sort of the structure of that marketplace is what happens to the, in a sense, the merchant discount with respect to those products as the competition from lenders heats up in that space. So that's something we'll have to watch. So I think there's a lot for Capital One to learn in this marketplace, and we're watching it closely. And we really, with interest, look to see how this opportunity evolves."

Or is there more from the digital transformation on the cost side? And if cost is part of it, can you maybe just talk about what some of those drivers are and what the timing is in terms of us getting there?"

So Ryan, if -- the efficiency -- our journey and the success we had over a number of years really until the pandemic sort of set things back a bit was driven to kind of mathematically, of course, by the 2 factors: sustained revenue growth and the efficiencies that were coming particularly from transforming to a more digital operating model. And I think the same things that drove our efficiency ratio down over the years are going to be the same drivers going forward. 
When -- at the time that we gave the guidance on 42%, we were -- there were a lot of things coming together that not only on the efficiency side, things like getting out of data centers, things like the step-up that in the Walmart revenue sharing relationship. But very much, we were looking at accelerating growth opportunities in our businesses, particularly our consumer businesses. So the pandemic set that back. And so the -- I would still say the biggest driver of the efficiency gains that we will continue to work toward will be on the revenue side because we still continue to invest in the digital opportunities that are, in fact, enabling the revenue growth. 
And one thing that we've talked about is that we -- we're now finished with our eighth year of our tech transformation. And in many ways, this will be a lifelong transformation, but we -- this has been a -- starting at the bottom of the tech stack journey. And over time, we've been working our way up the tech stack. And the more we get up the tech stack, the more the opportunities are things that, well, actually, the world can see, things that customers can experience and things that can more directly enable growth. And that's why I mentioned on my comments about marketing is that some of the marketing opportunities we see are, in fact, specifically enabled by our tech transformation. So therefore, while tech continues to create efficiency opportunities, it is also the basis for a number of our growth opportunities, and we really want to take advantage of those. We're leaning in. And of course, it takes investment to do that. So that's why I think growth -- revenue growth is -- I would expect it to still be the bigger driver of our efficiency journey on a net basis than on the cost side. But really, the key is having revenue growth that exceeds the growth in expenses, of course."

Well, thank you, Moshe. The -- with our strategy of relatively lower lines, we've often talked about how, in many ways, the primary credit risk and the primary growth comes really on the line increase side more so than just the originations themselves. And so what we have often done in times of stress or when there's extra caution, and you will remember, Moshe, in probably 18 months prior to this downturn, maybe 2 years, we were also talking cautiously about lines because we said we are so long in the tooth on this economy. And so that has been our strategy for managing risk is to try to hold the lines down where we can continue to lean into the origination side of the business and then open up the lines as we see more of the sun coming out and more opportunity at one customer at a time. So where we stand on that, we've been particularly tight on the lines during this downturn. But I think that as we watch the pandemic play out, I think that we see opportunities one customer at a time. But collectively, pulling up on this, we do see important opportunities for increasing those lines. And as we do that, that can put some momentum around the loan growth in a way that you don't just get from originations, which we're also leaning into."

It's a really interesting question, Moshe, whether rewards rates -- whether a downturn causes reward rates to go down or up. So the case for down, in other words, for people -- for the competition to get less intense about that is that people are pulling back, they're spending less, and they're more concerned about riding through the downturn than they are about trying to grow quite a bit. 
Here's the flip side to that argument and the thing that I think is dominating in that particular tug of war. And that is that what is most striking about the pullback, probably true in any downturn, but especially in this one, is how much the spending -- how much pullback there has been in spending and what a pullback there has been in spending by heavy spenders. And I think that not just a point about heavy spenders. It's partly what heavy spenders spend their money on, which is travel and entertainment on a disproportional basis relative to others, and those are the sectors that have been absolutely lacked here. 
So it's generally the case that the heavy spenders from a credit point of view, everything that we have seen would be consistent that they perform well in a downturn. They just get more conservative in their spending. Travel opportunities and things like that don't necessarily look so enticing, and certainly, the case in this downturn. And so I think what happens is a response from players to lean into increasing inducement to generate the volumes that people want to get. We have seen significant increases in upfront bonuses. We've seen increases in reward levels. And I think that's probably a natural thing for us to expect in this particular environment, even though paradoxically, it's associated with so much pullback."

My question is just on how to think about the reserve levels and the reserve release from here. And I know the questions asked a little bit, but the reason I'm raising it is I think you said that your reserve today is based on an unemployment rate of 8% at 2021. I know there's a lot more inputs than just that, but that's -- that 8% at year-end '21 is similar to last quarter's. Yet at the same time, I know, Rich, you mentioned that every quarter that goes by with good credit is like a reduction of peak, if not a pushout. So how should I triangulate that? Should we be anticipating really more aggressive reserve releases as the quarters come through that are not so bad? Or is there something else going on in the reserving analysis that we should be thinking about?"

So look, I think that the -- as I mentioned a couple of times, I think the biggest consideration in our reserve right now is just the uncertainty and trying to make sure that we're capturing all of the scenarios in thinking about that. And that is resulting in us having a really high level of qualitative reserves on top of our modeled risk. And so even in the current quarter where, you're right, our 2010 fourth quarter estimate of unemployment at around 8% is consistent with where we were last quarter. During the full year, we're expecting lower levels of unemployment than what we had forecasted or used in our allowance a quarter ago. And so that, coupled with -- we saw the passage of stimulus, were both factors that drove the release this quarter. But we still have -- even with the positive trends, we put on even more qualitative factors because it's just really hard to forecast where this thing is going to go and how it may play out. And we're -- in the allowance, we continue to expect that we will see the very low levels of credit come up and meet the high levels of unemployment that we see today. And I really do believe that we will, over time, see that play out exactly how that relationship is going to normalize. And if it doesn't normalize, then we're going to have allowance releases, and they're going to come in over time. But until we start to see kind of more evidence that, that relationship is going to stay kind of at the levels where it is, I would expect that we're going to continue to reserve against a variety of downside scenarios."

Bob, we don't break out our tech investments, but Capital One, I think, relative to banks our size invest quite a bit more in technology than my sense is of what other banks our size invest in. By the way, our primary competitive set is the big national banks, and they have [indiscernible] tech budgets. So we don't -- we certainly know also what we're up against. But let me just talk about again so philosophically what we've done. Look, I think when most banks -- I think companies, in general, when they're looking -- everybody knows they've got to invest more in technology. And even as recently as this quarter, so many companies said they're increasing their technology spend. And I almost can't imagine companies not feeling the need to do that as they face an accelerating digital revolution. The thing that's very common that companies do is they make their biggest investments at the top of the tech stack, meaning the things that are closest to the consumer, investing in apps, investing in experiences for customers or associates or things that can more directly and immediately manifest in improvements, and there's no -- it's a very natural thing to do. Capital One has taken the unlikely journey. The -- a little bit the road less traveled by to have our investment primarily at the bottom of the tech stack. So we're talking down at core systems and data and addressing vendor products and their role in this thing, bringing lots of things in house, bringing a lot of engineering in house. And it's been a journey that -- and you know this, Bob, and other investors on this call know that they would often say, I know you're investing a lot. You're talking about it, but I can't see it. Because the problem is if you were to improve one system in the core systems, it doesn't really manifest itself in something that the outside world can see. And this is really the essence of the challenge that we and our investors who have patiently owned our stock of this journey that we're going through. 
What we so deeply believe at the outset of this journey and absolutely believe now that in order to compete with the tech companies, in order to be a modern company and be able to go where banking is going to go is one really needs a modern tech stack. And that's a hard thing for a startup bank to build. It's a really hard thing for a legacy company to build. Now I think it was a little easier for Capital One, only that we were in a sense, an original fintech 3 decades ago, and so maybe don't have as much legacy as a lot of companies do, but it's still been a very significant journey. 
So -- but I think when you say how do we compare ourselves with other companies, I think other companies have. I think there's a lot of good things other companies that go and they are doing. They have really nice apps for their customers and everything else. But I think more and more Capital One is built like a tech company and like some of the leading tech companies that are changing the world. And I think it was a little bit of a shock to some folks when 1 day we said, by the way, we're getting entirely out of data centers and into the cloud. And that's the kind of thing that could only come as a product of many years of this. And it's not an accident that almost no big enterprise legacy companies have, in fact, made that journey. 
Now where does -- but what it puts us in a position to do is that -- is to drive for opportunities and act more and more like a tech company and be able to be more dynamic, faster to the market, create -- offer better products, a better customer experience. And that gives us the opportunity to transform how we work, really how a bank works on the inside from risk management, fraud, credit, compliance, operational execution. It enables us to build our national bank and lean into that. It enables us to win some partnerships that -- in head-to-head competition. We -- I feel that we won by virtue of the -- some of the tech capabilities we had. It enables us to achieve better economics and not so much in saving on -- well, partly tech on tech costs like massive vendor costs that we can save. But at the same time, we're investing a lot in tech so that the big net saving is not so much tech costs as it is the opportunity to reduce analog costs over time. 
So that's kind of a long answer to your question. But when we look out and said, over time, we're going to want to do that or we're going to want to do this thing over there or we're going to do that thing over there, in each case, we saw a shared path of investment and transformation that we would need to do. And we're well down that path. We are not done. In many ways, it's a lifelong journey. But I think our opportunities are increasing as we get further down this path."

I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation.  In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $2.6 billion or $5.35 per common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $2.7 billion or $5.18 per share. Includ",679,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation.  
In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $2.6 billion or $5.35 per common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $2.7 billion or $5.18 per share. Included in EPS for the quarter were 2 small adjusting items, which are outlined on the slide. Net of these adjusting items, earnings per share for the quarter was $5.29. Full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $5.79. In addition to the adjusting items in the quarter, we recorded an equity investment gain of $60 million or $0.10 per share related to our equity stake in Snowflake. For the full year, the investment gain was $535 million or around $0.89 per share.  
Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail. In the fourth quarter, we released $593 million of allowance, primarily in our card business. Economic assumptions underlying our allowance included unemployment of around 8% at the end of 2021 and the impacts of the $900 billion stimulus package passed in December. The release was driven by the strong credit performance we have observed and by the new stimulus bill.  
In our allowance, we continue to assume that the relationship between the economic metrics and credit quickly reverts to a historical norm, and we've added significant additional qualitative factors for COVID-related uncertainty.  
In our commercial business, we charged off certain energy loans and released allowance for these specific reserves that were previously established for those loans.  
Turning to Slide 5. You can see the allowance coverage levels declined modestly from the prior quarters across our segments but remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Our Domestic Card coverage is now at 10.8%, while our branded card portfolio coverage is 12.7%. Recall that the difference between these metrics is driven by loss-sharing agreements in our partnership portfolios. Coverage in our consumer and commercial businesses also remained elevated at 3.9% and 2.2%, respectively.  
Moving to Slide 6, I'll discuss our liquidity position. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 145%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Our liquidity reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity declined slightly from the third quarter to end the year at approximately $144 billion, including about $41 billion in cash driven by continued strong deposits.  
Turning to Slide 7. You can see that our net interest margin increased 37 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 6.05%. The increase was largely driven by higher card loan revenue margin as strong credit results led to lower suppression, the impact of third and fourth quarter deposit pricing actions and a modest decline in our cash balance, which was partially offset by lower yields on cash and securities.  
Lastly, turning to Slide 8. I will cover our capital position. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.7% at the end of the fourth quarter, up 70 basis points from the third quarter and 150 basis points higher than a year ago. We continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%, which includes a buffer over our capital requirements under the SCB framework of 10.1%. As we close out 2020, we have approximately 270 basis points or around $8 billion of capital in excess of our CET1 target.  
Following the latest stress test results released by the Federal Reserve last month and in light of the strong capital position I just described, we expect to restore our quarterly dividend back to $0.40 per share in the first quarter, pending Board approval. Our Board of Directors has also authorized the repurchase of up to $7.5 billion of the company's common stock inclusive of share repurchase capacity of up to approximately $500 million in the first quarter based on the Fed's current trailing 4-quarter average earnings rule. The timing and amount of stock repurchase activity will be informed by our outlook on the economy as well as actual forecasted levels of capital, earnings and growth.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich."

As I think everyone on this call knows, Scott shared with me in November that he would be leaving Capital One to join a tech startup. While he will be here through March 15, this will be Scott's last earnings call. So I want to take a moment and thank you, Scott, for giving so much of your life to Capital One over this past decade, including the last 5 years as our CFO. You've built strong relationships with our shareholders and across the investment community, and you've always brought their external perspectives to our work inside of Capital One. You've been a key adviser and partner for me and for the Board and a strong leader in our company. I'm particularly grateful for the legacy you've built, transforming finance technology, strengthening processes and controls, building a great team of talented leaders, including your successor, Andrew Young. We will miss you, and I'm sure you will continue to do great things.  
With that, let me turn to our Domestic Card business. Exceptional credit performance was the biggest driver of Domestic Card financial results in the quarter. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.69%, a 163 basis point improvement year-over-year and a 95 basis point improvement from the sequential quarter. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.42%, 151 basis points better than the prior year. The delinquency rate was up 21 basis points from the linked quarter, consistent with typical seasonal patterns. Fourth quarter provision for credit losses improved by $1.1 billion year-over-year, driven by the allowance release that Scott discussed and lower charge-offs.  
Several factors are driving continued credit strength. Consumers are behaving cautiously, spending less, saving more and paying down debt. These behaviors have been amplified by the cumulative effect of unusually large government stimulus and widespread forbearance across the banking industry. Our own longstanding resilience choices put us in a strong position going into the pandemic. And our strategic investments in digital technology and transformation are paying off in enhanced capabilities and underwriting that are powering our performance and response to the pandemic.  
Strikingly strong consumer credit has persisted throughout 2020, even after the expiration of several parts of the CARES Act. Uncertainty about future credit trends remains high, especially in the context of an evolving pandemic that is difficult to predict. As Scott discussed, that uncertainty informs our allowance for credit loss. We believe that each incremental month of favorable credit reduces the cumulative losses through the downturn rather than just delaying the impact.  
At the end of the fourth quarter, Domestic Card ending loan balances were down $20.1 billion or 17% year-over-year, driven by 3 factors: cautious consumer behavior, reduced spending and demand for new credit, and drove payment rates to historically high levels. Our marketing pullbacks at the outset of the downturn put additional pressure on loan balances, and we moved a partnership portfolio to held-for-sale in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the move to held-for-sale, ending loans declined about 15%. Fourth quarter average loans declined 16% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the expected seasonal ramp drove ending loans up by about 3%.  
Purchase volume continued to rebound from the sharp declines early in the pandemic. For the full year, purchase volume was down 2% in 2020. Fourth quarter purchase volume was essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter. That compares to a year-over-year decline of about 30% in the first weeks of the pandemic. Quarterly purchase volume increased 10% from the sequential quarter, consistent with the expected seasonality and the continued rebound. Despite the rebound, purchase volume growth is still down compared to the double-digit growth we were seeing before the pandemic.  
Fourth quarter revenue declined 7% year-over-year as a result of the decrease in average loans, partially offset by higher revenue margin. The revenue margin was up 121 basis points year-over-year to 16.91%, largely driven by 2 factors: strong credit drove lower revenue suppression; and year-over-year, net interchange revenue in the numerator of the margin is essentially flat, while average loan balances, the denominator of the margin calculation, are down 16%.  
Noninterest expense was down $186 million or 8% from the fourth quarter of last year, largely driven by our choice to pull back on Domestic Card marketing when the pandemic hit. Total company marketing trends are largely driven by Domestic Card. Fourth quarter marketing for the total company was down 21% year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, total company marketing increased significantly in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, future marketing will be impacted by how things play out with the pandemic and the economy. In the midst of the pandemic, we're finding opportunities, and we are leaning into them. These opportunities are enhanced by our tech transformation. The ultimate level of our 2021 marketing will depend on our continuing real-time assessment of the marketplace.  
Slide 12 summarizes fourth quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Driven by our auto business, ending loans increased 9% year-over-year. Average loans grew 10% for the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year.  
When the COVID downturn began, we tightened our underwriting box in auto to focus on the most resilient asset. We believe that several factors drove our growth. The auto market rebound has been stronger for larger franchise dealers, the part of the market where we're focused.  
Our digital products and services drove growth in direct-to-consumer originations and growth with dealers who want to provide a low-touch car buying experience in response to social distancing. And our dealer relationship strategy put us in a strong position to grow high-quality auto loans. Fourth quarter auto originations were down 2% year-over-year. Competition picked up late in the third quarter and continued to increase in the fourth quarter.  
Fourth quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $36.7 billion or 17% year-over-year, driven by the stimulus-driven surge in deposits in the second quarter. Average deposits were up 19% for the fourth quarter and up 15% for the full year. Our average deposit interest rate decreased 73 basis points year-over-year and 19 basis points from the linked quarter as we reduced deposit pricing in response to the market interest rate environment and competitive dynamics.  
Fourth quarter Consumer Banking revenue increased 18% from the prior year quarter. Annual revenue was up 4%. Both increases were driven by growth in auto loans and retail deposits. Annual growth was negatively impacted by differences in the timing of Federal Reserve rate cuts, preceding our deposit pricing reduction. Noninterest expense in Consumer Banking was up 1% year-over-year.  
Fourth quarter provision for credit losses improved by $275 million year-over-year, driven by lower charge-offs and a modest allowance release in our auto business. Fourth quarter credit results in our auto business remain unusually strong even after seasonal linked quarter increases in 24 basis points in the auto charge-off rate and 102 basis points in the delinquency rate. Year-over-year, the charge-off rate improved 143 basis points to 0.47% and the delinquency rate improved 210 basis points to 4.78%. Strong auto credit is the result of several factors. In addition to the same general drivers of Domestic Card credit strength, auto credit also benefited from very strong auction values. And our auto forbearance is having a temporary positive impact, particularly on delinquency rates. We've provided updated auto forbearance information on appendix Slide 18. We expect auto credit metrics to increase from their unusually low levels as auction prices normalize and the temporary impacts of COVID forbearance play out.  
Moving to Slide 13. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Fourth quarter ending loan balances were up 2% year-over-year, driven by growth in selected C&I and CRE specialties. Average loans were also up 2% for the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. Quarterly average deposits increased 21% from the fourth quarter of 2019, and average -- annual average deposits grew 14% in 2020 as middle market customers continued to bolster their liquidity. Fourth quarter revenue was up 10% from the prior year quarter. Annual revenue was up 6% for the year. Annual revenue growth from higher loan and deposit volumes and higher noninterest income was partially offset by lower net interest margin. Noninterest expense for the quarter increased by 1% year-over-year.  
Provision for credit losses improved by $90 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The allowance release that Scott discussed was partially offset by higher charge-offs largely related to our oil and gas portfolio. Our oil and gas exposure declined year-over-year. We've provided a breakout of our oil and gas portfolio composition and reserves on appendix Slide 19.  
The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate for the quarter was 0.45%. The criticized performing loan rate for the quarter increased compared to both the prior year and linked quarters to 9.5%, driven by downgrades in our commercial real estate portfolio. The criticized nonperforming loan rate rose modestly from the prior year quarter to 0.9%.  
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and how we're positioned for the future. It's not a surprise that the pandemic shaped our 2020 results. For the full year, total company loan balances declined 5%. Annual revenue was essentially flat, including $535 million in gains on our Snowflake investment. Noninterest expense was down 3%, with a decline in marketing and relatively flat operating expense. Provision for credit losses increased by $4 billion. And earnings per share rebounded from negative territory early in the year to $5.18 for the full year, down significantly from 2019.  
Three key themes are evident in our 2020 results. The pandemic pressured top line loan balances and revenue, particularly in the first half of the year. On the bottom line, strikingly strong credit resulted in a return to positive trajectory and record profitability in the second half of the year. And our longstanding strategic choices put us in a strong position to respond to both the near-term challenges and the emerging opportunities.  
Turning first to the near-term challenges. Domestic Card loan balances declined sharply as cautious consumers, stimulus and widespread industry forbearance drove historically high payment rates and reduced demand. Lower loan balances put pressure on revenue, efficiency and scale. The operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments was 46%. It was 46.9%, excluding Snowflake gains. The flip side of this top line pressure was exceptionally strong consumer credit performance, which drove 2 consecutive quarters of record earnings in the second half of 2020. And strong second half earnings, coupled with a smaller balance sheet, enabled us to increase our CET1 ratio to 13.7%. Today, we've announced our intent to raise the quarterly dividend to its prior level of $0.40 per share subject to Board approval, and we've also discussed our plan -- we also discussed our plan for up to $7.5 billion of share repurchases, which our Board has already approved.  
Throughout 2020, we have been well served by the choices we made before the downturn began. Since our founding days, we've hardwired resilience into the choices we've made on credit, capital and liquidity through good times and bad. As a result, we entered the downturn with strong and resilient credit trends, a fortified balance sheet and deep experience in successfully navigating through prior periods of stress, including the Great Recession. Our investments to transform our technology and how we work and our efforts to drive the company to digital are paying off. Our transformation is powering our response to the downturn and putting us in a strong position for emerging opportunities as the pandemic plays out.  
Pulling way up despite the pressures of the pandemic in the near term, nothing has changed about where we think our businesses are headed or the long-term strategic opportunities that are being created as sweeping digital change continues to transform banking. As we manage through the near-term challenges, we also continue to focus on the things that create long-term value when delivered and sustained over time, continuing to transform our technology from the ground up, capitalizing on our transformation to drive innovation and growth, generating positive operating leverage and improving efficiency, and managing capital efficiently and effectively, including significant capital distribution.  
And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

In terms of the allowance, you're right that when you look at our coverage levels versus our current level of losses and delinquencies, there's a big gap. And I would just point out that, that is because right now, our allowance is built to absorb a very wide range of outcomes, which gives sense -- which is sensible, given kind of the circumstances that we are in at the moment. And so I think that the biggest driver of where the allowance might go and what might drive our leases is, frankly, just certainty. And narrowing down the range of possible outcomes, I think, could come from things like macroeconomic factors like unemployment or pandemic-specific variables like broader rollouts of the vaccine, reduced restrictions on people's movements and activities and things like that. So to me, it feels like that certainty is more likely to happen over time versus a step function. So I think we'll see the allowance kind of play out in measured ways over time."

As you know, this is -- while there are certain things that are sort of fixed -- mostly fixed about our marketing expenditures, a lot of it is based on real-time assessment of prospects for resilient growth in the competitive marketplace. 
But let me just kind of pull up and talk about our journey this year with respect to marketing. We pulled back early in the crisis but have since increased marketing spend, as you saw in Q4. And as expected, the increase from Q3 was meaningfully higher than typical seasonal patterns. Right now, we are seeing opportunities to invest. We continue to invest in our brand and our national banking strategy. And in our card business, we're leaning in where we see signs of strength. And we feel pretty good about our origination opportunities, and these are enhanced by our tech transformation as well. So we're keeping a very watchful eye on the marketplace, but we do see opportunities, and we're investing in them. 
And with respect to efficiency, we still believe that we're on the path to achieve the efficiency targets that we had set -- that we had talked about in prior years, driven by growth and digital productivity gains and really enabled by our tech transformation. 
The pandemic has really impacted the timing of when we get there, particularly on revenue growth. Now we feel good about our current revenue trajectory, and we're still on the same efficiency journey, but how the pandemic and the recession will play out remain uncertain and how the growth opportunity unfolds. And also the sort of the great credit paradox with the strength of credit also comes the high payment rates, which, certainly, it's a great thing for the overall financial performance of the company, but it's another thing that holds back the growth. So we're leaning in to really -- in the growth opportunities, but -- and we're on the same kind of -- heading to the same destinations we talked about before, but we're not giving guidance about the timing."

So let's, and first of all, talk about the pandemic. I don't think the pandemic changed much about the destination of banking, but it changed the timing of that because it accelerated the digital journey. And one thing that's been so striking about banking products and even banking products relative to credit card products is the stickiness and the inertia inherent in the customer relationships that have existed sometimes for many decades. And so one of the challenges for any digital bank is how do you go after that inertia and create something compelling enough to cause people to switch. And so it's really nice being on, in a sense, the right side of history because we can see the direction things go. What I'm struck by is the amount of acceleration that we've seen in these inevitable trends this year. So that's a good thing for us, and we want to capitalize on that. 
Now the other -- along the way, not surprisingly, we've seen the rise of some very intriguing banking fintechs. And we watch with great interest their strategies. In many cases, they have very nice digital customer experiences. In some cases, they have created strategies that the banking industry didn't come up with. And we look with interest in that and, in many ways, root for their success because it's all part of the same -- their success is a manifestation also of the accelerating change in customer behavior and the opportunity for digital banks. So we have a lot of respect for some of the players. We're impressed by their innovation, and we're energized by their success and the success that we're having. And so as a result, we're leaning in -- continuing to lean in and leaning in a little harder on our own banking strategy."

It's kind of ironic because the original buy now, pay later product was the credit card. And so it's interesting to be a very established credit card player and feel a little bit like the old guard is we're watching these innovations on buy-now-pay-later. And I have a lot of respect for and I'm impressed by some of the things -- the success of the point-of-sale lending products. And point-of-sale lending has, of course, existed since really the beginning of lending itself. 
I think what's striking here is the way that it exists, of course, in the e-commerce space, the way it's got shelf space right there on -- at the checkout page, the -- some of the elegance of the digital technology, and interestingly, right now, sort of financially how this marketplace works because the striking thing to me is that right now, merchants are actually paying the bill as opposed to consumers. And that tends to create a healthy marketplace. It tends to create better selection dynamics. Then very often, you see in some of these short-term lending products, they tend to have very high effective APRs and things that can sometimes lead to adverse selection. So I think to me, the thing that I'm most interested in watching from sort of the structure of that marketplace is what happens to the, in a sense, the merchant discount with respect to those products as the competition from lenders heats up in that space. So that's something we'll have to watch. So I think there's a lot for Capital One to learn in this marketplace, and we're watching it closely. And we really, with interest, look to see how this opportunity evolves."

So Ryan, if -- the efficiency -- our journey and the success we had over a number of years really until the pandemic sort of set things back a bit was driven kind of mathematically, of course, by the 2 factors: sustained revenue growth and the efficiencies that were coming particularly from transforming to a more digital operating model. And I think the same things that drove our efficiency ratio down over the years are going to be the same drivers going forward. 
When -- at the time that we gave the guidance on 42%, we were -- there were a lot of things coming together that not only on the efficiency side, things like getting out of data centers, things like the step-up that in the Walmart revenue sharing relationship, but very much, we were looking at accelerating growth opportunities in our businesses, particularly our consumer businesses. So the pandemic set that back. And so the -- I would still say the biggest driver of the efficiency gains that we will continue to work toward will be on the revenue side because we still continue to invest in the digital opportunities that are, in fact, enabling the revenue growth. 
And one thing that we've talked about is that we -- we're now finished with our eighth year of our tech transformation. And in many ways, this will be a lifelong transformation, but we -- this has been a -- starting at the bottom of the tech stack journey. And over time, we've been working our way up the tech stack. And the more we get up the tech stack, the more the opportunities are things that, well, actually, the world can see, things that customers can experience and things that can more directly enable growth. And that's why I mentioned on my comments about marketing is that some of the marketing opportunities we see are, in fact, specifically enabled by our tech transformation. So therefore, while tech continues to create efficiency opportunities, it is also the basis for a number of our growth opportunities, and we really want to take advantage of those. We're leaning in. And of course, it takes investment to do that. So that's why I think growth -- revenue growth is -- I would expect it to still be the bigger driver of our efficiency journey on a net basis than on the cost side. But really, the key is having revenue growth that exceeds the growth in expenses, of course."

Well, thank you, Moshe. The -- with our strategy of relatively lower lines, we've often talked about how, in many ways, the primary credit risk and the primary growth comes really on the line increase side more so than just the originations themselves. And so what we have often done in times of stress or when there's extra caution, and you will remember, Moshe, in probably 18 months prior to this downturn, maybe 2 years, we were also talking cautiously about lines because we said we are so long in the tooth on this economy. 
And so that has been our strategy for managing risk is to try to hold the lines down where we can continue to lean into the origination side of the business and then open up the lines as we see more of the sun coming out and more opportunity at one customer at a time. So where we stand on that, we've been particularly tight on the lines during this downturn. But I think that as we watch the pandemic play out, I think that we see opportunities one customer at a time. But collectively, pulling up on this, we do see important opportunities for increasing those lines. And as we do that, that can put some momentum around the loan growth in a way that you don't just get from originations, which we're also leaning into."

It's a really interesting question, Moshe, whether rewards rates -- whether a downturn causes reward rates to go down or up. So the case for down, in other words, for people -- for the competition to get less intense about that is that people are pulling back, they're spending less, and they're more concerned about riding through the downturn than they are about trying to grow quite a bit. 
Here's the flip side to that argument and the thing that I think is dominating in that particular tug-of-war. And that is that what is most striking about the pullback, probably true in any downturn, but especially in this one, is how much the spending -- how much pullback there has been in spending and what a pullback there has been in spending by heavy spenders. And I think that's not just a point about heavy spenders. It's partly what heavy spenders spend their money on, which is travel and entertainment on a disproportional basis relative to others, and those are the sectors that have been absolutely flacked here. 
So it's generally the case that the heavy spenders from a credit point of view, everything that we have seen would be consistent that they perform well in a downturn. They just get more conservative in their spending. Travel opportunities and things like that don't necessarily look so enticing, and certainly, the case in this downturn. And so I think what happens is a response from players to lean into increasing inducement to generate the volumes that people want to get. We have seen significant increases in upfront bonuses. We've seen increases in reward levels. And I think that's probably a natural thing for us to expect in this particular environment, even though paradoxically, it's associated with so much pullback."

My question is just on how to think about the reserve levels and the reserve release from here. And I know the questions ask a little bit, but the reason I'm raising it is I think you said that your reserve today is based on an unemployment rate of 8% at 2021. I know there's a lot more inputs than just that, but that's -- that 8% at year-end '21 is similar to last quarter's. Yet at the same time, I know, Rich, you mentioned that every quarter that goes by with good credit is like a reduction of peak, if not a pushout. So how should I triangulate that? Should we be anticipating really more aggressive reserve releases as the quarters come through that are not so bad? Or is there something else going on in the reserving analysis that we should be thinking about?"

So look, I think that the -- as I mentioned a couple of times, I think the biggest consideration in our reserve right now is just the uncertainty and trying to make sure that we're capturing all of the scenarios in thinking about that. And that is resulting in us having a really high level of qualitative reserves on top of our modeled risk. And so even in the current quarter where, you're right, our 2010 fourth quarter estimate of unemployment at around 8% is consistent with where we were last quarter. 
During the full year, we're expecting lower levels of unemployment than what we had forecasted or used in our allowance a quarter ago. And so that, coupled with -- we saw the passage of stimulus, were both factors that drove the release this quarter. But we still have -- even with the positive trends, we put on even more qualitative factors because it's just really hard to forecast where this thing is going to go and how it may play out. And we're -- in the allowance, we continue to expect that we will see the very low levels of credit come up and meet the high levels of unemployment that we see today. 
And I really do believe that we will, over time, see that play out exactly how that relationship is going to normalize. And if it doesn't normalize, then we're going to have allowance releases, and they're going to come in over time. But until we start to see kind of more evidence that, that relationship is going to stay kind of at the levels where it is, I would expect that we're going to continue to reserve against a variety of downside scenarios."

Bob, we don't break out our tech investments, but Capital One, I think, relative to banks our size, invests quite a bit more in technology than my sense is of what other banks our size invest in. By the way, our primary competitive set is the big national banks, and they have jacked-up tech budgets. So we don't -- we certainly know also what we're up against. But let me just talk about again, so philosophically, what we've done. 
Look, I think when most banks -- I think companies, in general, when they're looking -- everybody knows they've got to invest more in technology. And even as recently as this quarter, so many companies said they're increasing their technology spend. And I almost can't imagine companies not feeling the need to do that as they face an accelerating digital revolution. The thing that's very common that companies do is they make their biggest investments at the top of the tech stack, meaning the things that are closest to the consumer, investing in apps, investing in experiences for customers or associates or things that can more directly and immediately manifest in improvements, and there's no -- it's a very natural thing to do. 
Capital One has taken the unlikely journey, the -- a little bit the road less traveled by to have our investment primarily at the bottom of the tech stack. So we're talking down at core systems and data and addressing vendor products and their role in this thing, bringing lots of things in-house, bringing a lot of engineering in-house. And it's been a journey that -- and you know this, Bob, and other investors on this call know that they would often say, I know you're investing a lot. You're talking about it, but I can't see it. Because the problem is if you were to improve one system in the core systems, it doesn't really manifest itself in something that the outside world can see. And this is really the essence of the challenge that we and our investors who have patiently owned our stock of this journey that we're going through. 
What we so deeply believe at the outset of this journey and absolutely believe now that in order to compete with the tech companies, in order to be a modern company and be able to go where banking is going to go is one really needs a modern tech stack. And that's a hard thing for a startup bank to build. It's a really hard thing for a legacy company to build. Now I think it was a little easier for Capital One, only that we were in a sense, an original fintech 3 decades ago, and so maybe don't have as much legacy as a lot of companies do, but it's still been a very significant journey. 
So -- but I think when you say how do we compare ourselves with other companies, I think other companies have. I think there's a lot of good things other companies that go, and they are doing. They have really nice apps for their customers and everything else. But I think more and more Capital One is built like a tech company and like some of the leading tech companies that are changing the world. And I think it was a little bit of a shock to some folks when one day we said, by the way, we're getting entirely out of data centers and into the cloud. And that's the kind of thing that could only come as a product of many years of this. And it's not an accident that almost no big enterprise legacy companies have, in fact, made that journey. 
Now where does -- but what it puts us in a position to do is that -- is to drive for opportunities and act more and more like a tech company and be able to be more dynamic, faster to the market, create -- offer better products, a better customer experience. And that gives us the opportunity to transform how we work, really how a bank works on the inside from risk management, fraud, credit, compliance, operational execution. It enables us to build our national bank and lean into that. It enables us to win some partnerships that -- in head-to-head competition. We -- I feel that we won by virtue of the -- some of the tech capabilities we had. It enables us to achieve better economics and not so much in saving on -- well, partly tech-on-tech costs like massive vendor costs that we can save. But at the same time, we're investing a lot in tech so that the big net saving is not so much tech costs as it is the opportunity to reduce analog costs over time. 
So that's kind of a long answer to your question. But when we look out and said, over time, we're going to want to do that or we're going to want to do this thing over there or we're going to do that thing over there, in each case, we saw a shared path of investment and transformation that we would need to do. And we're well down that path. We are not done. In many ways, it's a lifelong journey. But I think our opportunities are increasing as we get further down this path."

In the first quarter, Capital One earned $3.3 billion or $7.03 per diluted common share. 
Pre-provision earnings increased 1% in the quarter to $3.4 billion, and we recorded a provision benefit of $823 million. After recognizing $535 million of gains during 2021 on our Snowflake investment, we had a loss on our position in the first quarter of $75 million or $0.12 per share. 
We have now fully exited our position with a cumulative gain of $460 million. 
Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail. In the first quarter, we released $1.6 billion of allowance. The release was driven by strong credit performance across all of our businesses and a more favorable economic outlook that includes the $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed in March. 
Our allowance continues to assume that the relationship between economic metrics and credit performance reverts to historical patterns. And despite the strong credit performance and more favorable economic outlook, we continue to hold significant qualitative factors to account for a number of remaining uncertainties. 
Turning to Slide 5, I'll provide some detail on the allowance coverage by segment. After the impact of the $1.6 billion allowance release, our coverage levels declined modestly across all segments from the prior quarter and remain well above pre pandemic levels. 
Our Domestic Card coverage is now 10.5%, down from 10.8% last quarter. Our Branded Card coverage is 12.1%. Recall that the difference between Branded and Domestic coverage is driven by the law sharing agreement in our partnership portfolio. Coverage in our Consumer business declined 38 basis points to 3.6%. And coverage in our Commercial Banking business fell 23 basis points to 2%. 
Moving to Slide 6. I'll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter was 139%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Our liquidity reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity, ended the quarter at approximately $151 billion. The $7 billion increase in total liquidity is largely attributable to strong inflows of consumer and commercial deposits in the last few weeks of the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'll discuss our net interest margin. NIM declined 6 basis points in the linked quarter due to a 14 basis point headwind from having 2 less days in the quarter as well as a higher mix of cash. These factors were partially offset by the full quarter effect of deposit pricing actions we took in the fourth quarter and a modest increase in loan yields. 
Lastly, turning to Slide 8, I will cover our capital position. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.6% at the end of the first quarter, up 90 basis points from the fourth quarter and 260 basis points higher than a year ago. We continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%. 
Recall that in January, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase plan of up to $7.5 billion of the company's common stock. In the first quarter, we repurchased $400 million of -- $490 million of common stock at an average price of approximately $114 per share. 
Based on the Fed's extension of the trailing 4-quarter average earnings rule, our share repurchase capacity will be limited to approximately $1.7 billion in the second quarter. The timing and amount of all future stock repurchase activity will be a function of any regulatory restrictions, stock trading volumes and our holistic view of our capital position. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?"

I'll begin on Slide 10 with our credit card business. Year-over-year, credit card loan balances and revenue declined in the first quarter driven by the continuing impacts of the pandemic. Purchase v",1170,"Thanks, Andrew, and it's great to have you as our CFO. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our credit card business. 
Year-over-year, credit card loan balances and revenue declined in the first quarter driven by the continuing impacts of the pandemic. Purchase volume rebounded compared to the first quarter of 2020. And the biggest driver of quarterly results was the provision for credit losses which improved significantly. 
Credit card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which we show on Slide 11. For the third consecutive quarter, the story of our Domestic Card business continues to be 2 sides of the same coin. Historically, high payment rates amplified by the effects of government stimulus, continue to put pressure on loan balances. And on the flip side, the same factors are driving exceptional credit performance. 
Looking first at growth. We continued to see purchase volume rebound from the sharp declines early in the pandemic. Domestic Card purchase volume for the first quarter was up 8.4% year-over-year, with growth accelerating in March. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, purchase volume is up 17%. Most spend categories are now exceeding the pre pandemic levels we saw in 2019. 
T&E spend is still lagging pre pandemic levels, but it's catching up. P&E purchase volume is growing faster than overall purchase volume. But payment rate, which has risen to a historically high level continues to put pressure on loan balances, even with the pickup in consumer spending. 
At the end of the first quarter, Domestic Card ending loan balances were down $18.5 billion or about 17% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of a partnership portfolio moved to held-for-sale last year, first quarter ending loans declined about 15% year-over-year. The year-over-year percentage change in ending loan balances this quarter was approximately the same as it was last quarter. 
Strikingly strong credit was the biggest driver of Domestic Card financial results in the quarter, just as it has been for the prior 2 quarters. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.54%, a 214 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.24%, 145 basis points better than the prior year. 
First quarter provision for credit losses improved by nearly $4 billion year-over-year. We had a large allowance release in the first quarter of this year versus a large allowance build in the first quarter last year. Strong 
credit and purchase volume growth were also key drivers of Domestic Card revenue margin, which was up 229 basis points year-over-year to 17.2%. Total company marketing was up modestly compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our choices in card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends. 
In the midst of the pandemic, we're finding opportunities to continue to build the business, and we continue to lean into marketing. Pulling up, our Domestic Card business is delivering significant value and building momentum. 
Slide 12 summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Auto growth, continued strength in retail deposits and exceptional auto credits are the main themes in the first quarter Consumer Banking results. Driven by auto, first quarter ending loans increased 10% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans grew 9%. Auto originations were up 16% year-over-year and up 20% from the linked quarter. 
We've seen competitive intensity increase through the second half of 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021. And with most competitors holding excess deposits, we expect that competitive intensity will continue to increase going forward. First quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $36.4 billion or 17% year-over-year. 
Average deposits were up 16%. On a linked-quarter basis, ending deposits were up 2% and average deposits were flat. Elevated consumer savings rates, fueled by continuing government stimulus are driving year-over-year deposit growth. First quarter Consumer Banking revenue increased 22% from the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and retail deposits. 
First quarter provision for credit losses improved by $986 million year-over-year, driven by an allowance release and lower charge-offs in our auto business. Credit results in our auto business are strikingly strong and continue to benefit from historically high auction values and government stimulus. 
Year-over-year, the first quarter charge-off rate improved 104 basis points to 0.47%, and the delinquency rate improved 217 basis points to 3.12%. A sharp uptick in used car values, coupled with a stimulus driven surge in customer payments resulted in a negative net charge-off rate in March. We expect the auto charge-off rate to increase from its unusually low level as auction prices normalize and stimulus impact play out. 
The Consumer Banking business continues to deliver resilient growth in auto loans and retail deposits. 
Moving to Slide 13. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. First quarter ending loan balances were down 9% year-over-year. Average loans were down 3%, and in C&I, we've seen a reduction in commercial line utilization, which peaked early in the pandemic as customers facing elevated uncertainty drew down their lines. That behavior has since diminished. 
In our commercial real estate business, originations were down and pay downs increased compared to the first quarter of 2020. Quarterly average deposits increased 24% from the first quarter of 2020 and 4% from the linked quarter as middle market and government customers continued to hold elevated levels of liquidity. 
First quarter revenue was up 4% from the prior year quarter. Higher loan and deposit spreads and growth in average deposits were partially offset by lower average loan balances. Provision for credit losses improved significantly compared to the first quarter of 2020, driven by a swing from an allowance build to an allowance release. And lower net charge-offs. 
For the first quarter, the Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 9 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 9.2%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.9%. Our Commercial Banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to navigate the pandemic and build our commercial capabilities. 
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning. 3 key themes are evident in our first quarter results. High payment rates continue to put near-term pressure on loan balances and revenue growth, particularly in our Domestic Card business. 
On the flip side, strikingly strong credit drove a third consecutive quarter of record earnings per share. And our investments to transform our technology and transform how we work are paying off. 
Our modern technology is powering our response to the pandemic and putting us in a strong position for opportunities that emerge as sweeping digital change transforms banking. Pulling way up, we continue to focus on the things that create enduring value when delivered and sustained over the long term. 
Continuing to transform our technology from the ground up, capitalizing on our transformation to drive innovation and growth. Generating positive operating leverage and improving efficiency over time and managing capital efficiently and effectively, including significant planned capital distribution.

Good evening. The growth story is -- I'm sure you're mostly focused on card with that question. So let me turn there. It is really striking that of all the asset classes, 1 really stands sort of unique in the industry is the 1 asset class",716,"Thanks, John. Good evening. The growth story is -- I'm sure you're mostly focused on card with that question. So let me turn there. 
It is really striking that of all the asset classes, 1 really stands sort of unique in the industry is the 1 asset class that shrank since the start of the pandemic, and that's credit cards. And of course, that's because it is a discretionary spending and borrowing product. 
In the current environment, the biggest drivers of card growth are spend and payment behavior and, of course, the traction that we're getting in the marketplace. Let's just talk about spend for a minute, which is recovering. 
In the first quarter, you saw the Domestic Card purchase volume was up at 8.4% year-over-year. And we're seeing just about every spend category rebounding. And even by the way, on T&E, while it's down, it's certainly accelerating. Let's just give you a few stats here. 
T&E spending at the beginning of the pandemic was down more than 80%. And by December, it was down about 50%. And in March, it was down about 25%. So from a growth point of view, both the growth of purchase volume and loan growth, there's some strength that we see on the spending side. 
Turning to payment rates, which are, of course, historically high, the government -- the government stimulus, how big a driver is that of what's going on in payment rates? Obviously, consumers have been very conservative as well, but it's certainly really amplifying the payment rates. And I think, while not a perfect proxy for our overall Domestic Card results, you can get an idea of what's happening with payment rates in our publicly disclosed trust results. 
For example, in March, the payment rate in our Master Trust was just under 46%. That's an all-time high for Capital One and up more than 12 percentage points year-over-year. Now remember that the payment rate represents the percent of the prior month's ending balance that was paid off. So a 46% payment rate means that nearly half of our beginning balances in the trust were paid off in March, which is just remarkable. 
Said another way, all else equal, each percentage point increase in payment rate is a percentage point decrease in year-over-year growth. Now we need to always remember, and this is a really important point. The flip side of high payment rates is strikingly strong credit performance, which drives strong profitability and capital generation. 
Now the other big driver of growth is what happens with originations and line increase. And as the pandemic has played out, we're seeing some attractive origination opportunities. And these opportunities are enhanced by our technology investments. And so we are continuing to lean into marketing. That's origination. We are also gradually increasing credit lines as well. 
So pulling way up we are certainly very pleased with our opportunity to continue to grow our customer franchise. The net growth of outstandings will, of course, be affected by payment rates. So here is, we're not -- now to your question, John. We're not predicting the timing -- the timing of an inflection point. I think we have certainly learned that high payment rates, while they slow down growth are just a really good guy for not only the earnings power of the company, but just the performance quality of the consumer. 
We encourage our customers to pay down whenever they can, we find every opportunity actually to encourage them and remind them to pay down. So I think there's certainly a good thing going on. What we're focused on from a growth point of view, is what we can do to drive the underlying franchise, and we like our opportunities there. And so we're not predicting exact timing of inflection points and things like that. What I would leave you with is, we like our opportunity on growing the underlying franchise. 
And we'll see how payment rates play out in terms of driving sort of the final kind of outstandings growth number. But to us, an underlying growth of the franchise and the really strong dynamics that are going on with -- on the payment side of the business, it's just a healthy place to be, and we feel really good about that."

But -- so we see good opportunities to grow account originations. And we're investing in marketing consistent with those opportunities.

We also are continuing and sort of increasingly so to tell our story in terms of the customer experience we're building, the some of the benefits of our -- the technology we're building, and that's part of our story. 
That gets reflected in the marketing. And that's something that powers the growth as well. And then we're continuing to invest in our brand and our national banking strategy.

So have -- I wanted to get a sense for how we should think about capital allocation, timing of the execution of the $7.5 billion you previously announced?

And so we recognize that capital distribution is important component of our returns and our current position and at least the prospects of earnings from here. So how quickly we complete that $7.5 billion that the Board has already authorized is going to tie back to any unforeseen additional regulatory restrictions, but also trading volumes in our stock and then just taking a step back and looking holistically at our capital position.

The U.S. consumer continues to demonstrate striking resilient. And consumers",710,"And Sanjay, with respect to your credit question and the borrowing through the mountain metaphor, let me just kind of pull up and give thoughts about what's going on with credit. The U.S. consumer continues to demonstrate striking resilient. And consumers went into this downturn with like twice the savings rate that they had before the Great Recession? 
Lower payment obligations and none of the structural issues they faced a decade ago with the housing sector. And because everything sort of went into vertical, a drop at once as the pandemic began, they certainly reacted strongly and rationally. 
And launch this trilogy of behaviors of spending less, saving more and paying down debt. And then, of course, the year ended the pandemic direct government support to consumers, including enhanced unemployment benefits remains in place. And in fact, last month, in March was the single largest month of direct government payments to consumers in dollar terms since the pandemic began. 
The consumer savings rate was 17% in the first 2 months of 2021, more than double what we saw before the pandemic and something like 5x what it was in the years before the Great Recession. And then we also have the forbearance factor. Although forbearance is winding down in card and auto. It is still relatively widespread for student loans and mortgages. 
And as we've said before, the benefits of some of these effects like higher savings are probably cumulative, to some extent, improving consumer balance sheets in ways that could lead to some sustained credit benefits. And now to the metaphor that I know I use all the time. Every month that the consumer remains healthy, we're borrowing a longer tunnel underneath the mountain of still high unemployment, and we're reducing the cumulative losses through this downturn rather than just delaying the impacts. 
Now we should all keep in mind a few things here. There remains a great deal of uncertainty. As you know, Covid cases remain elevated. New variants continue to emerge. And while the U.S. has been moving in a pretty good direction, of course, a lot of the world is moving in the other direction with respect to COVID. 
The economy, while improving still has a lot of strain elements in it. And so that we still look at this just extraordinary kind of paradox of the separation of some of what happened to the economy and what happened to consumer credit. But we should all keep in mind the uncertainty that still remains out there. And then there's 1 other point that I'd just like to put on the table here. In the spirit of pattern recognition. I do want to flag that this period of unusually strong credit could lay the groundwork for credit worsening down the road as an industry point. 
And let me elaborate on that just for a moment here. Reliance on consumer credit characteristics, that may be more temporary, driven by things like stimulus and forbearance can be a real challenge for credit modeling. And the benign rearview mirror could encourage lenders to reach for growth and to loosen underwriting standards, which, as you know, can invite adverse selection. 
And then overlay on top of that, the excess liquidity and capital that's out there, and that could push lenders to stretch for less resilient business. So what we have here is a pretty benign period where we are right now. We're also watching the physics of of how markets, not only economic markets, but how credit markets work. 
And so what we're doing at Capital One is leaning into the opportunities that we have. But by having a view of how the physics of some of these things work, we're very much watching out for that in all the choices that we make. And it's, again, another reason why we're focusing, as always, on making sure that we book resilient business. 
So pulling way up, we're not ready to predict that the tunnel comes out just all the way across the mountain, and we are talking about some topography that can exist out there longer run as a consequence of some of the physics of how the current situation lasts. 
But those are some thoughts on the credit environment, Sanjay."

Auction prices ended the quarter at all-time highs, driven by strong demand and persistent constraints on new vehicle supply. And over time, we still expect auction prices to normalize as these vehicle supply constraints work themselves out. 
But the time horizon for normalization has expanded given the strong recovery of demand and the continuing stress on global supply chain. So for example, microprocessor shortages, have held back new vehicle production for some time. The first quarter saw disruptions due to winter weather events. And that impacted petrochemical supplies used for parts. And then most recently, rubber shortages have manifested themselves. So the supply shortage, there are signs of it everywhere. 
And for example, we see rental car companies are normally a source of use vehicle supply. But they have very lean fleets at the moment with little excess to sell. So we still expect auction prices to normalize over time and a very important thing is in our underwriting, we make conservative assumptions with faster normalization. 
Now with that, very unusual context there. And again, my view is that we cannot underwrite under an assumption that we're going to get the benefit of those things. It's certainly something we're enjoying on our portfolio. But as we always do and particularly at this point, we need to look past that in our underwriting, and that's certainly what we're doing. 
With respect to growth, industry retail auto sales were strong in the first quarter and especially in March. And in addition to tax refund seasonality, I'm sure payments -- stimulus payments likely really helped strong sales, both in the new and the used vehicle segments. So at Capital One over the course of the pandemic, we actually have -- we tightened up in certain segments, especially early on. 
But we are we are still probably net tighter than we were at the outset. We're watching things closely. But we have benefited by the tide rising for everyone in the industry. Certainly, it's been a very exceptional time. But also on top of that, our investments in industry-leading technology products have allowed us to maintain very strong relationships with dealers during these uncertain times and generate the ability to have less in person face-to-face interaction during the pandemic has also really helped lift the digital products and the digital capabilities that we have both for customers and for dealers. 
So we have found on top of the rising tide, maybe a little bit of extra boost at Capital One. But I've also said that even more so than the card business, the auto business is hypersensitive to sort of the level of competition, and that's because a dealer sits there and holds an auction in ways that doesn't happen in a direct-to-consumer business like card. 
So it's not lost on us that the tide rising everywhere in auto has caused quite a buoyancy in the auto business. So what we're going to do is continue to lean into the opportunities at that moment.

Moshe, great questions there. Let's kind of pull up and talk about card competition. Competition can show up in a variety of ways, including the marketing intensity, the product offers including there the upfront bonuses, enhanced rewards, pricing and other things. 
Competitive intensity is back to its high levels. Particularly as you point to Moshe, in the rewards space at the higher end, the heavy spender end. So let's talk about marketing. Marketing and media spend, obviously, dropped dramatically in the second quarter. And since then, activity has steadily increased. 
We get our data on a bit of a lag basis, but I feel it's very likely that marketing levels are now at or above pre pandemic levels. The rewards offerings remain intense. And let's talk about some of the elements of that. Upfront bonuses, have actually been relatively stable with some modest increases, mainly in the travel space and likely in anticipation of returning demand. 
We -- as for rewards earned on spend, we've seen additional categories like groceries and restaurants qualify for enhanced rewards over the past year. And while these shifts have slowed down, reward levels overall remain high. And we've even seen a couple of a few competitors talk about still planning to be tinkering with their rewards here. 
So I think it's a very natural thing that's happened with spending having been weighed down and also the things, Moshe, that are naturally rewarded are not the activities people tend to be doing that much of right now. 
There's been somewhat of a mix change, and I think a forward lean by the industry on this. So I think it's -- the things that I've said so often about the card business these days, I think it's a very competitive industry, but there's a rationality to it that I'm pretty struck by and 1 that I would not use some of those terms to describe some of the other markets that we're in. 
So what are we doing? We are continuing to look at our opportunities, lean into where we have opportunities. I think we feel good with the general structure, the rewards products we have. But we do know that competition is high, and it's probably going to be increasing. We ourselves are going to lean into marketing. 
And -- but I don't necessarily see some sort of dramatic changes in the structure of offers out there. To change to us the attractiveness of this. Part of the thing is most of us operate on a relatively thin net margin because while interchange rates are high, we are passing most of the interchange rates on to consumers in the form of really attractive deals. 
So pulling way up, we continue to like our opportunities. We have a lot of years of experience with the high level of intensity, and I think we should probably prepare for that."

And we saw some of the things going on in the marketplace. 
So we took a pretty conservative policy with lines. And then during the pandemic, a particularly conservative strategy with lines. And so that contains some potential energy. As we've always talked about, it turns into kinetic energy, when, of course, we grant the line increases, and there is more opportunity for people to spend. 
And the opening of lines has been something we've been doing over the last number of months. It's been kind of invisible with to the outside world in terms of growth because it's getting washed over by the extraordinary payment rates. But we continue to see an opportunity to open up some of the lines gradually. 
And Moshe, I think that represents an extra part of growth opportunity. We're not doing anything really dramatic, but it's just part of the gradual leaning into the opportunity with what we're seeing with the performance of our customers."

So let me start with the branches. As you know, Capital One has -- over the years, sort of leaned into the closing of branches in conjunction with our building of our more national banking business and also the all the digital investments we were making because we spent so much energy on creating an experience that doesn't need to have a branch on every corner. 
And we've been pleased with our strategy so far. But there's -- we don't -- I think that there's more of a continuation of where we are. I think we're in continuing to lean into the same strategy we've had for quite a period of time there. So I wouldn't look at our network and say, wow, there's a huge kind of potential to unleash there. We've just been gradually making our choices and continuing to develop our digital opportunities, watching customer behavior. And then just continue down the same path. 
With respect to our cloud strategy, as you know, we completely exited data centers last year. So we are 100% in the cloud. And we are enjoying the benefits of being in the public cloud, the hassle free access to infrastructure the ability to ride the incredible wave of innovation that's happening on the cloud, both from the cloud providers as well as from the rest of the world software companies that are building on the cloud. 
We -- so this is something we've been many years in the making. And we we're happy to be all in on the cloud. But it doesn't mean our journey is done on the cloud. We find as we get there, there's the opportunity to build many more capabilities, the opportunity to really enhance resilience, operating resilience, failover capabilities, efficiency, the ability to over time move, basically, 1 of the real benefits of the cloud is the ability to abstract the developers from being burdened with the details of the infrastructure that they're operating on. And the cloud itself is an abstractor of that -- the infrastructure work for a developer. 
But within -- if you just look at what's happening to cloud, the continuing migration sort of abstracting up the tech stack and where cloud has gone with containers and now where it's going with serverless, just continues to liberate developers so that they can focus on doing what they came to do which is to create great things and ship products. 
Now all of that doesn't happen automatically. Companies have to continue to stay on the forefront. So Capital One is continuing to invest in the serverless side of the business. For example, as we continue to move the level of distraction up the stack and create more opportunity for the software to be developed faster, more effectively and safer."

So I think a way to think about the pandemic is that it took a company like Capital One in our card business and just set us back like 15% behind the starting line. 
And that's a pretty jarring thing to happen in our flagship business and are very successful and profitable business. But this whole payment phenomenon essentially did that. Now in that context, as we start further behind the starting line. As we look at the opportunity to grow accounts, the opportunity to build the franchise, the opportunity to get out there with some of our really great digital products and things like this, the ability to -- and of course, on the banking side, the ability to grow the national bank. 
That is still very -- that opportunity is still very much there. And isn't really it isn't really that changed by the pandemic. Now on the outstanding side, you, first of all, have the paydown story. So that definitely is pushing us and others farther back, all other things being equal. There's sort of the issue for how much credit demand there is that we'll see from spokes we certainly have the spend weakness on the travel side of the business as well. 
So I think that we feel the effectiveness of our marketing and building the franchise is very much like it was before. The outstandings metrics of the company started farther behind, and they have headwinds to them. But since we've always talked about if payment rates stay high, we're going to have to live with all the great credit performance that we have and the earnings and the ability to distribute capital. 
So the benefits come in a different way. But the we are very focused on continuing to build the franchise. And I think Capital One is in a similar position to do that, as we were pre pandemic, in many ways, maybe even a little bit better positioned because we're further along on our tech transformation."

First of all, as I often say, Capital One was 1 of the original fintechs before anybody used that word. So I think fintechs here, particularly near and dear to my heart, and I watch with tremendous interest at the growth of fintechs, some of the really clever innovation they're coming up with. 
We should all know, of course, that all of these fintechs are born in the cloud. They're starting with modern technology. And that already gives them a bunch of advantages relative to a lot of banks. I think Capital One being in the cloud, I think, is in a a sort of much better position competitively relative to that. 
But what we should all saver about the fintech is the modern tech platform they have. And that's -- it's always and I think those advantages are larger nowadays than they were in the past because the difference between being built on a modern tech stack versus not is just a greater advantage and something that's motivated us to do very big tech transformation, as you know. 
So the -- and the fintechs journey is not just sort of used some clever technology. They're also very much positioning themselves to take advantage of some of the opportunities to gather more data, different data than typically gathered and to leverage it in real time. So there's some bunch of impressive things there. 
When we look at the fintechs, we are both generally impressed. We think that they do represent threats to the business. But to us, I think they are very much also just a good examples of the kind of innovation that's possible and the kind of innovation that companies like Capital One, who are in the cloud with -- on a modern tech stack, the kind of things that we can do as well. 
So we look at it from that perspective, and we fire -- worrying and inspiring at the same time. Then you have the lending side of business, I want to make a special comment about lending. Half an hour ago, I put a caution note out there that we've got a that I worry about where in the marketplace lending goes from here with people building models that are looking at a recession that was very, very unusual with sort of spectacular credit. And I worry particularly about fintechs who are not that experienced and some of the credit choices they can do and the impact on our marketplace. 
So I think the fintechs, and you can see in the commentary by banks, I think banks are becoming a lot more sort of realizing the the scale, the growth -- the collective size of the growth rate and the innovation that the fintechs are bringing, and they're going to be a force to reckon with. And to us, they are a continued impetus that we've got to lean forward. We've got to continue on our tech transformation. And we need to lead the way ourselves with innovation."

In the first quarter, Capital One earned $3.3 billion or $7.03 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings increased 1% in the quarter to $3.4 billion, and we recorded a provision benefit of $823 million. After recognizing $535 million of gains during 2021 on our Snowflake investment, we had a loss on our position in the first quarter of $75 million or $0.12 per share. We've now fully exited our position with a cumulative gain of $460 million.
Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail. In the first quarter, we released $1.6 billion of allowance. The release was driven by strong credit performance across all of our businesses and a more favorable economic outlook that includes the $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed in March.
Our allowance continues to assume that the relationship between economic metrics and credit performance reverts to historical patterns. And despite the strong credit performance and more favorable economic outlook, we continue to hold significant qualitative factors to account for a number of remaining uncertainties.
Turning to Slide 5, I'll provide some detail on the allowance coverage by segment. After the impact of the $1.6 billion allowance release, our coverage levels declined modestly across all segments from the prior quarter and remain well above pre-pandemic levels.
Our Domestic Card coverage is now 10.5%, down from 10.8% last quarter. Our Branded Card coverage is 12.1%. Recall that the difference between Branded and Domestic coverage is driven by the law sharing agreement in our partnership portfolio. Coverage in our Consumer business declined 38 basis points to 3.6%. And coverage in our Commercial Banking business fell 23 basis points to 2%.
Moving to Slide 6, I'll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter was 139%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Our liquidity reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately $151 billion. The $7 billion increase in total liquidity is largely attributable to strong inflows of consumer and commercial deposits in the last few weeks of the quarter.
Turning to Slide 7, I'll discuss our net interest margin. NIM declined 6 basis points in the linked quarter due to a 14 basis point headwind from having 2 less days in the quarter as well as a higher mix of cash. These factors were partially offset by the full quarter effect of deposit pricing actions we took in the fourth quarter and a modest increase in loan yields.
Lastly, turning to Slide 8, I will cover our capital position. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.6% at the end of the first quarter, up 90 basis points from the fourth quarter and 260 basis points higher than a year ago. We continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%.
Recall that in January, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase plan of up to $7.5 billion of the company's common stock. In the first quarter, we repurchased $400 million of -- $490 million of common stock at an average price of approximately $114 per share.
Based on the Fed's extension of the trailing 4-quarter average earnings rule, our share repurchase capacity will be limited to approximately $1.7 billion in the second quarter. The timing and amount of all future stock repurchase activity will be a function of any regulatory restrictions, stock trading volumes and our holistic view of our capital position.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?"

Year-over-year, credit card loan balances and revenue declined in the first quarter driven by the continuing impacts of the pandemic. Purchase volume rebounded compared to the first quarter of 2020. And the biggest driver of quarterly results was the provision for credit losses, which improved significantly. Credit card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which we show on Slide 11.
For the third consecutive quarter, the story of our Domestic Card business continues to be 2 sides of the same coin. Historically, high payment rates amplified by the effects of government stimulus continue to put pressure on loan balances. And on the flip side, the same factors are driving exceptional credit performance.
Looking first at growth. We continued to see purchase volume rebound from the sharp declines early in the pandemic. Domestic Card purchase volume for the first quarter was up 8.4% year-over-year, with growth accelerating in March. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, purchase volume is up 17%. Most spend categories are now exceeding the pre-pandemic levels we saw in 2019.
T&E spend is still lagging pre-pandemic levels, but it's catching up. T&E purchase volume is growing faster than overall purchase volume. The payment rate, which has risen to a historically high level, continues to put pressure on loan balances, even with the pickup in consumer spending.
At the end of the first quarter, Domestic Card ending loan balances were down $18.5 billion or about 17% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of a partnership portfolio moved to held-for-sale last year, first quarter ending loans declined about 15% year-over-year. The year-over-year percentage change in ending loan balances this quarter was approximately the same as it was last quarter.
Strikingly strong credit was the biggest driver of Domestic Card financial results in the quarter, just as it has been for the prior 2 quarters. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.54%, a 214 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.24%, 145 basis points better than the prior year.
First quarter provision for credit losses improved by nearly $4 billion year-over-year. We had a large allowance release in the first quarter of this year versus a large allowance build in the first quarter last year. Strong credit and purchase volume growth were also key drivers of Domestic Card revenue margin, which was up 229 basis points year-over-year to 17.2%.
Total company marketing was up modestly compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our choices in card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends. In the midst of the pandemic, we're finding opportunities to continue to build the business, and we continue to lean into marketing. Pulling up, our Domestic Card business is delivering significant value and building momentum.
Slide 12 summarizes first quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Auto growth, continued strength in retail deposits and exceptional auto credit are the main themes in the first quarter Consumer Banking results. Driven by Auto, first quarter ending loans increased 10% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans grew 9%. Auto originations were up 16% year-over-year and up 20% from the linked quarter. 
We've seen competitive intensity increase through the second half of 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021. And with most competitors holding excess deposits, we expect that competitive intensity will continue to increase going forward. First quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Banking were up $36.4 billion or 17% year-over-year.
Average deposits were up 16%. On a linked-quarter basis, ending deposits were up 2% and average deposits were flat. Elevated consumer savings rates, fueled by continuing government stimulus, are driving year-over-year deposit growth. First quarter Consumer Banking revenue increased 22% from the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and retail deposits.
First quarter provision for credit losses improved by $986 million year-over-year driven by an allowance release and lower charge-offs in our Auto business. Credit results in our Auto business are strikingly strong and continue to benefit from historically high auction values and government stimulus. 
Year-over-year, the first quarter charge-off rate improved 104 basis points to 0.47%, and the delinquency rate improved 217 basis points to 3.12%. A sharp uptick in used car values, coupled with a stimulus driven surge in customer payments, resulted in a negative net charge-off rate in March. We expect the auto charge-off rate to increase from its unusually low level as auction prices normalize and stimulus impact play out. The Consumer Banking business continues to deliver resilient growth in auto loans and retail deposits.
Moving to Slide 13. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. First quarter ending loan balances were down 9% year-over-year. Average loans were down 3%. In C&I, we've seen a reduction in commercial line utilization, which peaked early in the pandemic as customers facing elevated uncertainty drew down their lines. That behavior has since diminished.
In our commercial real estate business, originations were down and pay downs increased compared to the first quarter of 2020. Quarterly average deposits increased 24% from the first quarter of 2020 and 4% from the linked quarter as middle market and government customers continued to hold elevated levels of liquidity.
First quarter revenue was up 4% from the prior year quarter. Higher loan and deposit spreads and growth in average deposits were partially offset by lower average loan balances. Provision for credit losses improved significantly compared to the first quarter of 2020, driven by a swing from an allowance build to an allowance release and lower net charge-offs.
For the first quarter, the Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 9 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 9.2%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.9%. Our Commercial Banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to navigate the pandemic and build our commercial capabilities.
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning. Three key themes are evident in our first quarter results. High payment rates continue to put near-term pressure on loan balances and revenue growth, particularly in our Domestic Card business. On the flip side, strikingly strong credit drove a third consecutive quarter of record earnings per share.
And our investments to transform our technology and transform how we work are paying off. Our modern technology is powering our response to the pandemic and putting us in a strong position for opportunities that emerge as sweeping digital change transforms banking. Pulling way up, we continue to focus on the things that create enduring value when delivered and sustained over the long term, continuing to transform our technology from the ground up, capitalizing on our transformation to drive innovation and growth, generating positive operating leverage and improving efficiency over time and managing capital efficiently and effectively, including significant planned capital distribution.

The growth story is -- I'm sure you're mostly focused on card with that question. So let me turn there. It is really striking that of all the asset classes, one really stands sort of unique in the industry is the one asset class that shrank since the start of the pandemic, and that's credit cards. And of course, that's because it is a discretionary spending and borrowing product.
In the current environment, the biggest drivers of card growth are spend and payment behavior and, of course, the traction that we're getting in the marketplace. Let's just talk about spend for a minute, which is recovering. In the first quarter, you saw the Domestic Card purchase volume was up at 8.4% year-over-year. And we're seeing just about every spend category rebounding. And even by the way, on T&E, while it's down, it's certainly accelerating.
Let's just give you a few stats here. T&E spending at the beginning of the pandemic was down more than 80%. And by December, it was down about 50%. And in March, it was down about 25%. So from a growth point of view, both the growth of purchase volume and loan growth, there's some strength that we see on the spending side.
Turning to payment rates, which are, of course, historically high, the government stimulus, how big a driver is that of what's going on in payment rates? Obviously, consumers have been very conservative as well, but it's certainly really amplifying the payment rates. And I think, while not a perfect proxy for our overall Domestic Card results, you can get an idea of what's happening with payment rates in our publicly disclosed Trust results.
For example, in March, the payment rate in our Master Trust was just under 46%. That's an all-time high for Capital One and up more than 12 percentage points year-over-year. Now remember that the payment rate represents the percent of the prior month's ending balance that was paid off. So a 46% payment rate means that nearly half of our beginning balances in the Trust were paid off in March, which is just remarkable.
Said another way, all else equal, each percentage point increase in payment rate is a percentage point decrease in year-over-year growth. Now we need to always remember, and this is a really important point, the flip side of high payment rates is strikingly strong credit performance, which drives strong profitability and capital generation.
Now the other big driver of growth is what happens with originations and line increase. And as the pandemic has played out, we're seeing some attractive origination opportunities. And these opportunities are enhanced by our technology investments. And so we are continuing to lean into marketing. That's origination.
We are also gradually increasing credit lines as well. So pulling way up, we are certainly very pleased with our opportunity to continue to grow our customer franchise. The net growth of outstandings will, of course, be affected by payment rates. So here is, we're not -- now to your question, John. We're not predicting the timing of an inflection point. I think we have certainly learned that high payment rates, while they slow down growth, are just a really good guide for not only the earnings power of the company, but just the performance quality of the consumer.
We encourage our customers to pay down whenever they can. We find every opportunity actually to encourage them and remind them to pay down. So I think there's certainly a good thing going on. What we're focused on from a growth point of view is, what we can do to drive the underlying franchise, and we like our opportunities there. And so we're not predicting exact timing of inflection points and things like that.
What I would leave you with is, we like our opportunity on growing the underlying franchise. And we'll see how payment rates play out in terms of driving sort of the final kind of outstandings growth number. But to us, an underlying growth of the franchise and the really strong dynamics that are going on with -- on the payment side of the business is just a healthy place to be, and we feel really good about that."

But -- so we see good opportunities to grow account originations. And we're investing in marketing consistent with those opportunities.
In card, we're certainly -- in all our businesses, we're leaning in where we see signs of strength. We also are continuing and sort of increasingly so to tell our story in terms of the customer experience we're building, some of the benefits of our -- the technology we're building, and that's part of our story, that gets reflected in the marketing. And that's something that powers the growth as well. And then we're continuing to invest in our brand and our national banking strategy. So that's why it kind of pulling way up with the collective set of opportunities we're seeing, we're continuing to lean into the marketing."

And so we recognize that capital distribution is important component of our returns and our current position and at least the prospects of earnings from here. So how quickly we complete that $7.5 billion that the Board has already authorized is going to tie back to any unforeseen additional regulatory restrictions, but also trading volumes in our stock and then just taking a step back and looking holistically at our capital position.

I think over the longer term, I'd expect our cash position and the size of the investment portfolio to come back down to more normal levels, I'll call it, and be a tailwind to NIM, all else equal. But it's, again, important to know that the uncertainty of what we're seeing in deposit volumes and the impact of payment rates, as Rich said, on loan growth, those are all factors that are going to create some variability and uncertainty in NIM in the near term."

And consumer",708,"And Sanjay, with respect to your credit question and the burrowing through the mountain metaphor, let me just kind of pull up and give thoughts about what's going on with credit. The U.S. consumer continues to demonstrate striking resilience. And consumers went into this downturn with like twice the savings rate that they had before the Great Recession, lower payment obligations and none of the structural issues they faced a decade ago with the housing sector.
And because everything sort of went into vertical drop at once as the pandemic began, they certainly reacted strongly and rationally. And launched this trilogy of behaviors of spending less, saving more and paying down debt. And then, of course, a year into the pandemic, direct government support to consumers, including enhanced unemployment benefits remain in place. And in fact, last month, in March, was the single largest month of direct government payments to consumers in dollar terms since the pandemic began.
The consumer savings rate was 17% in the first 2 months of 2021, more than double what we saw before the pandemic and something like 5x what it was in the years before the Great Recession. And then we also have the forbearance factor. Although forbearance is winding down in card and auto, it is still relatively widespread for student loans and mortgages. And as we've said before, the benefits of some of these effects like higher savings are probably cumulative to some extent, improving consumer balance sheets in ways that could lead to some sustained credit benefits.
And now to the metaphor that I know I use all the time. Every month that the consumer remains healthy, we're burrowing a longer tunnel underneath the mountain of still high unemployment, and we're reducing the cumulative losses through this downturn rather than just delaying the impacts. Now we should all keep in mind a few things here. There remains a great deal of uncertainty. As you know, COVID cases remain elevated, new variants continue to emerge. And while the U.S. has been moving in a pretty good direction, of course, a lot of the world is moving in the other direction with respect to COVID.
The economy, while improving still has a lot of strain elements in it. And so that we still look at this just extraordinary kind of paradox of the separation of some of what happened to the economy and what happened to consumer credit. But we should all keep in mind the uncertainty that still remains out there.
And then there's one other point that I'd just like to put on the table here. In the spirit of pattern recognition, I do want to flag that this period of unusually strong credit could lay the groundwork for credit worsening down the road as an industry point. And let me elaborate on that just for a moment here. Reliance on consumer credit characteristics that may be more temporary driven by things like stimulus and forbearance can be a real challenge for credit modeling. And the benign rearview mirror could encourage lenders to reach for growth and to loosen underwriting standards, which, as you know, can invite adverse selection.
And then overlay on top of that, the excess liquidity and capital that's out there, and that could push lenders to stretch for less resilient business. So what we have here is a pretty benign period where we are right now. We're also watching the physics of how markets, not only economic markets, but how credit markets work. And so what we're doing at Capital One is leaning into the opportunities that we have. But by having a view of how the physics of some of these things work, we're very much watching out for that in all the choices that we make.
And it's, again, another reason why we're focusing, as always, on making sure that we book resilient business. So pulling way up, we're not ready to predict that the tunnel comes out just all the way across the mountain, and we are talking about some topography that can exist out there longer run as a consequence of some of the physics of how the current situation lasts. But those are some thoughts on the credit environment, Sanjay."

Auction prices ended the quarter at all-time highs, driven by strong demand and persistent constraints on new vehicle supply. And over time, we still expect auction prices to normalize as these vehicle supply constraints work themselves out.
But the time horizon for normalization has expanded, given the strong recovery of demand and the continuing stress on global supply chain. So for example, microprocessor shortages have held back new vehicle production for some time. The first quarter saw disruptions due to winter weather events. And that impacted petrochemical supplies used for parts. And then most recently, rubber shortages have manifested themselves. So the supply shortage, there are signs of it everywhere.
And for example, we see rental car companies are normally a source of use vehicle supply. But they have very lean fleets at the moment with little excess to sell. So we still expect auction prices to normalize over time.
And a very important thing is in our underwriting, we make conservative assumptions with faster normalization. Now with that, very unusual context there and again, my view is that, we cannot underwrite under an assumption that we're going to get the benefit of those things. It's certainly something we're enjoying on our portfolio. But as we always do and particularly at this point, we need to look past that in our underwriting, and that's certainly what we're doing.
With respect to growth, industry retail auto sales were strong in the first quarter and especially in March. And in addition to tax refund seasonality, I'm sure payments -- stimulus payments likely really helped strong sales, both in the new and the used vehicle segments. So at Capital One over the course of the pandemic, we actually have -- we tightened up in certain segments, especially early on. But we are still probably net tighter than we were at the outset. We're watching things closely.
But we have benefited by the tide rising for everyone in the industry. Certainly, it's been a very exceptional time. But also on top of that, our investments in industry-leading technology products have allowed us to maintain very strong relationships with dealers during these uncertain times and generate the ability to have less in-person, face-to-face interaction during the pandemic has also really helped lift the digital products and the digital capabilities that we have both for customers and for dealers.
So we have found on top of the rising tide maybe a little bit of extra boost at Capital One. But I've also said that even more so than the card business, the auto business is hypersensitive to sort of the level of competition, and that's because a dealer sits there and holds an auction in ways that doesn't happen in a direct-to-consumer business like card.
So it's not lost on us that the tide rising everywhere in auto has caused quite a buoyancy in the auto business. So what we're going to do is continue to lean into the opportunities at that moment. But again, to use my physics term again, really keep a watchful eye on the physics of how the markets work and be looking for some of those things that can come on the side of excessive competition as well as over time, a breaking of the extraordinary things going on, a normalization of the used car prices."

Moshe, great questions there. Let's kind of pull up and talk about card competition. Competition can show up in a variety of ways, including the marketing intensity, the product offers, including there the upfront bonuses, enhanced rewards, pricing",486,"Okay. Moshe, great questions there. Let's kind of pull up and talk about card competition. Competition can show up in a variety of ways, including the marketing intensity, the product offers, including there the upfront bonuses, enhanced rewards, pricing and other things. Competitive intensity is back to its high levels, particularly as you point to Moshe, in the rewards space at the higher end, the heavy spender end.
So let's talk about marketing. Marketing and media spend, obviously, dropped dramatically in the second quarter. And since then, activity has steadily increased. We get our data on a bit of a lag basis, but I feel it's very likely that marketing levels are now at or above pre-pandemic levels.
The rewards offerings remain intense. And let's talk about some of the elements of that. Upfront bonuses, have actually been relatively stable with some modest increases, mainly in the travel space and likely in anticipation of returning demand. We -- as for rewards earned on spend, we've seen additional categories like groceries and restaurants qualify for enhanced rewards over the past year. And while these shifts have slowed down, reward levels overall remain high.
And we've even seen a couple of -- a few competitors talk about still planning to be tinkering with their rewards here. So I think it's a very natural thing that's happened with spending having been weighed down and also some of the things, Moshe, that are naturally rewarded are not the activities people tend to be doing that much of right now. There's been somewhat of a mix change, and I think a forward lean by the industry on this.
So I think it's -- the things that I've said so often about the card business these days, I think it's a very competitive industry, but there's a rationality to it that I am pretty struck by and one that I would not use some of those terms to describe some of the other markets that we're in.
So what are we doing? We are continuing to look at our opportunities, lean into where we have opportunities. I think we feel good with the general structure, the rewards products we have. But we do know that competition is high, and it's probably going to be increasing. We ourselves are going to lean into marketing.
And -- but I don't necessarily see some sort of dramatic changes in the structure of offers out there to change to us the attractiveness of this. Part of the thing is most of us operate on a relatively thin net margin because while interchange rates are high, we are passing most of the interchange rates on to consumers in the form of really attractive deals. So pulling way up, we continue to like our opportunities. We have a lot of years of experience with the high level of intensity, and I think we should probably prepare for that."

And we saw some of the things going on in the marketplace.
So we took a pretty conservative policy with lines. And then during the pandemic, we took a particularly conservative strategy with lines. And so that contains some potential energy. As we've always talked about, it turns into kinetic energy, when, of course, we grant the line increases, and there is more opportunity for people to spend.
And the opening of lines has been something we've been doing over the last number of months. It's been kind of invisible with to the outside world in terms of growth because it's getting washed over by the extraordinary payment rates. But we continue to see an opportunity to open up some of the lines gradually. 
And Moshe, I think that represents an extra part of growth opportunity. We're not doing anything really dramatic, but it's just part of the gradual leaning into the opportunity with what we're seeing with the performance of our customers."

As you know, Capital One has, over the years, sort of leaned into the closing of branches in conjunction with our building of our more national banking business and also all the digital investments we were making because we spent so much energy on creating an experience that doesn't need to have a branch on every corner.
And we've been pleased with our strategy so far. But there's -- we don't -- I think that there's more of a continuation of where we are. I think we're in -- continuing to lean into the same strategy we've had for quite a period of time there. So I wouldn't look at our network and say, ""Wow, there's a huge kind of potential to unleash there."" We've just been gradually making our choices and continuing to develop our digital opportunities, watching customer behavior and then just continue down the same path.
With respect to our cloud strategy, as you know, we completely exited data centers last year. So we are 100% in the cloud. And we are enjoying the benefits of being in the public cloud, the hassle free access to infrastructure, the ability to ride the incredible wave of innovation that's happening on the cloud, both from the cloud providers as well as from the rest of the world software companies that are building on the cloud. We -- so this is something we've been many years in the making. And we're happy to be all in on the cloud.
But it doesn't mean our journey is done on the cloud. We find as we get there -- there's the opportunity to build many more capabilities, the opportunity to really enhance resilience, operating resilience, failover capabilities, efficiency, the ability to over time move. Basically, one of the real benefits of the cloud is the ability to abstract the developers from being burdened with the details of the infrastructure that they're operating on. And the cloud itself is an abstractor of that -- the infrastructure work for a developer.
But within, if you just look at what's happening to cloud, the continuing migration sort of abstracting up the tech stack and where cloud has gone with containers and now where it's going with serverless, just continues to liberate developers so that they can focus on doing what they came to do which is to create great things and ship products.
Now all of that doesn't happen automatically. Companies have to continue to stay on the forefront. So Capital One is continuing to invest in the serverless side of the business. For example, as we continue to move the level of abstraction up the stack and create more opportunity for the software to be developed faster, more effectively and safer."

So I think a way to think about the pandemic is that it took a company like Capital One in our Card business and just set us back like 15% behind the starting line.
And that's a pretty jarring thing to happen in our flagship business and our very successful and profitable business. But this whole payment phenomenon essentially did that. Now in that context, as we start farther behind the starting line. As we look at the opportunity to grow accounts, the opportunity to build the franchise, the opportunity to get out there with some of our really great digital products and things like this, the ability to -- and of course, on the banking side, the ability to grow the national bank, that is still very -- that opportunity is still very much there. And isn't really -- it isn't really that changed by the pandemic.
Now on the outstanding side, you, first of all, have the paydown story. So that definitely is pushing us and others farther back, all other things being equal. There's sort of the issue for how much credit demand there is that we'll see from folks. We certainly have the spend weakness on the travel side of the business as well.
So I think that we feel the effectiveness of our marketing and building the franchise is very much like it was before. The outstandings metrics of the company started farther behind, and they have headwinds to them. But since we've always talked about if payment rates stay high, we're going to have to live with all the great credit performance that we have and the earnings and the ability to distribute capital so the benefits come in a different way.
But the -- we are very focused on continuing to build the franchise. And I think Capital One is in a similar position to do that, as we were pre-pandemic, in many ways, maybe even a little bit better position because we're farther along on our tech transformation."

First of all, as I often say, Capital One was one of the original fintechs before anybody used that word. So I think fintechs here, particularly near and dear to my heart, and I watch with tremendous interest the growth of fintechs, some of the really clever innovation they're coming up with.
We should all know, of course, that all of these fintechs are born in the cloud. They're starting with modern technology. And that already gives them a bunch of advantages relative to a lot of banks. I think Capital One being in the cloud, I think, is in a sort of much better position competitively relative to that.
What we should all savor about the fintechs is the modern tech platform they have, and that's -- it's always -- and I think those advantages are larger nowadays than they were in the past because the difference between being built on a modern tech stack versus not is just a greater advantage and something that's motivated us to do very big tech transformation, as you know.
So the -- and the fintechs journey is not just sort of used some clever technology. They're also very much positioning themselves to take advantage of some of the opportunities to gather more data, different data than typically gathered and to leverage it in real time. So there's some bunch of impressive things there.
When we look at the fintechs, we are both generally impressed. We think that they do represent threats to the business. But to us, I think they are very much also just good examples of the kind of innovation that's possible and the kind of innovation that companies like Capital One, who are in the cloud with -- on a modern tech stack, the kind of things that we can do as well. So we look at it from that perspective, and we fire -- we're worrying and inspiring at the same time.
Then you have the lending side of business. I want to make a special comment about lending. Half an hour ago, I put a caution note out there that we've got a -- that I worry about wherein the marketplace lending goes from here with people building models that are looking at a recession that was very, very unusual with sort of spectacular credit. And I worry particularly about fintechs who are not that experienced and some of the credit choices they can do and the impact on our marketplace.
So I think the fintechs -- and you can see in the commentary by banks, I think banks are becoming a lot more sort of realizing the scale, the growth -- the collective size of the growth rate and the innovation that the fintechs are bringing, and they're going to be a force to reckon with. And to us, they are a continued impetus that we've got to lean forward. We've got to continue on our tech transformation. And we need to lead the way ourselves with innovation."

I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $3.5 billion or $7.62 per diluted common share.

In the second quarter, Capital One earned $3.5 billion or $7.62 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter was a $55 million legal reserve build. Net of this adjusting item, earnings per share in the quarter was $7.71. 
On a GAAP basis, pre-provision earnings increased slightly in the sequential quarter to $3.4 billion. We recorded a provision benefit of $1.2 billion in the quarter as $541 million of charge-offs was offset by a $1.7 billion allowance release. 
Revenue grew 4% in the linked quarter, largely driven by the impact of strong Domestic Card purchase volume on noninterest income and the absence of the mark on our Snowflake investment a quarter ago. 
Period-end loans held for investment grew $6.5 billion or 3%, inclusive of the effect of moving $4.1 billion of loans to held-for-sale during the quarter. The loans moved to held-for-sale consisted of $2.6 billion of an international card partnership portfolio and $1.5 billion in commercial loans. 
Turning to Slide 4, I will cover the changes in our allowance in the quarter. We released $1.7 billion of allowance primarily driven by observed strong credit performance and an improved economic outlook. 
Turning to Slide 5. We provide the allowance coverage ratios by segment. You can see allowance coverage declined in the quarter across all segments largely reflecting the dynamics I just described. However, coverage ratios remain well above pre-pandemic levels due to continued economic uncertainty as our allowance is built to absorb a wide range of outcomes. 
Our Domestic Card coverage is now 8.9%, down from 10.5% last quarter. Our branded card coverage is 10.1%. Recall that the difference between branded and domestic coverage is largely driven by the loss sharing agreements in some of our partnership portfolios. 
Coverage in our consumer business declined about 60 basis points to 3.0%. In addition to continued strong credit performance and improved economic outlook, historically high auto values aided the reduction in coverage. Coverage in our Commercial Banking business declined about 25 basis points to 1.7%, with the single largest driver being the improvement in our energy portfolio. 
Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first -- during the quarter was 141%. The LCR continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Our liquidity reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately $137 billion. The $14 billion decline in total liquidity was driven by lower ending cash balances. Our cash position declined in the quarter as it was redeployed to net loan growth, wholesale funding maturities, a modest increase in our securities portfolio and share repurchases. 
Moving to Page 7. I'll now discuss net interest margin. You can see that our second quarter net interest margin was 5.89%, 10 basis points lower than the prior quarter. The linked-quarter decline in NIM was largely driven by lower yield in our card portfolio, where the typical seasonal decrease in revolve rate was exacerbated by higher transactor volume and associated higher payments. These impacts were partially offset by the favorable impact from 1 more day in the quarter. 
Lastly, turning to Slide 8, I will cover our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.5% at the end of the second quarter, down 10 basis points from the first quarter. Loan growth and capital actions were largely offset by earnings growth. 
During the quarter, the Federal Reserve released the results of their stress test. Our stress capital buffer requirement, which will be effective on October 1 of this year, is 2.5%, resulting in a total capital requirement by the Fed of 7.0%. While we saw a decline in this year's SCB, it's important to note that the Fed's stress testing results can move around meaningfully from year to year and are only one of many factors that we use in our capital planning process. Based on our internal modeling, we continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%. 
Turning to share repurchases. We repurchased $1.7 billion of common stock in the second quarter, the full amount allowed under the Fed's capital preservation measures. We have approximately $5.3 billion remaining of our current Board authorization of $7.5 billion. 
Now let me move on to dividends. In the third quarter of 2020, we reduced our dividend to $0.10 due to the Fed's capital preservation measures. We chose to continue this reduced level of dividend in the fourth quarter of 2020 out of an abundance of caution. The difference between our historical $0.40 dividend and the reduced level for those 2 quarters was $0.60 per common share. Therefore, we expect to make up for the reduced level of dividends from the second half of 2020 by paying a $0.60 special dividend in the third quarter of 2021. 
In addition to the special dividend, we expect to increase our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.40 per share to $0.60 per share in the third quarter. Both the $0.60 special dividend and the increase of our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.60 will be subject to Board approval. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?"

I'll begin on Slide 10 with our credit card business. Strong year-over-year purchase volume growth drove an increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of 2020, more than offsetting a modest year-over-y",1180,"Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our credit card business. 
Strong year-over-year purchase volume growth drove an increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of 2020, more than offsetting a modest year-over-year decline in loan balances. And provision for credit losses improved significantly. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. 
Second quarter results reflect building momentum in our Domestic Card business. As we emerge from the pandemic, consumers are spending more and continuing to make elevated payments. Accelerating purchase volume growth partially offset the impact of historically high payment rates, resulting in strong revenue growth and a more modest year-over-year decline in loan balances. High payment rates are continuing to contribute to strikingly strong credit results. 
Domestic Card purchase volume for the second quarter was up 48% from the second quarter of 2020. Purchase volume was up 25% from the second quarter of 2019, which is an acceleration from the first quarter when we saw growth of 17% versus 2019. T&E spending continues to catch up to overall spending and accelerated through the second quarter. In June, T&E purchase volume was up 3% compared to June of 2019. 
At the end of the quarter, Domestic Card loan balances were down $4.1 billion or about 4% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of a partnership portfolio moved to held-for-sale last year, second quarter ending loans declined about 2% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending loans were up about 5%, ahead of typical seasonal growth of 2%. 
Credit performance remained strikingly strong. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.28%, a 225 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 1.68%, 106 basis points better than the prior year. Provision for credit losses improved by about $3.5 billion year-over-year. We swung from a large allowance build in the second quarter last year to a large allowance release this year. 
Let me turn to Domestic Card revenue margin. Purchase volume growth outpacing loan growth and strong credit were the key drivers of Domestic Card revenue margin, which was up 226 basis points year-over-year to 17.7%. Revenue margin increased over 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter, higher than our typical seasonal pattern. 
Total company marketing expense was $620 million in the quarter, up $347 million compared to the second quarter of 2020. Our choices in card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends. 
As we emerge from the pandemic, we're seeing strong originations and purchase volumes. Our growth opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. We are leaning further into marketing to drive future growth and continue to build our franchise. At the same time, we're keeping a watchful eye on the competitive environment, which is intensifying. Pulling up, our Domestic Card business continues to deliver significant value and build momentum. 
Slide 12 summarizes second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Auto growth and exceptional auto credit are the main themes in second quarter Consumer Banking results. 
Driven by auto, second quarter ending loans increased 12% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 12%. Auto originations were up 56% year-over-year and up 47% from the linked quarter. Pent-up demand and high auto prices drove a second quarter surge in growth across the auto marketplace. In the context of increased industry growth, our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continued to drive strong growth in our auto business. 
Second quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $4.4 billion or 2% year-over-year. Average deposits were up 9% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue increased 27% from the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and retail deposits. 
Second quarter provision for credit losses improved by $1.2 billion year-over-year, driven by an allowance release and lower charge-offs in our auto business. Credit results in our auto business are strikingly strong. Year-over-year, the second quarter charge-off rate improved 120 basis points to negative 0.12%, and the delinquency rate was essentially flat at 3.26%. In the quarter, elevated used car prices drove an increase in auction proceeds amplifying the normal seasonal benefit we see from tax refunds around this time of the year. As used vehicle prices normalize, they will become a headwind to the auto charge-off rate. we expect the auto charge-off rate to increase from the unusually low second quarter level. 
Moving to Slide 13, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Second quarter ending loan balances were down 5% year-over-year. Average loans were down 7%. Commercial line utilization continues to be down year-over-year, and we moved $1.5 billion of commercial real estate loans to held for sale. 
Quarterly average deposits increased 22% from the second quarter of 2020 and 5% from the linked quarter as middle market and government customers continued to hold elevated levels of liquidity. Second quarter revenue was up 3% from the prior year quarter and down 6% from the linked quarter. The linked-quarter decline is more than entirely driven by a onetime cost associated with moving the commercial real estate loans to held-for-sale. This decline was offset by an equivalent onetime gain in the other category and is therefore neutral to the company. Excluding this effect, Commercial Banking revenue would have increased about 13% year-over-year and 4% from the linked quarter. 
Provision for credit losses improved significantly compared to the second quarter of 2020, driven by a swing from an allowance build to an allowance release and a swing from net charge-offs to net recovery. In the second quarter, the Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was negative 11 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 7.6%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 1.0%. Our Commercial Banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our commercial capabilities. 
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning. Several key themes are evident in our second quarter results. Credit remains strikingly strong. Purchase volume and loans are rebounding. We are continuing to invest to propel our future results, and we're returning capital to our shareholders. 
We are seeing increasing near-term opportunities to build our Domestic Card business as we emerge from the pandemic. We are leaning further into marketing to seize these opportunities. We are also increasing our marketing for auto, national banking and our brand. 
We are now in the ninth year of a journey to build a modern technology company from the bottom of the tech stack up. Our progress is accelerating, and the stakes are rising. Competitor tech investments are increasing as technology is increasingly seen as an existential issue. The investment flowing into fintechs is nothing short of breathtaking. And the war for tech talent continues to escalate including levels of compensation. 
We continue to invest in technology and the opportunities that emerge as our transformation gains traction. Our modern technology is powering our current performance and setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking. 
And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

And as you know, government stimulus has been amplifying payment rates. And while these programs have been winding down, customer balance sheets are extremely healthy, and payment rates remain elevated. You can see the payment rate trends in our reported trust metrics. 
And while not a perfect reflection of our total portfolio, Q2 payment rates remain at historically high levels. And these high payment rates are muting balanced growth even as spend is very strong. And of course, the flip side of high payment rates is strikingly strong credit performance, which drives strong profitability and capital generation. So we actually are always happy when our customers are paying at high levels, and it's indicative of a healthy consumer, and those high payment rates correlate with the really strong credit results that we continue to see. 
We are -- if we look at monthly numbers, we can see, John, a little bit of easing of the payment rates. I don't know if that would be a trend to indicate. It certainly would be very plausible to me that as consumers now step up and spend more and more, and they're going out and returning, hopefully, back to normal, it would be a natural thing that payment rates would ease a little bit here and that also credit metrics would move towards normalizing a little bit. So I guess, John, I would say we've seen the earliest of indications of that still running at really quite a breathtaking level."

We installed in the founding days, what I call horizontal accounting, where we track every action and cohort and everything on a lifetime economic basis. And we measure before and during and afterward, to see how it's going. And that -- and so we always put organic at the top of the list. 
And here's a great example. I mean while every bank that's -- every national bank that's been created has come through many, many acquisitions. We've had some acquisitions in our journey, but we are really leaning into an organically driven national growth strategy in banking. So -- and as I said a few minutes ago, we see good organic growth opportunities, which are partly a function of the market and where it is right now and very much these opportunities stand on the shoulders of the technology that we've built and some of the innovation that we're rolling out. 
With respect to acquisitions, we're not putting any energy or strategic focus on doing bank acquisitions. What we are looking at is technology acquisitions. And really, in fact, there's a spectrum on the technology side with respect to fintechs and tech companies. On the continuum, at one end is just being a partner with them, and then the next notch on the continuum is being a partner and an investor in them. And you saw that with Snowflake, for example, and then there are sometimes acquisitions. All of those have -- we've been active in all of those places on the continuum over the last few years. And I'm struck by the traction and success that we're having. 
When we look back at some of the acquisitions of little fintechs, for example, and tech companies, we are very, very pleased with the performance. And in many ways, these things are generally outperforming. 
One of the big benefits that we have is that we have a modern tech stack, so do the fintechs or tech companies that we're buying. And so the integration and the compatibility, the ability to attract and then really retain the talent past the sort of the contractual period is something that I think leans in our favor. So lots of positives there. 
There's one big kind of elephant in the room with respect to acquisitions on the tech side, and that's the valuations. So we've recently gone to a few of these conversations and said, ""Love the company, but not at that price."" So we are very aware about the -- where pricing is. But strategically, I think if you kind of open the aperture and don't talk about necessarily this very moment, I think for Capital One, it's an organic-first strategy, but acquisitions in fintechs and tech companies at the right price, and they're usually be little ones, I think will help fill out our business and accelerate our opportunities."

Yes, but I think we -- it was a little echoey, but I think I felt I heard what you were saying there, Kevin. 
from where we are right now, which is at an extraordinary benign level that virtually has never been seen before in modern times, it's got a ways to go to normalize. We are not choosing to make a prediction on where that is, not because we want to be coy about it, but because, in fact, I think it's a hard thing to predict these days. 
What we like to talk about is the drivers. So talking about the drivers, the consumer is in a very strong place right now. And I think what's striking is -- and I mentioned this earlier, when you look at what the average consumer, and this is average because the experience for an individual consumer can be way different from what I'm describing on average. But the accumulated sort of surplus that consumers have been able to build up is something that even when the government stimulus monthly benefits ease, I think there is a bit of an accumulated balance there that will be beneficial for the credit performance of consumers. 
The -- so we -- there's really only one way for the credit to go from here, and that is in normalizing. I think it starts with a bit of a head start. And I think that the rate at which it normalizes is going to be pretty linked to consumers' choices on payment rates. And as I've mentioned earlier, I think it's a natural thing for payment rates to gradually decline and for credit to gradually normalize. 
The directions are inevitable. The timing is speculative. Our view is during this period of time, let's take advantage of the market opportunity that is here, the place the consumer is. But let's also be cognizant of how markets work, how credit markets work in particular and be on the lookout for some of the natural indicators of overheating."

And so within every single asset class, the mix is going to impact our coverage needs, and then you look at overall the balance sheet mix across each of those asset classes will impact things. 
So I look at all of those factors, and I don't think that the ratio at adoption is necessarily a destination. But I also think that if you put into the formula, like all of the economic assumptions and all of the asset mix, I still believe that the pre-pandemic coverage ratio can still serve as a very rough benchmark of what coverage ratios might look like.

Yes, Don, thank you. So let me talk about tech and the tech hiring. Winning in technology really kind of begins and ends with one thing, hiring world-class tech talent. And it is the easiest thing to talk about and possibly the hardest thing to pull",872,"Okay. Yes, Don, thank you. So let me talk about tech and the tech hiring. Winning in technology really kind of begins and ends with one thing, hiring world-class tech talent. And it is the easiest thing to talk about and possibly the hardest thing to pull off in business today as -- because while this principle is -- this talent principle is true in any business, it is profoundly true in technology as the demand for world-class tech talent vastly exceeds the supply. 
So we've built a tech brand and have had great success in attracting top talent, and we're competing head-to-head with the leading technology companies in the U.S. And we've been leaning into tech hiring for years, and this is a strong year of hiring. 
Most of the new roles we're hiring for are engineering roles in software development, cloud infrastructure and machine learning. And these are the most sought-after roles in the world, and we're getting real traction here. But essentially, if you pull way up and we -- it's more than just words when we say it, we've really been living this, which is to, from the ground up, build a technology company that does banking, essentially what Capital One is. The technology and data are increasingly what the business is. And at the heart of that journey is the tech talent. 
I also mentioned one other thing, Don, is that the cost of technology talent is visibly moving upward right in front of our eyes. And I wanted to flag that to investors. That is just something that, again, it's the natural consequence of the demand greatly exceeding the supply. But -- so I think it's going to be hard for most companies, for all companies to do hiring and get the numbers that they want. We are leaning into that. I think we're in a very good position, but it's -- we're going to need to pay appropriately for that talent. 
Don, you asked about fintechs and what we feel about fintechs and possibly a comment on the regulatory side. I just have a tremendous interest in fintechs and maybe that's because Capital One was an original fintech before there was such a word. And I look at the fintech marketplace, and I think some of these fintechs are bringing great innovations to the market. And we very carefully study these innovations. And I think that we look at these both as threats to our business. We look at them as opportunities. Maybe we can partner with the fintechs. In some cases, there are acquisitions associated with that. And in some cases, what they're doing are beacons of opportunity that we can pursue. 
The fintechs today, I think what banks have to stare at is that fintechs today are benefiting from their modern cloud-based technologies and their innovative and entrepreneurial approach to disrupting markets, the tremendous amount of funding that is out there. I mean, for example, these days, the venture capital funding going into fintechs is close to it, I think. I don't have this data right in front of me, but it's close to double the next category in terms of the amount of venture funding going into this. So this is pretty electrifying. And the fintechs benefit from a lower level of regulation than financial institutions have. 
Now I don't think right now the success of fintechs that one can look at fintech and say the primary reason they're succeeding in areas sometimes more than the banks are is because they are less regulated. I think they're succeeding for the factors that we talked about. I think when you look over time and envision these fintechs with tremendous growth and being larger, it is an elephant in the room relative to what's the regulatory context, the capital that they're going to be carrying, the regulatory requirements and the levelness of the playing field. So we certainly have a watchful eye on that. 
But when we look at the fintechs, the success we're seeing in them, to me, is indicative of the opportunity that exists to reimagine banking. And that's what we've been focused on for years. And then if we kind of take our focus off fintech for a minute and think about Capital One, like the fintechs, we have a modern technology infrastructure based in the cloud. We also have other benefits they don't have, most of them, we have tremendous customer scale, a powerful brand and literally decades of underwriting and banking experience. 
So when I pull up, I think we and the fintechs are well positioned for success; in some ways for the same reasons, in some ways for different reasons. But I think the biggest takeaway of all of this is that the banking industry is changing on an accelerated basis. The competition is unbelievably and increasingly well funded. And we look at that and we say, it indicates the magnitude of change, the magnitude of the opportunity, but it also is an indicator, an imperative that we need to make sure that during the windows of opportunity that we lean in and invest where we need to invest because these opportunities won't last forever. Thank you, Don."

And that you just can feel in a sense the world pent-up and just bursting out. And I think that's sort of the biggest news that we see inside our numbers as we look at it. 
The subprime business, I think, has been more characteristic of, in general, the sort of mass market of America, and that is that things have not been as dramatic in terms of pullbacks nor are they as dramatic in terms of leaning in. But we've just continued to take the same strategy we've had in the subprime business, really in the prime business for years. And we are carefully leaning into originations and growing the underlying franchise and then at the right opportunities, raising the lines when we feel that the opportunity and the conditions warrant. So we continue to lean into originations really across our business. And we are opening up credit lines, gradually opening up credit lines because we see good results. 
The consumer is in a pretty good position. Our customers are in a good place. And you remember, Sanjay, we talked about the sort of years of holding back on that.

And so that's where we are on the marke",827,"Okay. Well, first, a word on marketing. As I said to Betsy, we are leaning into the marketing right now and sort of leaning a little further into it because what we do is always so Windows-driven, as you know, Ryan. And so that's where we are on the marketing side. So from an efficiency point of view, you notice pretty high levels of spending on marketing. That -- marketing goes up, marketing goes down, but that, at the moment, has been more on the upside. 
Let me turn -- and one thing I want to say about competition, if I could, just because this is very relevant to these growth conversations and then I'll pivot to the efficiency point. 
There -- most competitors have been -- the feel of their earnings calls is they, too, are leaning in to the opportunities that they see at the moment. And we see this. We see competition heating up all around us, especially in rewards, where typically, that's kind of the flash points where you see these things the most. But you see it in the marketing and the media activity. We see it in direct mail numbers. We see it in the rewards offerings and the heating up of some of that. 
The competition is intense right now, Ryan, but it's not yet irrational. But I want to just kind of take the moment to reflect on what I call sort of the physics of competitive cycles because I've seen this enough. It's pretty much you can count on these things happening. 
Now timing is always the question. But right now, credit is historically good across the industry and the consumer is in great shape. The longer this persists, the more competition will likely be to extrapolate these trends to inform their decision making. And this can embolden them to make more aggressive offers, market more intensely and a particular one I worry about, loosening underwriting standards. 
And in this particular environment, the benign rearview mirror could encourage lenders to reach for growth, and it could be exacerbated by credit modeling that relies on consumer credit data that, frankly, may be very unique to the downturn and not as good for predicting where credit performance is going to be over time. 
Ryan, if you're building a credit model right now and you're looking back at the data on the last year or 2. What are you going to do with that with respect to what that tells you about the next time things turn down. So -- the -- and there's also a lot of earnings and capital and liquidity in the system. And then you've got the fintechs that are really revving up, as I talked about earlier. 
So the -- we -- even as we're leaning into this opportunity, we remind ourselves every day that the seeds for the next challenges coming up in the credit cycle as opposed to the economic cycle in the credit cycle, these seeds are being planted right now. And so what we do is we don't just look at our models to make decisions. We pull way up, and we have a very watchful eye for the key indicators of these, not only likely basically inevitable. Things do happen and then we will act accordingly. We just never want to be surprised. 
Let me turn to talk about operating efficiency. We've been focused on improving our operating efficiency ratio for years. And from 2013 to 2019, we delivered 400 basis points of improvement with a combination of revenue growth and tight expense management. And of course, the pandemic interrupted our progress, particularly on revenue growth. 
Now as it turns out, the pandemic also accelerated the technology race and raised the stakes for all players across many industries and frankly, particularly in banking. And so as I talked about earlier, I think everyone can feel the clock ticking, companies, everybody in banking feeling the clock ticking on their tech readiness, the investment flowing into fintechs, the arms race for talent. And so we are struck by the emerging opportunities in the marketplace. They're significant but the windows aren't unlimited. So we feel we're very well positioned on this. But we are continuing to invest in this moment in our technology and in the opportunities that we see out there. 
So meanwhile, we continue to focus on operating efficiency. Our tech transformation is the engine of long-term efficiency gains, both through revenue growth and digital productivity gains. So continuing to invest in our technology opportunities and driving for efficiency improvements are on a shared path. 
So we're still driving toward the same destination of operating efficiency, but the timing of operating efficiency improvement needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace. And delivering positive operating leverage over time continues to be one of the important payoffs of our technology journey and a key element of how we deliver long-term shareholder value."

And I think the whole banking industry and the investment community has really sort of collectively gone through and learned an important lesson here about the metric that really honestly was talked about that much, which is payment rates and the profound impact payment rates has on both loan growth and in fact, credit performance. 
And the striking thing is it's not only empirical that relationship, but it's intuitive as well, which to me really reinforces there's something very important here. Now as I've said to you, we kind of root for higher payment rates because I think it reflects a healthier consumer even -- and we get paid on the credit side and sometimes pay very well, as you can see here. But it is a natural thing that will happen over time. The normalization of credit will very likely come along with the lowering of payment rates. And that, in turn, is likely sort of mathematically all other things being equal, that will be a boost to loan growth. 
So when you say, well -- but I think for those numbers to move significantly enough to, in fact, have loan growth lead the rate of growth relative to metrics like spending and some of the other things or for us, originations and things like that, that's kind of quite a journey to do to get there. I'm not saying that it won't. But I wouldn't run to the bank counting on a loan growth topping the lead tables of the various growth metrics. 
But I think what is baking, what really essentially is baking in the oven is a gradual normalization of credit correspondingly; for the same reason, a lowering of payment rates. And we are probably seeing the very early sort of on a monthly basis, the very early indicators of that phenomenon."

And so rather than say these 3 here are the priority, let's go see what we can partner with or buy. What we do is we massively study the fintech marketplace across all the areas that we are also leaning into. Frankly, we study it beyond that because we can learn a lot. 
So -- and then what we do is the sheer learning alone is worth the effort. And so we go to school on this, and we try to say, well -- a bunch of times, we say, ""Well, look at that, they thought of that idea. We didn't Capital One very good or bad. But look, let's see what we can learn from that.

And so every once in a while, we do an acquisition and -- but there is a lot of focus on that particular business model. We always ask ourselves, ""Could we build that rather than buy it?"" And then we really look hard at the talent because in the end, what really has made our most successful acquisitions has been that the talent comes and stays and leads becomes leading executives in the company. And so that's how it works. And a lot of times, we don't buy anything, but we always come out having learned a lot, Bob. Thank you."

I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $3.5 billion or $7.62 per diluted common share.

In the second quarter, Capital One earned $3.5 billion or $7.62 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter was a $55 million legal reserve build. Net of this adjusting item, earnings per share in the quarter was $7.71.
On a GAAP basis, pre-provision earnings increased slightly in the sequential quarter to $3.4 billion. We recorded a provision benefit of $1.2 billion in the quarter as $541 million of charge-offs was offset by a $1.7 billion allowance release.
Revenue grew 4% in the linked quarter, largely driven by the impact of strong Domestic Card purchase volume on noninterest income and the absence of the mark on our Snowflake investment a quarter ago.
Period-end loans held for investment grew $6.5 billion or 3%, inclusive of the effect of moving $4.1 billion of loans to held-for-sale during the quarter. The loans moved to held-for-sale consisted of $2.6 billion of an International Card partnership portfolio and $1.5 billion in commercial loans.
Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in the quarter. We released $1.7 billion of allowance, primarily driven by observed strong credit performance and an improved economic outlook.
Turning to Slide 5. We provide the allowance coverage ratios by segment. You can see allowance coverage declined in the quarter across all segments, largely reflecting the dynamics I just described. However, coverage ratios remain well above pre-pandemic levels due to continued economic uncertainty as our allowance is built to absorb a wide range of outcomes.
Our Domestic Card coverage is now 8.9%, down from 10.5% last quarter. Our branded card coverage is 10.1%. Recall that the difference between branded and domestic coverage is largely driven by the loss sharing agreements in some of our partnership portfolios.
Coverage in our consumer business declined about 60 basis points to 3.0%. In addition to continued strong credit performance and improved economic outlook, historically high auto values aided the reduction in coverage. Coverage in our Commercial Banking business declined about 25 basis points to 1.7%, with the single largest driver being the improvement in our energy portfolio.
Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first -- during the quarter was 141%. The LCR continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Our liquidity reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately $137 billion. The $14 billion decline in total liquidity was driven by lower ending cash balances. Our cash position declined in the quarter as it was redeployed to net loan growth, wholesale funding maturities, a modest increase in our securities portfolio and share repurchases.
Moving to Page 7. I'll now discuss net interest margin. You can see that our second quarter net interest margin was 5.89%, 10 basis points lower than the prior quarter. The linked-quarter decline in NIM was largely driven by lower yield in our card portfolio, where the typical seasonal decrease in revolve rate was exacerbated by higher transactor volume and associated higher payments. These impacts were partially offset by the favorable impact from 1 more day in the quarter.
Lastly, turning to Slide 8. I will cover our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.5% at the end of the second quarter, down 10 basis points from the first quarter. Loan growth and capital actions were largely offset by earnings growth.
During the quarter, the Federal Reserve released the results of their stress test. Our stress capital buffer requirement, which will be effective on October 1 of this year, is 2.5%, resulting in a total capital requirement by the Fed of 7.0%. While we saw a decline in this year's SCB, it's important to note that the Fed's stress testing results can move around meaningfully from year to year and are only one of many factors that we use in our capital planning process. Based on our internal modeling, we continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%.
Turning to share repurchases. We repurchased $1.7 billion of common stock in the second quarter, the full amount allowed under the Fed's capital preservation measures. We have approximately $5.3 billion remaining of our current Board authorization of $7.5 billion.
Now let me move on to dividends. In the third quarter of 2020, we reduced our dividend to $0.10 due to the Fed's capital preservation measures. We chose to continue this reduced level of dividend in the fourth quarter of 2020 out of an abundance of caution. The difference between our historical $0.40 dividend and the reduced level for those 2 quarters was $0.60 per common share. Therefore, we expect to make up for the reduced level of dividends from the second half of 2020 by paying a $0.60 special dividend in the third quarter of 2021.
In addition to the special dividend, we expect to increase our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.40 per share to $0.60 per share in the third quarter. Both the $0.60 special dividend and the increase of our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.60 will be subject to Board approval.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?"

I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business.
Strong year-over-year purchase volume growth drove an increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of 2020, more than offsetting a modest year-over-year decline in loan balances. And provision for credit losses improved significantly. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our Domestic Card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11.
Second quarter results reflect building momentum in our Domestic Card business. As we emerge from the pandemic, consumers are spending more and continuing to make elevated payments. Accelerating purchase volume growth partially offset the impact of historically high payment rates, resulting in strong revenue growth and a more modest year-over-year decline in loan balances. High payment rates are continuing to contribute to strikingly strong credit results.
Domestic Card purchase volume for the second quarter was up 48% from the second quarter of 2020. Purchase volume was up 25% from the second quarter of 2019, which is an acceleration from the first quarter when we saw growth of 17% versus 2019. T&E spending continues to catch up to overall spending and accelerated through the second quarter. In June, T&E purchase volume was up 3% compared to June of 2019.
At the end of the quarter, Domestic Card loan balances were down $4.1 billion or about 4% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of a partnership portfolio moved to held-for-sale last year, second quarter ending loans declined about 2% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending loans were up about 5%, ahead of typical seasonal growth of 2%.
Credit performance remained strikingly strong. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.28%, a 225 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 1.68%, 106 basis points better than the prior year. Provision for credit losses improved by about $3.5 billion year-over-year. We swung from a large allowance build in the second quarter last year to a large allowance release this year.
Let me turn to Domestic Card revenue margin. Purchase volume growth outpacing loan growth and strong credit were the key drivers of Domestic Card revenue margin, which was up 226 basis points year-over-year to 17.7%. Revenue margin increased over 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter, higher than our typical seasonal pattern.
Total company marketing expense was $620 million in the quarter, up $347 million compared to the second quarter of 2020. Our choices in card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends.
As we emerge from the pandemic, we're seeing strong originations and purchase volumes. Our growth opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. We are leaning further into marketing to drive future growth and continue to build our franchise. At the same time, we're keeping a watchful eye on the competitive environment, which is intensifying. Pulling up, our Domestic Card business continues to deliver significant value and build momentum.
Slide 12 summarizes second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Auto growth and exceptional auto credit are the main themes in second quarter Consumer Banking results. Driven by auto, second quarter ending loans increased 12% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 12%. Auto originations were up 56% year-over-year and up 47% from the linked quarter. Pent-up demand and high auto prices drove a second quarter surge in growth across the auto marketplace. In the context of increased industry growth, our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continued to drive strong growth in our auto business.
Second quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $4.4 billion or 2% year-over-year. Average deposits were up 9% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue increased 27% from the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and retail deposits.
Second quarter provision for credit losses improved by $1.2 billion year-over-year, driven by an allowance release and lower charge-offs in our auto business. Credit results in our auto business are strikingly strong. Year-over-year, the second quarter charge-off rate improved 120 basis points to negative 0.12%, and the delinquency rate was essentially flat at 3.26%. 
In the quarter, elevated used car prices drove an increase in auction proceeds, amplifying the normal seasonal benefit we see from tax refunds around this time of the year. As used vehicle prices normalize, they will become a headwind to the auto charge-off rate. we expect the auto charge-off rate to increase from the unusually low second quarter level.
Moving to Slide 13. I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Second quarter ending loan balances were down 5% year-over-year. Average loans were down 7%. Commercial line utilization continues to be down year-over-year, and we moved $1.5 billion of commercial real estate loans to held-for-sale. Quarterly average deposits increased 22% from the second quarter of 2020 and 5% from the linked quarter as middle market and government customers continue to hold elevated levels of liquidity.
Second quarter revenue was up 3% from the prior year quarter and down 6% from the linked quarter. The linked quarter decline is more than entirely driven by a onetime cost associated with moving the commercial real estate loans to held for sale. This decline was offset by an equivalent onetime gain in the other category and is therefore neutral to the company. Excluding this effect, Commercial Banking revenue would have increased about 13% year-over-year and 4% from the linked quarter. 
Provision for credit losses improved significantly compared to the second quarter of 2020, driven by a swing from an allowance build to an allowance release and a swing from net charge-offs to net recoveries. In the second quarter, the Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was negative 11 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 7.6%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 1.0%. Our Commercial Banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our commercial capabilities. 
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning. Several key themes are evident in our second quarter results. Credit remains strikingly strong. Purchase volume and loans are rebounding. We're continuing to invest to propel our future results, and we're returning capital to our shareholders. We are seeing increasing near-term opportunities to build our Domestic Card business as we emerge from the pandemic. We are leaning further into marketing to seize these opportunities. We are also increasing our marketing for auto, national banking and our brand. 
We are now in the ninth year of a journey to build a modern technology company from the bottom of the tech stack up. Our progress is accelerating, and the stakes are rising. Competitor tech investments are increasing as technology is increasingly seen as an existential issue. The investment flowing into fintechs is nothing short of breathtaking. And the war for tech talent continues to escalate, including levels of compensation. We continue to invest in technology and the opportunities that emerge as our transformation gains traction. Our modern technology is powering our current performance and setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking. 
And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

And as you know, government stimulus has been amplifying payment rates. And while these programs have been winding down, customer balance sheets are extremely healthy, and payment rates remain elevated. You can see the payment rate trends in our reported trust metrics.
And while not a perfect reflection of our total portfolio, Q2 payment rates remain at historically high levels. And these high payment rates are muting balanced growth even as spend is very strong. And of course, the flip side of high payment rates is strikingly strong credit performance, which drives strong profitability and capital generation. So we actually are always happy when our customers are paying at high levels, and it's indicative of a healthy consumer, and those high payment rates correlate with the really strong credit results that we continue to see.
We are -- if we look at monthly numbers, we can see, John, a little bit of easing of the payment rates. I don't know if that would be a trend to indicate. It certainly would be very plausible to me that as consumers now step up and spend more and more and they're going out and returning, hopefully, back to normal, it would be a natural thing that payment rates would ease a little bit here and that also credit metrics would move towards normalizing a little bit. So I guess, John, I would say we've seen the earliest of indications of that still running at really quite a breathtaking level."

We installed in the founding days what I call horizontal accounting, where we track every action and cohort and everything on a lifetime economic basis. And we measure it before and during and afterward to see how it's going. And that -- and so we always put organic at the top of the list.
And here's a great example. I mean while every bank that's -- every national bank that's been created has come through many, many acquisitions, we've had some acquisitions in our journey, but we are really leaning into an organically driven national growth strategy in banking. So -- and as I said a few minutes ago, we see good organic growth opportunities, which are partly a function of the market and where it is right now and very much these opportunities stand on the shoulders of the technology that we've built and some of the innovation that we're rolling out.
With respect to acquisitions, we're not putting any energy or strategic focus on doing bank acquisitions. What we are looking at is technology acquisitions. And really, in fact, there's a spectrum on the technology side with respect to fintechs and tech companies. On the continuum, at one end is just being a partner with them, and then the next notch on the continuum is being a partner and an investor in them. And you saw that with Snowflake, for example, and then there are sometimes acquisitions.
All of those have -- we've been active in all of those places on the continuum over the last few years. And I'm struck by the traction and success that we're having. When we look back at some of the acquisitions of little fintechs, for example, and tech companies, we are very, very pleased with the performance. And in many ways, these things are generally outperforming.
One of the big benefits that we have is that we have a modern tech stack, so do the fintechs or tech companies that we're buying. And so the integration and the compatibility, the ability to attract and then really retain the talent past the sort of the contractual period is something that I think leans in our favor. So lots of positives there.
There's one big kind of elephant in the room with respect to acquisitions on the tech side, and that's the valuations. So we've recently gone to a few of these conversations and said, ""Love the company but not at that price."" So we are very aware about the -- where pricing is. But strategically, I think if you kind of open the aperture and don't talk about necessarily this very moment, I think for Capital One, it's an organic-first strategy, but acquisitions of fintechs and tech companies at the right price, and they'll usually be little ones, I think, will help fill out our business and accelerate our opportunities."

But I think we -- it was a little echoey, but I think I felt I heard what you were saying there, Kevin. From where we are right now, which is at an extraordinary benign level that virtually has never been seen before in modern times, it's got ways to go to normalize. We are not choosing to make a prediction on where that is, not because we want to be coy about it but because, in fact, I think it's a hard thing to predict these days.
What we like to talk about is the drivers. So talking about the drivers, the consumer is in a very strong place right now. And I think what's striking is -- and I mentioned this earlier, when you look at what the average consumer -- and this is average because the experience for an individual consumer can be way different from what I'm describing on average. But the accumulated sort of surplus that consumers have been able to build up is something that even when the government stimulus monthly benefits ease, I think there is a bit of an accumulated balance there that will be beneficial for the credit performance of consumers.
The -- so we -- there's really only one way for the credit to go from here, and that is in normalizing. I think it starts with a bit of a head start. And I think that the rate at which it normalizes is going to be pretty linked to consumers' choices on payment rates. And as I've mentioned earlier, I think it's a natural thing for payment rates to gradually decline and for credit to gradually normalize.
The directions are inevitable. The timing is speculative. Our view is during this period of time, let's take advantage of the market opportunity that is here, the place the consumer is. But let's also be cognizant of how markets work, how credit markets work in particular and be on the lookout for some of the natural indicators of overheating."

So I look at all of those factors, and I don't think that the ratio at adoption is necessarily a destination. But I also think that if you put into the formula, like all of the economic assumptions and all of the asset mix, I still believe that the pre-pandemic coverage ratio can still serve as a very rough benchmark of what coverage ratios might look like.

And it is the easiest thing to talk about and possibly the hardest thing to pull",875,"Okay. Yes, Don, thank you. So let me talk about tech and the tech hiring. Winning in technology really kind of begins and ends with one thing, hiring world-class tech talent. And it is the easiest thing to talk about and possibly the hardest thing to pull off in business today as -- because while this principle is -- this talent principle is true in any business, it is profoundly true in technology as the demand for world-class tech talent vastly exceeds the supply.
So we've built a tech brand and have had great success in attracting top talent, and we're competing head-to-head with the leading technology companies in the U.S. And we've been leaning into tech hiring for years, and this is a strong year of hiring.
Most of the new roles we're hiring for are engineering roles in software development, cloud infrastructure and machine learning. And these are the most sought-after roles in the world, and we're getting real traction here. But essentially, if you pull way up and we -- it's more than just words when we say it. We've really been living this, which is to, from the ground up, build a technology company that does banking, essentially what Capital One is. The technology and data are increasingly what the business is. And at the heart of that journey is the tech talent.
I also mentioned one other thing, Don, is that the cost of technology talent is visibly moving upward right in front of our eyes. And I wanted to flag that to investors. That is just something that, again, it's the natural consequence of the demand greatly exceeding the supply. But -- so I think it's going to be hard for most companies -- for all companies to do hiring and get the numbers that they want. We are leaning into that. I think we're in a very good position, but it's -- we're going to need to pay appropriately for that talent.
Don, you asked about fintechs and what we feel about fintechs and possibly a comment on the regulatory side. I just have a tremendous interest in fintechs, and maybe that's because Capital One was an original fintech before there was such a word. And I look at the fintech marketplace, and I think some of these fintechs are bringing great innovations to the market. 
And we very carefully study these innovations. And I think that we look at these both as threats to our business. We look at them as opportunities. Maybe we can partner with the fintechs. In some cases, there are acquisitions associated with that. And in some cases, what they're doing are beacons of opportunity that we can pursue.
The fintechs today, I think what banks have to stare at is that fintechs today are benefiting from their modern cloud-based technologies and their innovative and entrepreneurial approach to disrupting markets, the tremendous amount of funding that is out there. I mean for example, these days, the venture capital funding going into fintechs is close to -- I think, I don't have this data right in front of me, but it's close to double the next category in terms of the amount of venture funding going into this. So this is pretty electrifying. And the fintechs benefit from a lower level of regulation than financial institutions have.
Now I don't think right now the success of fintechs that one can look at fintech and say the primary reason they're succeeding in areas sometimes more than the banks are is because they are less regulated. I think they're succeeding for the factors that we talked about. I think when you look over time and envision these fintechs with tremendous growth and being large disrupters, it is an elephant in the room relative to what's the regulatory context, the capital that they're going to be carrying, the regulatory requirements and the levelness of the playing field. So we certainly have a watchful eye on that.
But when we look at the fintechs, the success we're seeing in them, to me, is indicative of the opportunity that exists to reimagine banking. And that's what we've been focused on for years. And then if we kind of take our focus off fintech for a minute and think about Capital One, like the fintechs, we have a modern technology infrastructure based in the cloud. We also have other benefits they don't have, most of them. We have tremendous customer scale, a powerful brand and literally decades of underwriting and banking experience.
So when I pull up, I think we and the fintechs are well positioned for success, in some ways for the same reasons, in some ways for different reasons. But I think the biggest takeaway of all of this is that the banking industry is changing on an accelerated basis. The competition is unbelievably and increasingly well funded. And we look at that and we say it indicates the magnitude of change, the magnitude of the opportunity, but it also is a -- indicates an imperative that we need to make sure that during the windows of opportunity that we lean in and invest where we need to invest because these opportunities won't last forever. Thank you, Don."

And I think that's sort of the biggest news that we see inside our numbers as we look at it.
The subprime business, I think, has been more characteristic of, in general, the sort of mass market of America. And that is that things have not been as dramatic in terms of pullbacks nor are they as dramatic in terms of leaning in. But we've just continued to take the same strategy we've had in the subprime business, really in the prime business for years. And we are carefully leaning into originations and growing the underlying franchise and then at the right opportunities, raising the lines when we feel that the opportunity and the conditions warrant. 
So we continue to lean into originations really across our business. And we are opening up credit lines -- gradually opening up credit lines because we see good results. The consumer is in a pretty good position. Our customers are in a good place. And you remember, Sanjay, we talked about the sort of years of holding back on that. It's not like we're unleashing with credit lines right now, but we are sort of net-net, more on the opening up side than the tightening side at the moment.

Well, first, a word on marketing.

As I said to Betsy, we are leaning into the marketing right now and sort of leaning a little further into it because what we do is always so Windows-driven, as you know, Ryan. And so that's where we are on the marketing side. So from an efficiency point of view, you notice pretty high levels of spending on marketing. That -- marketing goes up. Marketing goes down. But that, at the moment, has been more on the upside.
Let me turn -- and one thing I want to say about competition, if I could, just because this is very relevant to these growth conversations. And then I'll pivot to the efficiency point. There -- most competitors have been -- the feel of their earnings calls is they, too, are leaning in to the opportunities that they see at the moment. And we see this. We see competition heating up all around us, especially in rewards, where typically, that's kind of the flash points where you see these things the most. But you see it in the marketing and the media activity. We see it in direct mail numbers. We see it in the rewards offerings and the heating up of some of that.
The competition is intense right now, Ryan, but it's not yet irrational. But I want to just kind of take the moment to reflect on what I call sort of the physics of competitive cycles because I've seen this enough that it's pretty much you can count on these things happening.
Now timing is always the question. But right now, credit is historically good across the industry, and the consumer is in great shape. The longer this persists, the more competition will likely be to extrapolate these trends to inform their decision making. And this can embolden them to make more aggressive offers, market more intensely and a particular one I worry about, loosening underwriting standards.
And in this particular environment, the benign rearview mirror could encourage lenders to reach for growth. And it could be exacerbated by credit modeling that relies on consumer credit data that, frankly, may be very unique to the downturn and not as good for predicting where credit performance is going to be over time.
Ryan, if you're building a credit model right now and you're looking back at the data on the last year or 2, what are you going to do with that with respect to what that tells you about the next time things turn down? So the -- and there's also a lot of earnings and capital and liquidity in the system. And then you've got the fintechs that are really revving up, as I talked about earlier.
So the -- we -- even as we're leaning into this opportunity, we remind ourselves every day that the seeds for the next challenges coming up in the credit cycle as opposed to the economic cycle, in the credit cycle, these seeds are being planted right now. And so what we do is we don't just look at our models to make decisions. We pull way up, and we have a very watchful eye for the key indicators of these, not only likely, basically inevitable things to happen. And then we will act accordingly. We just never want to be surprised.
Let me turn to talk about operating efficiency. We've been focused on improving our operating efficiency ratio for years. And from 2013 to 2019, we delivered 400 basis points of improvement with a combination of revenue growth and tight expense management. And of course, the pandemic interrupted our progress, particularly on revenue growth.
Now as it turns out, the pandemic also accelerated the technology race and raised the stakes for all players across many industries and, frankly, particularly in banking. And so as I talked about earlier, I think everyone can feel the clock ticking, companies, everybody in banking feeling the clock ticking on their tech readiness, the investment flowing into fintechs, the arms race for talent. And so we are struck by the emerging opportunities in the marketplace. They're significant but the windows aren't unlimited. 
So we feel we're very well positioned on this, but we are continuing to invest in this moment in our technology and in the opportunities that we see out there. So meanwhile, we continue to focus on operating efficiency. Our tech transformation is the engine of long-term efficiency gains, both through revenue growth and digital productivity gains. So continuing to invest in our technology opportunities and driving for efficiency improvements are on a shared path.
So we're still driving toward the same destination of operating efficiency, but the timing of operating efficiency improvement needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace. And delivering positive operating leverage over time continues to be one of the important payoffs of our technology journey and a key element of how we deliver long-term shareholder value."

And I think the whole",351,"I think one of the things that I think the banking industry -- I mean we've talked about this relationship between payment rates and growth from time to time, but I think it's been more of an occasional conversation with The Street. And I think the whole banking industry and the investment community has really sort of collectively gone through and learned an important lesson here about the metric that really honestly wasn't talked about that much, which is payment rates and the profound impact payment rates has on both loan growth and, in fact, credit performance.
And the striking thing is it's not only empirical, that relationship, but it's intuitive as well, which to me really reinforces there's something very important here. Now as I've said to you, we kind of root for higher payment rates because I think it reflects a healthier consumer even -- and we get paid on the credit side and sometimes paid very well, as you can see here. But it is a natural thing that will happen over time. The normalization of credit will very likely come along with the lowering of payment rates. And that, in turn, is likely -- sort of mathematically, all other things being equal, that will be a boost to loan growth.
So when you say, well -- but I think for those numbers to move significantly enough to, in fact, have loan growth lead the race of growth relative to metrics like spending and some of the other things or, for us, originations and things like that, that's kind of quite a journey to do to get there. I'm not saying that it won't. But I wouldn't run to the bank counting on a loan growth topping the league tables of the various growth metrics.
But I think what is baking -- what really essentially is baking in the oven is a gradual normalization of credit correspondingly, for the same reason, a lowering of payment rates. And we are probably seeing the very early -- sort of on a monthly basis, the very early indicators of that phenomenon."

And so rather than say these 3 here are the priority, let's go see what we can partner with or buy, what we do is we massively study the fintech marketplace across all the areas that we are also leaning into. Frankly, we study it beyond that because we can learn a lot.
So -- and then what we do is -- the sheer learning alone is worth the effort. And so we go to school on this, and we try to say, well -- a bunch of times, we say, well, look at that. They thought of that idea. We didn't at Capital One. Very good. Our bad. But look, let's see what we can learn from that.
And -- but also along the way, we look across that continuum of partnering, investing or buying these things. But as we really look from the other end of the telescope, rather than what we need, what we look for is what do we find and especially what do we find relative to a company with the talent and the culture and the business model that would be really accelerative to us.
And so every once in a while, we do an acquisition, and -- but there is a lot of focus on that particular business model. We always ask ourselves, could we build that rather than buy it? And then we really look hard at the talent because in the end, what really has made our most successful acquisitions has been that the talent comes and stays and leads, becomes leading executives in the company. And so that's how it works. And a lot of times, we don't buy anything, but we always come out having learned a lot, Bob. Thank you."

I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the third quarter, Capital One earned $3.1 billion or $6.78 per diluted common share. Included in our results for the quarter was a $45 million legal reserve b",716,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the third quarter, Capital One earned $3.1 billion or $6.78 per diluted common share. Included in our results for the quarter was a $45 million legal reserve build. Net of this adjusting item, earnings per share in the quarter were $6.86. 
On a GAAP basis, pre-provision earnings were $3.6 billion, an increase of 7% relative to a quarter ago. Period-end loans held for investment grew $11.8 billion or 5% as we had strong loan growth across all of our businesses. Recall that we moved $4.1 billion of loans to held for sale late in the second quarter so average loans in the third quarter grew more modestly at 3%. 
Revenue increased 6% in the linked quarter, largely driven by the loan growth I just described, coupled with margin expansion in our Card business. Operating expenses grew 3% in the quarter, with total noninterest expense increasing 6%. In addition to strong pre-provision earnings, the P&L was aided by a provision benefit in the quarter as record low charge-offs were more than offset by an allowance release. 
Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. We released $770 million of allowance in the third quarter as the effects of continued actual strong credit performance and a reduction in qualitative factors drove a decline in allowance balance, which was partially offset by loan growth in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 5. You can see our allowance coverage ratios continue to decline across all of our segments, driven by the factors I just described. 
Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 143%.  The LCR remained stable and continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Our liquidity reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately $124 billion, down $13 billion from the prior quarter as we continue to run off excess liquidity built during the pandemic. 
The 9% decline in total liquidity was driven by a modest reduction in the size of our investment portfolio and $8 billion in lower ending cash balances, which were used to fund loan growth and share repurchases. The decline in cash balances had an impact on our NIM, which I will discuss in more detail on Page 7. 
You can see that our third quarter net interest margin was 6.35%, 46 basis points higher than Q2 and 67 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The linked quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by 4 factors. 
First, the decline in average cash balances I just described; second, margin expansion in our Domestic Card business; third, loan growth in our Domestic Card business; and lastly, the benefit of one additional day in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8. I will end by covering our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.8% at the end of the third quarter, down 70 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets and share repurchases. 
We repurchased $2.7 billion of common stock in the third quarter and have approximately $2.6 billion remaining of our current board authorization of $7.5 billion. At the beginning of the third quarter, we began operating under the Federal Reserve's stress capital buffer framework, resulting in a minimum CET1 capital requirement of 7% as of October 1. And However, based on our internal modeling, we continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%. 
Before I turn the call over to Rich, let me describe a few items related to our preferred stock. On October 18, we announced our intention to redeem our outstanding preferred stock Series G and Series H in early December. As a result of the full quarter of recent issuances and a partial quarter of the planned redemptions, we expect fourth quarter preferred dividends to remain elevated at around $74 million. 
Looking ahead to Q1, we expect the run rate for preferred dividends to decline to approximately $57 million per quarter, barring additional activity. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?"

I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Strong year-over-year purchase volume growth and strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of 2020 and provision for credit losses improved signif",1198,"Thanks, Andrew. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Strong year-over-year purchase volume growth and strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of 2020 and provision for credit losses improved significantly. 
Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. As you can see on Slide 11, third quarter Domestic Card revenue grew 14% year-over-year. 
Purchase volume for the third quarter was up 28% year-over-year and up 27% compared to the third quarter of 2019. And the rebound in loan growth continued with ending loan balances up $3.7 billion or about 4% year-over-year. Ending loans also grew 4% from the sequential quarter ahead of typical seasonal growth of around 1%. 
Ending loan growth was the result of strong growth in purchase volume as well as the traction we're getting with new account originations and line increases, partially offset by continued high payment rates. Payment rates leveled off in the third quarter, but remain near historic highs. 
The flip side of high payment rates is strong credit and credit results remain strikingly strong. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.36%, a 228 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 1.93%, a 28 basis points improvement over the prior year. The pace of year-over-year improvement is slowing, particularly for the delinquency rate. 
Domestic Card revenue margin was up 218 basis points year-over-year to 18.4%. Two factors drove most of the increase. Revenue margin benefited from spend velocity, which is purchase volume growth and net interchange outpacing loan growth and favorable current credit performance enabled us to recognize a higher proportion of finance charges and fees in third quarter revenue as well. 
This credit-driven revenue impact generally tracks Domestic Card credit trends. Total company marketing expense was $751 million in the quarter, including marketing in card, auto and retail banking. Our choices in card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends. 
We continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our Domestic Card business. Our loan -- well, our growth opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. Turning opportunities into actual growth requires investment. And once again, we're leaning further into marketing to drive growth and to build our franchise. 
At the same time, we're keeping a watchful eye on the competitive environment, which is intensifying. Looking ahead, we expect a sequential increase in total company marketing in the fourth quarter that's consistent with typical historical pattern. Pulling up, our Domestic Card business continues to deliver significant value as we invest to build our franchise. 
Slide 12 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Consistent auto growth and strong auto credit are the main themes in the third quarter Consumer Banking results. Our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continue to drive strong growth in our auto business. 
Driven by auto, third quarter ending loans increased 12% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 12%. Auto originations were up 29% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, auto originations were down 11% from the exceptionally high level in the second quarter. As we discussed last quarter, pent-up demand and high auto prices had driven a second quarter surge in originations across the auto marketplace. 
Third quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $2.7 billion or 1% year-over-year. Average deposits were also up 1% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue increased 14% from the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans. Third quarter provision for credit losses improved by $48 million year-over-year, driven by an allowance release in our auto business. Credit results in our auto business remained strong. Year-over-year, the third quarter charge-off rate improved 5 basis points to 0.18% and the delinquency rate improved 11 basis points to 3.65%. 
Looking at sequential quarter trends, the charge-off rate increase from the unprecedented negative charge-off rate in the second quarter and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 39 basis points from the second quarter, consistent with historical seasonal pattern.
Moving to Slide 13, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances were up 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in selected industry specialties. Average loans were down 2%. Ending deposits grew 18% from the third quarter of 2020, as middle market and government customers continue to hold elevated levels of liquidity. 
Quarterly average deposits also increased 18% year-over-year. Third quarter revenue was up 17% from the prior year quarter and 23% from the linked quarter. Recall that revenue in the second quarter was unusually low due to the impact of moving $1.5 billion of commercial real estate loans to held for sale. 
Commercial credit performance remained strong. In the third quarter, the commercial banking annualized charge-off rate was 5 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 6.9% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.8%. Our Commercial Banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our commercial capabilities. I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning. 
In the third quarter, we drove strong growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and new accounts. And loan growth is picking up. Credit remains strikingly strong across our businesses, and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. In the marketplace, the pandemic has clearly accelerated digital adoption. The game is changing from new and permanent shifts in virtual and hybrid work to more digital product and exceptional customer experiences to new fintech innovation and business model. The common thread throughout all of this is technology and the stakes are rising faster than ever before. 
Competitors are embracing the realization that technology capabilities may be an existential issue. The investment flowing into fintech is breathtaking and it's growing. We can see investors voting with their feet in stunning fintech valuation. And the war for tech talent continues to escalate, which will drive up tech labor costs even before any headcount increases. 
All these developments underscore the size of the opportunity for players who lead the way in transforming how banking works. And Capital One is very well positioned to do just that. We are in the ninth year of our technology transformation from the bottom of the tech stack up. We were in original fintech, and we have built modern technology capabilities at scale. 
But what is also clear in the marketplace is that the time frames for investment and innovation are compressing. The imperative to invest is now. We have been on a long journey to drive down operating efficiency ratio powered by revenue growth and digital productivity gains. 
Our journey will need to incorporate the investment imperative of the rapidly changing marketplace, and it is likely to pressure operating efficiency ratio along the way. Pulling way up, we're living through an extraordinary time of accelerating digital change. Our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our opportunity. It's setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking and it's the engine that drives enduring value creation over the long term. 
And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

Where we saw competition accelerate? And where do you think it goes from here? And then I guess, maybe wrap that in with what does it mean for growth for the company? And I have 1 follow-up question."
336241,1682810709,2413224,"Capital One Financial Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Capital One Financial Corporation","Executives","Okay.

So what -- there's -- let me really talk about the card competition that's probably the heart of your questions here, but we can also expand on that. But in Domestic -- in the Card business, competition has definitely intensified, especially in rewards. Marketing and media activity are I would say, approaching pre-pandemic levels and competitors continue to lean into marketing and originations. Direct mail is back to 2019 levels. Originations have also recovered across the industry and are above pre-pandemic levels. 
The pricing continues to be mostly stable. Our rewards offerings have become richer, and we continue to watch that very closely. We saw some modest increases in upfront bonuses, mainly in the form of limited time offers and in travel as demand returns. 
Our rewards earned rates have also increased with some of the new product structures introduced recently, particularly in the cashback space. And of course, there's also a lot of increasing activity with fintechs, such as buy-now-pay-later, installment lending and we talked about the breathtaking levels of investment by venture capital into that industry. 
So -- and by the way, all of this is incredibly natural how a market should be reacting. If we didn't see everything that I just described to you, I would wonder if I woke up in the wrong place. This is incredibly natural. But in the context of this increased competition, we continue to see good opportunities for growth, which are enhanced by our tech transformation. 
And we're keeping a close eye on competition, looking for adverse selection that may come as a result of that. And we are underwriting with the expectation of higher losses in the future. Now you asked for a comparison, Ryan, about how does this compare with the last decade. Certainly, in the middle of the last decade, competition in the credit card space really started picking up. 
But -- and some of the descriptors I would use here, I would use there in the sense that more spending on marketing and originations being kind of robust for the industry. Back then, we saw a bunch of things that we really don't see now, but we'll have to keep it out and eye out for that. What we saw back then is very aggressive behavior in ways that was more than just marketing. It really was in the form of looser underwriting. And in practices, some consumer practices that we did not feel were fully in the customer's interest. So there were a lot of things to react to in that marketplace. 
And if you look back Capital One's loan growth kind of slowed in the card business as we moderated in the face of what we thought was competition that was over the top and that was going to not only make it more costly to originate, but much more importantly, could impact the quality of the credit quality of what is being booked. So we do not feel right now that we're at a time like that, we have to be on the lookout for natural things that happens as competitors continue to heat up their efforts to grow. But I think we're in a pretty good period, Ryan, right now in the marketplace. 
And for Capital One, as indicated by my comment about marketing, we see good opportunities. We're leaning into that. And we have our having learned over the years and seen a lot of things, Ryan, we're going to have our eye out for things that we think are over the top."

We're in an extraordinary place from a credit point of view, and I'm speaking of the industry, and obviously, Capital One as well. And not only for our Credit Card business, but also really across the board at Capital One. So as we think about where it could go from here, let's think a little bit about what's driving where it is. So obviously, the high level of consumer support through the government stimulus has been a factor. 
Although that's mostly in the rearview mirror, there's some lingering benefits in terms of the consumer balance sheet that come from that. But this will be a good time to watch how credit performs in the -- basically in the absence of that. We've also had widespread industry forbearance and consumers themselves have behave very rationally through this period of uncertainty, generally saving more spending less and paying down debt. And then on top of that, we've seen strong labor markets so far this year with very high demand for workers, solid wage growth, which should support consumers as government stimulates stimulus expires. 
So where does everything go from here? It feels inevitable that losses will increase from the exceptionally low levels of the past year and of where we are. But I think the timing -- it's much easier to have conviction about what will happen and the timing of that. We're looking for signs of normalization, card delinquencies ticked up modestly in August and September. Although this is the time of year when we tend to see seasonal increases in delinquencies. 
So we -- this is just a -- I think this is a very strong time. And the I think most companies are enjoying the strength that most banks enjoying the strength that they have. I think they're leaning into their opportunities. And for Capital One, I think our opportunities are particularly good because of the technology that we -- the shoulders that we stand on. 
But with a watchful eye for normalization that will absolutely inevitably happen. And by the way, when it happens, that's normal. That's not necessarily alarming at all. It would be surprising if it didn't happen, but we'll just watch out for the extremes of behavior and in the meantime, lean into our opportunities."

Well, look, revenue growth is the best friend of efficiency ratio, as you point out, Moshe. And our philosophy, I think some companies sort of drive -- try to drive a very sustained efficiency ratio improvement by just squeezing cost out and we're ce",555,"Yes. Well, look, revenue growth is the best friend of efficiency ratio, as you point out, Moshe. And our philosophy, I think some companies sort of drive -- try to drive a very sustained efficiency ratio improvement by just squeezing cost out and we're certainly trying to drive a lot of efficiencies from technology. But our philosophy is certainly that leaning into investing in technology and in growth opportunities can be an engine for revenue growth, and that, combined with digital efficiencies can help drive a sustained long-term improvement in efficiency ratio. 
And of course, we've enjoyed something like a 400 basis point improvement in efficiency ratio from 2013 to 2019 when the pandemic kind of interrupted our process. The reason I pointed out the -- my comment about efficiency ratio a few minutes ago was pointing out some of the pressures on the cost side that really come from the sweeping digital change that's transforming the marketplace and the compressed time frame for investment and innovation. 
And -- so new and traditional competitors embracing the need to invest in technology, the arms race for tech talent is fierce. And in fact, it's the biggest talent arms race that I've seen in my 3 decades of building Capital One. And that Moshe, that's a disappointing one because that raises the tied level of tech costs without generating in a sense, any benefits directly from that. And just talking about the fintechs for a minute. Here's some striking data. Investments in fintechs through the first 3 quarters of this year has been more than $90 billion or on an annualized basis, of course, that's $120 billion, and that's more than double last year's total. 
And I mean those are just breathtaking investment numbers. And that's a huge assault on our industry from a kind of a defensive point of view as we react to that. But also, I look at this and say, that's a clear indication. That banking is ripe for transformation, which we have believed for many, many years. So this all shows up in the need to invest both in technology itself and in leading digital products to gain competitive advantage and the clock is ticking. 
So we're in a strong position to take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace, and we have invested for years to build a modern tech stack. We have a deep heritage in big data and analytics. And we have a large customer franchise and a national brand. So I really like our positioning and our chances, but we do have to invest to capitalize on the opportunity. 
So Moshe, the pulling way up, the pressures come really from 2 things, which both derived from 1 thing, which is the rapidly changing marketplace. So you've got the cost pressure in terms of tech wages and the compressing time frames for innovation across the industry. And we just wanted to share that with investors and that we are leaning in to capitalize on this opportunity. And all other things being equal, that pressures efficiency ratio. Of course, when you pull way up everything I just talked about, maybe not so much the tech labor cost. 
But the investment imperative is in service of the same longer-term objectives, enhancing growth, building a franchise and very importantly, driving greater efficiency."

Great, It was so eloquent. I can't repeat what I said now. Got it. But the spend growth is really an across-the-board thing from mass market customers to the heavy spenders that we have in our portfolio. And virtually every spend category is up, and it's up over -- it's up over last year. It's up over 2 years ago. The only laggard versus 2 years ago, I shouldn't say laggard. Basically, the travel and entertainment category has kind of caught up with where it was 2 years ago. 
But given that you saw our overall purchase volume numbers are up 27% compared to 2019. It just kind of shows you how much -- pretty much all the rest of the categories are surging ahead. So that's partly a comment on the marketplace. And it's also partly a comment about Capital One and our the traction that we're getting in spend across our business. 
Obviously, you can see from our marketing and from our products, and we've spent years investing in building a spender franchise. And we -- the numbers that we've been posting are indicative of a lot of traction there. Now I'm going to -- I'm not going to give guidance on where it's going to go from here. 
I think it's got good momentum. But also, I think consumers have been sort of making up for lost time. And I think as they break out being so cooped up in the pandemic, the spend levels have been up. And we'll see where things go from here, but we certainly carry quite a bit of momentum into the marketplace. 
And the purchase volume success ends up being -- giving a boost to the outstanding growth of Capital One, which, of course, like all the banks is still being constrained somewhat by the high payment rates. But we were really happy to see that even the outstandings growth is the needle started to move there in the quarter."

And all the areas that you mentioned are opportunity areas. I think that the list is even more expensive than what you have, but I certainly agree with the 4 because I'm looking at products, customer experience, back office and underwriting. And I -- let me just kind of think through some of the real opportunity areas for us. 
And importantly, what I want to say is what I'm going to talk about here stands on the shoulders of our modern tech stack and we're working to build breakthrough capabilities and solutions. For example, our new marketing platforms leverage big data streaming in real time to reach more customers with the right offers and driving to improve and optimize conversion rates. 
Our new credit decisioning platforms enable us to use way more data and more sophisticated machine learning algorithms to make better credit decisions. Our new fraud platform enables us to approve more transactions for our customers while simultaneously reducing fraud costs. And just let me pause on fraud for [ Rob ], for a second because one thinks that while investing in fraud is really important, of course, to getting fraud cost down because fraud costs have continued to sort of rise in the industry. But it's also the opportunity, having breakthroughs in the management of fraud creates an opportunity on the customer experience side and the business opportunities we have. I'll give you 2 examples. 
One is in Credit Cards for very heavy spenders, where the card always works is an incredibly important battle cry in -- at the top of the marketplace. And so the spillover benefits there are significant and also in building a national digital bank. So if a bank just goes out there and hang out a shingle and say come on in and have folks sign up for digital bank accounts. It turns out while fraud rates in the branches or people -- if they want to commit fraud, don't typically walk into a branch to commit account opening fraud. 
But it's very easy to do that online. So what we have found is that our heavy investment in fraud has been instrumental to our national banking strategy that you see featured on TV and the ability to really, on a mass basis, open up accounts nationwide and be comfortable with respect to the fraud cost. So the -- so we've been talking about some of the risk management side. Let me also say just another key area, not really directly on your list, but sort of risk management beyond just underwriting or fraud is, as you know, just banks -- the business, risk management is the business and the ability to automate risk management process is the ability to move to a 100% monitoring all the time in real time of things that were otherwise just sampled. 
There's just a lot of benefits that come from transforming how we work. Then to your customer experience category, we're building growing franchises in addition to the core card business and enhancing the experiences of our flagship cards. We're growing franchises with innovative products like Capital One Shopping and credit wise. 
In the auto business, we're delivering innovative products like Auto Navigator, which offers real-time underwriting of any car on any lot in America and a fraction of the second and enables customers to know in advance what their financing terms will be on any car before they visit the dealership. And that was a little word-of-mouth thing until we put it on national TV in the last few months. I'm sure you've seen the ad. We're strengthening our brand and customer franchise, evidenced by high Net Promoter Scores and J.D. Power naming Capital One, the leading mobile banking app. 
I turn to the card partnership business. We're winning card partnership opportunities where increasingly, retailers are focusing on digital capabilities as like a preemptively important part of the conversation. We're partnering with tech leaders like Snowflake, where we are their largest customer. And in addition to getting valuable early investment stake in them, we've been able to leverage the world's leading data management platform for our own innovation. 
On the operating side, we're steadily working to automate our operating processes, enabling us to reduce risk and to reduce cost. Then there's the tech-on-tech savings, our investments in modern technology are enabling us to reduce legacy tech costs and legacy vendor costs. So again, even as we invest more in modern tech, we're really powered by some of the benefits of reducing legacy tech costs. Digital productivity gains are powering speed to market and revenue generation. 
And with all these growing opportunities, we're enjoying the virtuous cycle of attracting more and better tech talent, which which in turn accelerates our progress. So even sort of beyond your list of 4, which is a great list. Our technology transformation is changing the trajectory of Capital One in driving growth, improving efficiency, strengthening risk management, enhancing the brand and improving our status as a leading destination for great talent. 
And so we like very much the position that we're in here. As I've said, time frames are compressing in the industry, and we want to make sure that we capitalize on those opportunities. Thanks for your question, Rick."

The product structures and the overall rewards levels continue to be fairly aggressive. And you can see banks out there refreshing products in the market recently with enhanced rewards. And not only in the cashback space but also to your point, at the very top of the market, including with the high fee rewards card. So I have not -- look, I think we all live on pretty thin margins in transaction margins in this business really because what's happening and it's great for consumers. 
The leading banks have past so many benefits on the consumers. But what -- I would be surprised if our biggest competitors at the top of the market are losing money on every transaction and trying to make it up with volume elsewhere in their franchise. There may be selected examples of that. But I think what the leading players and this is certainly what we've been doing at Capital One, have invested for years in brand and digital capabilities, customer experience, the servicing side of things, the card always works side of things to where one doesn't have to compete solely on the basis of rewards, important though that is, I think, really for the top players, I think this is really, at the end of the day about building a franchise, a sustainable franchise. 
And I certainly, from everything I see, feel that, that's what we have here at Capital One. And I think a small number of players are particularly years of investing to get that position. And I think all of us are well served by what we have."

And we've already seen some significant improvements in operating efficiency. I talked about the pressures that come from rising tech labor costs and the imperative to invest. But while again, the rising labor costs sort of by themselves don't really generate a lot of value, they cost money. The things we're talking about here of leaning into investment opportunities are the very things that are part of our original strategic philosophy about driving operating efficiency. That's the way that we drive more growth over time. The way that we drive more digital productivity gains will be to continue leaning into our tech transformation and the investment at the top of the tech stack for the -- in the growth opportunities that can help power that. 
So we are still all in on the quest, the efficiency ratio quest and the kind of destinations that we have talked about, we need to incorporate the investment imperative that we have along the way."

And one that for many, many years, we have been -- we put a -- we have put your strategic question, kind of front and center in our own thinking for years. So ever since you could watch, of course, in Chin",700,"So Sanjay, look, that is a really great question. And one that for many, many years, we have been -- we put a -- we have put your strategic question, kind of front and center in our own thinking for years. So ever since you could watch, of course, in China and the incredible way that inside tech apps, one's whole life, including financial life gets embedded in there. That's the most extreme example of the front end of banking really being taken over by a tech company. 
And the risk, of course, as one looks at the marketplace, to your point, is the front end of banking being taken over by tech companies and banks being the utilities quietly behind the scenes of that. 
And that -- that has been on central on our radar screen from for many years. And we have seen -- and I think that there continues to be momentum in both camps. So in terms of the tech companies being the front end of banking, we see increasing traction in aggregation and many, many types of aggregation, not just people coming to go get a budgeting app kind of thing. We see that one-off aggregation for particular things and a whole variety of things in consumers' life. 
But between the incredible scale that tech companies have in terms of customers, the incredible engagement they have and now the increasing traction in aggregation that is something that all of us need to really be staring at. And I think there is, in a sense, kind of a great race going on between that model and the model of a bank being the go-to place, not only for the back end of banking, but really for the front end of banking where one can manage one's financial life through the technology of a customer's bank. 
And that's been a primary objective of ours for a long time and 1 of the probably 20 reasons that we've worked so hard to transform our technology because we want to have shoulders to stand on that are the same shoulders as the leading tech companies have. So that we can build software and have the kind of capability and speed to market and so on that comes from being a modern tech company. 
And I have -- we have seen a lot of traction at Capital One. And I think some of the other leading banks have seen a lot of traction too. I mean just looking at the growth of not only how many mobile customers that we have, both online and mobile customers, the growth rate of that, but also the frequency of visits and the increasing number of things that we can do for our customers. 
And the old world of banking was a reactive one. Customer would walk into a branch and say, I have a particular need, and then the banker would figure this out. The opportunity that comes in the new world of technology is where proactive banking is as important as reactive banking. 
They're not proactive banking in the sense of spanning once customers with lots of cross-sell offers but really banking where we are watching the customers' money when the customer isn't and providing leverage right in the flow of the customer's financial life to provide them the information that they need and the guidance that they need. 
And if you notice some of the TV ads, we did probably 6 to 12 months ago were all about some of the real-time alerts that were helping people with things that they really had no idea were going on with respect to their money. So I think that the great race that you talk about is on. It's one of the reasons we feel a real imperative to invest. But we like our position, and I really like actually our chances to not just build some features and have a bunch of customers, but actually to be at the center of our customers' financial lives and to be able to really build a growing franchise where Capital One is right there, where the eyeballs are and where a customers' mind share is."

So if you're looking just at card versus the corporate side, I mean, there's kind of 4 factors I would call out that drove it in the quarter in card yield. Specifically, Rich talked about the credit kind of benefits that are flowing through in suppression saw a tick up of delinquencies in the third quarter, in line with seasonal trends, but that aids late fees. 
They tend to have a fourth -- a third thing of seasonally higher revolve rates and then day count in the quarter are kind of the drivers of card yield. So when I think about how those play out, you can figure out which things are kind of seasonal to the quarter versus which things are driven by more macroeconomic factors versus what is sort of underlying trends. I'll pull up though and just give a corporate view of NIM because you touched on some of the other dimensions that are really playing through more corporately, which is the reduction of cash at the total company level and having that be replaced by card growth. 
And then those factors, coupled with the higher yield in card that I just described is really what benefited this quarter. So as we look ahead, continued normalization of cash, continued growth in revolving card balances, those are the things that would be tailwinds to NIM, but movements in the other direction, things like sustained higher than normal payment rates or reduction in card yield would be headwinds. So we'll just have to see how those things sort of net against one another."

A strategic thing that we've been really leaning into for a number of years at Capital One is a continued migration toward the transactor side of the business, not running away from the other one, but differentially really investing and enhancing that. 
And of course, when you see all the purchase volume growth and other things, you can see the benefit there. But what we have also found is that the real emphasis on the transacting side of the business even for revolvers ends up being something that not only generates more transactions, but it helps drive a healthier prime and even subprime book. So that quest is very aligned and well at Capital One. 
We see growth opportunities really across the board. There's pretty intense competition across the board, but I think we see growth opportunities and a relatively rational marketplace in card across the board. The auto business, auto , there's 2 things I would say about auto. First of all, there's like 4 or 5 planets that are aligned in the auto business that I don't think in our lifetimes are going to align again that have led to some of the extreme performance that's happened in the auto business in terms of the growth, the revenue, the credit side of the business, it's been a very strong thing. 
Given the strength, we have been particularly had a cautious eye looking at competitive pressures in that business. And I've always said that the auto business is more subject to competitive pressure disrupting the business than the card business because the card business is one-on-one us with a customer or a prospect. The auto business, again, has the dealer in the middle of the -- of the whole exchange and the dealer is driving an auction. 
And so we continue to be very carefully monitoring the competitive effects. We are seeing growing competition in the auto business. It's showing up across the board from big banks, credit unions, and smaller independent lenders, and we're seeing it play out across all credit segments. It's showing up in pricing, underwriting and loan terms. And many lenders have expanded beyond their pre-pandemic credit box. And is the competitive environment continues to evolve, we remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategy and our core philosophy of maintaining high resilience and taking what the market gives us remained unchanged. 
In our underwriting, we made conservative assumptions and assume rapid normalization of vehicle values to more sustainable levels. So there's kind of 2 competing things going on in the auto business that sort of -- that drives the results that you see. One is growing competition, which is very understandable because every auto player has posted really strong returns and wants to get more of that. 
There are some signs that we raise an eyebrow to make sure that we see sound underwriting out there in the marketplace. But we also have our opportunity is differentially being also powered by our tech capabilities that we have in the auto business, things like Auto Navigator, things like our relationship with the dealers and their reliance on our technology to help them underwrite better and sell cars more rapidly and effectively. 
So the net of those 2 forces has led us to post another really solid quarter, and we're leaning in, in the auto business, but we should all understand we should be cautious about where the marketplace will go and also understand that the planet alignment at some point, those planets won't be as aligned as they have been."

As we -- as we have said on a number of occasions, the banking industry -- by the way, scale matters a lot. 
And by the way, however important scale was years ago. And by the way, as someone that started Capital One 3 decades ago, and I've always were shipped on the alter scale, and it's been a tough journey because we didn't have the scale for most of the time. And one is always reminded of how more scale would help. Banks -- most of the banking industry is, I think, focusing a lot on buying other banks to build a very important scale. 
At Capital One, we are not looking at bank acquisitions. We are building a national -- I mean, by the way, we did 4 bank acquisitions in our past that were very important in putting us in a good position of threshold scale in the banking industry. But where we are focused on the banking side is in building a national digital bank. And that's really going to be an organic quest. 
No company has ever really built one organically, but we like where we are and we like our chances. Our acquisition focus is looking at technology companies and the fintechs. 
And I mentioned both of those. We have done acquisition of technology companies where they have some of the tech capabilities that we're building. And since we share a similar tech stack, that's been a compatible thing to do and an accelerant. And then, of course, we are looking at fintechs and Capital One has done a number of those acquisitions in the past as well. 
We -- it's not lost on us the breathtaking valuations that these companies command. And so we want to be a patient investor, but we are real students of the fintech marketplace because we can learn so much from them. We're inspired by some of the things they come up with and the things that they do, and we partner with some of them take stakes in some of them and sometimes do acquisitions. 
I think Capital One is in ideal position as an acquirer of a fintech because of the tech stack that we have and pretty much every fintech out there, every modern fintech out there is on the cloud. And I think that the -- they're on the cloud, the tech talent they have is like very similar to our own. Culturally, the whole thing, the emphasis on data and analytics that is behind a number of the fintechs has been a focus of our company since its founding days. So I think that we have some natural advantages on the acquiring side. So for years, we've looked at fintechs and occasionally, made acquisitions, and we certainly are pleased with the ones we have made."

In the third quarter, Capital One earned $3.1 billion or $6.78 per diluted common share. Included in our results for the quarter was a $45 million legal reserve build. Net of this adjusting item, earnings per share in the quarter were $6.86.
On a GAAP basis, pre-provision earnings were $3.6 billion, an increase of 7% relative to a quarter ago. Period-end loans held for investment grew $11.8 billion or 5% as we had strong loan growth across all of our businesses. Recall that we moved $4.1 billion of loans to be held for sale late in the second quarter so average loans in the third quarter grew more modestly at 3%.
Revenue increased 6% in the linked quarter, largely driven by the loan growth I just described, coupled with margin expansion in our Card business. Operating expenses grew 3% in the quarter, with total noninterest expense increasing 6%. In addition to strong pre-provision earnings, the P&L was aided by a provision benefit in the quarter as record low charge-offs were more than offset by an allowance release.
Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. We released $770 million of allowance in the third quarter as the effects of continued actual strong credit performance and a reduction in qualitative factors drove a decline in allowance balance, which was partially offset by loan growth in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 5. You can see our allowance coverage ratios continue to decline across all of our segments, driven by the factors I just described.
Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 143%.  The LCR remained stable and continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Our liquidity reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately $124 billion, down $13 billion from the prior quarter as we continue to run off excess liquidity built during the pandemic.
The 9% decline in total liquidity was driven by a modest reduction in the size of our investment portfolio and $8 billion in lower ending cash balances, which were used to fund loan growth and share repurchases. The decline in cash balances had an impact on our NIM, which I will discuss in more detail on Page 7.
You can see that our third quarter net interest margin was 6.35%, 46 basis points higher than Q2 and 67 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The linked quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by 4 factors.
First, the decline in average cash balances I just described; second, margin expansion in our Domestic Card business; third, loan growth in our Domestic Card business; and lastly, the benefit of one additional day in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8. I will end by covering our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.8% at the end of the third quarter, down 70 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets and share repurchases.
We repurchased $2.7 billion of common stock in the third quarter and have approximately $2.6 billion remaining of our current board authorization of $7.5 billion. At the beginning of the third quarter, we began operating under the Federal Reserve's stress capital buffer framework, resulting in a minimum CET1 capital requirement of 7% as of October 1. And however, based on our internal modeling, we continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%. 
Before I turn the call over to Rich, let me describe a few items related to our preferred stock. On October 18, we announced our intention to redeem our outstanding preferred stock Series G and Series H in early December. As a result of the full quarter of recent issuances and a partial quarter of the planned redemptions, we expect fourth quarter preferred dividends to remain elevated at around $74 million.
Looking ahead to Q1, we expect the run rate for preferred dividends to decline to approximately $57 million per quarter, barring additional activity. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?"

I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Strong year-over-year purchase volume growth and strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of 2020 and provision for credit losses improved signif",1198,"Thanks, Andrew. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Strong year-over-year purchase volume growth and strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of 2020 and provision for credit losses improved significantly.
Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. As you can see on Slide 11, third quarter Domestic Card revenue grew 14% year-over-year.
Purchase volume for the third quarter was up 28% year-over-year and up 27% compared to the third quarter of 2019. And the rebound in loan growth continued with ending loan balances up $3.7 billion or about 4% year-over-year. Ending loans also grew 4% from the sequential quarter ahead of typical seasonal growth of around 1%.
Ending loan growth was the result of strong growth in purchase volume as well as the traction we're getting with new account originations and line increases, partially offset by continued high payment rates. Payment rates leveled off in the third quarter, but remain near historic highs. 
The flip side of high payment rates is strong credit and credit results remain strikingly strong. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.36%, a 228 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 1.93%, a 28 basis points improvement over the prior year. The pace of year-over-year improvement is slowing, particularly for the delinquency rate. 
Domestic Card revenue margin was up 218 basis points year-over-year to 18.4%. Two factors drove most of the increase. Revenue margin benefited from spend velocity, which is purchase volume growth and net interchange outpacing loan growth and favorable current credit performance enabled us to recognize a higher proportion of finance charges and fees in third quarter revenue as well. This credit-driven revenue impact generally tracks Domestic Card credit trends. 
Total company marketing expense was $751 million in the quarter, including marketing in card, auto and retail banking. Our choices in card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends.
We continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our Domestic Card business. Our loan -- well, our growth opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. Turning opportunities into actual growth requires investment. And once again, we're leaning further into marketing to drive growth and to build our franchise. 
At the same time, we're keeping a watchful eye on the competitive environment, which is intensifying. Looking ahead, we expect a sequential increase in total company marketing in the fourth quarter that's consistent with typical historical pattern. Pulling up, our Domestic Card business continues to deliver significant value as we invest to build our franchise. 
Slide 12 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Consistent auto growth and strong auto credit are the main themes in the third quarter Consumer Banking results. Our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continue to drive strong growth in our auto business. 
Driven by auto, third quarter ending loans increased 12% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 12%. Auto originations were up 29% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, auto originations were down 11% from the exceptionally high level in the second quarter. As we discussed last quarter, pent-up demand and high auto prices had driven a second quarter surge in originations across the auto marketplace. 
Third quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $2.7 billion or 1% year-over-year. Average deposits were also up 1% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue increased 14% from the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans. Third quarter provision for credit losses improved by $48 million year-over-year, driven by an allowance release in our auto business. Credit results in our auto business remained strong. Year-over-year, the third quarter charge-off rate improved 5 basis points to 0.18% and the delinquency rate improved 11 basis points to 3.65%. 
Looking at sequential quarter trends, the charge-off rate increase from the unprecedented negative charge-off rate in the second quarter and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 39 basis points from the second quarter, consistent with historical seasonal pattern.
Moving to Slide 13, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances were up 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in selected industry specialties. Average loans were down 2%. Ending deposits grew 18% from the third quarter of 2020, as middle market and government customers continue to hold elevated levels of liquidity. 
Quarterly average deposits also increased 18% year-over-year. Third quarter revenue was up 17% from the prior year quarter and 23% from the linked quarter. Recall that revenue in the second quarter was unusually low due to the impact of moving $1.5 billion of commercial real estate loans to held for sale. 
Commercial credit performance remained strong. In the third quarter, the commercial banking annualized charge-off rate was 5 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 6.9% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.8%. Our Commercial Banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our commercial capabilities. I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning.
In the third quarter, we drove strong growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and new accounts. And loan growth is picking up. Credit remains strikingly strong across our businesses, and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. In the marketplace, the pandemic has clearly accelerated digital adoption. The game is changing from new and permanent shifts in virtual and hybrid work to more digital product and exceptional customer experiences to new fintech innovation and business model. The common thread throughout all of this is technology and the stakes are rising faster than ever before. 
Competitors are embracing the realization that technology capabilities may be an existential issue. The investment flowing into fintech is breathtaking and it's growing. We can see investors voting with their feet in stunning fintech valuation. And the war for tech talent continues to escalate, which will drive up tech labor costs even before any headcount increases. 
All these developments underscore the size of the opportunity for players who lead the way in transforming how banking works. And Capital One is very well positioned to do just that. We are in the ninth year of our technology transformation from the bottom of the tech stack up. We were in original fintech, and we have built modern technology capabilities at scale. 
But what is also clear in the marketplace is that the time frames for investment and innovation are compressing. The imperative to invest is now. We have been on a long journey to drive down operating efficiency ratio powered by revenue growth and digital productivity gains. 
Our journey will need to incorporate the investment imperative of the rapidly changing marketplace, and it is likely to pressure operating efficiency ratio along the way. 
Pulling way up, we're living through an extraordinary time of accelerating digital change. Our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our opportunity. It's setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking and it's the engine that drives enduring value creation over the long term.
And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

And yet, it seems like your strategy is working as evidenced by the better-than-peer growth metrics and credit. 
So I was just wondering, can you maybe just talk about the competitive environment you're seeing out there? 
How does it compare to maybe the middle part of the last decade? Where we saw competition accelerate? And where do you think it goes from here? And then I guess, maybe wrap that in with what does it mean for growth for the company? And I have 1 follow-up question."

So what -- there's -- let me really talk about the card competition that's probably the heart of your questions here, but we can also expand on that. But in Domestic -- in the Card business, competition has definitely intensified, especially in rewards. Marketing and media activity are I would say, approaching pre-pandemic levels and competitors continue to lean into marketing and originations. Direct mail is back to 2019 levels. Originations have also recovered across the industry and are above pre-pandemic levels. 
The pricing continues to be mostly stable. Our rewards offerings have become richer, and we continue to watch that very closely. We saw some modest increases in upfront bonuses, mainly in the form of limited time offers and in travel as demand returns.
Our rewards earned rates have also increased with some of the new product structures introduced recently, particularly in the cashback space. And of course, there's also a lot of increasing activity with fintechs, such as buy-now-pay-later, installment lending, and we talked about the breathtaking levels of investment by venture capital into that industry.
So -- and by the way, all of this is incredibly natural how a market should be reacting. If we didn't see everything that I just described to you, I would wonder if I woke up in the wrong place. This is incredibly natural. But in the context of this increased competition, we continue to see good opportunities for growth, which are enhanced by our tech transformation.
And we're keeping a close eye on competition, looking for adverse selection that may come as a result of that. And we are underwriting with the expectation of higher losses in the future. 
Now you asked for a comparison, Ryan, about how does this compare with the last decade. Certainly, in the middle of the last decade, competition in the credit card space really started picking up. But -- and some of the descriptors I would use here, I would use there in the sense that more spending on marketing and originations being kind of robust for the industry. 
Back then, we saw a bunch of things that we really don't see now, but we'll have to keep it out and eye out for that. What we saw back then is very aggressive behavior in ways that was more than just marketing. It really was in the form of looser underwriting. And in practices, some consumer practices that we did not feel were fully in the customer's interest. 
So there were a lot of things to react to in that marketplace. And if you look back Capital One's loan growth kind of slowed in the card business as we moderated in the face of what we thought was competition that was over the top and that was going to not only make it more costly to originate, but much more importantly, could impact the quality of -- the credit quality of what is being booked. 
So we do not feel right now that we're at a time like that, we have to be on the lookout for natural things that happens as competitors continue to heed up their efforts to grow. But I think we're in a pretty good period, Ryan, right now in the marketplace. 
And for Capital One, as indicated by my comment about marketing, we see good opportunities. We're leaning into that. And we have our having learned over the years and seen a lot of things, Ryan, we're going to have our eye out for things that we think are over the top."

So I was wondering that given that this downturn has been like no other, how are you thinking about the trajectory of credit over an intermediate time frame? Do you think we could run well below normal for an extended period of time? Or do you think there is the risk of fast normalization as the industry has become more concerned about?"

We're in an extraordinary place from a credit point of view, and I'm speaking of the industry, and obviously, Capital One as well. And not only for our Credit Card business, but also really across the board at Capital One. So as we think about where it could go from here, let's think a little bit about what's driving where it is. So obviously, the high level of consumer support through the government stimulus has been a factor. 
Although that's mostly in the rearview mirror, there's some lingering benefits in terms of the consumer balance sheet that come from that. But this will be a good time to watch how credit performs in the -- basically in the absence of that. 
We've also had widespread industry forbearance and consumers themselves have behave very rationally through this period of uncertainty, generally saving more spending less and paying down debt. And then on top of that, we've seen strong labor markets so far this year with very high demand for workers, solid wage growth, which should support consumers as government stimulates stimulus expires. 
So where does everything go from here? It feels inevitable that losses will increase from the exceptionally low levels of the past year and of where we are. But I think the timing -- it's much easier to have conviction about what will happen and the timing of that. We're looking for signs of normalization, card delinquencies ticked up modestly in August and September. Although this is the time of year when we tend to see seasonal increases in delinquencies.
So we -- this is just a -- I think this is a very strong time. And the I think most companies are enjoying the strength that most banks enjoying the strength that they have. I think they're leaning into their opportunities. And for Capital One, I think our opportunities are particularly good because of the technology that we -- the shoulders that we stand on.
But with a watchful eye for normalization that will absolutely inevitably happen. And by the way, when it happens, that's normal. That's not necessarily alarming at all. It would be surprising if it didn't happen, but we'll just watch out for the extremes of behavior and in the meantime, lean into our opportunities."

Well, look, revenue growth is the best friend of efficiency ratio, as you point out, Moshe. And our philosophy, I think some companies sort of drive -- try to drive a very sustained efficiency ratio improvement by just squeezing cost out and we're certainly trying to drive a lot of efficiencies from technology. 
But our philosophy is certainly that leaning into investing in technology and in growth opportunities can be an engine for revenue growth, and that, combined with digital efficiencies can help drive a sustained long-term improvement in efficiency ratio. 
And of course, we've enjoyed something like a 400 basis point improvement in efficiency ratio from 2013 to 2019 when the pandemic kind of interrupted our process. The reason I pointed out the -- my comment about efficiency ratio a few minutes ago was pointing out some of the pressures on the cost side that really come from the sweeping digital change that's transforming the marketplace and the compressed time frame for investment and innovation. 
And -- so new and traditional competitors embracing the need to invest in technology, the arms race for tech talent is fierce. And in fact, it's the biggest talent arms race that I've seen in my 3 decades of building Capital One. 
And that Moshe, that's a disappointing one because that raises the tied level of tech costs without generating in a sense, any benefits directly from that. 
And just talking about the fintechs for a minute. Here's some striking data. Investments in fintechs through the first 3 quarters of this year has been more than $90 billion or on an annualized basis, of course, that's $120 billion, and that's more than double last year's total.
And I mean those are just breathtaking investment numbers. And that's a huge assault on our industry from a kind of a defensive point of view as we react to that. But also, I look at this and say, that's a clear indication that banking is ripe for transformation, which we have believed for many, many years. So this all shows up in the need to invest both in technology itself and in leading digital products to gain competitive advantage and the clock is ticking.
So we're in a strong position to take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace, and we have invested for years to build a modern tech stack. We have a deep heritage in big data and analytics. And we have a large customer franchise and a national brand. So I really like our positioning and our chances, but we do have to invest to capitalize on the opportunity.
So Moshe, the pulling way up -- the pressures come really from 2 things, which both derived from one thing, which is the rapidly changing marketplace. So you've got the cost pressure in terms of tech wages and the compressing time frames for innovation across the industry. 
And we just wanted to share that with investors and that we are leaning in to capitalize on this opportunity. And all other things being equal, that pressures' efficiency ratio. Of course, when you pull way up everything I just talked about, maybe not so much the tech labor cost. 
But the investment imperative is in service of the same longer-term objectives, enhancing growth, building a franchise and very importantly, driving greater efficiency."

Let me start over, Betsy. Great, It was so eloquent. I can't repeat what I said now. But the spend growth is really an across-the-board thing from mass market customers to the heavy spenders that we have in our portfolio. And virtually every spend category is up, and it's up over -- it's up over last year. It's up over 2 years ago. The only laggard versus 2 years ago -- I shouldn't say laggard. Basically, the travel and entertainment category has kind of caught up with where it was 2 years ago.
But given that you saw our overall purchase volume numbers are up 27% compared to 2019. It just kind of shows you how much -- pretty much all the rest of the categories are surging ahead. So that's partly a comment on the marketplace. And it's also partly a comment about Capital One and our -- the traction that we're getting in spend across our business. 
Obviously, you can see from our marketing and from our products, and we've spent years investing in building a spender franchise. And we -- the numbers that we've been posting are indicative of a lot of traction there. Now I'm going to -- I'm not going to give guidance on where it's going to go from here. 
I think it's got good momentum. But also, I think consumers have been sort of making up for lost time. And I think as they break out being so cooped up in the pandemic, the spend levels have been up. And we'll see where things go from here, but we certainly carry quite a bit of momentum into the marketplace. 
And the purchase volume success ends up being -- giving a boost to the outstanding growth of Capital One, which, of course, like all the banks is still being constrained somewhat by the high payment rates. But we were really happy to see that even the outstandings growth is -- the needle started to move there in the quarter."

And all the areas that you mentioned are opportunity areas. I think that the list is even more expansive than what you have, but I certainly agree with the 4 because I'm looking at products, customer experience, back office and underwriting. 
And I -- let me just kind of think through some of the real opportunity areas for us. And importantly, what I want to say is and what I'm going to talk about here stands on the shoulders of our modern tech stack and we're working to build breakthrough capabilities and solutions. For example, our new marketing platforms leverage big data streaming in real time to reach more customers with the right offers and driving to improve and optimize conversion rates.
Our new credit decisioning platforms enable us to use way more data and more sophisticated machine learning algorithms to make better credit decisions. our new fraud platform enables us to approve more transactions for our customers while simultaneously reducing fraud costs. 
And just let me pause on fraud for a second because one thinks that while investing in fraud is really important, of course, to getting fraud cost down because fraud costs have continued to sort of rise in the industry. But it's also the opportunity -- having breakthroughs in the management of fraud creates an opportunity on the customer experience side and the business opportunities we have. 
I'll give you 2 examples. One is in credit cards for very heavy spenders, where the card always works is an incredibly important battle cry in -- at the top of the marketplace. And so the spillover benefits there are significant and also in building a national digital bank. So if a bank just goes out there and hang out a shingle and say come on in and have folks sign up for digital bank accounts. It turns out while fraud rates in the branches or people -- if they want to commit fraud, they don't typically walk into a branch to commit account opening fraud.
But it's very easy to do that online. So what we have found is that our heavy investment in fraud has been instrumental to our national banking strategy that you see featured on TV and the ability to really, on a mass basis, open up accounts nationwide and be comfortable with respect to the fraud cost. 
So the -- so we've been talking about some of the risk management side. Let me also say just another key area, not really directly on your list, but sort of risk management beyond just underwriting or fraud is, as you know, just banks, the business. Risk management is the business. And the ability to automate risk management process is the ability to move to a 100% monitoring all the time in real time of things that were otherwise just sampled.  
There's just a lot of benefits that come from transforming how we work. Then to your customer experience category, we're building growing franchises in addition to the core card business and enhancing the experiences of our flagship cards. We're growing franchises with innovative products like Capital One Shopping and Credit Wise.
In the auto business, we're delivering innovative products like Auto Navigator, which offers real-time underwriting of any car on any lot in America in a fraction of the second and enables customers to know in advance what their financing terms will be on any car before they visit the dealership. And that was a little word-of-mouth thing until we put it on national TV in the last few months. I'm sure you've seen the ad. 
We're strengthening our brand and customer franchise, evidenced by high Net Promoter Scores and J.D. Power naming Capital One, the leading mobile banking app.  
I turn to the card partnership business. We're winning card partnership opportunities where increasingly, retailers are focusing on digital capabilities as like a preemptively important part of the conversation. 
We're partnering with tech leaders like Snowflake, where we are their largest customer. And in addition to getting valuable early investment stake in them, we've been able to leverage the world's leading data management platform for our own innovation. On the operating side, we're steadily working to automate our operating processes, enabling us to reduce risk and to reduce cost. 
Then there's the tech-on-tech savings, our investments in modern technology are enabling us to reduce legacy tech costs and legacy vendor costs. So again, even as we invest more in modern tech, we're really powered by some of the benefits of reducing legacy tech costs. 
Digital productivity gains are powering speed to market and revenue generation. And with all these growing opportunities, we're enjoying the virtuous cycle of attracting more and better tech talent, which in turn accelerates our progress. 
So even sort of beyond your list of 4, which is a great list, our technology transformation is changing the trajectory of Capital One in driving growth, improving efficiency, strengthening risk management, enhancing the brand and improving our status as a leading destination for great talent. And so we like very much the position that we're in here. as I've said, time frames are compressing in the industry, and we want to make sure that we capitalize on those opportunities. Thanks for your question, Rick."

The product structures and the overall rewards levels continue to be fairly aggressive. And you can see banks out there refreshing products in the market recently with enhanced rewards. And not only in the cash back space but also to your point, at the very top of the market, including with the high fee rewards card. So I have not -- look, I think we all live on pretty thin margins in transaction margins in this business really because of what's happening and it's great for consumers.
The leading banks have past so many benefits on the consumers. But what I -- I would be surprised if our biggest competitors at the top of the market are losing money on every transaction and trying to make it up with volume elsewhere in their franchise. 
Now there may be selected examples of that. But I think what the leading players and this is certainly what we've been doing at Capital One, we have invested for years in brand and digital capabilities, customer experience, the servicing side of things, the card always works side of things to where one doesn't have to compete solely on the basis of rewards, important though that is, I think, really for the top players, I think this is really, at the end of the day about building a franchise, a sustainable franchise.  
And I certainly, from everything I see, feel that, that's what we have here at Capital One. And I think a small number of players are particularly investing -- years of investing to get that position. And I think all of us are well served by what we have."

So I would think that not giving any sort of explicit guidance, but I think if you look at history as your guide, there's a lot in there that kind of would suggest where we might be going in the near term.
And Rich talked about the investments over time and how that's going to play into the number of factors across the P&L in terms of revenue growth in fraud and many other things that are playing down through there. So that's how I would think about the short to medium term. And I'll turn it over to Rich to answer your second question."

So John, we declared years ago that through the tech transformation that we were driving, which along the way was going to cost more to drive that, that over time this transformation and the extra growth that we could get in the marketplace could -- that would put us in a good position to drive operating efficiency over the longer term and that, that would be an important part of the investor value proposition for Capital One.
And we've already -- seeing some significant improvements in operating efficiency. I talked about the pressures that come from rising tech labor costs and the imperative to invest. But while, again, the rising labor costs sort of by themselves don't really generate a lot of value, they cost money. 
The things we're talking about here of leaning into investment opportunities are the very things that are part of our original strategic philosophy about driving operating efficiency. That's the way that we drive more growth over time. The way that we drive more digital productivity gains will be to continue leaning into our tech transformation and the investment at the top of the tech stack for the -- in the growth opportunities that can help power that.  
So we are still all in on the quest, the efficiency ratio quest. And the kind of destinations that we have talked about, we need to incorporate the investment imperative that we have along the way."

And one that for many, many years, we have been -- we put a -- we have put your strategic question, kind of front and center in our own thinking for years.

And one that for many, many years, we have been -- we put a -- we have put your strategic question, kind of front and center in our own thinking for years. 
So ever since you could watch, of course, in China and the incredible way that inside tech apps, one's whole life, including financial life gets embedded in there. That's the most extreme example of the front end of banking really being taken over by a tech company. 
And the risk, of course, as one looks at the marketplace, to your point, is the front end of banking being taken over by tech companies and banks being the utilities quietly behind the scenes of that. 
And that has been central on our radar screen from for many years. And we have seen -- and I think that there continues to be momentum in both camps. So in terms of the tech companies being the front end of banking, we see increasing traction in aggregation and many, many types of aggregation, not just people coming to go get a budgeting app kind of thing. We see that one-off aggregation for particular things and a whole variety of things in consumers' life. 
But between the incredible scale that tech companies have in terms of customers, the incredible engagement they have and now the increasing traction in aggregation that is something that all of us need to really be staring at. And I think there is, in a sense, kind of a great race going on between that model and the model of a bank being the go-to place, not only for the back end of banking, but really for the front end of banking where one can manage one's financial life through the technology of a customer's bank.
And that's been a primary objective of ours for a long time. And one of the probably 20 reasons that we've worked so hard to transform our technology because we want to have shoulders to stand on, that are the same shoulders as the leading tech companies have. So that we can build software and have the kind of capability and speed to market and so on that comes from being a modern tech company. 
And I have -- we have seen a lot of traction at Capital One. And I think some of the other leading banks have seen a lot of traction too. I mean just looking at the growth of not only how many mobile customers that we have -- both online and mobile customers, the growth rate of that. But also the frequency of visits and the increasing number of things that we can do for our customers. 
And the old world of banking was a reactive one. Customer would walk into a branch and say, I have a particular need, and then the banker would figure this out. The opportunity that comes in the new world of technology is where proactive banking is as important as reactive banking. 
They're not proactive banking in the sense of spamming more customers with lots of cross-sell offers. But really banking where we are watching the customers' money when the customer isn't, and providing leverage right in the flow of the customer's financial life to provide them the information that they need and the guidance that they need.
And if you notice some of the TV ads, we did probably 6 to 12 months ago, were all about some of the real-time alerts that were helping people with things that they really had no idea were going on with respect to their money. 
So I think that the great race that you talk about is on. It's one of the reasons we feel a real imperative to invest. But we like our position, and I really like actually our chances to not just build some features and have a bunch of customers, but actually to be at the center of our customers' financial lives and to be able to really build a growing franchise where Capital One is right there, where the eyeballs are and where a customers' mind share is."

So if you're looking just at card versus the corporate side, I mean, there's kind of 4 factors I would call out that drove it in the quarter in card yield. Specifically, Rich talked about the credit, kind of, benefits that are flowing through in suppression saw a tick up of delinquencies in the third quarter, in line with seasonal trends, but that aids late fees.
They tend to have a fourth -- a third thing of seasonally higher revolve rates and then day count in the quarter are kind of the drivers of card yield. So when I think about how those play out, you can figure out which things are kind of seasonal to the quarter versus which things are driven by more macroeconomic factors versus what is sort of underlying trends.
I'll pull up though and just give a corporate view of NIM because you touched on some of the other dimensions that are really playing through more corporately, which is the reduction of cash at the total company level and having that be replaced by card growth. And then those factors, coupled with the higher yield in card that I just described is really what benefited this quarter. 
So as we look ahead, continued normalization of cash, continued growth in revolving card balances, those are the things that would be tailwinds to NIM, but movements in the other direction, things like sustained higher than normal payment rates or reduction in card yield would be headwinds. So we'll just have to see how those things sort of net against one another."

A strategic thing that we've been really leaning into for a number of years at Capital One is a continued migration toward the transactor side of the business, not running away from the other one, but differentially really investing and enhancing that. 
And of course, when you see all the purchase volume growth and other things, you can see the benefit there. But what we have also found is that the real emphasis on the transacting side of the business even for revolvers ends up being something that not only generates more transactions, but it helps drive a healthier prime and even subprime book. So that quest is very aligned and well at Capital One.
We see growth opportunities really across the board. There's pretty intense competition across the board, but I think we see growth opportunities and a relatively rational marketplace in card across the board. The auto business, auto -- there's 2 things I would say about auto. First of all, there's like 4 or 5 planets that are aligned in the auto business that I don't think in our lifetimes are going to align again that have led to some of the extreme performance that's happened in the auto business in terms of the growth, the revenue, the credit side of the business, it's been a very strong thing.
Given the strength, we have been particularly -- had a cautious eye looking at competitive pressures in that business. And I've always said that the auto business is more subject to competitive pressure disrupting the business than the card business because the card business is one-on-one us with a customer or a prospect. The auto business, again, has the dealer in the middle of the whole exchange and the dealer is driving an auction.
And so we continue to be -- very carefully monitoring the competitive effects. We are seeing growing competition in the auto business. It's showing up across the board from big banks, credit unions, and smaller independent lenders, and we're seeing it play out across all credit segments. It's showing up in pricing, underwriting and loan terms. 
And many lenders have expanded beyond their pre-pandemic credit box. And as the competitive environment continues to evolve, we remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategy and our core philosophy of maintaining high resilience and taking what the market gives us remained unchanged. In our underwriting, we made conservative assumptions and assume rapid normalization of vehicle values to more sustainable levels. 
So there's kind of 2 competing things going on in the auto business that sort of -- that drives the results that you see. One is growing competition, which is very understandable because every auto player has posted really strong returns and wants to get more of that. 
There are some signs that we raise an eyebrow to make sure that we see sound underwriting out there in the marketplace. But we also have -- our opportunity is differentially being also powered by our tech capabilities that we have in the auto business, things like Auto Navigator, things like our relationship with the dealers and their reliance on our technology to help them underwrite better and sell cars more rapidly and effectively.
So the net of those 2 forces has led us to post another really solid quarter, and we're leaning in, in the auto business, but we should all understand we should be cautious about where the marketplace will go and also understand that the planet alignment, at some point those planets won't be as aligned as they have been."

Sorry for the silence. Thank you, Kevin, for the good question there. As we have said on a number of occasions, the banking industry -- by the way, scale matters a lot.
And by the way, however important scale was years ago -- and by the way, as someone that started Capital One 3 decades ago -- and I've always were worshiped on the altar, scale, and it's been a tough journey because we didn't have the scale for most of the time. And One is always reminded of how more scale would help. Banks -- most of the banking industry is, I think, focusing a lot on buying other banks to build a very important scale. 
At Capital One, we are not looking at bank acquisitions. We are building a national -- I mean -- by the way, we did 4 bank acquisitions in our past that were very important in putting us in a good position of threshold scale in the banking industry. But where we are focused on the banking side is in building a national digital bank. And that's really going to be an organic quest. No company has ever really built one organically, but we like where we are, and we like our chances. 
Our acquisition focus is looking at technology companies and the fintechs. And I mentioned both of those. We have done acquisition of technology companies where they have some of the tech capabilities that we're building. And since we share a similar tech stack, that's been a compatible thing to do and an accelerant. And then, of course, we are looking at fintechs and Capital One has done a number of those acquisitions in the past as well. 
We -- it's not lost on us the breathtaking valuations that these companies command. And so we want to be a patient investor, but we are real students of the fintech marketplace because we can learn so much from them. We're inspired by some of the things they come up with and the things that they do, and we partner with some of them to take stakes in some of them and sometimes do acquisitions. 
I think Capital One is in ideal position as an acquirer of a fintech because of the tech stack that we have. And pretty much every fintech out there -- every modern fintech out there is on the cloud. And I think that the -- they're on the cloud, the tech talent they have is like very similar to our own. 
Culturally, the whole thing, the emphasis on data and analytics that is behind a number of the fintechs has been a focus of our company since its founding days. So I think that we have some natural advantages on the acquiring side. So for years, we've looked at fintechs and occasionally, made acquisitions, and we certainly are pleased with the ones we have made."

I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the third quarter, Capital One earned $3.1 billion or $6.78 per diluted common share.

In the third quarter, Capital One earned $3.1 billion or $6.78 per diluted common share. Included in our results for the quarter was a $45 million legal reserve build. Net of this adjusting item, earnings per share in the quarter were $6.86.
On a GAAP basis, pre-provision earnings were $3.6 billion, an increase of 7% relative to a quarter ago. Period-end loans held for investment grew $11.8 billion or 5% as we had strong loan growth across all of our businesses. Recall that we moved $4.1 billion of loans to be held for sale late in the second quarter so average loans in the third quarter grew more modestly at 3%.
Revenue increased 6% in the linked quarter, largely driven by the loan growth I just described, coupled with margin expansion in our Card business. Operating expenses grew 3% in the quarter, with total noninterest expense increasing 6%. In addition to strong pre-provision earnings, the P&L was aided by a provision benefit in the quarter as record low charge-offs were more than offset by an allowance release.
Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. We released $770 million of allowance in the third quarter as the effects of continued actual strong credit performance and a reduction in qualitative factors drove a decline in allowance balance, which was partially offset by loan growth in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 5. You can see our allowance coverage ratios continue to decline across all of our segments, driven by the factors I just described.
Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was 143%.  The LCR remained stable and continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Our liquidity reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately $124 billion, down $13 billion from the prior quarter as we continue to run off excess liquidity built during the pandemic.
The 9% decline in total liquidity was driven by a modest reduction in the size of our investment portfolio and $8 billion in lower ending cash balances, which were used to fund loan growth and share repurchases. The decline in cash balances had an impact on our NIM, which I will discuss in more detail on Page 7.
You can see that our third quarter net interest margin was 6.35%, 46 basis points higher than Q2 and 67 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. The linked quarter increase in NIM was largely driven by 4 factors.
First, the decline in average cash balances I just described; second, margin expansion in our Domestic Card business; third, loan growth in our Domestic Card business; and lastly, the benefit of one additional day in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8. I will end by covering our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.8% at the end of the third quarter, down 70 basis points from the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was more than offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets and share repurchases.
We repurchased $2.7 billion of common stock in the third quarter and have approximately $2.6 billion remaining of our current board authorization of $7.5 billion. At the beginning of the third quarter, we began operating under the Federal Reserve's stress capital buffer framework, resulting in a minimum CET1 capital requirement of 7% as of October 1. And however, based on our internal modeling, we continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%. 
Before I turn the call over to Rich, let me describe a few items related to our preferred stock. On October 18, we announced our intention to redeem our outstanding preferred stock Series G and Series H in early December. As a result of the full quarter of recent issuances and a partial quarter of the planned redemptions, we expect fourth quarter preferred dividends to remain elevated at around $74 million.
Looking ahead to Q1, we expect the run rate for preferred dividends to decline to approximately $57 million per quarter, barring additional activity. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?"

I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Strong year-over-year purchase volume growth and strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of 2020 and provision for credit losses improved signif",1198,"Thanks, Andrew. I'll begin on Slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Strong year-over-year purchase volume growth and strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of 2020 and provision for credit losses improved significantly.
Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on Slide 11. As you can see on Slide 11, third quarter Domestic Card revenue grew 14% year-over-year.
Purchase volume for the third quarter was up 28% year-over-year and up 27% compared to the third quarter of 2019. And the rebound in loan growth continued with ending loan balances up $3.7 billion or about 4% year-over-year. Ending loans also grew 4% from the sequential quarter ahead of typical seasonal growth of around 1%.
Ending loan growth was the result of strong growth in purchase volume as well as the traction we're getting with new account originations and line increases, partially offset by continued high payment rates. Payment rates leveled off in the third quarter, but remain near historic highs. 
The flip side of high payment rates is strong credit and credit results remain strikingly strong. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.36%, a 228 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 1.93%, a 28 basis points improvement over the prior year. The pace of year-over-year improvement is slowing, particularly for the delinquency rate. 
Domestic Card revenue margin was up 218 basis points year-over-year to 18.4%. Two factors drove most of the increase. Revenue margin benefited from spend velocity, which is purchase volume growth and net interchange outpacing loan growth and favorable current credit performance enabled us to recognize a higher proportion of finance charges and fees in third quarter revenue as well. This credit-driven revenue impact generally tracks Domestic Card credit trends. 
Total company marketing expense was $751 million in the quarter, including marketing in card, auto and retail banking. Our choices in card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends.
We continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our Domestic Card business. Our loan -- well, our growth opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. Turning opportunities into actual growth requires investment. And once again, we're leaning further into marketing to drive growth and to build our franchise. 
At the same time, we're keeping a watchful eye on the competitive environment, which is intensifying. Looking ahead, we expect a sequential increase in total company marketing in the fourth quarter that's consistent with typical historical pattern. Pulling up, our Domestic Card business continues to deliver significant value as we invest to build our franchise. 
Slide 12 summarizes third quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Consistent auto growth and strong auto credit are the main themes in the third quarter Consumer Banking results. Our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continue to drive strong growth in our auto business. 
Driven by auto, third quarter ending loans increased 12% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business. Average loans also grew 12%. Auto originations were up 29% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, auto originations were down 11% from the exceptionally high level in the second quarter. As we discussed last quarter, pent-up demand and high auto prices had driven a second quarter surge in originations across the auto marketplace. 
Third quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $2.7 billion or 1% year-over-year. Average deposits were also up 1% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue increased 14% from the prior year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans. Third quarter provision for credit losses improved by $48 million year-over-year, driven by an allowance release in our auto business. Credit results in our auto business remained strong. Year-over-year, the third quarter charge-off rate improved 5 basis points to 0.18% and the delinquency rate improved 11 basis points to 3.65%. 
Looking at sequential quarter trends, the charge-off rate increase from the unprecedented negative charge-off rate in the second quarter and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 39 basis points from the second quarter, consistent with historical seasonal pattern.
Moving to Slide 13, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Third quarter ending loan balances were up 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in selected industry specialties. Average loans were down 2%. Ending deposits grew 18% from the third quarter of 2020, as middle market and government customers continue to hold elevated levels of liquidity. 
Quarterly average deposits also increased 18% year-over-year. Third quarter revenue was up 17% from the prior year quarter and 23% from the linked quarter. Recall that revenue in the second quarter was unusually low due to the impact of moving $1.5 billion of commercial real estate loans to held for sale. 
Commercial credit performance remained strong. In the third quarter, the commercial banking annualized charge-off rate was 5 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate was 6.9% and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.8%. Our Commercial Banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our commercial capabilities. I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning.
In the third quarter, we drove strong growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and new accounts. And loan growth is picking up. Credit remains strikingly strong across our businesses, and we continue to return capital to our shareholders. In the marketplace, the pandemic has clearly accelerated digital adoption. The game is changing from new and permanent shifts in virtual and hybrid work to more digital product and exceptional customer experiences to new fintech innovation and business model. The common thread throughout all of this is technology and the stakes are rising faster than ever before. 
Competitors are embracing the realization that technology capabilities may be an existential issue. The investment flowing into fintech is breathtaking and it's growing. We can see investors voting with their feet in stunning fintech valuation. And the war for tech talent continues to escalate, which will drive up tech labor costs even before any headcount increases. 
All these developments underscore the size of the opportunity for players who lead the way in transforming how banking works. And Capital One is very well positioned to do just that. We are in the ninth year of our technology transformation from the bottom of the tech stack up. We were in original fintech, and we have built modern technology capabilities at scale. 
But what is also clear in the marketplace is that the time frames for investment and innovation are compressing. The imperative to invest is now. We have been on a long journey to drive down operating efficiency ratio powered by revenue growth and digital productivity gains. 
Our journey will need to incorporate the investment imperative of the rapidly changing marketplace, and it is likely to pressure operating efficiency ratio along the way. 
Pulling way up, we're living through an extraordinary time of accelerating digital change. Our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our opportunity. It's setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking and it's the engine that drives enduring value creation over the long term.
And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

And yet, it seems like your strategy is working as evidenced by the better-than-peer growth metrics and credit. 
So I was just wondering, can you maybe just talk about the competitive environment you're seeing out there? 
How does it compare to maybe the middle part of the last decade? Where we saw competition accelerate? And where do you think it goes from here? And then I guess, maybe wrap that in with what does it mean for growth for the company? And I have 1 follow-up question."

So what -- there's -- let me really talk about the card competition that's probably the heart of your questions here, but we can also expand on that. But in Domestic -- in the Card business, competition has definitely intensified, especially in rewards. Marketing and media activity are I would say, approaching pre-pandemic levels and competitors continue to lean into marketing and originations. Direct mail is back to 2019 levels. Originations have also recovered across the industry and are above pre-pandemic levels. 
The pricing continues to be mostly stable. Our rewards offerings have become richer, and we continue to watch that very closely. We saw some modest increases in upfront bonuses, mainly in the form of limited time offers and in travel as demand returns.
Our rewards earned rates have also increased with some of the new product structures introduced recently, particularly in the cashback space. And of course, there's also a lot of increasing activity with fintechs, such as buy-now-pay-later, installment lending, and we talked about the breathtaking levels of investment by venture capital into that industry.
So -- and by the way, all of this is incredibly natural how a market should be reacting. If we didn't see everything that I just described to you, I would wonder if I woke up in the wrong place. This is incredibly natural. But in the context of this increased competition, we continue to see good opportunities for growth, which are enhanced by our tech transformation.
And we're keeping a close eye on competition, looking for adverse selection that may come as a result of that. And we are underwriting with the expectation of higher losses in the future. 
Now you asked for a comparison, Ryan, about how does this compare with the last decade. Certainly, in the middle of the last decade, competition in the credit card space really started picking up. But -- and some of the descriptors I would use here, I would use there in the sense that more spending on marketing and originations being kind of robust for the industry. 
Back then, we saw a bunch of things that we really don't see now, but we'll have to keep it out and eye out for that. What we saw back then is very aggressive behavior in ways that was more than just marketing. It really was in the form of looser underwriting. And in practices, some consumer practices that we did not feel were fully in the customer's interest. 
So there were a lot of things to react to in that marketplace. And if you look back Capital One's loan growth kind of slowed in the card business as we moderated in the face of what we thought was competition that was over the top and that was going to not only make it more costly to originate, but much more importantly, could impact the quality of -- the credit quality of what is being booked. 
So we do not feel right now that we're at a time like that, we have to be on the lookout for natural things that happens as competitors continue to heed up their efforts to grow. But I think we're in a pretty good period, Ryan, right now in the marketplace. 
And for Capital One, as indicated by my comment about marketing, we see good opportunities. We're leaning into that. And we have our having learned over the years and seen a lot of things, Ryan, we're going to have our eye out for things that we think are over the top."

So I was wondering that given that this downturn has been like no other, how are you thinking about the trajectory of credit over an intermediate time frame? Do you think we could run well below normal for an extended period of time? Or do you think there is the risk of fast normalization as the industry has become more concerned about?"

We're in an extraordinary place from a credit point of view, and I'm speaking of the industry, and obviously, Capital One as well. And not only for our Credit Card business, but also really across the board at Capital One. So as we think about where it could go from here, let's think a little bit about what's driving where it is. So obviously, the high level of consumer support through the government stimulus has been a factor. 
Although that's mostly in the rearview mirror, there's some lingering benefits in terms of the consumer balance sheet that come from that. But this will be a good time to watch how credit performs in the -- basically in the absence of that. 
We've also had widespread industry forbearance and consumers themselves have behave very rationally through this period of uncertainty, generally saving more spending less and paying down debt. And then on top of that, we've seen strong labor markets so far this year with very high demand for workers, solid wage growth, which should support consumers as government stimulates stimulus expires. 
So where does everything go from here? It feels inevitable that losses will increase from the exceptionally low levels of the past year and of where we are. But I think the timing -- it's much easier to have conviction about what will happen and the timing of that. We're looking for signs of normalization, card delinquencies ticked up modestly in August and September. Although this is the time of year when we tend to see seasonal increases in delinquencies.
So we -- this is just a -- I think this is a very strong time. And the I think most companies are enjoying the strength that most banks enjoying the strength that they have. I think they're leaning into their opportunities. And for Capital One, I think our opportunities are particularly good because of the technology that we -- the shoulders that we stand on.
But with a watchful eye for normalization that will absolutely inevitably happen. And by the way, when it happens, that's normal. That's not necessarily alarming at all. It would be surprising if it didn't happen, but we'll just watch out for the extremes of behavior and in the meantime, lean into our opportunities."

Well, look, revenue growth is the best friend of efficiency ratio, as you point out, Moshe. And our philosophy, I think some companies sort of drive -- try to drive a very sustained efficiency ratio improvement by just squeezing cost out and we're certainly trying to drive a lot of efficiencies from technology. 
But our philosophy is certainly that leaning into investing in technology and in growth opportunities can be an engine for revenue growth, and that, combined with digital efficiencies can help drive a sustained long-term improvement in efficiency ratio. 
And of course, we've enjoyed something like a 400 basis point improvement in efficiency ratio from 2013 to 2019 when the pandemic kind of interrupted our process. The reason I pointed out the -- my comment about efficiency ratio a few minutes ago was pointing out some of the pressures on the cost side that really come from the sweeping digital change that's transforming the marketplace and the compressed time frame for investment and innovation. 
And -- so new and traditional competitors embracing the need to invest in technology, the arms race for tech talent is fierce. And in fact, it's the biggest talent arms race that I've seen in my 3 decades of building Capital One. 
And that Moshe, that's a disappointing one because that raises the tied level of tech costs without generating in a sense, any benefits directly from that. 
And just talking about the fintechs for a minute. Here's some striking data. Investments in fintechs through the first 3 quarters of this year has been more than $90 billion or on an annualized basis, of course, that's $120 billion, and that's more than double last year's total.
And I mean those are just breathtaking investment numbers. And that's a huge assault on our industry from a kind of a defensive point of view as we react to that. But also, I look at this and say, that's a clear indication that banking is ripe for transformation, which we have believed for many, many years. So this all shows up in the need to invest both in technology itself and in leading digital products to gain competitive advantage and the clock is ticking.
So we're in a strong position to take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace, and we have invested for years to build a modern tech stack. We have a deep heritage in big data and analytics. And we have a large customer franchise and a national brand. So I really like our positioning and our chances, but we do have to invest to capitalize on the opportunity.
So Moshe, the pulling way up -- the pressures come really from 2 things, which both derived from one thing, which is the rapidly changing marketplace. So you've got the cost pressure in terms of tech wages and the compressing time frames for innovation across the industry. 
And we just wanted to share that with investors and that we are leaning in to capitalize on this opportunity. And all other things being equal, that pressures' efficiency ratio. Of course, when you pull way up everything I just talked about, maybe not so much the tech labor cost. 
But the investment imperative is in service of the same longer-term objectives, enhancing growth, building a franchise and very importantly, driving greater efficiency."

But the spend growth is really an across-the-board thing from mass market customers to the heavy spenders that we have in our portfolio. And virtually every spend category is up, and it's up over -- it's up over last year. It's up over 2 years ago. The only laggard versus 2 years ago -- I shouldn't say laggard. Basically, the travel and entertainment category has kind of caught up with where it was 2 years ago.
But given that you saw our overall purchase volume numbers are up 27% compared to 2019. It just kind of shows you how much -- pretty much all the rest of the categories are surging ahead. So that's partly a comment on the marketplace. And it's also partly a comment about Capital One and our -- the traction that we're getting in spend across our business. 
Obviously, you can see from our marketing and from our products, and we've spent years investing in building a spender franchise. And we -- the numbers that we've been posting are indicative of a lot of traction there. Now I'm going to -- I'm not going to give guidance on where it's going to go from here. 
I think it's got good momentum. But also, I think consumers have been sort of making up for lost time. And I think as they break out being so cooped up in the pandemic, the spend levels have been up. And we'll see where things go from here, but we certainly carry quite a bit of momentum into the marketplace. 
And the purchase volume success ends up being -- giving a boost to the outstanding growth of Capital One, which, of course, like all the banks is still being constrained somewhat by the high payment rates.

When we think about technology, I think there are probably 4 places or 4 opportunities. It's product, it's customer experience, it's back office, and it's potentially underwriting and adding value there.
I'm curious, when you think about those 4 factors or those 4 elements, where you see the biggest opportunity to enhance return? And are you seeing misuse of technology and people driving bad decisions or bad outcomes on any of these factors?"

And all the areas that you mentioned are opportunity areas. I think that the list is even more expansive than what you have, but I certainly agree with the 4 because I'm looking at products, customer experience, back office and underwritin",880,"So hello, Rick. And all the areas that you mentioned are opportunity areas. I think that the list is even more expansive than what you have, but I certainly agree with the 4 because I'm looking at products, customer experience, back office and underwriting. 
And I -- let me just kind of think through some of the real opportunity areas for us. And importantly, what I want to say is and what I'm going to talk about here stands on the shoulders of our modern tech stack and we're working to build breakthrough capabilities and solutions. For example, our new marketing platforms leverage big data streaming in real time to reach more customers with the right offers and driving to improve and optimize conversion rates.
Our new credit decisioning platforms enable us to use way more data and more sophisticated machine learning algorithms to make better credit decisions. our new fraud platform enables us to approve more transactions for our customers while simultaneously reducing fraud costs. 
And just let me pause on fraud for a second because one thinks that while investing in fraud is really important, of course, to getting fraud cost down because fraud costs have continued to sort of rise in the industry. But it's also the opportunity -- having breakthroughs in the management of fraud creates an opportunity on the customer experience side and the business opportunities we have. 
I'll give you 2 examples. One is in credit cards for very heavy spenders, where the card always works is an incredibly important battle cry in -- at the top of the marketplace. And so the spillover benefits there are significant and also in building a national digital bank. So if a bank just goes out there and hang out a shingle and say come on in and have folks sign up for digital bank accounts. It turns out while fraud rates in the branches or people -- if they want to commit fraud, they don't typically walk into a branch to commit account opening fraud.
But it's very easy to do that online. So what we have found is that our heavy investment in fraud has been instrumental to our national banking strategy that you see featured on TV and the ability to really, on a mass basis, open up accounts nationwide and be comfortable with respect to the fraud cost. 
So the -- so we've been talking about some of the risk management side. Let me also say just another key area, not really directly on your list, but sort of risk management beyond just underwriting or fraud is, as you know, just banks, the business. Risk management is the business. And the ability to automate risk management process is the ability to move to a 100% monitoring all the time in real time of things that were otherwise just sampled.  
There's just a lot of benefits that come from transforming how we work. Then to your customer experience category, we're building growing franchises in addition to the core card business and enhancing the experiences of our flagship cards. We're growing franchises with innovative products like Capital One Shopping and Credit Wise.
In the auto business, we're delivering innovative products like Auto Navigator, which offers real-time underwriting of any car on any lot in America in a fraction of the second and enables customers to know in advance what their financing terms will be on any car before they visit the dealership. And that was a little word-of-mouth thing until we put it on national TV in the last few months. I'm sure you've seen the ad. 
We're strengthening our brand and customer franchise, evidenced by high Net Promoter Scores and J.D. Power naming Capital One, the leading mobile banking app.  
I turn to the card partnership business. We're winning card partnership opportunities where increasingly, retailers are focusing on digital capabilities as like a preemptively important part of the conversation. 
We're partnering with tech leaders like Snowflake, where we are their largest customer. And in addition to getting valuable early investment stake in them, we've been able to leverage the world's leading data management platform for our own innovation. On the operating side, we're steadily working to automate our operating processes, enabling us to reduce risk and to reduce cost. 
Then there's the tech-on-tech savings, our investments in modern technology are enabling us to reduce legacy tech costs and legacy vendor costs. So again, even as we invest more in modern tech, we're really powered by some of the benefits of reducing legacy tech costs. 
Digital productivity gains are powering speed to market and revenue generation. And with all these growing opportunities, we're enjoying the virtuous cycle of attracting more and better tech talent, which in turn accelerates our progress. 
So even sort of beyond your list of 4, which is a great list, our technology transformation is changing the trajectory of Capital One in driving growth, improving efficiency, strengthening risk management, enhancing the brand and improving our status as a leading destination for great talent. And so we like very much the position that we're in here. as I've said, time frames are compressing in the industry, and we want to make sure that we capitalize on those opportunities. Thanks for your question, Rick."

The product structures and the overall rewards levels continue to be fairly aggressive. And you can see banks out there refreshing products in the market recently with enhanced rewards. And not only in the cash back space but also to your point, at the very top of the market, including with the high fee rewards card. So I have not -- look, I think we all live on pretty thin margins in transaction margins in this business really because of what's happening and it's great for consumers.
The leading banks have past so many benefits on the consumers. But what I -- I would be surprised if our biggest competitors at the top of the market are losing money on every transaction and trying to make it up with volume elsewhere in their franchise. 
Now there may be selected examples of that. But I think what the leading players and this is certainly what we've been doing at Capital One, we have invested for years in brand and digital capabilities, customer experience, the servicing side of things, the card always works side of things to where one doesn't have to compete solely on the basis of rewards, important though that is, I think, really for the top players, I think this is really, at the end of the day about building a franchise, a sustainable franchise.  
And I certainly, from everything I see, feel that, that's what we have here at Capital One. And I think a small number of players are particularly investing -- years of investing to get that position. And I think all of us are well served by what we have."

So I would think that not giving any sort of explicit guidance, but I think if you look at history as your guide, there's a lot in there that kind of would suggest where we might be going in the near term.
And Rich talked about the investments over time and how that's going to play into the number of factors across the P&L in terms of revenue growth in fraud and many other things that are playing down through there.

So John, we declared years ago that through the tech transformation that we were driving, which along the way was going to cost more to drive that, that over time this transformation and the extra growth that we could get in the marketplace could -- that would put us in a good position to drive operating efficiency over the longer term and that, that would be an important part of the investor value proposition for Capital One.
And we've already -- seeing some significant improvements in operating efficiency. I talked about the pressures that come from rising tech labor costs and the imperative to invest. But while, again, the rising labor costs sort of by themselves don't really generate a lot of value, they cost money. 
The things we're talking about here of leaning into investment opportunities are the very things that are part of our original strategic philosophy about driving operating efficiency. That's the way that we drive more growth over time. The way that we drive more digital productivity gains will be to continue leaning into our tech transformation and the investment at the top of the tech stack for the -- in the growth opportunities that can help power that.  
So we are still all in on the quest, the efficiency ratio quest. And the kind of destinations that we have talked about, we need to incorporate the investment imperative that we have along the way."

And one that for many, many years, we have been -- we put a -- we have put your strategic question, kind of front and center in our own thinking for years. 
So ever since you could watch, of course, in China and the incredible way that inside tech apps, one's whole life, including financial life gets embedded in there. That's the most extreme example of the front end of banking really being taken over by a tech company. 
And the risk, of course, as one looks at the marketplace, to your point, is the front end of banking being taken over by tech companies and banks being the utilities quietly behind the scenes of that. 
And that has been central on our radar screen from for many years. And we have seen -- and I think that there continues to be momentum in both camps. So in terms of the tech companies being the front end of banking, we see increasing traction in aggregation and many, many types of aggregation, not just people coming to go get a budgeting app kind of thing. We see that one-off aggregation for particular things and a whole variety of things in consumers' life. 
But between the incredible scale that tech companies have in terms of customers, the incredible engagement they have and now the increasing traction in aggregation that is something that all of us need to really be staring at. And I think there is, in a sense, kind of a great race going on between that model and the model of a bank being the go-to place, not only for the back end of banking, but really for the front end of banking where one can manage one's financial life through the technology of a customer's bank.
And that's been a primary objective of ours for a long time. And one of the probably 20 reasons that we've worked so hard to transform our technology because we want to have shoulders to stand on, that are the same shoulders as the leading tech companies have. So that we can build software and have the kind of capability and speed to market and so on that comes from being a modern tech company. 
And I have -- we have seen a lot of traction at Capital One. And I think some of the other leading banks have seen a lot of traction too. I mean just looking at the growth of not only how many mobile customers that we have -- both online and mobile customers, the growth rate of that. But also the frequency of visits and the increasing number of things that we can do for our customers. 
And the old world of banking was a reactive one. Customer would walk into a branch and say, I have a particular need, and then the banker would figure this out. The opportunity that comes in the new world of technology is where proactive banking is as important as reactive banking. 
They're not proactive banking in the sense of spamming more customers with lots of cross-sell offers. But really banking where we are watching the customers' money when the customer isn't, and providing leverage right in the flow of the customer's financial life to provide them the information that they need and the guidance that they need.
And if you notice some of the TV ads, we did probably 6 to 12 months ago, were all about some of the real-time alerts that were helping people with things that they really had no idea were going on with respect to their money. 
So I think that the great race that you talk about is on. It's one of the reasons we feel a real imperative to invest. But we like our position, and I really like actually our chances to not just build some features and have a bunch of customers, but actually to be at the center of our customers' financial lives and to be able to really build a growing franchise where Capital One is right there, where the eyeballs are and where a customers' mind share is."

So if you're looking just at card versus the corporate side, I mean, there's kind of 4 factors I would call out that drove it in the quarter in card yield. Specifically, Rich talked about the credit, kind of, benefits that are flowing through in suppression saw a tick up of delinquencies in the third quarter, in line with seasonal trends, but that aids late fees.
They tend to have a fourth -- a third thing of seasonally higher revolve rates and then day count in the quarter are kind of the drivers of card yield. So when I think about how those play out, you can figure out which things are kind of seasonal to the quarter versus which things are driven by more macroeconomic factors versus what is sort of underlying trends.
I'll pull up though and just give a corporate view of NIM because you touched on some of the other dimensions that are really playing through more corporately, which is the reduction of cash at the total company level and having that be replaced by card growth. And then those factors, coupled with the higher yield in card that I just described is really what benefited this quarter. 
So as we look ahead, continued normalization of cash, continued growth in revolving card balances, those are the things that would be tailwinds to NIM, but movements in the other direction, things like sustained higher than normal payment rates or reduction in card yield would be headwinds. So we'll just have to see how those things sort of net against one another."

A strategic thing that we've been really leaning into for a number of years at Capital One is a continued migration toward the transactor side of the business, not running away from the other one, but differentially really investing and enhancing that. 
And of course, when you see all the purchase volume growth and other things, you can see the benefit there. But what we have also found is that the real emphasis on the transacting side of the business even for revolvers ends up being something that not only generates more transactions, but it helps drive a healthier prime and even subprime book. So that quest is very aligned and well at Capital One.
We see growth opportunities really across the board. There's pretty intense competition across the board, but I think we see growth opportunities and a relatively rational marketplace in card across the board. The auto business, auto -- there's 2 things I would say about auto. First of all, there's like 4 or 5 planets that are aligned in the auto business that I don't think in our lifetimes are going to align again that have led to some of the extreme performance that's happened in the auto business in terms of the growth, the revenue, the credit side of the business, it's been a very strong thing.
Given the strength, we have been particularly -- had a cautious eye looking at competitive pressures in that business. And I've always said that the auto business is more subject to competitive pressure disrupting the business than the card business because the card business is one-on-one us with a customer or a prospect. The auto business, again, has the dealer in the middle of the whole exchange and the dealer is driving an auction.
And so we continue to be -- very carefully monitoring the competitive effects. We are seeing growing competition in the auto business. It's showing up across the board from big banks, credit unions, and smaller independent lenders, and we're seeing it play out across all credit segments. It's showing up in pricing, underwriting and loan terms. 
And many lenders have expanded beyond their pre-pandemic credit box. And as the competitive environment continues to evolve, we remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategy and our core philosophy of maintaining high resilience and taking what the market gives us remained unchanged. In our underwriting, we made conservative assumptions and assume rapid normalization of vehicle values to more sustainable levels. 
So there's kind of 2 competing things going on in the auto business that sort of -- that drives the results that you see. One is growing competition, which is very understandable because every auto player has posted really strong returns and wants to get more of that. 
There are some signs that we raise an eyebrow to make sure that we see sound underwriting out there in the marketplace. But we also have -- our opportunity is differentially being also powered by our tech capabilities that we have in the auto business, things like Auto Navigator, things like our relationship with the dealers and their reliance on our technology to help them underwrite better and sell cars more rapidly and effectively.
So the net of those 2 forces has led us to post another really solid quarter, and we're leaning in, in the auto business, but we should all understand we should be cautious about where the marketplace will go and also understand that the planet alignment, at some point those planets won't be as aligned as they have been."

Sorry for the silence. Thank you, Kevin, for the good question there. As we have said on a number of occasions, the banking industry -- by the way, scale matters a lot.
And by the way, however important scale was years ago -- and by the way, as someone that started Capital One 3 decades ago -- and I've always were worshiped on the altar, scale, and it's been a tough journey because we didn't have the scale for most of the time. And One is always reminded of how more scale would help. Banks -- most of the banking industry is, I think, focusing a lot on buying other banks to build a very important scale. 
At Capital One, we are not looking at bank acquisitions. We are building a national -- I mean -- by the way, we did 4 bank acquisitions in our past that were very important in putting us in a good position of threshold scale in the banking industry. But where we are focused on the banking side is in building a national digital bank. And that's really going to be an organic quest. No company has ever really built one organically, but we like where we are, and we like our chances. 
Our acquisition focus is looking at technology companies and the fintechs. And I mentioned both of those. We have done acquisition of technology companies where they have some of the tech capabilities that we're building. And since we share a similar tech stack, that's been a compatible thing to do and an accelerant. And then, of course, we are looking at fintechs and Capital One has done a number of those acquisitions in the past as well. 
We -- it's not lost on us the breathtaking valuations that these companies command. And so we want to be a patient investor, but we are real students of the fintech marketplace because we can learn so much from them. We're inspired by some of the things they come up with and the things that they do, and we partner with some of them to take stakes in some of them and sometimes do acquisitions. 
I think Capital One is in ideal position as an acquirer of a fintech because of the tech stack that we have. And pretty much every fintech out there -- every modern fintech out there is on the cloud. And I think that the -- they're on the cloud, the tech talent they have is like very similar to our own. 
Culturally, the whole thing, the emphasis on data and analytics that is behind a number of the fintechs has been a focus of our company since its founding days. So I think that we have some natural advantages on the acquiring side. So for years, we've looked at fintechs and occasionally, made acquisitions, and we certainly are pleased with the ones we have made."
