Today, we issued record fourth quarter results marking an outstanding close to a very dynamic and successful year. As I mentioned in our 2020 shareholder letter, we expected the operating environment of the 2020s to be on",2368,"Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. Today, we issued record fourth quarter results marking an outstanding close to a very dynamic and successful year. As I mentioned in our 2020 shareholder letter, we expected the operating environment of the 2020s to be one of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, or VUCA for short. Lest we had any thought of easing into that construct over time, like others, we were thrust into action as the pandemic roared onto the scene in March and April. And as for many companies, the early days of the pandemic brought into focus the first rung of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. We quickly established pandemic-era tactical priorities: first, protect the health and safety of our employees and supply chain partners. Secondly, ensure the continuity of our operations and financial stability; and third, do what we can or could to mitigate the impact of the virus in our communities. 
We undertook a myriad of actions consistent with those priorities, including the implementation of intensive company-wide safety protocols, including mandatory masks from day 1; significant liquidity enhancements cost reductions, some temporary, some permanent as well as a substantial increase in our philanthropy, both in dollar terms and in kind. 
We asked our people to be guided by our purpose. For those who make the world, we emphasized our 3 simple leadership principles, which include creating clarity, inspiring engagement and growing and delivering. Our people, while dealing with their personal hardships and challenges characteristic of this era, responded beautifully to our lead. Amidst 4 weeks of collapsing sellout revenue in April, we were hunkered down, ready to ride out the storm. and then suddenly, in the last week of April and on into the summer months, an abrupt and very positive phenomenon emerged in the Tools business. 
Our end users, many of them homebound, with time on their hands, discovered and/or rediscovered DIY projects, both indoors and outdoors. We enjoyed a surge in North American retail of a magnitude never before experienced. By June, POS was running 30% to 40% greater than the prior year. E-commerce growth exploded at levels even higher than that. Unfortunately, both we and our channel partners had solid inventory positions at the onset of the demand. By May, we were ramping up our factories to extraordinary levels. By the third quarter, the demand trend had extended to Europe and other markets around the world, albeit at somewhat lower levels, but still in strong double-digit territory. 
The second half of 2020 proved to be an all-out test of our supply chain resiliency and ability to serve the growth. Customer inventory levels have been substantially reduced by midyear and our global factories were running at historic levels just to keep up with the POS demand, and they still are. We faced rolling labor shortages, supplier issues and various arbitrary government edicts in jurisdictions all over the globe. However, we were able to prevail and operate continuously with only minor exceptions. And along the way, we've moved forward with significant capacity expansion actions for both power and hand tools, and we look forward to serving continued growth in the future. 
2020 was by far the most difficult backdrop we've ever faced, but we were prepared for volatility and our people rose to meet the challenges. Fortunately, we went into it with strength and have stayed strong for the duration. Back in 2016, we committed to a vision that embodied purpose-driven performance. We've built a company that is anchored by a support of people-oriented culture, striving to deliver top quartile shareholder return to become known as one of the world's great innovators and to elevate an already strong commitment to ESG and corporate social responsibility. 
We demonstrated in 2020 that when corporations like ours put people first and work to have a positive impact on society at large, the result can be extraordinary resilience, which benefits our shareholders through outstanding growth, cash flow, margin expansion and ESG, and that is the story of 2020. 
On the heels of an excellent third quarter, the fourth quarter was the pinnacle of our 2020 performance, and we entered 2021 stronger than ever. And now I'll take a moment and recap the 4Q numbers, which demonstrate the power of our momentum as we enter 2021. 
Revenues were up 19% to $4.4 billion with organic growth of 16%. This was led once again by Tools & Storage, which had organic revenue up an impressive 25%. Our total company operating margin rate, excluding charges, was a fourth quarter record at 16.5%, up 290 basis points from prior year with volume leverage, productivity, cost actions, price and margin resiliency initiatives all contributing.  Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $3.29, up 51%, 51% versus prior year. 
And now let's turn to the full year. Revenues were $14.5 billion, up 1%, with 10% organic growth in the second half more than offsetting the first half pandemic-related issues. Full year operating margin rate expanded 110 basis points to 14.6%, attributable to strong cost control, productivity, our margin resiliency initiatives and price. Adjusted EPS for the year was $9.04, an 8% increase versus 2019, especially remarkable, when considering our original prepandemic guidance midpoint last January was $8.90 a share. 
We converted the strong sales and margin results, along with just over 0.5 turn of working capital improvement, into record cash flow. Free cash flow was $1.7 billion for the year, $1.7 billion for the year, an all-time record for the company, up 55% versus 2019 with a conversion rate of 136%. And lastly, I'm happy to report that we successfully exceeded all of our 5-year, medium-term environmental health and safety goals established in 2015. We targeted a 20% reduction of our energy consumption, our carbon emissions, our water use and our waste generated in our facilities and more than attained each one of those goals. In addition, we significantly improved our recycling and use of renewable energy and achieved our safety goals. 
When I became CEO in 2016, we updated our vision to elevate our commitment to social responsibility. Achievement of these goals is an important milestone in our journey to execute on our 2030 sustainability strategy. More goals and more milestones ahead as we continue on this March. So where do we go from here? In a world of elevated uncertainty, here are a few observations to simplify and clarify our point of view on that for '21 and '22. Without question, tools and outdoor demand is on a roll, and we think it will be for some time to come, benefiting from a series of exogenous factors, including: first, a secular surge in global DIY, driven by the consumers' rediscovery of home and garden; secondly, a massive acceleration of the global shift to e-commerce within our channels, which plays to our strength as the global tools leader in e-commerce; and third, a cyclical boom in North America home improvement, driven by increasing new and preowned home sales associated largely with household formation and the urban exodus; and then there is the need to rebuild channel levels -- inventory levels, which we believe are at least 4 weeks lower than desirable. 
Our Tools business has never been stronger or better positioned to gain share, and we have consistently grown organically and gained share every year since the merger of Stanley and Black & Decker 11 years ago. Our unmatched array of iconic brands, market-leading innovation, combined with our scale and organizational agility, continues to support that investment thesis. 
Total company operating margin reached new heights in the second half of 2020, breaking through the 15% threshold at 17.7% and 16.5% in 3Q and 4Q respectively. This is a significant increase of about 300 basis points over prior year and it is not a coincidence. It derives from an intentional confluence of tight cost management, volume leverage, price/mix management and our margin resiliency initiative. The latter applies cutting-edge digital technologies to optimize margin performance across multiple value pools. Skeptics point out that the third quarter benefited from cost reductions, some of which were admittedly temporary in nature. These skeptics now have to deal with the fourth quarter in which the 16.5% includes the vast majority of temporary costs such as furloughs, 4-day work weeks, executive salary reductions and benefit deferrals back in the run rate. This was accomplished as we began to fund significant new investments in growth initiatives, including major thrusts into e-commerce, revitalizing the Black & Decker brand, security, health and safety, and outdoor products. And although the second half '21 Tools' growth comp is difficult, we believe it is manageable, and we are predicting full year total company organic growth of approximately 6% at the midpoint, with a super strong first half and a modest negative in the back half yielding the 6% midpoint, which is the high end of our long-term growth objective for that measure. 
Our strong share momentum, aided by numerous growth catalysts such as FLEXVOLT, Craftsman, ATOMIC, XTREME, POWERDETECT and e-commerce, should not be underestimated. On top of this, there's an industrial-related portion of Tools that is in the midst of a cyclical rebound as we enter 2021, along with about $4 billion of Industrial, which includes Engineered Fastening automotive, and the Security segment revenue, which was negative in 2020, all those are expected to be positive in the aggregate in 2021. So for all these reasons and more, as Don will cover in his remarks, our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance is introduced at $9.70 to $10.30 a share. At the midpoint, this is $10, up 11%, which is a very good place to start our journey into 2021. And while it is too early, way too early to guess at what market conditions might be in 2022, we stand to benefit from our multiyear relationship with MTD and our optionality to acquire the remaining 80% at a very attractive multiple with a window that begins to open in July of this year, which brings me to a brief update on MTD. Our current planning assumption calls for the exercise of our MTD option and the potential addition of up to $3 billion of revenue from the MTD transaction in 2022. And just to clarify, we expect to implement or exercise the option in late '21 and begin to recognize revenue subsequent to regulatory approvals and hopefully, beginning in 2022. 
The lawn and garden category is experiencing similar benefits to Tools from the consumer's reconnection with the home. And MTD LTM revenues now approximate $2.6 billion with a very strong second half revenue performance in the books, comparable to our Tools business. Additionally, MTD continues to make progress on multiple opportunities to generate operational efficiency and margin improvement, delivering a 6% operating margin in 2020 with momentum coming into the 2021 season and plenty of runway ahead for further improvement. The transaction was structured in a financially prudent way, whereby we purchased 20% of the company at an 11x multiple with the option to purchase the remaining 80% anytime during a 10-year window beginning this July. MTD's incremental EBITDA improvement since our initial purchase is shared 50-50 and is thus valued at 5.5x, which provides us the ability to acquire a market leader in outdoor power equipment at an all-in multiple the time of option execution likely to approximate 7 to 8x. We are excited by the multiple levers to accelerate growth and margin expansion with this acquisition. In addition to the initial revenue contribution upon consolidation, we see additional organic growth opportunities in the pro outdoor equipment market as well as to drive electric-powered and autonomous mower offerings while employing our successful commercial model to fully leverage our portfolio of brands and channels. 
We're also working on a multiyear road map to achieve 15% operating margin in the category, not likely some say. However, we believe we're up to the challenge. I remind the naysayers that Black & Decker's operating margin was below 6% in the year before acquisition, and the very same team that addressed that opportunity is still in the field today. We continue to be encouraged by MTD's innovation and product development pipeline as well as their progress on improving profitability, and we're excited about this future combination. Even before exercising our option, we are bringing this vision to life in 2021, with FTD and MTD each independently launching a series of new products under the DEWALT, Craftsman and Black & Decker brands that are hitting the market now across the gas and electric power spectrum. A few notable examples. MTD brings world-class innovation in writing and zero-turn mowers. And through a licensing arrangement, we'll launch a new lineup of the well-branded, gas-powered professional mowers that are now beginning to roll out at one of our major U.S. retailers. In addition, we have designed, developed and are launching new cordless 20-volt DEWALT walk-behind mowers also with strong listings that will be made in the U.S.A. with global materials and MTD's Tupelo, Mississippi facility. 
MTD continues to expand its outdoor offering into new categories with Craftsman under license. New to this -- new to market this year will be an impressive lineup of zero-turn gas mowers as well as gas-powered solutions in riding and walk-behind mowers. Concurrently, SBD will expand our battery and electric-powered offerings in push mowers, power washers and handheld products such as chainsaws, trimmers and blowers. 
Lastly, as a part of our e-commerce-focused brand refresh with Black & Decker -- of Black & Decker, MTD will launch a new lineup of gas handheld products under license. And we will launch new electric offerings, including an autonomous robotic mower in Europe. 
As you can see, we've been busy working our partnership with MTD, and there is a lot to be excited about that. And for 2021, these opportunities are planned to deliver more than $100 million of organic growth for SBD as well as support additional growth for MTD. With broad coverage across gas-powered products for MTD and electric and battery-powered categories for SBD, we are just starting to tap into the significant potential ahead of us. 
And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan to cover the fourth quarter and our 2021 guidance. Don?"

We are incredibly pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance, which closed out an amazing back half to 2020.

We are incredibly pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance, which closed out an amazing back half to 2020. So now I would like to review our business segment results for the fourth quarter. 
Tools & Storage delivered an exceptional 25% total and organic revenue growth with volume up 23% and price contributing additional 2 points. All regions continued to benefit from exceptionally strong revenue trends related to the consumer's reconnection with home and garden. E-commerce continued to be very strong. We had a strong holiday season and a robust lineup of new products and innovation. 
The operating margin rate for this segment was another outstanding result at 20.7%, up 420 basis points versus the prior year as volume, productivity, cost control and price were modestly offset by new growth investments. As the revenue outlook improved during 2020, we released incremental SG&A investments to further the development of our brands via digital marketing, increased distribution capacity and added commercial resources to support our business model in brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. We believe much of these investments will drive further organic growth and share gains in 2021 and 2022. 
Now let's look at some of the geographies within Tools & Storage. North America was up a robust 27% organically. Retail continued to see exceptionally strong POS, delivering 36% organic growth through a very strong holiday season, along with continued momentum in e-commerce. POS growth for the quarter approximated 30%. And retailer inventories ended the year slightly below Q3 levels and well below prior year, an amazing Q4 performance for the Tools & Storage team. And what's incredibly amazing is we still have a channel refill opportunity of 4 weeks in front of us that will likely materialize in the front part of 2021. 
The North American commercial and industrial channels continue to experience positive sequential trends with both posting low single-digit growth this quarter versus declines in Q3. Fair play construction customers within these channels were up mid-teens in Q4, significantly improved from the low single-digit growth last quarter. This trend is clearly another strong signal that professional demand is back and accelerating. 
The Tools & Storage European business also had an outstanding fourth quarter as all regions grew, which resulted in 18% organic growth. This performance was led by the U.K., Central Europe, Nordics, Benelux and Iberia all up double digits, with France and Italy up mid-single digits. The team experienced strong revenue growth in both retail, brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. 
Finally, emerging markets delivered an exceptional quarter of organic growth as well, up 22%, with all regions posting positive revenue trends. We experienced strong construction demand in these markets. And when combined with positive pricing momentum, it supported this robust performance. 
Latin America was the strongest performer, delivering 36% organic growth with all countries up double digits. While Russia and Turkey had another very strong quarter, also resulting in double-digit growth in these markets. Finally, Asia delivered low single-digit growth, led by South Korea and India, each up double digits, which was partially offset by modest declines in China and Southeast Asia. 
Now let's pivot and look at the Tools & Storage SBUs. Power Tools delivered 32% organic growth, benefiting from the home and construction trends mentioned previously as well as strong commercial execution for the holiday season and new product introductions. We continue to see strong share gains from our new innovations in FLEXVOLT, ATOMIC and XTREME, which now represent over $600 million of annual revenue on a combined basis. 
Our outdoor product business delivered 29% organic growth as these categories continue to benefit from the consumer reconnection with the home as well as new DeWalt and Craftsman cordless products were launched in 2020. The Hand Tools and Accessory and Storage business delivered an impressive 15% organic growth in the quarter. This was supported by new product launches, the strong performance in emerging markets and Mac Tools, combined with the rebound in professional construction demand I just previously mentioned. In summary, an amazing quarter in an incredibly successful year for Tools & Storage. The team remained focused and responded with agility to the pandemic and quickly pivoted to fulfill the surging demand that emerged in the second half of the year. This effort was remarkable and helped them delivered record levels of growth and margin expansion during one of the most challenging operating environments in our lifetimes. Great job by the entire team. We thank them for their intense and focused efforts. I am really excited to see the encore performance in 2021. 
Turning to Industrial. Total growth was 10%, which included an 11 point contribution from the CAM acquisition and 2 points from currency. This was partially offset by a 2% volume-driven organic decline and a negative 1% impact from the divestiture of a noncore product line in Oil & Gas. It was great to see continued improving trends sequentially as the organic decline in Q3 of 18% improved to negative 2% in the fourth quarter, a trend which is positioning this segment for organic growth in 2021. The operating margin rate increased 110 basis points year-over-year to 14.7% as the benefits from productivity and restructuring cost actions more than offset the impact of the lower volume. 
Diving a bit deeper into this segment. Engineered Fastening revenues were down 2% organically as growth in automotive was offset by an improved but still declining general Industrial end market. Automotive was up mid-single digits behind high-teens growth in Automotive Fasteners, which was partially offset by continued declines in systems as most new capital investment decisions related to new car models continue to be on hold. However, global light vehicle production continues to improve, and we remain well positioned to outpace the underlying market with content gains in the fastener portion of this business. Industrial fasteners declined high single digits in the fourth quarter. The recovery in the industrial markets continues to progress, and we once again saw a sequential improvement. Our Infrastructure businesses declined 5% organically as positive Attachment Tools growth was more than offset by reduced pipeline construction in Oil & Gas. 
And finally, turning to Security. Total revenue was down 3% with a 3% positive impact from currency while price and acquisitions each contributed 1%. This was offset by a 5-point decline in volumes and a negative 3% due to the divestitures announced last quarter. North America declined 5% as growth in health care was offset by lower installations in automatic doors and commercial electronic security. These businesses are serving markets that are still slowly improving from the pandemic impact, and it also faced a difficult 7% growth comparable in 2019. 
European Security organic growth was relatively flat as they experienced solid growth in France from the new growth initiatives which began to take root. This performance was offset by lower volume in the U.K. related to the various intense lockdowns from the pandemic. 
Our focus on health and safety initiatives, such as touchless stores, contact tracing and health care solutions are building momentum and generated about 150 basis points of growth in Q4. With the healthy backlog, a continued recovering market and the addition of these new solutions, we are optimistic that Security can return to growth in the front half and for the full year of 2021. 
In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin rate was 11.2%, flat versus the prior year as price and cost control were offset by the impact from lower volume and growth investments. 
Now let's take a look at our very strong free cash flow performance on the next page. As you can see, we were able to leverage our strong operational performance in the back half to generate a record full year free cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion in 2020. This represents an increase of $593 million versus the prior year and a free cash flow conversion of 136% of net income. This result was driven by the strong growth in Tools & Storage, our company-wide cost actions and lower capital spending, delivering significant improvement in cash earnings. 
Now as it relates to working capital, we delivered 10.4 working capital turns, up 0.6 turns year-over-year, reflecting the strong revenue performance and leveraging the SBD operating model to drive working capital efficiency across the company. With the strong cash generation and inclusion of the excess cash on the balance sheet, which amounted to $1.4 billion at year-end, we believe we are well positioned from a leverage perspective heading into 2021, a fantastic outcome. 
Now I would like to discuss our views on 2021 as improving channel and market visibility has enabled us to reinstate guidance. Beginning with Slide 10, I'd like to dive deeper into several of our 2021 organic growth assumptions. We are experiencing a fast start to the first quarter as strong market trends in Tools & Storage continue, combined with improving Industrial and Security markets. Therefore, we expect organic revenue growth to approximate 21% to 26% for the company in the first quarter of 2021. 
Tools & Storage is the largest contributor of this strong performance, and our plans assume a 1Q organic growth range of 30% to 40%. Underpinning this assumption is the continuation of the strong demand trends, the potential for customer inventories to start to move back to historical levels, and finally, we have an easier comp since Q1 2019 at the beginning -- Q1 2020 at the beginning impacts from the pandemic. Growth continues to be broad-based with all regions contributing to very strong outlook. POS in U.S. retail through the first 3 weeks of January has remained in a similar band that we experienced during December, and we are assuming this trend will continue through the remainder of the quarter. 
We are also seeing continued positive momentum in the commercial and Industrial channels. Tools & Storage European and emerging markets continue to experience strong momentum as well. And we are currently expecting demand trends in Q1 that are similar to the fourth quarter we just completed. 
Another way to look at the 30% to 40% Tools & Storage organic growth assumption is that it represents approximately $600 million to $800 million of Q1 organic growth. January, which is historically a very slow month for Tools & Storage, is on track through 3 or 5 weeks to deliver $400 million of growth in the month. Additionally, February and March were both negative comps in 2020. Therefore, we believe with the continuation of market demand trends and a modest contribution from safety stock increases across our global customer base, this represents a very strong or reasonably balanced expectation for the first quarter. 
Turning to Industrial. Our first quarter assumes a decline of 5% up to flat organically. To deconstruct this a bit, at the midpoint of this range, we are calling for high single-digit to low double-digit growth in both Attachment Tools and within automotive Engineered Fastening, which in total represent a little more than half of this segment. Supporting this, Attachment Tools experienced a 50% year-over-year increase in Q4 backlog. In automotive, this assumes a moderation of fastener volume growth to low double digits and a less severe decline on easier comps for our Systems business. We expect our Industrial Fastener business to continue its sequential improvement and be relatively flat. Offsetting these positive factors in Q1, we anticipate steep declines in Oil & Gas and aerospace. CAM is included in the organic growth calculation partway through the first quarter. As both of these businesses are longer cycle, they held up relatively better when the initial impacts of the pandemic occurred and therefore, will be challenged in the front half of 2021. 
Turning to Security. Our plan assumes for a range of flat to up low single digits organically in Q1. Exit trends in December for this business were strong. And the backlog ended the year up double digits, which provides a good setup as we enter Q1, particularly as the easier comps begin in the month of March. Additionally, the business is focused on continuing to stimulate demand with their existing and new health and safety solutions that emerge from the pandemic and started to generate revenue prior to the end of the year. 
Turning to the right side of the slide, I want to touch on the full year growth assumptions for all segments and the first and second half planning assumptions for Tools & Storage. As you would expect, we are planning for a very strong first half of the year. We are expecting the strong trends I just talked about through -- I just talked through for Q1 to moderate in the second quarter but remain quite strong. The continued market recoveries in Security and Industrial, strong demand in Tools and relatively easy year-over-year comps positions the company for an organic growth range of 19% to 24% for the first quarter. 
For the second half, we have moderated our assumptions to incorporate the difficult comps created by the strong second half 2020 growth in Tools. While we are pushing for more growth and share gains, we felt it was prudent to set expectations for a decline of 3% to 8% organically for the company. This is how we have constructed our overall range of 4% to 8% organic growth for the full year for Stanley Black & Decker. 
For Tools & Storage, we're also assuming full year growth of 48%, which includes organic growth of 27% to 32% in the first half for the reasons previously mentioned, and a decline of 7% to 12% in the back half. While the growth in Tools is retracting versus 2020 in the back half, the range is up 4% to 10% versus the back half of 2019. This is a reasonable 2-year assumption based on the historical growth numbers we have seen for this business. That being said, this is a short-cycle business, and we are ensuring the supply chain can accommodate second half scenarios that are improved versus this range. The potential scenario we must be prepared for is robust Tools & Storage markets that continue for the majority of 2021. We have not assumed this will occur in our guidance, but we will be ready to respond if this does evolve in the coming months. 
For Industrial, we are assuming 2% to 6% growth in 2021 with a stronger performance in the front half due to the easier comps. Engineered Fastening and Attachment Tools have a lot of momentum, and we are well positioned to capitalize upon the recovery as it unfolds in 2021. As it relates to Oil & Gas and aerospace, we expect they will remain a significant headwind to growth in the front half, but this eases a bit as we move into the back half. 
Finally, for Security, we see a range for 4% to 6% growth for the full year. This is fairly consistent across the 2 halves as the front half has easier comps and the back half carries a stronger level of growth from the ramp-up of our health and safety-focused growth initiatives. 
We are excited by the prospects for these tech-enabled products, which contributed 1.5 points of growth in the fourth quarter and could represent up to $100 million of revenue in 2021. So in summary, we are expecting 4% to 8% organic full year growth with growth in every segment. We are well positioned to capture market recoveries and share gains in each of our businesses and feel this is a balanced range that acknowledges the current environment. We will continue to watch our markets and will be prepared if the back half assumption proves to be conservative. 
Now I'll summarize the remaining guidance assumptions on Slide 11. We are reinitiating guidance in 2021 with an adjusted earnings per share range of $9.70 to $10.30, up approximately 11% versus prior year at the midpoint. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $9.15 to $9.85, inclusive of various onetime charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. This range is $0.40 wider than our traditional guide, recognizing that while visibility has improved, the operating environment remains dynamic. 
Since I just covered organic growth, let's jump right into the cost structure considerations. We expect $125 million of carryover cost saving net of the reversal of temporary actions from the cost program we implemented in the second quarter of 2020. These actions will primarily benefit the first quarter with a modest benefit in the second quarter. From an inflation perspective, we currently see the potential for approximately $75 million of headwind, primarily associated with steel, base metals, transportation, electronic components and resins. Keep in mind, we generally lock in our supply agreements 1 to 2 quarters out so the timing of this headwind is back-half weighted. Partially offsetting this headwind is a tailwind of roughly $45 million related to foreign exchange. Therefore, at this point in time, we have included $30 million of a headwind associated with these externally driven cost inputs. 
Should we see additional pressure in commodities or should currency reverse, we will utilize our productivity programs and pricing to neutralize the pressure over time. However, specific to 2021, as a reminder,  we have $100 million to $150 million of margin resiliency benefits as a contingency, which is not included in our guidance. This contingency will assist in mitigating new headwinds in these areas during 2020 if they emerge. Finally, we have disclosed our current full year assumptions for the significant below-the-line items and our expectation for pretax M&A and other charges to assist with your modeling. 
Turning to cash flow. We expect another strong performance in 2021 with free cash flow conversion approximating GAAP net income. Underpinning this expectation is capital expenditures of approximately 3% of net sales. In addition, we will utilize the SBD operating model to drive efficiencies and working capital to deliver turns improvement. Lastly, we expect the first quarter's earnings per share to be approximately 24% of the full year performance, which is primarily driven by operating leverage on the organic growth assumptions I walked through for Q1 and the $150 million of benefits from the carryover cost actions we have implemented. 
So in summary, for the total company, we expect 4% to 8% organic growth and 7% to 14% adjusted EPS expansion, a strong forecast that represents a balanced view recognizing the dynamic operating environment, but also incorporates more difficult comps and inflation assumptions into the plan while delivering healthy margin expansion and EPS growth for the full year. The organization remains focused on meeting the needs of several ongoing strong and sequentially improving markets, leveraging our organic growth catalysts as well, executing margin resiliency and generating strong free cash flow while not losing sight of ensuring we keep our employees safe and assisting our communities through the remainder of this pandemic. 
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim to close out with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim?"

In summary, 2020 was an extraordinary year for Stanley Black & Decker. This performance was possible due to the agility, passion and dedication of our people, combined with a strong cultural and financial foundation. It's hard to pick one element to get most enthused about given the 2020 performance, especially in the second half as well as the improving outlook. Is it the growth, the margin expansion or the extraordinary cash flow and the potential for more? Is it the demonstrated resilience of this purpose-driven company? Or is it the enormous potential given the way the company is positioned for 2021 and 2022? In my view, it's all of the above. We are energized by the existence of a multiyear runway for growth and profitability improvement. The shareholder value-creation potential is certainly compelling over the medium to long term. While pursuing these shareholder rewards, we are also mindful of our responsibility to society and the multiple stakeholders that we serve. And our sustained commitment to ESG and social responsibility is strong, authentic, and we continue to elevate it over time. 
And as you can see, there's a lot to be excited about with our MTD partnership. And for 2021, these opportunities are planned to deliver more than $100 million of organic growth for SBD as well as to support additional growth for MTD. 
So I want to thank everybody. It's been an exciting year. There's a lot of really great things ahead. And now I'll turn it over to Dennis. Dennis?"

There are some licensing income associated with some of the opportunities I described in the comments. There's some organic growth in Stanley based on some collaboration with MTD on products that we will be selling through our own channels and our own brands. But there is nothing related to the acquisition in the guidance. 
The multiple is going to be a trailing multiple because that's how the option is basically priced. It's based on a trailing EBITDA. And so that's where the 7 to 8x comes from. And as far as the road to mid-teens operating margin, it's our our objective to get the operating margin up to around -- somewhere around 8-ish percent next year, maybe a little higher if the volume kind of comes through the way we think. And so if we start from, let's say, a base of maybe 8% to 10%, there is a whole series of cost reduction, value-creation activities that exist in a plan, if you will. It's a somewhat high level plan because we're not able to get in and do super detailed diligence at this point. But we have been working with a major consulting firm to come up with some -- a point of view on how we can get to a number, something in the neighborhood of probably $50 million to $100 million of additional margin improvement that is not being implemented by MTD for various reasons. One, they may not have the appetite for it or they may not have the capability to do it. But we have some ideas that are pretty specific in that regard. And that gets us up into like the 12-ish kind of zone. And then from 12 to 15, it really is going to be a function of really leveraging the synergies between the companies, the channel synergies, the brand synergies, the growth and also a major thrust into the professional channel. I must say that having spent some time at MTD in September, I was blown away by the quality of their innovation pipeline, the collaboration, to the extent we've been allowed to do that through -- based on certain legal constraints and so on. But the collaboration that we have been able to do in terms of lightweighting, electrification, autonomy, those types of things, it's really, really impressive. And what they've done on their own is impressive, too. So the combination of all those things, I expect that we will make a major thrust into the pro channel. The products are going to be very, very strong. And when we start branding those products with some of our major brands such as DEWALT, I think there's going to be a really compelling value proposition for the channel and the end-user to carry those products and buy those products. So that's kind of where we're going with MTD. You can start to see the -- in the marketplace in 2021, some of the, I'll call them, collaborations around just the edges without really being 100% owned by us. And the ability for us to generate $100 million of organic growth just with some modest collaboration in terms of commercial and product is really kind of underlines the potential and the power of this relationship."

So we feel really positive about how the business positioned itself from a profitability perspective.

I'll start with the raw material part of that question. I mean we saw these trends kind of emerge in October time frame, November and in the categories I mentioned of steel, resin, electronic components. And so that is going to continue for a period",405,"Yes. I'll start with the raw material part of that question. I mean we saw these trends kind of emerge in October time frame, November and in the categories I mentioned of steel, resin, electronic components. And so that is going to continue for a period of time. Right now, we have $75 million of an increase in those types of categories in our guidance for 2021. I don't think it's going to radically deviate from that. It could go up a little bit as the year goes on. But we do have to keep in mind that the way that we structure our contracts, it usually takes a good 6 months for that to really impact our P&L, which gives us time to respond with pricing actions, if that makes sense, or productivity or whatever the case may be. And then that kind of helps us mitigate that over a longer period of time, maybe over a multiyear period of time, those actions. 
The margin resiliency program is an annual program that we started about 3 years ago, which was built on -- let's look at the different areas of our company, the functions, the operations teams, how we price our products, et cetera, and use technology such as artificial intelligence, advanced data analytics and make better decisions in those particular areas to drive efficiency and effectiveness. And we've seen that over the last few years that ongoing process of the team that's been created and the technology that they use, we have about 100 people that are focused on this full time in the company, drives about $100 million to $150 million of annual value. Now we could put that in our P&L and make it part of our guidance. But we think it's more prudent in volatile times like this to have it outside the guidance as a contingency. And so when new things come your way that are headwinds, you have an offset. These things are underway. They're in process. And so they're driving value this month, in all 12 months out of the year. And so if the headwinds don't come, you get the opportunity to position yourself to outperform. And we think it's a very balanced way to approach guidance and the way to operate in this world, given the level of volatility that we've all seen in the last 4 years, but in particular, the last 12 months."

And we've always been able to offset a part of it with price and new product development, new product introductions and so on. And then there's always productivity that has come through and helped offset the rest of it and actually given us some decent margin accretion certain years even when there was inflation. And so this reflex reaction that occurred, which was, ""Oh, my gosh, Stanley Black & Decker is inflation prone,"" didn't make any sense to us. But then when we thought about it, we realized that if you go back to the '17, '18, '19 kind of time frame, there was this $1 billion of headwinds that we have all behind us now. And that $1 billion of headwinds was a triad of things. It was the inflation, it was the tariffs and it was the FX. And $1 billion was just too big a series of headwinds to just offset with the normal types of offsets that I talked about, so we ended up having to do some restructuring. And by the way, we still generated 6% earnings growth during that time frame. So it wasn't catastrophic. It was just a of work and a lot of pain in order to get through that period and we did it. But any one of those, whether it was the FX or the inflation or the tariffs, any one of those we could have handled easily through our normal contingencies and things like that. But when we put them all together in that 3 years in a row, it just became -- it became a lot. And so that perception, I think, develops. So immediately when the winds of inflation started blowing in the third, fourth quarter, we got this reflex from the investment community. But I think as of today, I hope that we can put that behind us because it is not a significant material issue to us in '21."

And with the home being in the focal point as well as outdoor being the focal point of people's activities and the number of projects and the number of people doing projects and doing projects for the first time is at record levels. I think another thing is the install base of battery systems is a big deal with this kind of growth that we have in 2020 and now into '21. There are going to be more and more first timers or people that have bought new battery systems, investing in additional Tools for their battery systems. And frankly, I think once people discover DIY, it tends to be somewhat addictive. So I think that we're going to have a -- it is a secular shift, in my opinion. I think the home center CEOs would agree with that. I've heard them talk about that as well. So that's a big deal. Obviously, it abates over time as the comps kind of get tougher in terms of its percentage impact on growth. And what we saw in 2000 relative to the pros was, in the beginning, the pros, like, let's say, like April, May projects kind of came to a grinding halt, for the most part, except for the really essential ones. And then into the summer, the pro started coming back into the third and fourth quarter. You can't even get a contractor in this country anymore if you want one. So at least I've had that experience. I think the contractors are very busy in the resi and both the remodeling and in the new construction areas. They've got a tremendous backlog. I think they are back. I mean I think that has played out. So as we go forward, I think what we're really looking at is more of kind of going up against the comps and getting back to a more normal environment as we get into '22 and beyond. But it's -- it is one. It's an art, as you say, and it's difficult to really parse in great detail exactly what's happening. But that is our gut feel and instinct based on what we can see here at this point."

The areas that really are being hit hard are steel, resin, electronic components and then battery cells or base metals, if you want to call it that, however you want to call it. But those 4 categories are things that there's a high demand for right now as we all know. The question is how long does that demand last? Is there a -- there's parts of the economy that are really going strong, and there's other parts of the economy that are not, that have not recovered as well. And the timing of that recovery is going to depend on how the vaccines roll out and how we eventually get to herd immunity and how quickly that occurs. So we could be seeing a short-term bubble here that maybe moderate for a period of time or it could be something that continues to grow modestly over multiple years. So time will tell. But I think we've got that in the right box right now, and it's something we can manage going forward with all the levers that I described. 
The other 2 segments for profitability improvement, I can probably be cute and give you all kinds of leverage factors. But I think it might be simpler to just say, if you think about the whole company's operating margin rate, we're trying to improve about 50 basis points year-over-year. Tools, as China improve roughly the same number, maybe a little bit more. And so that means Industrial and Security are going to improve about same number, too. So I think you can kind of look at a 50 -- anywhere from 40 to 60 basis point improvement in all 3 segments with the net result for the company of about 50 basis points for the full year."

We were very fortunate that we were able to really -- first of all, we started the year with a really solid inventory position, both in the company and in the channels or at least the North American channels where the demand really spiked. And so tha",490,"Yes. We were very fortunate that we were able to really -- first of all, we started the year with a really solid inventory position, both in the company and in the channels or at least the North American channels where the demand really spiked. And so that was helpful because it was kind of a strange situation. But it got into May, and we were looking at POS that was starting to skyrocket and the orders were not coming in from the channel, and so we ended up building quite a bit of inventory starting in May, actually over $500 million of inventory we built to serve POS demand that was occurring. And we had to kind of bet that the POS was going to continue at that rate and it did. And that enabled us to really get ahead of the situation so that we've been -- now if you look at, at this point in time, we're essentially serving the POS and have been for 2 quarters now. And we're able to do that. Our end-users continue to be very, very robust and buying tools. And our channel partners would like more. They would like their inventory restored. And that is the challenge. And so one of the things that we've done, and we were also very fortunate are made -- our make where you sell campaign that we've been working on for 3 or 4 years had some pretty significant capacity additions both in Mexico and in North America and in the U.S. and a number of those are either online or coming online, including a major plant in Mexico and a major plant in the U.S. in -- later in 2021. And so as we look forward, we're not counting on those to necessarily get the inventories back to where they need to be in the channels. But we are looking forward to the fact that we will have more capacity in the system, significantly more capacity as we get into 2021. So we're not too concerned about that. 
And in the meantime, there's a tremendous amount of inefficiency that's been built into our cost of goods sold here in the second, third and fourth quarters, especially the third and fourth quarters, where in order to meet the fill rate objectives and keep the inventories at the levels that we've been able to, we've done a lot of heroic things that have been costly, things like air freight and expediting and items of that nature. And those items ultimately will be released, I think, to some extent, by the capacity coming online in the future. And -- but in the meantime, they're kind of built into the run rate. You can see the margins are, even with those inefficiencies are pretty good. And we have really pushed our supply chain hard to serve our customers thus far, and it's been successful as you can see."

Today, we issued record fourth quarter results marking an outstanding close to a very dynamic and successful year. As I mentioned in our 2020 shareholder letter, we expected the operating environment of the 2020s to be on",2372,"Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. Today, we issued record fourth quarter results marking an outstanding close to a very dynamic and successful year. As I mentioned in our 2020 shareholder letter, we expected the operating environment of the 2020s to be one of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, or VUCA for short. Lest we had any thought of easing into that construct over time, like others, we were thrust into action as the pandemic roared onto the scene in March and April. And as for many companies, the early days of the pandemic brought into focus the first rung of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. We quickly established pandemic-era tactical priorities: first, protect the health and safety of our employees and supply chain partners; secondly, ensure the continuity of our operations and financial stability; and third, do what we can or could to mitigate the impact of the virus in our communities.
We undertook a myriad of actions consistent with those priorities, including the implementation of intensive company-wide safety protocols, including mandatory masks from day 1; significant liquidity enhancements; cost reductions, some temporary, some permanent; as well as a substantial increase in our philanthropy, both in dollar terms and in kind.
We asked our people to be guided by our purpose. For those who make the world, we emphasized our 3 simple leadership principles, which include creating clarity, inspiring engagement and growing and delivering. Our people, while dealing with their personal hardships and challenges, characteristic of this era, responded beautifully to our lead. Amidst 4 weeks of collapsing sellout revenue in April, we were hunkered down, ready to ride out the storm. And then suddenly, in the last week of April and on into the summer months, an abrupt and very positive phenomenon emerged in the Tools business.
Our end users, many of them homebound, with time on their hands, discovered and/or rediscovered DIY projects, both indoors and outdoors. We enjoyed a surge in North American retail of a magnitude never before experienced. By June, POS was running 30% to 40% greater than the prior year. E-commerce growth exploded at levels even higher than that. Unfortunately, both we and our channel partners had solid inventory positions at the onset of the demand. By May, we were ramping up our factories to extraordinary levels. By the third quarter, the demand trend had extended to Europe and other markets around the world, albeit at somewhat lower levels but still in strong double-digit territory.
The second half of 2020 proved to be an all-out test of our supply chain resiliency and ability to serve the growth. Customer inventory levels have been substantially reduced by midyear and our global factories were running at historic levels just to keep up with the POS demand, and they still are. We faced rolling labor shortages, supplier issues and various arbitrary government edicts in jurisdictions all over the globe. However, we were able to prevail and operate continuously with only minor exceptions. And along the way, we've moved forward with significant capacity expansion actions for both power and hand tools, and we look forward to serving continued growth in the future.
2020 was by far the most difficult backdrop we've ever faced, but we were prepared for volatility and our people rose to meet the challenges. Fortunately, we went into it with strength and have stayed strong for the duration. Back in 2016, we committed to a vision that embodied purpose-driven performance. We've built a company that is anchored by a support of people-oriented culture, striving to deliver top quartile shareholder return to become known as one of the world's great innovators and to elevate an already strong commitment to ESG and corporate social responsibility.
We demonstrated in 2020 that when corporations like ours put people first and work to have a positive impact on society at large, the result can be extraordinary resilience, which benefits our shareholders through outstanding growth, cash flow, margin expansion and ESG, and that is the story of 2020.
On the heels of an excellent third quarter, the fourth quarter was the pinnacle of our 2020 performance, and we entered 2021 stronger than ever. And now I'll take a moment and recap the 4Q numbers, which demonstrate the power of our momentum as we enter 2021.
Revenues were up 19% to $4.4 billion with organic growth of 16%. This was led once again by Tools & Storage, which had organic revenue up an impressive 25%. Our total company operating margin rate, excluding charges, was a fourth quarter record at 16.5%, up 290 basis points from prior year, with volume leverage, productivity, cost actions, price and margin resiliency initiatives all contributing. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $3.29, up 51%, 51% versus prior year.
And now let's turn to the full year. Revenues were $14.5 billion, up 1%, with 10% organic growth in the second half more than offsetting the first half pandemic-related issues. Our full year operating margin rate expanded 110 basis points to 14.6%, attributable to strong cost control, productivity, our margin resiliency initiatives and price. Adjusted EPS for the year was $9.04, an 8% increase versus 2019, especially remarkable when considering our original pre-pandemic guidance midpoint last January was $8.90 a share.
We converted the strong sales and margin results, along with just over 0.5 turn of working capital improvement, into record cash flow. Free cash flow was $1.7 billion for the year, $1.7 billion for the year, an all-time record for the company, up 55% versus 2019 with a conversion rate of 136%.
And lastly, I'm happy to report that we successfully exceeded all of our 5-year, medium-term environmental, health and safety goals established in 2015. We targeted a 20% reduction of our energy consumption, our carbon emissions, our water use and our waste generated in our facilities and more than attained each one of those goals. In addition, we significantly improved our recycling and use of renewable energy and achieved our safety goals. When I became CEO in 2016, we updated our vision to elevate our commitment to social responsibility.
Achievement of these goals is an important milestone in our journey to execute on our 2030 sustainability strategy. More goals and more milestones ahead as we continue on this march.
So where do we go from here? In a world of elevated uncertainty, here are a few observations to simplify and clarify our point of view on that for '21 and '22. Without question, tools and outdoor demand is on a roll, and we think it will be for some time to come, benefiting from a series of exogenous factors, including: first, the secular surge in global DIY driven by the consumers' rediscovery of home and garden; secondly, a massive acceleration of the global shift to e-commerce within our channels, which plays to our strength as the global tools leader in e-commerce; and third, a cyclical boom in North America home improvement driven by increasing new and preowned home sales associated largely with household formation and the urban exodus; and then there is the need to rebuild channel inventories levels -- inventory levels, which we believe are at least 4 weeks lower than desirable.
Our Tools business has never been stronger or better positioned to gain share, and we have consistently grown organically and gained share every year since the merger of Stanley and Black & Decker 11 years ago. Our unmatched array of iconic brands, market-leading innovation, combined with our scale and organizational agility, continues to support that investment thesis.
Total company operating margin reached new heights in the second half of 2020, breaking through the 15% threshold at 17.7% and 16.5% in 3Q and 4Q, respectively. This is a significant increase of about 300 basis points over prior year and it is not a coincidence. It derives from an intentional confluence of tight cost management, volume leverage, price/mix management and our margin resiliency initiative. The latter applies cutting-edge digital technologies to optimize margin performance across multiple value pools.
Skeptics point out that the third quarter benefited from cost reductions, some of which were admittedly temporary in nature. These skeptics now have to deal with the fourth quarter in which the 16.5% includes the vast majority of temporary costs such as furloughs, 4-day work weeks, executive salary reductions and benefit deferrals back in the run rate. This was accomplished as we began to fund significant new investments in growth initiatives, including major thrusts into e-commerce, revitalizing the Black & Decker brand, security, health and safety and outdoor products.
And although the second half '21 Tools' growth comp is difficult, we believe it is manageable, and we are predicting full year total company organic growth of approximately 6% at the midpoint, with a super strong first half and a modest negative in the back half yielding the 6% midpoint, which is the high end of our long-term growth objective for that measure.
Our strong share momentum, aided by numerous growth catalysts such as FLEXVOLT, Craftsman, ATOMIC, XTREME, POWERDETECT and e-commerce, should not be underestimated. On top of this, there's an industrial-related portion of Tools that is in the midst of a cyclical rebound as we enter 2021, along with about $4 billion of Industrial, which includes Engineered Fastening Automotive and the Security segment revenue, which was negative in 2020, and all those are expected to be positive in the aggregate in 2021.
So for all these reasons and more, as Don will cover in his remarks, our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance is introduced at $9.70 to $10.30 a share. At the midpoint, this is $10, up 11%, which is a very good place to start our journey into 2021. And while it is too early, way too early to guess at what market conditions might be in 2022, we stand to benefit from our multiyear relationship with MTD and our optionality to acquire the remaining 80% at a very attractive multiple with a window that begins to open in July of this year, which brings me to a brief update on MTD.
Our current planning assumption calls for the exercise of our MTD option and the potential addition of up to $3 billion of revenue from the MTD transaction in 2022. And just to clarify, we expect to implement or exercise the option in late '21 and begin to recognize revenue subsequent to regulatory approvals and, hopefully, beginning in 2022.
The Lawn and Garden category is experiencing similar benefits to Tools from the consumers' reconnection with the home. And MTD LTM revenues now approximate $2.6 billion with a very strong second half revenue performance in the books, comparable to our Tools business.
Additionally, MTD continues to make progress on multiple opportunities to generate operational efficiency and margin improvement, delivering a 6% operating margin in 2020 with momentum coming into the 2021 season and plenty of runway ahead for further improvement.
The transaction was structured in a financially prudent way, whereby we purchased 20% of the company at an 11x multiple with the option to purchase the remaining 80% anytime during a 10-year window beginning this July. MTD's incremental EBITDA improvement since our initial purchase is shared 50-50 and is thus valued at 5.5x, which provides us the ability to acquire a market leader in outdoor power equipment at an all-in multiple at the time of option execution likely to approximate 7 to 8x.
We are excited by the multiple levers to accelerate growth and margin expansion with this acquisition. In addition to the initial revenue contribution upon consolidation, we see additional organic growth opportunities in the pro outdoor equipment market as well as to drive electric-powered and autonomous mower offerings while employing our successful commercial model to fully leverage our portfolio of brands and channels.
We're also working on a multiyear road map to achieve 15% operating margin in the category. Not likely, some say. However, we believe we're up to the challenge. I remind the naysayers that Black & Decker's operating margin was below 6% in the year before acquisition, and the very same team that addressed that opportunity is still on the field today.
We continue to be encouraged by MTD's innovation and product development pipeline as well as their progress on improving profitability, and we're excited about this future combination. Even before exercising our option, we are bringing this vision to life in 2021, with SBD and MTD each independently launching a series of new products under the DEWALT, Craftsman and Black & Decker brands that are hitting the market now across the gas and electric power spectrum.
A few notable examples. MTD brings world-class innovation in riding and zero-turn mowers. And through a licensing arrangement, we'll launch a new lineup of the DEWALT-branded, gas-powered professional mowers that are now beginning to roll out at one of our major U.S. retailers. In addition, we have designed, developed and are launching new cordless, 20-volt DEWALT walk-behind mowers also with strong listings that will be made in the U.S.A. with global materials in MTD's Tupelo, Mississippi facility.
MTD continues to expand its outdoor offering into new categories with Craftsman under license. New to this -- new to market this year will be an impressive lineup of zero-turn gas mowers as well as gas-powered solutions in riding and walk-behind mowers. Concurrently, SBD will expand our battery and electric-powered offerings in push mowers, power washers and handheld products such as chainsaws, trimmers and blowers.
Lastly, as a part of our e-commerce-focused brand refresh with Black & Decker -- of Black & Decker, MTD will launch a new lineup of gas handheld products under license. And we will launch new electric offerings, including an autonomous robotic mower in Europe.
As you can see, we've been busy working our partnership with MTD, and there is a lot to be excited about that. And for 2021, these opportunities are planned to deliver more than $100 million of organic growth for SBD as well as support additional growth for MTD. With broad coverage across gas-powered products for MTD and electric and battery-powered categories for SBD, we are just starting to tap into the significant potential ahead of us.
And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan to cover the fourth quarter and our 2021 guidance. Don?"

We are incredibly pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance, which closed out an amazing back half to 2020. So now I would like to review our business segment results for the fourth quarter.
Tools & Storage delivered an exceptional 25% total and organic revenue growth, with volume up 23% and price contributing additional 2 points. All regions continued to benefit from exceptionally strong revenue trends related to the consumers' reconnection with home and garden. E-commerce continued to be very strong. We had a strong holiday season and a robust lineup of new products and innovation.
The operating margin rate for this segment was another outstanding result at 20.7%, up 420 basis points versus the prior year as volume, productivity, cost control and price were modestly offset by new growth investments. As the revenue outlook improved during 2020, we released incremental SG&A investments to further the development of our brands via digital marketing, increased distribution capacity and added commercial resources to support our business model in brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. We believe much of these investments will drive further organic growth and share gains in 2021 and 2022.
Now let's look at some of the geographies within Tools & Storage. North America was up a robust 27% organically. Retail continued to see exceptionally strong POS, delivering 36% organic growth through a very strong holiday season, along with continued momentum in e-commerce.
POS growth for the quarter approximated 30%. And retailer inventories ended the year slightly below Q3 levels and well below prior year, an amazing Q4 performance for the Tools & Storage team. And what's incredibly amazing is we still have a channel refill opportunity of 4 weeks in front of us that will likely materialize in the front part of 2021.
The North American commercial and industrial channels continue to experience positive sequential trends, with both posting low single-digit growth this quarter versus declines in Q3. Pure-play construction customers within these channels were up mid-teens in Q4, significantly improved from the low single-digit growth last quarter. This trend is clearly another strong signal that professional demand is back and accelerating.
The Tools & Storage European business also had an outstanding fourth quarter as all regions grew, which resulted in 18% organic growth. This performance was led by the U.K., Central Europe, Nordics, Benelux and Iberia, all up double digits, with France and Italy up mid-single digits. The team experienced strong revenue growth in both retail, brick-and-mortar and e-commerce.
Finally, emerging markets delivered an exceptional quarter of organic growth as well, up 22%, with all regions posting positive revenue trends. We experienced strong construction demand in these markets. And when combined with positive pricing momentum, it supported this robust performance.
Latin America was the strongest performer, delivering 36% organic growth, with all countries up double digits, while Russia and Turkey had another very strong quarter, also resulting in double-digit growth in these markets. Finally, Asia delivered low single-digit growth, led by South Korea and India, each up double digits, which was partially offset by modest declines in China and Southeast Asia.
Now let's pivot and look at the Tools & Storage SBUs. Power Tools delivered 32% organic growth, benefiting from the home and construction trends mentioned previously as well as strong commercial execution for the holiday season and new product introductions. We continue to see strong share gains from our new innovations in FLEXVOLT, ATOMIC and XTREME, which now represent over $600 million of annual revenue on a combined basis.
Our Outdoor Product business delivered 29% organic growth as these categories continue to benefit from the consumer reconnection with the home as well as new DEWALT and Craftsman cordless products were launched in 2020.
The Hand Tools and Accessory and Storage business delivered an impressive 15% organic growth in the quarter. This was supported by new product launches, the strong performance in emerging markets and Mac Tools, combined with the rebound in professional construction demand I just previously mentioned.
In summary, an amazing quarter and an incredibly successful year for Tools & Storage. The team remained focused and responded with agility to the pandemic and quickly pivoted to fulfill the surging demand that emerged in the second half of the year. This effort was remarkable and helped them deliver record levels of growth and margin expansion during one of the most challenging operating environments in our lifetimes. Great job by the entire team. We thank them for their intense and focused efforts. I am really excited to see the encore performance in 2021.
Turning to Industrial. Total growth was 10%, which included an 11-point contribution from the CAM acquisition and 2 points from currency. This was partially offset by a 2% volume-driven organic decline and a negative 1% impact from the divestiture of a noncore product line in Oil & Gas. It was great to see continued improving trends sequentially as the organic decline in Q3 of 18% improved to negative 2% in the fourth quarter, a trend which is positioning this segment for organic growth in 2021.
The operating margin rate increased 110 basis points year-over-year to 14.7% as the benefits from productivity and restructuring cost actions more than offset the impact of the lower volume.
Diving a bit deeper into this segment. Engineered Fastening revenues were down 2% organically as growth in Automotive was offset by an improved but still declining general industrial end market. Automotive was up mid-single digits behind high-teens growth in Automotive Fasteners, which was partially offset by continued declines in Systems as most new capital investment decisions related to new car models continue to be on hold.
However, global light vehicle production continues to improve, and we remain well positioned to outpace the underlying market with content gains in the fastener portion of this business. Industrial fasteners declined high single digits in the fourth quarter. The recovery in the industrial markets continues to progress, and we once again saw a sequential improvement.
Our Infrastructure businesses declined 5% organically as positive Attachment Tools growth was more than offset by reduced pipeline construction in Oil & Gas.
And finally, turning to Security. Total revenue was down 3% with a 3% positive impact from currency, while price and acquisitions each contributed 1%. This was offset by a 5-point decline in volumes and a negative 3% due to the divestitures announced last quarter.
North America declined 5% as growth in health care was offset by lower installations in automatic doors and commercial electronic security. These businesses are serving markets that are still slowly improving from the pandemic impact and also faced a difficult 7% growth comparable in 2019.
European Security organic growth was relatively flat as they experienced solid growth in France from the new growth initiatives which began to take root. This performance was offset by lower volume in the U.K. related to the various intense lockdowns from the pandemic.
Our focus on health and safety initiatives such as touchless stores, contact tracing and health care solutions are building momentum and generated about 150 basis points of growth in Q4. With the healthy backlog, a continued recovering market and the addition of these new solutions, we are optimistic that Security can return to growth in the front half and for the full year of 2021.
In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin rate was 11.2%, flat versus the prior year as price and cost control were offset by the impact from lower volume and growth investments.
Now let's take a look at our very strong free cash flow performance on the next page. As you can see, we were able to leverage our strong operational performance in the back half to generate a record full year free cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion in 2020. This represents an increase of $593 million versus the prior year and a free cash flow conversion of 136% of net income. This result was driven by the strong growth in Tools & Storage, our company-wide cost actions and lower capital spending, delivering significant improvement in cash earnings.
Now as it relates to working capital, we delivered 10.4 working capital turns, up 0.6 turns year-over-year, reflecting the strong revenue performance and leveraging the SBD operating model to drive working capital efficiency across the company. With the strong cash generation and inclusion of the excess cash on the balance sheet, which amounted to $1.4 billion at year-end, we believe we are well positioned from a leverage perspective heading into 2021, a fantastic outcome.
Now I would like to discuss our views on 2021 as improving channel and market visibility has enabled us to reinstate guidance. Beginning with Slide 10, I'd like to dive deeper into several of our 2021 organic growth assumptions. We are experiencing a fast start to the first quarter as strong market trends in Tools & Storage continue, combined with improving industrial and security markets. Therefore, we expect organic revenue growth to approximate 21% to 26% for the company in the first quarter of 2021.
Tools & Storage is the largest contributor of this strong performance, and our plans assume a 1Q organic growth range of 30% to 40%. Underpinning this assumption is the continuation of the strong demand trends, the potential for customer inventories to start to move back to historical levels, and finally, we have an easier comp since Q1 2019 at the beginning -- Q1 2020 at the beginning impacts from the pandemic. Growth continues to be broad-based, with all regions contributing to very strong outlook. POS in U.S. retail through the first 3 weeks of January has remained in a similar band that we experienced during December, and we are assuming this trend will continue through the remainder of the quarter.
We are also seeing continued positive momentum in the commercial and industrial channels. Tools & Storage European and emerging markets continue to experience strong momentum as well. And we are currently expecting demand trends in Q1 that are similar to the fourth quarter we just completed.
Another way to look at the 30% to 40% Tools & Storage organic growth assumption is that it represents approximately $600 million to $800 million of Q1 organic growth. January, which is historically a very slow month for Tools & Storage, is on track through 3 of 5 weeks to deliver $400 million of growth in the month. Additionally, February and March were both negative comps in 2020. Therefore, we believe with the continuation of market demand trends and a modest contribution from safety stock increases across our global customer base, this represents a very strong or reasonably balanced expectation for the first quarter.
Turning to Industrial. Our first quarter assumes a decline of 5% up to flat organically. To deconstruct this a bit, at the midpoint of this range, we are calling for high single-digit to low double-digit growth in both Attachment Tools and within Automotive Engineered Fastening, which in total represent a little more than half of this segment. Supporting this, Attachment Tools experienced a 50% year-over-year increase in Q4 backlog. In Automotive, this assumes a moderation of fastener volume growth to low double digits and a less severe decline on easier comps for our Systems business.
We expect our Industrial Fastener business to continue its sequential improvement and be relatively flat. Offsetting these positive factors in Q1, we anticipate steep declines in Oil & Gas and Aerospace. CAM is included in the organic growth calculation partway through the first quarter. As both of these businesses are longer cycle, they held up relatively better when the initial impacts of the pandemic occurred and, therefore, will be challenged in the front half of 2021.
Turning to Security. Our plan assumes for a range of flat to up low single digits organically in Q1. Exit trends in December for this business were strong. And the backlog ended the year up double digits, which provides a good setup as we enter Q1, particularly as the easier comps begin in the month of March. Additionally, the business is focused on continuing to stimulate demand with their existing and new health and safety solutions that emerged from the pandemic and started to generate revenue prior to the end of the year.
Turning to the right side of the slide. I want to touch on the full year growth assumptions for all segments and the first and second half planning assumptions for Tools & Storage. As you would expect, we are planning for a very strong first half of the year. We are expecting the strong trends I just talked about through -- I just talked through for Q1 to moderate in the second quarter but remain quite strong. The continued market recoveries in Security and Industrial, strong demand in Tools and relatively easy year-over-year comps positions the company for an organic growth range of 19% to 24% for the first quarter.
For the second half, we have moderated our assumptions to incorporate the difficult comps created by the strong second half 2020 growth in Tools. While we are pushing for more growth and share gains, we felt it was prudent to set expectations for a decline of 3% to 8% organically for the company. This is how we have constructed our overall range of 4% to 8% organic growth for the full year for Stanley Black & Decker.
For Tools & Storage, we are also assuming full year growth of 48%, which includes organic growth of 27% to 32% in the first half for the reasons previously mentioned, and a decline of 7% to 12% in the back half. While the growth in Tools is retracting versus 2020 in the back half, the range is up 4% to 10% versus the back half of 2019. This is a reasonable 2-year assumption based on the historical growth numbers we have seen for this business.
That being said, this is a short-cycle business and we are ensuring the supply chain can accommodate second half scenarios that are improved versus this range. The potential scenario we must be prepared for is robust tools and storage markets that continue for the majority of 2021. We have not assumed this will occur in our guidance, but we will be ready to respond if this does evolve in the coming months.
For Industrial, we are assuming 2% to 6% growth in 2021. With a stronger performance in the front half due to the easier comps, Engineered Fastening and Attachment Tools have a lot of momentum, and we are well positioned to capitalize upon the recovery as it unfolds in 2021.
As it relates to Oil & Gas and Aerospace, we expect they will remain a significant headwind to growth in the front half, but this eases a bit as we move into the back half.
Finally, for Security, we see a range for 4% to 6% growth for the full year. This is fairly consistent across the 2 halves as the front half has easier comps and the back half carries a stronger level of growth from the ramp-up of our health and safety-focused growth initiatives.
We are excited by the prospects for these tech-enabled products, which contributed 1.5 points of growth in the fourth quarter and could represent up to $100 million of revenue in 2021.
So in summary, we are expecting 4% to 8% organic full year growth with growth in every segment. We are well positioned to capture market recoveries and share gains in each of our businesses and feel this is a balanced range that acknowledges the current environment. We will continue to watch our markets and will be prepared if the back half assumption proves to be conservative.
Now I'll summarize the remaining guidance assumptions on Slide 11. We are reinitiating guidance in 2021 with an adjusted earnings per share range of $9.70 to $10.30, up approximately 11% versus prior year at the midpoint. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $9.15 to $9.85, inclusive of various onetime charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. This range is $0.40 wider than our traditional guide, recognizing that while visibility has improved, the operating environment remains dynamic.
Since I just covered organic growth, let's jump right into the cost structure considerations. We expect $125 million of carryover cost savings net of the reversal of temporary actions from the cost program we implemented in the second quarter of 2020. These actions will primarily benefit the first quarter with a modest benefit in the second quarter.
From an inflation perspective, we currently see the potential for approximately $75 million of headwind primarily associated with steel, base metals, transportation, electronic components and resins. Keep in mind, we generally lock in our supply agreements 1 to 2 quarters out, so the timing of this headwind is back-half weighted. Partially offsetting this headwind is a tailwind of roughly $45 million related to foreign exchange. Therefore, at this point in time, we have included $30 million of a headwind associated with these externally driven cost inputs.
Should we see additional pressure in commodities or should currency reverse, we will utilize our productivity programs and pricing to neutralize the pressure over time. However, specific to 2021, as a reminder, we have $100 million to $150 million of margin resiliency benefits as a contingency, which is not included in our guidance. This contingency will assist in mitigating new headwinds in these areas during 2020 if they emerge.
Finally, we have disclosed our current full year assumptions for the significant below-the-line items and our expectation for pretax M&A and other charges to assist with your modeling.
Turning to cash flow. We expect another strong performance in 2021, with free cash flow conversion approximating GAAP net income. Underpinning this expectation is capital expenditures of approximately 3% of net sales. In addition, we will utilize the SBD operating model to drive efficiencies in working capital to deliver turns improvement.
Lastly, we expect the first quarter's earnings per share to be approximately 24% of the full year performance, which is primarily driven by operating leverage on the organic growth assumptions I walked through for Q1 and the $150 million of benefits from the carryover cost actions we have implemented.
So in summary, for the total company, we expect 4% to 8% organic growth and 7% to 14% adjusted EPS expansion, a strong forecast that represents a balanced view recognizing the dynamic operating environment but also incorporates more difficult comps and inflation assumptions into the plan while delivering healthy margin expansion and EPS growth for the full year.
The organization remains focused on meeting the needs of several ongoing strong and sequentially improving markets, leveraging our organic growth catalysts as well, executing margin resiliency and generating strong free cash flow while not losing sight of ensuring we keep our employees safe and assisting our communities through the remainder of this pandemic.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim to close out with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim?"

In summary, 2020 was an extraordinary year for Stanley Black & Decker. This performance was possible due to the agility, passion and dedication of our people, combined with a strong cultural and financial foundation. It's hard to pick one element to get most enthused about given the 2020 performance, especially in the second half as well as the improving outlook. Is it the growth, the margin expansion or the extraordinary cash flow and the potential for more? Is it the demonstrated resilience of this purpose-driven company? Or is it the enormous potential given the way the company is positioned for 2021 and 2022?
In my view, it's all of the above. We are energized by the existence of a multiyear runway for growth and profitability improvement. The shareholder value-creation potential is certainly compelling over the medium to long term. And while pursuing these shareholder rewards, we are also mindful of our responsibility to society and the multiple stakeholders that we serve. And our sustained commitment to ESG and social responsibility is strong, authentic, and we continue to elevate it over time.
And as you can see, there's a lot to be excited about with our MTD partnership. And for 2021, these opportunities are planned to deliver more than $100 million of organic growth for SBD as well as to support additional growth for MTD.
So I want to thank everybody. It's been an exciting year. There's a lot of really great things ahead. And now I'll turn it over to Dennis. Dennis?"

To be very clear, there's no acquisition of MTD in the guidance. There are some licensing income associated with some of the opportunities I described in the comments.

There are some licensing income associated with some of the opportunities I described in the comments. There's some organic growth in Stanley based on some collaboration with MTD on products that we will be selling through our own channels and our own brands. But there is nothing related to the acquisition in the guidance.
The multiple is going to be a trailing multiple because that's how the option is basically priced. It's based on a trailing EBITDA. And so that's where the 7 to 8x comes from.
And as far as the road to mid-teens operating margin, it's our objective to get the operating margin up to around -- somewhere around 8-ish percent next year, maybe a little higher if the volume kind of comes through the way we think. And so if we start from, let's say, a base of maybe 8% to 10%, there is a whole series of cost reduction, value-creation activities that exist in a plan, if you will. It's a somewhat high-level plan because we're not able to get in and do super detailed diligence at this point.
But we have been working with a major consulting firm to come up with some -- a point of view on how we can get to a number, something in the neighborhood of probably $50 million to $100 million of additional margin improvement that is not being implemented by MTD for various reasons. One, they may not have the appetite for it or they may not have the capability to do it. But we have some ideas that are pretty specific in that regard.
And that gets us up into like the 12-ish kind of zone. And then from 12% to 15%, it really is going to be a function of really leveraging the synergies between the companies, the channel synergies, the brand synergies, the growth and also a major thrust into the professional channel.
I must say that having spent some time at MTD in September, I was blown away by the quality of their innovation pipeline, the collaboration, to the extent we've been allowed to do that through -- based on certain legal constraints and so on. But the collaboration that we have been able to do in terms of lightweighting, electrification, autonomy, those types of things, it's really, really impressive. And what they've done on their own is impressive, too.
So the combination of all those things, I expect that we will make a major thrust into the pro channel. The products are going to be very, very strong. And when we start branding those products with some of our major brands such as DEWALT, I think there's going to be a really compelling value proposition for the channel and the end user to carry those products and buy those products. So that's kind of where we're going with MTD.
You can start to see the -- in the marketplace in 2021 some of the, I'll call them, collaborations around just the edges without really being 100% owned by us. And the ability for us to generate $100 million of organic growth just with some modest collaboration in terms of commercial and product is -- really kind of underlines the potential and the power of this relationship."

So we feel really positive about how the business positioned itself from a profitability perspective.

I think over the long term, we feel like it's a business that will continue to progress and improve its profitability over the coming years. It won't just be a 1- or 2-year phenomenon."

I mean we saw these trends kind of emerge in October time frame, November and in the categories I mentioned of steel, resin, electronic components. And so that is going to continue for a period of time. Right now, we have $75 million of an increase in those types of categories in our guidance for 2021.
I don't think it's going to radically deviate from that. It could go up a little bit as the year goes on, but we do have to keep in mind that the way that we structure our contracts, it usually takes a good 6 months for that to really impact our P&L, which gives us time to respond with pricing actions, if that makes sense, or productivity or whatever the case may be. And then that kind of helps us mitigate that over a longer period of time, maybe over a multiyear period of time, those actions.
The margin resiliency program is an annual program that we started about 3 years ago, which was built on -- let's look at the different areas of our company, the functions, the operations teams, how we price our products, et cetera, and use technology such as artificial intelligence, advanced data analytics and make better decisions in those particular areas to drive efficiency and effectiveness. And we've seen that -- over the last few years that the ongoing process of the team that's been created and the technology that they use, we have about 100 people that are focused on this full time in the company, drives about $100 million to $150 million of annual value. Now we could put that in our P&L and make it part of our guidance, but we think it's more prudent in volatile times like this to have it outside the guidance as a contingency. And so when new things come your way that are headwinds, you have an offset.
These things are underway. They're in process. And so they're driving value this month, in all 12 months out of the year. And so if the headwinds don't come, you get the opportunity to position yourself to outperform. And we think it's a very balanced way to approach guidance and the way to operate in this world given the level of volatility that we've all seen in the last 4 years, but in particular, the last 12 months."

And we were scratching our heads to some extent because we've had inflation more often -- more years than not over the 20-plus years I've been here. And we've always been able to offset a part of it with price and new product development, new product introductions and so on. And then there's always productivity that has come through and helped offset the rest of it and actually given us some decent margin accretion in certain years even when there was inflation.
And so this reflex reaction that occurred, which was, oh, my gosh, Stanley Black & Decker is inflation prone, didn't make any sense to us. But then when we thought about it, we realized that if you go back to the '17, '18, '19 kind of time frame, there was this $1 billion of headwinds that we have all behind us now. And that $1 billion of headwinds was a triad of things. It was the inflation, it was the tariffs and it was the FX. And $1 billion was just too big a series of headwinds to just offset with the normal types of offsets that I talked about, so we ended up having to do some restructuring.
And by the way, we still generated 6% earnings growth during that time frame. So it wasn't catastrophic. It was just a lot of work and a lot of pain in order to get through that period and we did it. But any one of those, whether it was the FX or the inflation or the tariffs, any one of those we could have handled easily through our normal contingencies and things like that. But when we put them all together in that 3 years in a row, it just became -- it became a lot. And so that perception, I think, develops.
So immediately, when the winds of inflation started blowing in the third, fourth quarter, we got this reflex from the investment community. But I think as of today, I hope that we can put that behind us because it is not a significant material issue to us in '21."

And I think another thing is the install base of battery systems is a big deal with this kind of growth that we have in 2020 and now into '21. There are going to be more and more first timers or people that have bought new battery systems, investing in additional tools for their battery systems.
And frankly, I think once people discover DIY, it tends to be somewhat addictive. So I think that we're going to have a -- it is a secular shift, in my opinion. I think the home center CEOs would agree with that. I've heard them talk about that as well. So that's a big deal. Obviously, it abates over time as the comps kind of get tougher in terms of its percentage impact on growth.
And what we saw in 2000 relative to the pros was in the beginning, the pros, like -- let's say, like April, May, projects kind of came to a grinding halt for the most part, except for the really essential ones. And then into the summer, the pros started coming back into the third and fourth quarter. You can't even get a contractor in this country anymore if you want one. So at least I have had that experience. I think the contractors are very busy in the resi and both the remodeling and in the new construction areas. They've got a tremendous backlog. I think they are back. I mean, I think that has played out. 
So as we go forward, I think what we're really looking at is more of kind of going up against the comps and getting back to a more normal environment as we get into '22 and beyond. But it's -- it is one. It is an art, as you say, and it's difficult to really parse in great detail exactly what's happening. But that is our gut feel and instinct based on what we can see here at this point."

The areas that really are being hit hard are steel, resin, electronic components and then battery cells or base metals, if you want to call it that, however you want to call it.

The question is how long does that demand last? Is there a -- there's parts of the economy that are really going strong, and there's other parts of the economy that are not, that have not recovered as well. And the timing of that recovery is going to depend on how the vaccines roll out and how we eventually get to herd immunity and how quickly that occurs.
So we could be seeing a short-term bubble here that may be moderate for a period of time or it could be something that continues to grow modestly over multiple years. So time will tell. But I think we've got that in the right box right now, and it's something we can manage going forward with all the levers that I described.
The other 2 segments for profitability improvement, I can probably be cute and give you all kinds of leverage factors, but I think it might be simpler and just say, if you think about the whole company's operating margin rate, we're trying to improve about 50 basis points year-over-year. Tools is trying to improve roughly the same number, maybe a little bit more. And so that means Industrial and Security are going to improve about the same number, too.
So I think you can kind of look at a 50 -- anywhere from 40 to 60 basis point improvement in all 3 segments with the net result for the company of about 50 basis points for the full year."

Just thinking about the 4% to 8% Tools & Storage growth for the full year. Jim, I think you gave some parameters around inventory. It seems like it rounds to something in the neighborhood of 2 points of kind of full year benefit from replenishment. If we're way off with that, let us know. But is the rest of that kind of evenly split North America and international? I think if I'm taking some of the inputs and making some assumptions, it seems like kind of core growth in the U.S. business, inclusive of pro, is pretty modest ex restock.

It's -- we're talking about 4 weeks probably is a reasonable number to improve. It is a global number we're talking about because we do see opportunity across the globe probably heavily -- more heavily weighted to North America because we know those inventories are definitely at the very low end of the range of where we like to be. And so maybe 75% to 80% of it is weighted to the U.S. and North America.
But I think when you think about the growth that could come with that, it's probably a couple of points of growth, maybe 2.5 points of growth for the full year, which means it could be 5 points in the first half. So that's the magnitude we're talking about. And I think we'll see it start to evolve in Q1, but it might be more heavily weighted to Q2 because POS just seems really robust in Q1 at this stage."

We were very fortunate that we were able to really -- first of all, we started the year with a really solid inventory position, both in the company and in the channels, or at least the North American channels where the demand really spiked.
And so that was helpful because it was kind of a strange situation. But it got into May, and we were looking at POS that was starting to skyrocket and the orders were not coming in from the channel. And so we ended up building quite a bit of inventory starting in May -- actually over $500 million of inventory we built to serve POS demand that was occurring. And we had to kind of bet that the POS was going to continue at that rate, and it did. And that enabled us to really get ahead of the situation so that we've been -- now if you look at this at this point in time, we're essentially serving the POS and have been for 2 quarters now. And we're able to do that. Our end users continue to be very, very robust in buying tools. And our channel partners would like more. They would like their inventory restored. And that is the challenge. 
And so one of the things that we've done and we were also very fortunate from this standpoint of -- our made -- our make where you sell campaign that we've been working on for 3 or 4 years had some pretty significant capacity additions both in Mexico and in North America and in the U.S. And a number of those are either online or coming online, including a major plant in Mexico and a major plant in the U.S. in -- later in 2021.
And so as we look forward, we're not counting on those to necessarily get the inventories back to where they need to be in the channels, but we are looking forward to the fact that we will have more capacity in the system, significantly more capacity as we get into 2021. So we're not too concerned about that.
And in the meantime, there's a tremendous amount of inefficiency that's been built into our cost of goods sold here in the second, third and fourth quarters, especially the third and fourth quarters, where in order to meet the fill rate objectives and keep the inventories at the levels that we've been able to, we've done a lot of heroic things that have been costly, things like air freight and expediting and items of that nature. And those items ultimately will be relieved, I think, to some extent, by the capacity coming online in the future.
And -- but in the meantime, they're kind of built into the run rate. You can see the margins are -- even with those inefficiencies are pretty good. And we have really pushed our supply chain hard to serve our customers thus far, and it's been successful as you can see."

Today, we issued record fourth quarter results marking an outstanding close to a very dynamic and successful year. As I mentioned in our 2020 shareholder letter, we expected the operating environment of the 2020s to be on",2372,"Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. Today, we issued record fourth quarter results marking an outstanding close to a very dynamic and successful year. As I mentioned in our 2020 shareholder letter, we expected the operating environment of the 2020s to be one of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, or VUCA for short. Lest we had any thought of easing into that construct over time, like others, we were thrust into action as the pandemic roared onto the scene in March and April. And as for many companies, the early days of the pandemic brought into focus the first rung of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. We quickly established pandemic-era tactical priorities: first, protect the health and safety of our employees and supply chain partners; secondly, ensure the continuity of our operations and financial stability; and third, do what we can or could to mitigate the impact of the virus in our communities.
We undertook a myriad of actions consistent with those priorities, including the implementation of intensive company-wide safety protocols, including mandatory masks from day 1; significant liquidity enhancements; cost reductions, some temporary, some permanent; as well as a substantial increase in our philanthropy, both in dollar terms and in kind.
We asked our people to be guided by our purpose. For those who make the world, we emphasized our 3 simple leadership principles, which include creating clarity, inspiring engagement and growing and delivering. Our people, while dealing with their personal hardships and challenges, characteristic of this era, responded beautifully to our lead. Amidst 4 weeks of collapsing sellout revenue in April, we were hunkered down, ready to ride out the storm. And then suddenly, in the last week of April and on into the summer months, an abrupt and very positive phenomenon emerged in the Tools business.
Our end users, many of them homebound, with time on their hands, discovered and/or rediscovered DIY projects, both indoors and outdoors. We enjoyed a surge in North American retail of a magnitude never before experienced. By June, POS was running 30% to 40% greater than the prior year. E-commerce growth exploded at levels even higher than that. Unfortunately, both we and our channel partners had solid inventory positions at the onset of the demand. By May, we were ramping up our factories to extraordinary levels. By the third quarter, the demand trend had extended to Europe and other markets around the world, albeit at somewhat lower levels but still in strong double-digit territory.
The second half of 2020 proved to be an all-out test of our supply chain resiliency and ability to serve the growth. Customer inventory levels have been substantially reduced by midyear and our global factories were running at historic levels just to keep up with the POS demand, and they still are. We faced rolling labor shortages, supplier issues and various arbitrary government edicts in jurisdictions all over the globe. However, we were able to prevail and operate continuously with only minor exceptions. And along the way, we've moved forward with significant capacity expansion actions for both power and hand tools, and we look forward to serving continued growth in the future.
2020 was by far the most difficult backdrop we've ever faced, but we were prepared for volatility and our people rose to meet the challenges. Fortunately, we went into it with strength and have stayed strong for the duration. Back in 2016, we committed to a vision that embodied purpose-driven performance. We've built a company that is anchored by a support of people-oriented culture, striving to deliver top quartile shareholder return to become known as one of the world's great innovators and to elevate an already strong commitment to ESG and corporate social responsibility.
We demonstrated in 2020 that when corporations like ours put people first and work to have a positive impact on society at large, the result can be extraordinary resilience, which benefits our shareholders through outstanding growth, cash flow, margin expansion and ESG, and that is the story of 2020.
On the heels of an excellent third quarter, the fourth quarter was the pinnacle of our 2020 performance, and we entered 2021 stronger than ever. And now I'll take a moment and recap the 4Q numbers, which demonstrate the power of our momentum as we enter 2021.
Revenues were up 19% to $4.4 billion with organic growth of 16%. This was led once again by Tools & Storage, which had organic revenue up an impressive 25%. Our total company operating margin rate, excluding charges, was a fourth quarter record at 16.5%, up 290 basis points from prior year, with volume leverage, productivity, cost actions, price and margin resiliency initiatives all contributing. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $3.29, up 51%, 51% versus prior year.
And now let's turn to the full year. Revenues were $14.5 billion, up 1%, with 10% organic growth in the second half more than offsetting the first half pandemic-related issues. Our full year operating margin rate expanded 110 basis points to 14.6%, attributable to strong cost control, productivity, our margin resiliency initiatives and price. Adjusted EPS for the year was $9.04, an 8% increase versus 2019, especially remarkable when considering our original pre-pandemic guidance midpoint last January was $8.90 a share.
We converted the strong sales and margin results, along with just over 0.5 turn of working capital improvement, into record cash flow. Free cash flow was $1.7 billion for the year, $1.7 billion for the year, an all-time record for the company, up 55% versus 2019 with a conversion rate of 136%.
And lastly, I'm happy to report that we successfully exceeded all of our 5-year, medium-term environmental, health and safety goals established in 2015. We targeted a 20% reduction of our energy consumption, our carbon emissions, our water use and our waste generated in our facilities and more than attained each one of those goals. In addition, we significantly improved our recycling and use of renewable energy and achieved our safety goals. When I became CEO in 2016, we updated our vision to elevate our commitment to social responsibility.
Achievement of these goals is an important milestone in our journey to execute on our 2030 sustainability strategy. More goals and more milestones ahead as we continue on this march.
So where do we go from here? In a world of elevated uncertainty, here are a few observations to simplify and clarify our point of view on that for '21 and '22. Without question, tools and outdoor demand is on a roll, and we think it will be for some time to come, benefiting from a series of exogenous factors, including: first, the secular surge in global DIY driven by the consumers' rediscovery of home and garden; secondly, a massive acceleration of the global shift to e-commerce within our channels, which plays to our strength as the global tools leader in e-commerce; and third, a cyclical boom in North America home improvement driven by increasing new and preowned home sales associated largely with household formation and the urban exodus; and then there is the need to rebuild channel inventories levels -- inventory levels, which we believe are at least 4 weeks lower than desirable.
Our Tools business has never been stronger or better positioned to gain share, and we have consistently grown organically and gained share every year since the merger of Stanley and Black & Decker 11 years ago. Our unmatched array of iconic brands, market-leading innovation, combined with our scale and organizational agility, continues to support that investment thesis.
Total company operating margin reached new heights in the second half of 2020, breaking through the 15% threshold at 17.7% and 16.5% in 3Q and 4Q, respectively. This is a significant increase of about 300 basis points over prior year and it is not a coincidence. It derives from an intentional confluence of tight cost management, volume leverage, price/mix management and our margin resiliency initiative. The latter applies cutting-edge digital technologies to optimize margin performance across multiple value pools.
Skeptics point out that the third quarter benefited from cost reductions, some of which were admittedly temporary in nature. These skeptics now have to deal with the fourth quarter in which the 16.5% includes the vast majority of temporary costs such as furloughs, 4-day work weeks, executive salary reductions and benefit deferrals back in the run rate. This was accomplished as we began to fund significant new investments in growth initiatives, including major thrusts into e-commerce, revitalizing the Black & Decker brand, security, health and safety and outdoor products.
And although the second half '21 Tools' growth comp is difficult, we believe it is manageable, and we are predicting full year total company organic growth of approximately 6% at the midpoint, with a super strong first half and a modest negative in the back half yielding the 6% midpoint, which is the high end of our long-term growth objective for that measure.
Our strong share momentum, aided by numerous growth catalysts such as FLEXVOLT, Craftsman, ATOMIC, XTREME, POWERDETECT and e-commerce, should not be underestimated. On top of this, there's an industrial-related portion of Tools that is in the midst of a cyclical rebound as we enter 2021, along with about $4 billion of Industrial, which includes Engineered Fastening Automotive and the Security segment revenue, which was negative in 2020, and all those are expected to be positive in the aggregate in 2021.
So for all these reasons and more, as Don will cover in his remarks, our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance is introduced at $9.70 to $10.30 a share. At the midpoint, this is $10, up 11%, which is a very good place to start our journey into 2021. And while it is too early, way too early to guess at what market conditions might be in 2022, we stand to benefit from our multiyear relationship with MTD and our optionality to acquire the remaining 80% at a very attractive multiple with a window that begins to open in July of this year, which brings me to a brief update on MTD.
Our current planning assumption calls for the exercise of our MTD option and the potential addition of up to $3 billion of revenue from the MTD transaction in 2022. And just to clarify, we expect to implement or exercise the option in late '21 and begin to recognize revenue subsequent to regulatory approvals and, hopefully, beginning in 2022.
The Lawn and Garden category is experiencing similar benefits to Tools from the consumers' reconnection with the home. And MTD LTM revenues now approximate $2.6 billion with a very strong second half revenue performance in the books, comparable to our Tools business.
Additionally, MTD continues to make progress on multiple opportunities to generate operational efficiency and margin improvement, delivering a 6% operating margin in 2020 with momentum coming into the 2021 season and plenty of runway ahead for further improvement.
The transaction was structured in a financially prudent way, whereby we purchased 20% of the company at an 11x multiple with the option to purchase the remaining 80% anytime during a 10-year window beginning this July. MTD's incremental EBITDA improvement since our initial purchase is shared 50-50 and is thus valued at 5.5x, which provides us the ability to acquire a market leader in outdoor power equipment at an all-in multiple at the time of option execution likely to approximate 7 to 8x.
We are excited by the multiple levers to accelerate growth and margin expansion with this acquisition. In addition to the initial revenue contribution upon consolidation, we see additional organic growth opportunities in the pro outdoor equipment market as well as to drive electric-powered and autonomous mower offerings while employing our successful commercial model to fully leverage our portfolio of brands and channels.
We're also working on a multiyear road map to achieve 15% operating margin in the category. Not likely, some say. However, we believe we're up to the challenge. I remind the naysayers that Black & Decker's operating margin was below 6% in the year before acquisition, and the very same team that addressed that opportunity is still on the field today.
We continue to be encouraged by MTD's innovation and product development pipeline as well as their progress on improving profitability, and we're excited about this future combination. Even before exercising our option, we are bringing this vision to life in 2021, with SBD and MTD each independently launching a series of new products under the DEWALT, Craftsman and Black & Decker brands that are hitting the market now across the gas and electric power spectrum.
A few notable examples. MTD brings world-class innovation in riding and zero-turn mowers. And through a licensing arrangement, we'll launch a new lineup of the DEWALT-branded, gas-powered professional mowers that are now beginning to roll out at one of our major U.S. retailers. In addition, we have designed, developed and are launching new cordless, 20-volt DEWALT walk-behind mowers also with strong listings that will be made in the U.S.A. with global materials in MTD's Tupelo, Mississippi facility.
MTD continues to expand its outdoor offering into new categories with Craftsman under license. New to this -- new to market this year will be an impressive lineup of zero-turn gas mowers as well as gas-powered solutions in riding and walk-behind mowers. Concurrently, SBD will expand our battery and electric-powered offerings in push mowers, power washers and handheld products such as chainsaws, trimmers and blowers.
Lastly, as a part of our e-commerce-focused brand refresh with Black & Decker -- of Black & Decker, MTD will launch a new lineup of gas handheld products under license. And we will launch new electric offerings, including an autonomous robotic mower in Europe.
As you can see, we've been busy working our partnership with MTD, and there is a lot to be excited about that. And for 2021, these opportunities are planned to deliver more than $100 million of organic growth for SBD as well as support additional growth for MTD. With broad coverage across gas-powered products for MTD and electric and battery-powered categories for SBD, we are just starting to tap into the significant potential ahead of us.
And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan to cover the fourth quarter and our 2021 guidance. Don?"

We are incredibly pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance, which closed out an amazing back half to 2020. So now I would like to review our business segment results for the fourth quarter.
Tools & Storage delivered an exceptional 25% total and organic revenue growth, with volume up 23% and price contributing additional 2 points. All regions continued to benefit from exceptionally strong revenue trends related to the consumers' reconnection with home and garden. E-commerce continued to be very strong. We had a strong holiday season and a robust lineup of new products and innovation.
The operating margin rate for this segment was another outstanding result at 20.7%, up 420 basis points versus the prior year as volume, productivity, cost control and price were modestly offset by new growth investments. As the revenue outlook improved during 2020, we released incremental SG&A investments to further the development of our brands via digital marketing, increased distribution capacity and added commercial resources to support our business model in brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. We believe much of these investments will drive further organic growth and share gains in 2021 and 2022.
Now let's look at some of the geographies within Tools & Storage. North America was up a robust 27% organically. Retail continued to see exceptionally strong POS, delivering 36% organic growth through a very strong holiday season, along with continued momentum in e-commerce.
POS growth for the quarter approximated 30%. And retailer inventories ended the year slightly below Q3 levels and well below prior year, an amazing Q4 performance for the Tools & Storage team. And what's incredibly amazing is we still have a channel refill opportunity of 4 weeks in front of us that will likely materialize in the front part of 2021.
The North American commercial and industrial channels continue to experience positive sequential trends, with both posting low single-digit growth this quarter versus declines in Q3. Pure-play construction customers within these channels were up mid-teens in Q4, significantly improved from the low single-digit growth last quarter. This trend is clearly another strong signal that professional demand is back and accelerating.
The Tools & Storage European business also had an outstanding fourth quarter as all regions grew, which resulted in 18% organic growth. This performance was led by the U.K., Central Europe, Nordics, Benelux and Iberia, all up double digits, with France and Italy up mid-single digits. The team experienced strong revenue growth in both retail, brick-and-mortar and e-commerce.
Finally, emerging markets delivered an exceptional quarter of organic growth as well, up 22%, with all regions posting positive revenue trends. We experienced strong construction demand in these markets. And when combined with positive pricing momentum, it supported this robust performance.
Latin America was the strongest performer, delivering 36% organic growth, with all countries up double digits, while Russia and Turkey had another very strong quarter, also resulting in double-digit growth in these markets. Finally, Asia delivered low single-digit growth, led by South Korea and India, each up double digits, which was partially offset by modest declines in China and Southeast Asia.
Now let's pivot and look at the Tools & Storage SBUs. Power Tools delivered 32% organic growth, benefiting from the home and construction trends mentioned previously as well as strong commercial execution for the holiday season and new product introductions. We continue to see strong share gains from our new innovations in FLEXVOLT, ATOMIC and XTREME, which now represent over $600 million of annual revenue on a combined basis.
Our Outdoor Product business delivered 29% organic growth as these categories continue to benefit from the consumer reconnection with the home as well as new DEWALT and Craftsman cordless products were launched in 2020.
The Hand Tools and Accessory and Storage business delivered an impressive 15% organic growth in the quarter. This was supported by new product launches, the strong performance in emerging markets and Mac Tools, combined with the rebound in professional construction demand I just previously mentioned.
In summary, an amazing quarter and an incredibly successful year for Tools & Storage. The team remained focused and responded with agility to the pandemic and quickly pivoted to fulfill the surging demand that emerged in the second half of the year. This effort was remarkable and helped them deliver record levels of growth and margin expansion during one of the most challenging operating environments in our lifetimes. Great job by the entire team. We thank them for their intense and focused efforts. I am really excited to see the encore performance in 2021.
Turning to Industrial. Total growth was 10%, which included an 11-point contribution from the CAM acquisition and 2 points from currency. This was partially offset by a 2% volume-driven organic decline and a negative 1% impact from the divestiture of a noncore product line in Oil & Gas. It was great to see continued improving trends sequentially as the organic decline in Q3 of 18% improved to negative 2% in the fourth quarter, a trend which is positioning this segment for organic growth in 2021.
The operating margin rate increased 110 basis points year-over-year to 14.7% as the benefits from productivity and restructuring cost actions more than offset the impact of the lower volume.
Diving a bit deeper into this segment. Engineered Fastening revenues were down 2% organically as growth in Automotive was offset by an improved but still declining general industrial end market. Automotive was up mid-single digits behind high-teens growth in Automotive Fasteners, which was partially offset by continued declines in Systems as most new capital investment decisions related to new car models continue to be on hold.
However, global light vehicle production continues to improve, and we remain well positioned to outpace the underlying market with content gains in the fastener portion of this business. Industrial fasteners declined high single digits in the fourth quarter. The recovery in the industrial markets continues to progress, and we once again saw a sequential improvement.
Our Infrastructure businesses declined 5% organically as positive Attachment Tools growth was more than offset by reduced pipeline construction in Oil & Gas.
And finally, turning to Security. Total revenue was down 3% with a 3% positive impact from currency, while price and acquisitions each contributed 1%. This was offset by a 5-point decline in volumes and a negative 3% due to the divestitures announced last quarter.
North America declined 5% as growth in health care was offset by lower installations in automatic doors and commercial electronic security. These businesses are serving markets that are still slowly improving from the pandemic impact and also faced a difficult 7% growth comparable in 2019.
European Security organic growth was relatively flat as they experienced solid growth in France from the new growth initiatives which began to take root. This performance was offset by lower volume in the U.K. related to the various intense lockdowns from the pandemic.
Our focus on health and safety initiatives such as touchless stores, contact tracing and health care solutions are building momentum and generated about 150 basis points of growth in Q4. With the healthy backlog, a continued recovering market and the addition of these new solutions, we are optimistic that Security can return to growth in the front half and for the full year of 2021.
In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin rate was 11.2%, flat versus the prior year as price and cost control were offset by the impact from lower volume and growth investments.
Now let's take a look at our very strong free cash flow performance on the next page. As you can see, we were able to leverage our strong operational performance in the back half to generate a record full year free cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion in 2020. This represents an increase of $593 million versus the prior year and a free cash flow conversion of 136% of net income. This result was driven by the strong growth in Tools & Storage, our company-wide cost actions and lower capital spending, delivering significant improvement in cash earnings.
Now as it relates to working capital, we delivered 10.4 working capital turns, up 0.6 turns year-over-year, reflecting the strong revenue performance and leveraging the SBD operating model to drive working capital efficiency across the company. With the strong cash generation and inclusion of the excess cash on the balance sheet, which amounted to $1.4 billion at year-end, we believe we are well positioned from a leverage perspective heading into 2021, a fantastic outcome.
Now I would like to discuss our views on 2021 as improving channel and market visibility has enabled us to reinstate guidance. Beginning with Slide 10, I'd like to dive deeper into several of our 2021 organic growth assumptions. We are experiencing a fast start to the first quarter as strong market trends in Tools & Storage continue, combined with improving industrial and security markets. Therefore, we expect organic revenue growth to approximate 21% to 26% for the company in the first quarter of 2021.
Tools & Storage is the largest contributor of this strong performance, and our plans assume a 1Q organic growth range of 30% to 40%. Underpinning this assumption is the continuation of the strong demand trends, the potential for customer inventories to start to move back to historical levels, and finally, we have an easier comp since Q1 2019 at the beginning -- Q1 2020 at the beginning impacts from the pandemic. Growth continues to be broad-based, with all regions contributing to very strong outlook. POS in U.S. retail through the first 3 weeks of January has remained in a similar band that we experienced during December, and we are assuming this trend will continue through the remainder of the quarter.
We are also seeing continued positive momentum in the commercial and industrial channels. Tools & Storage European and emerging markets continue to experience strong momentum as well. And we are currently expecting demand trends in Q1 that are similar to the fourth quarter we just completed.
Another way to look at the 30% to 40% Tools & Storage organic growth assumption is that it represents approximately $600 million to $800 million of Q1 organic growth. January, which is historically a very slow month for Tools & Storage, is on track through 3 of 5 weeks to deliver $400 million of growth in the month. Additionally, February and March were both negative comps in 2020. Therefore, we believe with the continuation of market demand trends and a modest contribution from safety stock increases across our global customer base, this represents a very strong or reasonably balanced expectation for the first quarter.
Turning to Industrial. Our first quarter assumes a decline of 5% up to flat organically. To deconstruct this a bit, at the midpoint of this range, we are calling for high single-digit to low double-digit growth in both Attachment Tools and within Automotive Engineered Fastening, which in total represent a little more than half of this segment. Supporting this, Attachment Tools experienced a 50% year-over-year increase in Q4 backlog. In Automotive, this assumes a moderation of fastener volume growth to low double digits and a less severe decline on easier comps for our Systems business.
We expect our Industrial Fastener business to continue its sequential improvement and be relatively flat. Offsetting these positive factors in Q1, we anticipate steep declines in Oil & Gas and Aerospace. CAM is included in the organic growth calculation partway through the first quarter. As both of these businesses are longer cycle, they held up relatively better when the initial impacts of the pandemic occurred and, therefore, will be challenged in the front half of 2021.
Turning to Security. Our plan assumes for a range of flat to up low single digits organically in Q1. Exit trends in December for this business were strong. And the backlog ended the year up double digits, which provides a good setup as we enter Q1, particularly as the easier comps begin in the month of March. Additionally, the business is focused on continuing to stimulate demand with their existing and new health and safety solutions that emerged from the pandemic and started to generate revenue prior to the end of the year.
Turning to the right side of the slide. I want to touch on the full year growth assumptions for all segments and the first and second half planning assumptions for Tools & Storage. As you would expect, we are planning for a very strong first half of the year. We are expecting the strong trends I just talked about through -- I just talked through for Q1 to moderate in the second quarter but remain quite strong. The continued market recoveries in Security and Industrial, strong demand in Tools and relatively easy year-over-year comps positions the company for an organic growth range of 19% to 24% for the first quarter.
For the second half, we have moderated our assumptions to incorporate the difficult comps created by the strong second half 2020 growth in Tools. While we are pushing for more growth and share gains, we felt it was prudent to set expectations for a decline of 3% to 8% organically for the company. This is how we have constructed our overall range of 4% to 8% organic growth for the full year for Stanley Black & Decker.
For Tools & Storage, we are also assuming full year growth of 48%, which includes organic growth of 27% to 32% in the first half for the reasons previously mentioned, and a decline of 7% to 12% in the back half. While the growth in Tools is retracting versus 2020 in the back half, the range is up 4% to 10% versus the back half of 2019. This is a reasonable 2-year assumption based on the historical growth numbers we have seen for this business.
That being said, this is a short-cycle business and we are ensuring the supply chain can accommodate second half scenarios that are improved versus this range. The potential scenario we must be prepared for is robust tools and storage markets that continue for the majority of 2021. We have not assumed this will occur in our guidance, but we will be ready to respond if this does evolve in the coming months.
For Industrial, we are assuming 2% to 6% growth in 2021. With a stronger performance in the front half due to the easier comps, Engineered Fastening and Attachment Tools have a lot of momentum, and we are well positioned to capitalize upon the recovery as it unfolds in 2021.
As it relates to Oil & Gas and Aerospace, we expect they will remain a significant headwind to growth in the front half, but this eases a bit as we move into the back half.
Finally, for Security, we see a range for 4% to 6% growth for the full year. This is fairly consistent across the 2 halves as the front half has easier comps and the back half carries a stronger level of growth from the ramp-up of our health and safety-focused growth initiatives.
We are excited by the prospects for these tech-enabled products, which contributed 1.5 points of growth in the fourth quarter and could represent up to $100 million of revenue in 2021.
So in summary, we are expecting 4% to 8% organic full year growth with growth in every segment. We are well positioned to capture market recoveries and share gains in each of our businesses and feel this is a balanced range that acknowledges the current environment. We will continue to watch our markets and will be prepared if the back half assumption proves to be conservative.
Now I'll summarize the remaining guidance assumptions on Slide 11. We are reinitiating guidance in 2021 with an adjusted earnings per share range of $9.70 to $10.30, up approximately 11% versus prior year at the midpoint. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $9.15 to $9.85, inclusive of various onetime charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. This range is $0.40 wider than our traditional guide, recognizing that while visibility has improved, the operating environment remains dynamic.
Since I just covered organic growth, let's jump right into the cost structure considerations. We expect $125 million of carryover cost savings net of the reversal of temporary actions from the cost program we implemented in the second quarter of 2020. These actions will primarily benefit the first quarter with a modest benefit in the second quarter.
From an inflation perspective, we currently see the potential for approximately $75 million of headwind primarily associated with steel, base metals, transportation, electronic components and resins. Keep in mind, we generally lock in our supply agreements 1 to 2 quarters out, so the timing of this headwind is back-half weighted. Partially offsetting this headwind is a tailwind of roughly $45 million related to foreign exchange. Therefore, at this point in time, we have included $30 million of a headwind associated with these externally driven cost inputs.
Should we see additional pressure in commodities or should currency reverse, we will utilize our productivity programs and pricing to neutralize the pressure over time. However, specific to 2021, as a reminder, we have $100 million to $150 million of margin resiliency benefits as a contingency, which is not included in our guidance. This contingency will assist in mitigating new headwinds in these areas during 2020 if they emerge.
Finally, we have disclosed our current full year assumptions for the significant below-the-line items and our expectation for pretax M&A and other charges to assist with your modeling.
Turning to cash flow. We expect another strong performance in 2021, with free cash flow conversion approximating GAAP net income. Underpinning this expectation is capital expenditures of approximately 3% of net sales. In addition, we will utilize the SBD operating model to drive efficiencies in working capital to deliver turns improvement.
Lastly, we expect the first quarter's earnings per share to be approximately 24% of the full year performance, which is primarily driven by operating leverage on the organic growth assumptions I walked through for Q1 and the $150 million of benefits from the carryover cost actions we have implemented.
So in summary, for the total company, we expect 4% to 8% organic growth and 7% to 14% adjusted EPS expansion, a strong forecast that represents a balanced view recognizing the dynamic operating environment but also incorporates more difficult comps and inflation assumptions into the plan while delivering healthy margin expansion and EPS growth for the full year.
The organization remains focused on meeting the needs of several ongoing strong and sequentially improving markets, leveraging our organic growth catalysts as well, executing margin resiliency and generating strong free cash flow while not losing sight of ensuring we keep our employees safe and assisting our communities through the remainder of this pandemic.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim to close out with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim?"

In summary, 2020 was an extraordinary year for Stanley Black & Decker. This performance was possible due to the agility, passion and dedication of our people, combined with a strong cultural and financial foundation. It's hard to pick one element to get most enthused about given the 2020 performance, especially in the second half as well as the improving outlook. Is it the growth, the margin expansion or the extraordinary cash flow and the potential for more? Is it the demonstrated resilience of this purpose-driven company? Or is it the enormous potential given the way the company is positioned for 2021 and 2022?
In my view, it's all of the above. We are energized by the existence of a multiyear runway for growth and profitability improvement. The shareholder value-creation potential is certainly compelling over the medium to long term. And while pursuing these shareholder rewards, we are also mindful of our responsibility to society and the multiple stakeholders that we serve. And our sustained commitment to ESG and social responsibility is strong, authentic, and we continue to elevate it over time.
And as you can see, there's a lot to be excited about with our MTD partnership. And for 2021, these opportunities are planned to deliver more than $100 million of organic growth for SBD as well as to support additional growth for MTD.
So I want to thank everybody. It's been an exciting year. There's a lot of really great things ahead. And now I'll turn it over to Dennis. Dennis?"

To be very clear, there's no acquisition of MTD in the guidance. There are some licensing income associated with some of the opportunities I described in the comments. There's some organic growth in Stanley based on some collabo",560,"Okay. So thank you, Nigel. To be very clear, there's no acquisition of MTD in the guidance. There are some licensing income associated with some of the opportunities I described in the comments. There's some organic growth in Stanley based on some collaboration with MTD on products that we will be selling through our own channels and our own brands. But there is nothing related to the acquisition in the guidance.
The multiple is going to be a trailing multiple because that's how the option is basically priced. It's based on a trailing EBITDA. And so that's where the 7 to 8x comes from.
And as far as the road to mid-teens operating margin, it's our objective to get the operating margin up to around -- somewhere around 8-ish percent next year, maybe a little higher if the volume kind of comes through the way we think. And so if we start from, let's say, a base of maybe 8% to 10%, there is a whole series of cost reduction, value-creation activities that exist in a plan, if you will. It's a somewhat high-level plan because we're not able to get in and do super detailed diligence at this point.
But we have been working with a major consulting firm to come up with some -- a point of view on how we can get to a number, something in the neighborhood of probably $50 million to $100 million of additional margin improvement that is not being implemented by MTD for various reasons. One, they may not have the appetite for it or they may not have the capability to do it. But we have some ideas that are pretty specific in that regard.
And that gets us up into like the 12-ish kind of zone. And then from 12% to 15%, it really is going to be a function of really leveraging the synergies between the companies, the channel synergies, the brand synergies, the growth and also a major thrust into the professional channel.
I must say that having spent some time at MTD in September, I was blown away by the quality of their innovation pipeline, the collaboration, to the extent we've been allowed to do that through -- based on certain legal constraints and so on. But the collaboration that we have been able to do in terms of lightweighting, electrification, autonomy, those types of things, it's really, really impressive. And what they've done on their own is impressive, too.
So the combination of all those things, I expect that we will make a major thrust into the pro channel. The products are going to be very, very strong. And when we start branding those products with some of our major brands such as DEWALT, I think there's going to be a really compelling value proposition for the channel and the end user to carry those products and buy those products. So that's kind of where we're going with MTD.
You can start to see the -- in the marketplace in 2021 some of the, I'll call them, collaborations around just the edges without really being 100% owned by us. And the ability for us to generate $100 million of organic growth just with some modest collaboration in terms of commercial and product is -- really kind of underlines the potential and the power of this relationship."

So we feel really positive about how the business positioned itself from a profitability perspective.

I mean we saw these trends kind of emerge in October time frame, November and in the categories I mentioned of steel, resin, electronic components. And so that is going to continue for a period of time. Right now, we have $75 million of an increase in those types of categories in our guidance for 2021.
I don't think it's going to radically deviate from that. It could go up a little bit as the year goes on, but we do have to keep in mind that the way that we structure our contracts, it usually takes a good 6 months for that to really impact our P&L, which gives us time to respond with pricing actions, if that makes sense, or productivity or whatever the case may be. And then that kind of helps us mitigate that over a longer period of time, maybe over a multiyear period of time, those actions.
The margin resiliency program is an annual program that we started about 3 years ago, which was built on -- let's look at the different areas of our company, the functions, the operations teams, how we price our products, et cetera, and use technology such as artificial intelligence, advanced data analytics and make better decisions in those particular areas to drive efficiency and effectiveness. And we've seen that -- over the last few years that the ongoing process of the team that's been created and the technology that they use, we have about 100 people that are focused on this full time in the company, drives about $100 million to $150 million of annual value. Now we could put that in our P&L and make it part of our guidance, but we think it's more prudent in volatile times like this to have it outside the guidance as a contingency. And so when new things come your way that are headwinds, you have an offset.
These things are underway. They're in process. And so they're driving value this month, in all 12 months out of the year. And so if the headwinds don't come, you get the opportunity to position yourself to outperform. And we think it's a very balanced way to approach guidance and the way to operate in this world given the level of volatility that we've all seen in the last 4 years, but in particular, the last 12 months."

And we were scratching our heads to some extent because we've had inflation more often -- more years than not over the 20-plus years I've been here. And we've always been able to offset a part of it with price and new product development, new product introductions and so on. And then there's always productivity that has come through and helped offset the rest of it and actually given us some decent margin accretion in certain years even when there was inflation.
And so this reflex reaction that occurred, which was, oh, my gosh, Stanley Black & Decker is inflation prone, didn't make any sense to us. But then when we thought about it, we realized that if you go back to the '17, '18, '19 kind of time frame, there was this $1 billion of headwinds that we have all behind us now. And that $1 billion of headwinds was a triad of things. It was the inflation, it was the tariffs and it was the FX. And $1 billion was just too big a series of headwinds to just offset with the normal types of offsets that I talked about, so we ended up having to do some restructuring.
And by the way, we still generated 6% earnings growth during that time frame. So it wasn't catastrophic. It was just a lot of work and a lot of pain in order to get through that period and we did it. But any one of those, whether it was the FX or the inflation or the tariffs, any one of those we could have handled easily through our normal contingencies and things like that. But when we put them all together in that 3 years in a row, it just became -- it became a lot. And so that perception, I think, develops.
So immediately, when the winds of inflation started blowing in the third, fourth quarter, we got this reflex from the investment community. But I think as of today, I hope that we can put that behind us because it is not a significant material issue to us in '21."

And I think another thing is the install base of battery systems is a big deal with this kind of growth that we have in 2020 and now into '21. There are going to be more and more first timers or people that have bought new battery systems, investing in additional tools for their battery systems.
And frankly, I think once people discover DIY, it tends to be somewhat addictive. So I think that we're going to have a -- it is a secular shift, in my opinion. I think the home center CEOs would agree with that. I've heard them talk about that as well. So that's a big deal. Obviously, it abates over time as the comps kind of get tougher in terms of its percentage impact on growth.
And what we saw in 2000 relative to the pros was in the beginning, the pros, like -- let's say, like April, May, projects kind of came to a grinding halt for the most part, except for the really essential ones. And then into the summer, the pros started coming back into the third and fourth quarter. You can't even get a contractor in this country anymore if you want one. So at least I have had that experience. I think the contractors are very busy in the resi and both the remodeling and in the new construction areas. They've got a tremendous backlog. I think they are back. I mean I think that has played out. 
So as we go forward, I think what we're really looking at is more of kind of going up against the comps and getting back to a more normal environment as we get into '22 and beyond. But it's -- it is one. It is an art, as you say, and it's difficult to really parse in great detail exactly what's happening. But that is our gut feel and instinct based on what we can see here at this point."

And we'll work through those plans as these emerge and decide where it makes sense for pricing actions and when. But it is a gross number. And so that means the annualized number is probably $125 million to $150 million when you think about it. So -- and that's the right magnitude at this stage for these different areas. The areas that really are being hit hard are steel, resin, electronic components and then battery cells or base metals, if you want to call it that, however you want to call it. But those 4 categories are things that there's a high demand for right now as we all know.
The question is how long does that demand last? Is there a -- there's parts of the economy that are really going strong, and there's other parts of the economy that are not, that have not recovered as well. And the timing of that recovery is going to depend on how the vaccines roll out and how we eventually get to herd immunity and how quickly that occurs.
So we could be seeing a short-term bubble here that may be moderate for a period of time or it could be something that continues to grow modestly over multiple years. So time will tell. But I think we've got that in the right box right now, and it's something we can manage going forward with all the levers that I described.
The other 2 segments for profitability improvement, I can probably be cute and give you all kinds of leverage factors, but I think it might be simpler and just say, if you think about the whole company's operating margin rate, we're trying to improve about 50 basis points year-over-year. Tools is trying to improve roughly the same number, maybe a little bit more. And so that means Industrial and Security are going to improve about the same number, too.
So I think you can kind of look at a 50 -- anywhere from 40 to 60 basis point improvement in all 3 segments with the net result for the company of about 50 basis points for the full year."

It is a global number we're talking about because we do see opportunity across the globe probably heavily -- more heavily weighted to North America because we know those inventories are definitely at the very low end of the range of where we like to be. And so maybe 75% to 80% of it is weighted to the U.S. and North America.
But I think when you think about the growth that could come with that, it's probably a couple of points of growth, maybe 2.5 points of growth for the full year, which means it could be 5 points in the first half. So that's the magnitude we're talking about. And I think we'll see it start to evolve in Q1, but it might be more heavily weighted to Q2 because POS just seems really robust in Q1 at this stage."

We were very fortunate that we were able to really -- first of all, we started the year with a really solid inventory position, both in the company and in the channels, or at least the North American channels where the demand really spiked.
And so that was helpful because it was kind of a strange situation. But it got into May, and we were looking at POS that was starting to skyrocket and the orders were not coming in from the channel. And so we ended up building quite a bit of inventory starting in May -- actually over $500 million of inventory we built to serve POS demand that was occurring. And we had to kind of bet that the POS was going to continue at that rate, and it did. And that enabled us to really get ahead of the situation so that we've been -- now if you look at this point in time, we're essentially serving the POS and have been for 2 quarters now. And we're able to do that. Our end users continue to be very, very robust in buying tools. And our channel partners would like more. They would like their inventory restored. And that is the challenge. 
And so one of the things that we've done and we were also very fortunate from this standpoint of -- our made -- our make where you sell campaign that we've been working on for 3 or 4 years had some pretty significant capacity additions both in Mexico and in North America and in the U.S. And a number of those are either online or coming online, including a major plant in Mexico and a major plant in the U.S. in -- later in 2021.
And so as we look forward, we're not counting on those to necessarily get the inventories back to where they need to be in the channels, but we are looking forward to the fact that we will have more capacity in the system, significantly more capacity as we get into 2021. So we're not too concerned about that.
And in the meantime, there's a tremendous amount of inefficiency that's been built into our cost of goods sold here in the second, third and fourth quarters, especially the third and fourth quarters, where in order to meet the fill rate objectives and keep the inventories at the levels that we've been able to, we've done a lot of heroic things that have been costly, things like air freight and expediting and items of that nature. And those items ultimately will be relieved, I think, to some extent, by the capacity coming online in the future.
And -- but in the meantime, they're kind of built into the run rate. You can see the margins are -- even with those inefficiencies are pretty good. And we have really pushed our supply chain hard to serve our customers thus far, and it's been successful as you can see."

Today, we issued record fourth quarter results marking an outstanding close to a very dynamic and successful year. As I mentioned in our 2020 shareholder letter, we expected the operating environment of the 2020s to be on",2372,"Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. Today, we issued record fourth quarter results marking an outstanding close to a very dynamic and successful year. As I mentioned in our 2020 shareholder letter, we expected the operating environment of the 2020s to be one of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, or VUCA for short. Lest we had any thought of easing into that construct over time, like others, we were thrust into action as the pandemic roared onto the scene in March and April. And as for many companies, the early days of the pandemic brought into focus the first rung of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. We quickly established pandemic-era tactical priorities: first, protect the health and safety of our employees and supply chain partners; secondly, ensure the continuity of our operations and financial stability; and third, do what we can or could to mitigate the impact of the virus in our communities.
We undertook a myriad of actions consistent with those priorities, including the implementation of intensive company-wide safety protocols, including mandatory masks from day 1; significant liquidity enhancements; cost reductions, some temporary, some permanent; as well as a substantial increase in our philanthropy, both in dollar terms and in kind.
We asked our people to be guided by our purpose. For those who make the world, we emphasized our 3 simple leadership principles, which include creating clarity, inspiring engagement and growing and delivering. Our people, while dealing with their personal hardships and challenges, characteristic of this era, responded beautifully to our lead. Amidst 4 weeks of collapsing sellout revenue in April, we were hunkered down, ready to ride out the storm. And then suddenly, in the last week of April and on into the summer months, an abrupt and very positive phenomenon emerged in the Tools business.
Our end users, many of them homebound, with time on their hands, discovered and/or rediscovered DIY projects, both indoors and outdoors. We enjoyed a surge in North American retail of a magnitude never before experienced. By June, POS was running 30% to 40% greater than the prior year. E-commerce growth exploded at levels even higher than that. Unfortunately, both we and our channel partners had solid inventory positions at the onset of the demand. By May, we were ramping up our factories to extraordinary levels. By the third quarter, the demand trend had extended to Europe and other markets around the world, albeit at somewhat lower levels but still in strong double-digit territory.
The second half of 2020 proved to be an all-out test of our supply chain resiliency and ability to serve the growth. Customer inventory levels have been substantially reduced by midyear and our global factories were running at historic levels just to keep up with the POS demand, and they still are. We faced rolling labor shortages, supplier issues and various arbitrary government edicts in jurisdictions all over the globe. However, we were able to prevail and operate continuously with only minor exceptions. And along the way, we've moved forward with significant capacity expansion actions for both power and hand tools, and we look forward to serving continued growth in the future.
2020 was by far the most difficult backdrop we've ever faced, but we were prepared for volatility and our people rose to meet the challenges. Fortunately, we went into it with strength and have stayed strong for the duration. Back in 2016, we committed to a vision that embodied purpose-driven performance. We've built a company that is anchored by a support of people-oriented culture, striving to deliver top quartile shareholder return to become known as one of the world's great innovators and to elevate an already strong commitment to ESG and corporate social responsibility.
We demonstrated in 2020 that when corporations like ours put people first and work to have a positive impact on society at large, the result can be extraordinary resilience, which benefits our shareholders through outstanding growth, cash flow, margin expansion and ESG, and that is the story of 2020.
On the heels of an excellent third quarter, the fourth quarter was the pinnacle of our 2020 performance, and we entered 2021 stronger than ever. And now I'll take a moment and recap the 4Q numbers, which demonstrate the power of our momentum as we enter 2021.
Revenues were up 19% to $4.4 billion with organic growth of 16%. This was led once again by Tools & Storage, which had organic revenue up an impressive 25%. Our total company operating margin rate, excluding charges, was a fourth quarter record at 16.5%, up 290 basis points from prior year, with volume leverage, productivity, cost actions, price and margin resiliency initiatives all contributing. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $3.29, up 51%, 51% versus prior year.
And now let's turn to the full year. Revenues were $14.5 billion, up 1%, with 10% organic growth in the second half more than offsetting the first half pandemic-related issues. Our full year operating margin rate expanded 110 basis points to 14.6%, attributable to strong cost control, productivity, our margin resiliency initiatives and price. Adjusted EPS for the year was $9.04, an 8% increase versus 2019, especially remarkable when considering our original pre-pandemic guidance midpoint last January was $8.90 a share.
We converted the strong sales and margin results, along with just over 0.5 turn of working capital improvement, into record cash flow. Free cash flow was $1.7 billion for the year, $1.7 billion for the year, an all-time record for the company, up 55% versus 2019 with a conversion rate of 136%.
And lastly, I'm happy to report that we successfully exceeded all of our 5-year, medium-term environmental, health and safety goals established in 2015. We targeted a 20% reduction of our energy consumption, our carbon emissions, our water use and our waste generated in our facilities and more than attained each one of those goals. In addition, we significantly improved our recycling and use of renewable energy and achieved our safety goals. When I became CEO in 2016, we updated our vision to elevate our commitment to social responsibility.
Achievement of these goals is an important milestone in our journey to execute on our 2030 sustainability strategy. More goals and more milestones ahead as we continue on this march.
So where do we go from here? In a world of elevated uncertainty, here are a few observations to simplify and clarify our point of view on that for '21 and '22. Without question, tools and outdoor demand is on a roll, and we think it will be for some time to come, benefiting from a series of exogenous factors, including: first, the secular surge in global DIY driven by the consumers' rediscovery of home and garden; secondly, a massive acceleration of the global shift to e-commerce within our channels, which plays to our strength as the global tools leader in e-commerce; and third, a cyclical boom in North America home improvement driven by increasing new and preowned home sales associated largely with household formation and the urban exodus; and then there is the need to rebuild channel inventories levels -- inventory levels, which we believe are at least 4 weeks lower than desirable.
Our Tools business has never been stronger or better positioned to gain share, and we have consistently grown organically and gained share every year since the merger of Stanley and Black & Decker 11 years ago. Our unmatched array of iconic brands, market-leading innovation, combined with our scale and organizational agility, continues to support that investment thesis.
Total company operating margin reached new heights in the second half of 2020, breaking through the 15% threshold at 17.7% and 16.5% in 3Q and 4Q, respectively. This is a significant increase of about 300 basis points over prior year and it is not a coincidence. It derives from an intentional confluence of tight cost management, volume leverage, price/mix management and our margin resiliency initiative. The latter applies cutting-edge digital technologies to optimize margin performance across multiple value pools.
Skeptics point out that the third quarter benefited from cost reductions, some of which were admittedly temporary in nature. These skeptics now have to deal with the fourth quarter in which the 16.5% includes the vast majority of temporary costs such as furloughs, 4-day work weeks, executive salary reductions and benefit deferrals back in the run rate. This was accomplished as we began to fund significant new investments in growth initiatives, including major thrusts into e-commerce, revitalizing the Black & Decker brand, security, health and safety and outdoor products.
And although the second half '21 Tools' growth comp is difficult, we believe it is manageable, and we are predicting full year total company organic growth of approximately 6% at the midpoint, with a super strong first half and a modest negative in the back half yielding the 6% midpoint, which is the high end of our long-term growth objective for that measure.
Our strong share momentum, aided by numerous growth catalysts such as FLEXVOLT, Craftsman, ATOMIC, XTREME, POWERDETECT and e-commerce, should not be underestimated. On top of this, there's an industrial-related portion of Tools that is in the midst of a cyclical rebound as we enter 2021, along with about $4 billion of Industrial, which includes Engineered Fastening Automotive and the Security segment revenue, which was negative in 2020, and all those are expected to be positive in the aggregate in 2021.
So for all these reasons and more, as Don will cover in his remarks, our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance is introduced at $9.70 to $10.30 a share. At the midpoint, this is $10, up 11%, which is a very good place to start our journey into 2021. And while it is too early, way too early to guess at what market conditions might be in 2022, we stand to benefit from our multiyear relationship with MTD and our optionality to acquire the remaining 80% at a very attractive multiple with a window that begins to open in July of this year, which brings me to a brief update on MTD.
Our current planning assumption calls for the exercise of our MTD option and the potential addition of up to $3 billion of revenue from the MTD transaction in 2022. And just to clarify, we expect to implement or exercise the option in late '21 and begin to recognize revenue subsequent to regulatory approvals and, hopefully, beginning in 2022.
The Lawn and Garden category is experiencing similar benefits to Tools from the consumers' reconnection with the home. And MTD LTM revenues now approximate $2.6 billion with a very strong second half revenue performance in the books, comparable to our Tools business.
Additionally, MTD continues to make progress on multiple opportunities to generate operational efficiency and margin improvement, delivering a 6% operating margin in 2020 with momentum coming into the 2021 season and plenty of runway ahead for further improvement.
The transaction was structured in a financially prudent way, whereby we purchased 20% of the company at an 11x multiple with the option to purchase the remaining 80% anytime during a 10-year window beginning this July. MTD's incremental EBITDA improvement since our initial purchase is shared 50-50 and is thus valued at 5.5x, which provides us the ability to acquire a market leader in outdoor power equipment at an all-in multiple at the time of option execution likely to approximate 7 to 8x.
We are excited by the multiple levers to accelerate growth and margin expansion with this acquisition. In addition to the initial revenue contribution upon consolidation, we see additional organic growth opportunities in the pro outdoor equipment market as well as to drive electric-powered and autonomous mower offerings while employing our successful commercial model to fully leverage our portfolio of brands and channels.
We're also working on a multiyear road map to achieve 15% operating margin in the category. Not likely, some say. However, we believe we're up to the challenge. I remind the naysayers that Black & Decker's operating margin was below 6% in the year before acquisition, and the very same team that addressed that opportunity is still on the field today.
We continue to be encouraged by MTD's innovation and product development pipeline as well as their progress on improving profitability, and we're excited about this future combination. Even before exercising our option, we are bringing this vision to life in 2021, with SBD and MTD each independently launching a series of new products under the DEWALT, Craftsman and Black & Decker brands that are hitting the market now across the gas and electric power spectrum.
A few notable examples. MTD brings world-class innovation in riding and zero-turn mowers. And through a licensing arrangement, we'll launch a new lineup of the DEWALT-branded, gas-powered professional mowers that are now beginning to roll out at one of our major U.S. retailers. In addition, we have designed, developed and are launching new cordless, 20-volt DEWALT walk-behind mowers also with strong listings that will be made in the U.S.A. with global materials in MTD's Tupelo, Mississippi facility.
MTD continues to expand its outdoor offering into new categories with Craftsman under license. New to this -- new to market this year will be an impressive lineup of zero-turn gas mowers as well as gas-powered solutions in riding and walk-behind mowers. Concurrently, SBD will expand our battery and electric-powered offerings in push mowers, power washers and handheld products such as chainsaws, trimmers and blowers.
Lastly, as a part of our e-commerce-focused brand refresh with Black & Decker -- of Black & Decker, MTD will launch a new lineup of gas handheld products under license. And we will launch new electric offerings, including an autonomous robotic mower in Europe.
As you can see, we've been busy working our partnership with MTD, and there is a lot to be excited about that. And for 2021, these opportunities are planned to deliver more than $100 million of organic growth for SBD as well as support additional growth for MTD. With broad coverage across gas-powered products for MTD and electric and battery-powered categories for SBD, we are just starting to tap into the significant potential ahead of us.
And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan to cover the fourth quarter and our 2021 guidance. Don?"

We are incredibly pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance, which closed out an amazing back half to 2020. So now I would like to review our business segment results for the fourth quarter.
Tools & Storage delivered an exceptional 25% total and organic revenue growth, with volume up 23% and price contributing additional 2 points. All regions continued to benefit from exceptionally strong revenue trends related to the consumers' reconnection with home and garden. E-commerce continued to be very strong. We had a strong holiday season and a robust lineup of new products and innovation.
The operating margin rate for this segment was another outstanding result at 20.7%, up 420 basis points versus the prior year as volume, productivity, cost control and price were modestly offset by new growth investments. As the revenue outlook improved during 2020, we released incremental SG&A investments to further the development of our brands via digital marketing, increased distribution capacity and added commercial resources to support our business model in brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. We believe much of these investments will drive further organic growth and share gains in 2021 and 2022.
Now let's look at some of the geographies within Tools & Storage. North America was up a robust 27% organically. Retail continued to see exceptionally strong POS, delivering 36% organic growth through a very strong holiday season, along with continued momentum in e-commerce.
POS growth for the quarter approximated 30%. And retailer inventories ended the year slightly below Q3 levels and well below prior year, an amazing Q4 performance for the Tools & Storage team. And what's incredibly amazing is we still have a channel refill opportunity of 4 weeks in front of us that will likely materialize in the front part of 2021.
The North American commercial and industrial channels continue to experience positive sequential trends, with both posting low single-digit growth this quarter versus declines in Q3. Pure-play construction customers within these channels were up mid-teens in Q4, significantly improved from the low single-digit growth last quarter. This trend is clearly another strong signal that professional demand is back and accelerating.
The Tools & Storage European business also had an outstanding fourth quarter as all regions grew, which resulted in 18% organic growth. This performance was led by the U.K., Central Europe, Nordics, Benelux and Iberia, all up double digits, with France and Italy up mid-single digits. The team experienced strong revenue growth in both retail, brick-and-mortar and e-commerce.
Finally, emerging markets delivered an exceptional quarter of organic growth as well, up 22%, with all regions posting positive revenue trends. We experienced strong construction demand in these markets. And when combined with positive pricing momentum, it supported this robust performance.
Latin America was the strongest performer, delivering 36% organic growth, with all countries up double digits, while Russia and Turkey had another very strong quarter, also resulting in double-digit growth in these markets. Finally, Asia delivered low single-digit growth, led by South Korea and India, each up double digits, which was partially offset by modest declines in China and Southeast Asia.
Now let's pivot and look at the Tools & Storage SBUs. Power Tools delivered 32% organic growth, benefiting from the home and construction trends mentioned previously as well as strong commercial execution for the holiday season and new product introductions. We continue to see strong share gains from our new innovations in FLEXVOLT, ATOMIC and XTREME, which now represent over $600 million of annual revenue on a combined basis.
Our Outdoor Product business delivered 29% organic growth as these categories continue to benefit from the consumer reconnection with the home as well as new DEWALT and Craftsman cordless products were launched in 2020.
The Hand Tools and Accessory and Storage business delivered an impressive 15% organic growth in the quarter. This was supported by new product launches, the strong performance in emerging markets and Mac Tools, combined with the rebound in professional construction demand I just previously mentioned.
In summary, an amazing quarter and an incredibly successful year for Tools & Storage. The team remained focused and responded with agility to the pandemic and quickly pivoted to fulfill the surging demand that emerged in the second half of the year. This effort was remarkable and helped them deliver record levels of growth and margin expansion during one of the most challenging operating environments in our lifetimes. Great job by the entire team. We thank them for their intense and focused efforts. I am really excited to see the encore performance in 2021.
Turning to Industrial. Total growth was 10%, which included an 11-point contribution from the CAM acquisition and 2 points from currency. This was partially offset by a 2% volume-driven organic decline and a negative 1% impact from the divestiture of a noncore product line in Oil & Gas. It was great to see continued improving trends sequentially as the organic decline in Q3 of 18% improved to negative 2% in the fourth quarter, a trend which is positioning this segment for organic growth in 2021.
The operating margin rate increased 110 basis points year-over-year to 14.7% as the benefits from productivity and restructuring cost actions more than offset the impact of the lower volume.
Diving a bit deeper into this segment. Engineered Fastening revenues were down 2% organically as growth in Automotive was offset by an improved but still declining general industrial end market. Automotive was up mid-single digits behind high-teens growth in Automotive Fasteners, which was partially offset by continued declines in Systems as most new capital investment decisions related to new car models continue to be on hold.
However, global light vehicle production continues to improve, and we remain well positioned to outpace the underlying market with content gains in the fastener portion of this business. Industrial fasteners declined high single digits in the fourth quarter. The recovery in the industrial markets continues to progress, and we once again saw a sequential improvement.
Our Infrastructure businesses declined 5% organically as positive Attachment Tools growth was more than offset by reduced pipeline construction in Oil & Gas.
And finally, turning to Security. Total revenue was down 3% with a 3% positive impact from currency, while price and acquisitions each contributed 1%. This was offset by a 5-point decline in volumes and a negative 3% due to the divestitures announced last quarter.
North America declined 5% as growth in health care was offset by lower installations in automatic doors and commercial electronic security. These businesses are serving markets that are still slowly improving from the pandemic impact and also faced a difficult 7% growth comparable in 2019.
European Security organic growth was relatively flat as they experienced solid growth in France from the new growth initiatives which began to take root. This performance was offset by lower volume in the U.K. related to the various intense lockdowns from the pandemic.
Our focus on health and safety initiatives such as touchless stores, contact tracing and health care solutions are building momentum and generated about 150 basis points of growth in Q4. With the healthy backlog, a continued recovering market and the addition of these new solutions, we are optimistic that Security can return to growth in the front half and for the full year of 2021.
In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin rate was 11.2%, flat versus the prior year as price and cost control were offset by the impact from lower volume and growth investments.
Now let's take a look at our very strong free cash flow performance on the next page. As you can see, we were able to leverage our strong operational performance in the back half to generate a record full year free cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion in 2020. This represents an increase of $593 million versus the prior year and a free cash flow conversion of 136% of net income. This result was driven by the strong growth in Tools & Storage, our company-wide cost actions and lower capital spending, delivering significant improvement in cash earnings.
Now as it relates to working capital, we delivered 10.4 working capital turns, up 0.6 turns year-over-year, reflecting the strong revenue performance and leveraging the SBD operating model to drive working capital efficiency across the company. With the strong cash generation and inclusion of the excess cash on the balance sheet, which amounted to $1.4 billion at year-end, we believe we are well positioned from a leverage perspective heading into 2021, a fantastic outcome.
Now I would like to discuss our views on 2021 as improving channel and market visibility has enabled us to reinstate guidance. Beginning with Slide 10, I'd like to dive deeper into several of our 2021 organic growth assumptions. We are experiencing a fast start to the first quarter as strong market trends in Tools & Storage continue, combined with improving industrial and security markets. Therefore, we expect organic revenue growth to approximate 21% to 26% for the company in the first quarter of 2021.
Tools & Storage is the largest contributor of this strong performance, and our plans assume a 1Q organic growth range of 30% to 40%. Underpinning this assumption is the continuation of the strong demand trends, the potential for customer inventories to start to move back to historical levels, and finally, we have an easier comp since Q1 2019 at the beginning -- Q1 2020 at the beginning impacts from the pandemic. Growth continues to be broad-based, with all regions contributing to very strong outlook. POS in U.S. retail through the first 3 weeks of January has remained in a similar band that we experienced during December, and we are assuming this trend will continue through the remainder of the quarter.
We are also seeing continued positive momentum in the commercial and industrial channels. Tools & Storage European and emerging markets continue to experience strong momentum as well. And we are currently expecting demand trends in Q1 that are similar to the fourth quarter we just completed.
Another way to look at the 30% to 40% Tools & Storage organic growth assumption is that it represents approximately $600 million to $800 million of Q1 organic growth. January, which is historically a very slow month for Tools & Storage, is on track through 3 of 5 weeks to deliver $400 million of growth in the month. Additionally, February and March were both negative comps in 2020. Therefore, we believe with the continuation of market demand trends and a modest contribution from safety stock increases across our global customer base, this represents a very strong or reasonably balanced expectation for the first quarter.
Turning to Industrial. Our first quarter assumes a decline of 5% up to flat organically. To deconstruct this a bit, at the midpoint of this range, we are calling for high single-digit to low double-digit growth in both Attachment Tools and within Automotive Engineered Fastening, which in total represent a little more than half of this segment. Supporting this, Attachment Tools experienced a 50% year-over-year increase in Q4 backlog. In Automotive, this assumes a moderation of fastener volume growth to low double digits and a less severe decline on easier comps for our Systems business.
We expect our Industrial Fastener business to continue its sequential improvement and be relatively flat. Offsetting these positive factors in Q1, we anticipate steep declines in Oil & Gas and Aerospace. CAM is included in the organic growth calculation partway through the first quarter. As both of these businesses are longer cycle, they held up relatively better when the initial impacts of the pandemic occurred and, therefore, will be challenged in the front half of 2021.
Turning to Security. Our plan assumes for a range of flat to up low single digits organically in Q1. Exit trends in December for this business were strong. And the backlog ended the year up double digits, which provides a good setup as we enter Q1, particularly as the easier comps begin in the month of March. Additionally, the business is focused on continuing to stimulate demand with their existing and new health and safety solutions that emerged from the pandemic and started to generate revenue prior to the end of the year.
Turning to the right side of the slide. I want to touch on the full year growth assumptions for all segments and the first and second half planning assumptions for Tools & Storage. As you would expect, we are planning for a very strong first half of the year. We are expecting the strong trends I just talked about through -- I just talked through for Q1 to moderate in the second quarter but remain quite strong. The continued market recoveries in Security and Industrial, strong demand in Tools and relatively easy year-over-year comps positions the company for an organic growth range of 19% to 24% for the first quarter.
For the second half, we have moderated our assumptions to incorporate the difficult comps created by the strong second half 2020 growth in Tools. While we are pushing for more growth and share gains, we felt it was prudent to set expectations for a decline of 3% to 8% organically for the company. This is how we have constructed our overall range of 4% to 8% organic growth for the full year for Stanley Black & Decker.
For Tools & Storage, we are also assuming full year growth of 48%, which includes organic growth of 27% to 32% in the first half for the reasons previously mentioned, and a decline of 7% to 12% in the back half. While the growth in Tools is retracting versus 2020 in the back half, the range is up 4% to 10% versus the back half of 2019. This is a reasonable 2-year assumption based on the historical growth numbers we have seen for this business.
That being said, this is a short-cycle business and we are ensuring the supply chain can accommodate second half scenarios that are improved versus this range. The potential scenario we must be prepared for is robust tools and storage markets that continue for the majority of 2021. We have not assumed this will occur in our guidance, but we will be ready to respond if this does evolve in the coming months.
For Industrial, we are assuming 2% to 6% growth in 2021. With a stronger performance in the front half due to the easier comps, Engineered Fastening and Attachment Tools have a lot of momentum, and we are well positioned to capitalize upon the recovery as it unfolds in 2021.
As it relates to Oil & Gas and Aerospace, we expect they will remain a significant headwind to growth in the front half, but this eases a bit as we move into the back half.
Finally, for Security, we see a range for 4% to 6% growth for the full year. This is fairly consistent across the 2 halves as the front half has easier comps and the back half carries a stronger level of growth from the ramp-up of our health and safety-focused growth initiatives.
We are excited by the prospects for these tech-enabled products, which contributed 1.5 points of growth in the fourth quarter and could represent up to $100 million of revenue in 2021.
So in summary, we are expecting 4% to 8% organic full year growth with growth in every segment. We are well positioned to capture market recoveries and share gains in each of our businesses and feel this is a balanced range that acknowledges the current environment. We will continue to watch our markets and will be prepared if the back half assumption proves to be conservative.
Now I'll summarize the remaining guidance assumptions on Slide 11. We are reinitiating guidance in 2021 with an adjusted earnings per share range of $9.70 to $10.30, up approximately 11% versus prior year at the midpoint. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $9.15 to $9.85, inclusive of various onetime charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. This range is $0.40 wider than our traditional guide, recognizing that while visibility has improved, the operating environment remains dynamic.
Since I just covered organic growth, let's jump right into the cost structure considerations. We expect $125 million of carryover cost savings net of the reversal of temporary actions from the cost program we implemented in the second quarter of 2020. These actions will primarily benefit the first quarter with a modest benefit in the second quarter.
From an inflation perspective, we currently see the potential for approximately $75 million of headwind primarily associated with steel, base metals, transportation, electronic components and resins. Keep in mind, we generally lock in our supply agreements 1 to 2 quarters out, so the timing of this headwind is back-half weighted. Partially offsetting this headwind is a tailwind of roughly $45 million related to foreign exchange. Therefore, at this point in time, we have included $30 million of a headwind associated with these externally driven cost inputs.
Should we see additional pressure in commodities or should currency reverse, we will utilize our productivity programs and pricing to neutralize the pressure over time. However, specific to 2021, as a reminder, we have $100 million to $150 million of margin resiliency benefits as a contingency, which is not included in our guidance. This contingency will assist in mitigating new headwinds in these areas during 2020 if they emerge.
Finally, we have disclosed our current full year assumptions for the significant below-the-line items and our expectation for pretax M&A and other charges to assist with your modeling.
Turning to cash flow. We expect another strong performance in 2021, with free cash flow conversion approximating GAAP net income. Underpinning this expectation is capital expenditures of approximately 3% of net sales. In addition, we will utilize the SBD operating model to drive efficiencies in working capital to deliver turns improvement.
Lastly, we expect the first quarter's earnings per share to be approximately 24% of the full year performance, which is primarily driven by operating leverage on the organic growth assumptions I walked through for Q1 and the $150 million of benefits from the carryover cost actions we have implemented.
So in summary, for the total company, we expect 4% to 8% organic growth and 7% to 14% adjusted EPS expansion, a strong forecast that represents a balanced view recognizing the dynamic operating environment but also incorporates more difficult comps and inflation assumptions into the plan while delivering healthy margin expansion and EPS growth for the full year.
The organization remains focused on meeting the needs of several ongoing strong and sequentially improving markets, leveraging our organic growth catalysts as well, executing margin resiliency and generating strong free cash flow while not losing sight of ensuring we keep our employees safe and assisting our communities through the remainder of this pandemic.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim to close out with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim?"

In summary, 2020 was an extraordinary year for Stanley Black & Decker. This performance was possible due to the agility, passion and dedication of our people, combined with a strong cultural and financial foundation. It's hard to pick one element to get most enthused about given the 2020 performance, especially in the second half as well as the improving outlook. Is it the growth, the margin expansion or the extraordinary cash flow and the potential for more? Is it the demonstrated resilience of this purpose-driven company? Or is it the enormous potential given the way the company is positioned for 2021 and 2022?
In my view, it's all of the above. We are energized by the existence of a multiyear runway for growth and profitability improvement. The shareholder value-creation potential is certainly compelling over the medium to long term. And while pursuing these shareholder rewards, we are also mindful of our responsibility to society and the multiple stakeholders that we serve. And our sustained commitment to ESG and social responsibility is strong, authentic, and we continue to elevate it over time.
And as you can see, there's a lot to be excited about with our MTD partnership. And for 2021, these opportunities are planned to deliver more than $100 million of organic growth for SBD as well as to support additional growth for MTD.
So I want to thank everybody. It's been an exciting year. There's a lot of really great things ahead. And now I'll turn it over to Dennis. Dennis?"

To be very clear, there's no acquisition of MTD in the guidance. There are some licensing income associated with some of the opportunities I described in the comments.

There are some licensing income associated with some of the opportunities I described in the comments. There's some organic growth in Stanley based on some collaboration with MTD on products that we will be selling through our own channels and our own brands. But there is nothing related to the acquisition in the guidance.
The multiple is going to be a trailing multiple because that's how the option is basically priced. It's based on a trailing EBITDA. And so that's where the 7 to 8x comes from.
And as far as the road to mid-teens operating margin, it's our objective to get the operating margin up to around -- somewhere around 8-ish percent next year, maybe a little higher if the volume kind of comes through the way we think. And so if we start from, let's say, a base of maybe 8% to 10%, there is a whole series of cost reduction, value-creation activities that exist in a plan, if you will. It's a somewhat high-level plan because we're not able to get in and do super detailed diligence at this point.
But we have been working with a major consulting firm to come up with some -- a point of view on how we can get to a number, something in the neighborhood of probably $50 million to $100 million of additional margin improvement that is not being implemented by MTD for various reasons. One, they may not have the appetite for it or they may not have the capability to do it. But we have some ideas that are pretty specific in that regard.
And that gets us up into like the 12-ish kind of zone. And then from 12% to 15%, it really is going to be a function of really leveraging the synergies between the companies, the channel synergies, the brand synergies, the growth and also a major thrust into the professional channel.
I must say that having spent some time at MTD in September, I was blown away by the quality of their innovation pipeline, the collaboration, to the extent we've been allowed to do that through -- based on certain legal constraints and so on. But the collaboration that we have been able to do in terms of lightweighting, electrification, autonomy, those types of things, it's really, really impressive. And what they've done on their own is impressive, too.
So the combination of all those things, I expect that we will make a major thrust into the pro channel. The products are going to be very, very strong. And when we start branding those products with some of our major brands such as DEWALT, I think there's going to be a really compelling value proposition for the channel and the end user to carry those products and buy those products. So that's kind of where we're going with MTD.
You can start to see the -- in the marketplace in 2021 some of the, I'll call them, collaborations around just the edges without really being 100% owned by us. And the ability for us to generate $100 million of organic growth just with some modest collaboration in terms of commercial and product is -- really kind of underlines the potential and the power of this relationship."

So we feel really positive about how the business positioned itself from a profitability perspective.

I mean we saw these trends kind of emerge in October time frame, November and in the categories I mentioned of steel, resin, electronic components. And so that is going to continue for a period of time. Right now, we have $75 million of an increase in those types of categories in our guidance for 2021.
I don't think it's going to radically deviate from that. It could go up a little bit as the year goes on, but we do have to keep in mind that the way that we structure our contracts, it usually takes a good 6 months for that to really impact our P&L, which gives us time to respond with pricing actions, if that makes sense, or productivity or whatever the case may be. And then that kind of helps us mitigate that over a longer period of time, maybe over a multiyear period of time, those actions.
The margin resiliency program is an annual program that we started about 3 years ago, which was built on -- let's look at the different areas of our company, the functions, the operations teams, how we price our products, et cetera, and use technology such as artificial intelligence, advanced data analytics and make better decisions in those particular areas to drive efficiency and effectiveness. And we've seen that -- over the last few years that the ongoing process of the team that's been created and the technology that they use, we have about 100 people that are focused on this full time in the company, drives about $100 million to $150 million of annual value. Now we could put that in our P&L and make it part of our guidance, but we think it's more prudent in volatile times like this to have it outside the guidance as a contingency. And so when new things come your way that are headwinds, you have an offset.
These things are underway. They're in process. And so they're driving value this month, in all 12 months out of the year. And so if the headwinds don't come, you get the opportunity to position yourself to outperform. And we think it's a very balanced way to approach guidance and the way to operate in this world given the level of volatility that we've all seen in the last 4 years, but in particular, the last 12 months."

And we were scratching our heads to some extent because we've had inflation more often -- more years than not over the 20-plus years I've been here. And we've always been able to offset a part of it with price and new product development, new product introductions and so on. And then there's always productivity that has come through and helped offset the rest of it and actually given us some decent margin accretion in certain years even when there was inflation.
And so this reflex reaction that occurred, which was, oh, my gosh, Stanley Black & Decker is inflation prone, didn't make any sense to us. But then when we thought about it, we realized that if you go back to the '17, '18, '19 kind of time frame, there was this $1 billion of headwinds that we have all behind us now. And that $1 billion of headwinds was a triad of things. It was the inflation, it was the tariffs and it was the FX. And $1 billion was just too big a series of headwinds to just offset with the normal types of offsets that I talked about, so we ended up having to do some restructuring.
And by the way, we still generated 6% earnings growth during that time frame. So it wasn't catastrophic. It was just a lot of work and a lot of pain in order to get through that period and we did it. But any one of those, whether it was the FX or the inflation or the tariffs, any one of those we could have handled easily through our normal contingencies and things like that. But when we put them all together in that 3 years in a row, it just became -- it became a lot. And so that perception, I think, develops.
So immediately, when the winds of inflation started blowing in the third, fourth quarter, we got this reflex from the investment community. But I think as of today, I hope that we can put that behind us because it is not a significant material issue to us in '21."

And I think another thing is the install base of battery systems is a big deal with this kind of growth that we have in 2020 and now into '21. There are going to be more and more first timers or people that have bought new battery systems, investing in additional tools for their battery systems.
And frankly, I think once people discover DIY, it tends to be somewhat addictive. So I think that we're going to have a -- it is a secular shift, in my opinion. I think the home center CEOs would agree with that. I've heard them talk about that as well. So that's a big deal. Obviously, it abates over time as the comps kind of get tougher in terms of its percentage impact on growth.
And what we saw in 2000 relative to the pros was in the beginning, the pros, like -- let's say, like April, May, projects kind of came to a grinding halt for the most part, except for the really essential ones. And then into the summer, the pros started coming back into the third and fourth quarter. You can't even get a contractor in this country anymore if you want one. So at least I have had that experience. I think the contractors are very busy in the resi and both the remodeling and in the new construction areas. They've got a tremendous backlog. I think they are back. I mean I think that has played out. 
So as we go forward, I think what we're really looking at is more of kind of going up against the comps and getting back to a more normal environment as we get into '22 and beyond. But it's -- it is one. It is an art, as you say, and it's difficult to really parse in great detail exactly what's happening. But that is our gut feel and instinct based on what we can see here at this point."

And we'll work through those plans as these emerge and decide where it makes sense for pricing actions and when. But it is a gross number. And so that means the annualized number is probably $125 million to $150 million when you think about it. So -- and that's the right magnitude at this stage for these different areas. The areas that really are being hit hard are steel, resin, electronic components and then battery cells or base metals, if you want to call it that, however you want to call it. But those 4 categories are things that there's a high demand for right now as we all know.
The question is how long does that demand last? Is there a -- there's parts of the economy that are really going strong, and there's other parts of the economy that are not, that have not recovered as well. And the timing of that recovery is going to depend on how the vaccines roll out and how we eventually get to herd immunity and how quickly that occurs.
So we could be seeing a short-term bubble here that may be moderate for a period of time or it could be something that continues to grow modestly over multiple years. So time will tell. But I think we've got that in the right box right now, and it's something we can manage going forward with all the levers that I described.
The other 2 segments for profitability improvement, I can probably be cute and give you all kinds of leverage factors, but I think it might be simpler and just say, if you think about the whole company's operating margin rate, we're trying to improve about 50 basis points year-over-year. Tools is trying to improve roughly the same number, maybe a little bit more. And so that means Industrial and Security are going to improve about the same number, too.
So I think you can kind of look at a 50 -- anywhere from 40 to 60 basis point improvement in all 3 segments with the net result for the company of about 50 basis points for the full year."

And so maybe 75% to 80% of it is weighted to the U.S. and North America.
But I think when you think about the growth that could come with that, it's probably a couple of points of growth, maybe 2.5 points of growth for the full year, which means it could be 5 points in the first half. So that's the magnitude we're talking about. And I think we'll see it start to evolve in Q1, but it might be more heavily weighted to Q2 because POS just seems really robust in Q1 at this stage."

We were very fortunate that we were able to really -- first of all, we started the year with a really solid inventory position, both in the company and in the channels, or at least the North American channels where the demand really spiked.
And so that was helpful because it was kind of a strange situation. But it got into May, and we were looking at POS that was starting to skyrocket and the orders were not coming in from the channel. And so we ended up building quite a bit of inventory starting in May -- actually over $500 million of inventory we built to serve POS demand that was occurring. And we had to kind of bet that the POS was going to continue at that rate, and it did. And that enabled us to really get ahead of the situation so that we've been -- now if you look at this point in time, we're essentially serving the POS and have been for 2 quarters now. And we're able to do that. Our end users continue to be very, very robust in buying tools. And our channel partners would like more. They would like their inventory restored. And that is the challenge. 
And so one of the things that we've done and we were also very fortunate from this standpoint of -- our made -- our make where you sell campaign that we've been working on for 3 or 4 years had some pretty significant capacity additions both in Mexico and in North America and in the U.S. And a number of those are either online or coming online, including a major plant in Mexico and a major plant in the U.S. in -- later in 2021.
And so as we look forward, we're not counting on those to necessarily get the inventories back to where they need to be in the channels, but we are looking forward to the fact that we will have more capacity in the system, significantly more capacity as we get into 2021. So we're not too concerned about that.
And in the meantime, there's a tremendous amount of inefficiency that's been built into our cost of goods sold here in the second, third and fourth quarters, especially the third and fourth quarters, where in order to meet the fill rate objectives and keep the inventories at the levels that we've been able to, we've done a lot of heroic things that have been costly, things like air freight and expediting and items of that nature. And those items ultimately will be relieved, I think, to some extent, by the capacity coming online in the future.
And -- but in the meantime, they're kind of built into the run rate. You can see the margins are -- even with those inefficiencies are pretty good. And we have really pushed our supply chain hard to serve our customers thus far, and it's been successful as you can see."

I have to say it's an exciting day for us here at Stanley Black & Decker. Today, we have the opportunity to report an outstanding start to 2021, highlighted by record revenue and EPS and many other accomplishments. These powerful results were backed by strong markets and excellent operational execution, which supports our improved outlook for the year. And thank you to our 53,000 employees around the globe who delivered these results by maintaining focus on our pandemic era of priorities. The priorities of employee health and safety, serving our customers with continuous operations and doing our part to help our communities mitigate the impact of the virus have served us extraordinarily well this past year. 
First quarter revenues were up 34% to $4.2 billion versus prior year. Each of our segments and regions contributed to deliver an all-time record 31% organic growth. Our Tools & Storage business continued on its extraordinary growth trajectory with 45% organic growth. Yes, 45% growth in the quarter. All regions and business units contributed to the performance with blazing hot markets across the globe, led by a confluence of positive factors. 
Vibrant markets and secular trends, including the consumers' reconnection with the home and garden, e-commerce and outdoor electrification in concert with our ubiquitous channel strategy, and an intense focus on supply chain execution enabled a strong business growth. 
Our portfolio of iconic brands such as DEWALT, Craftsman and Stanley in combination with industry-leading innovation, has proven to consistently deliver ongoing gains in market share at the POS level and now at the sell-in level as well. The Tool's first quarter performance is an outstanding example of what this powerful combination can deliver. Industrial organic growth was 6% as we've seen a strong double-digit recovery in automotive, general industrial and attachment tool end markets, along with share gains. This was partially muted by continued market declines in aerospace and oil and gas. 
And for security, 1% organic growth was in line with our expectations given the many restrictions placed on our installation and service techs. We've made continual progress with our digital health and safety product offerings and the security business transformation to a data-enabled technology provider is accelerating. We are excited about the full potential of these opportunities to support revenue growth throughout the year. 
And there was great news regarding our operating margin rate as well. The rate for the quarter was 17.6%, up 760 basis points from the prior year, with volume leverage, productivity, cost control, price and margin resiliency all contributing. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was another all-time record at $3.13, up 161% over prior year. And both our operating cash flow and free cash flow were each about $240 million higher than in the same period in 2020, a year in which the company generated a record $1.7 billion in free cash flow. All-in, an impressive first quarter and a strong start to 2021. This great performance in the sustained market recovery through April. has given us more visibility into the second quarter and to some extent, the back half as well. 
As a result, our point of view for 2021 and momentum going into 2022 has significantly improved since I outlined our initial observations during our January earnings call. 
First, as you can see, tools remains on a role in addition to all the positives already mentioned. The Pro is back in full force and the commercial and industrial markets are hot as well. Europe is far stronger previously imaginable, given many countries are still bogged down in lockdowns and the emerging markets are blazing, We are clearly benefiting from secular trends that have been amplified and accelerated by the pandemic. 
We're also benefiting from the extraordinary efforts of our people to manage the supply chain effectively amidst numerous challenges, including parts availability, among others. 
With that said, many of our retail partners would like to replenish their inventories as our current production levels are basically serving their point-of-sale growth. 
In this regard, we recently have begun production in 2 new factories in Mexico. And an additional one in Fort Worth, Texas will be up and running in a matter of weeks. Our current view is that this will enable the approximate 4-week channel inventory rebuild to occur in the back half of this year. The secular surge in global DIY, driven by the consumers' reconnection with the home and garden continues to be a key demand driver across our global markets. The massive shift to e-commerce continues, and we achieved nearly 100% growth in this growing channel during the quarter. 
The electrification of the outdoor product market is accelerating just as we have launched a significant number of new products and increased listings. We now expect this business to reach $900 million in 2021, up approximately $250 million versus last year. We are already benefiting from our multiyear relationship with MTD and our option to acquire the remaining 80% at a very attractive 7 to 8x EBITDA multiple with a window that opens in July of this year. 
Our success comes from building a position as the world's leading tool company that can attract diverse world-class talent. An array of iconic brands, market-leading innovation, immense category, breadth and depth and a passion to serve our customers' shareholders and other stakeholders. 
In this regard, I would like to underscore a key point. We are gaining share and making bold investments to widen our lead in the future. And as it relates to profitability, we, once again, delivered significant gross margin and operating margin expansion and are continuing to perform at historically strong levels. At this point, all temporary cost actions have been restored, and we are making significant investments, as I said, We have incorporated increased inflation into our outlook, and we are taking aggressive actions to protect our margins in 2021, 2022, and Lee will review those in a few moments. 
Additionally, our tech-enabled margin resiliency program will support our margin rates. 
And finally, the market rebounds across automotive, general industrial and attachment end markets and security continued. We remain optimistic that this will continue and the potential for increased global infrastructure spend could enable further gains across the portfolio. 
So in summary, we have high conviction in our prospects for growth, supported by our catalyst, the positive trends I outlined, benefiting our markets and cyclical recoveries across the businesses. As a result, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $10.70 to $11 per share. This represents a significant update from our securities -- previous guidance. 
The revised midpoint of $10.85 now reflects a 20% increase versus prior year, with a total company organic growth at 11% to 13% for the year. And as you can see, there's a lot to be excited about in what lies ahead of us in terms of significant opportunities for value creation. 
And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan to cover the first quarter and our updated 2021 guidance."

I am pleased to report on the business segment results that contributed to our exceptional start to 2021.

I am pleased to report on the business segment results that contributed to our exceptional start to 2021. 
Tools & Storage delivered 48% revenue growth with volume up 42% and price and currency each contributing an additional 3 points, resulting in 45% organic growth for the first quarter. 
In addition, the operating margin rate for the segment was 21.4%, up 990 basis points versus the prior year. This is the result of the team's relentless focus on margin excellence, and strong operational performance. Volume, price, productivity and cost control were the main drivers of this expansion. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher costs in supply chain, such as expediting product via airfreight to serve the incredibly strong demand as well as new growth investments to support share gains in the future. 
On a geographic basis, we had incredibly strong organic growth and market share gains across all regions, up 41% in North America, 47% in Europe and 67% in emerging markets. This performance was driven by our industry-leading innovation, strong professional demand and the ongoing trends from secular shifts related to e-commerce, outdoor product electrification and the consumers' reconnection with the home and garden. 
The U.S. retail channel delivered 48% organic growth as underlying consumer demand remained elevated with continued momentum from professional and DIY users. 
Additionally, our omnichannel and e-tailer e-commerce platforms nearly doubled in the first quarter, which further reinforces our conviction behind the additional investments we are making to capture this accelerating opportunity. 
Point-of-sale growth for the quarter remained exceptionally strong and consistent with the high end of our forecasted Q1 range. Retailer inventories remained relatively in line with Q4 2020 levels. So the anticipated increase in store inventories of approximately 4 to 5 weeks is now expected to occur in the back half of the year. 
The North American commercial and industrial tool channels are continuing to experience positive sequential trends with growth in the mid-30s versus low single-digit decline in Q4 2020. 
Pure-play construction focus customers within these channels were up close to 40%, more than 2x the mid-teens growth we experienced last quarter. A resounding signal that the Pro is back and demand is clearly accelerating in this space. 
Also, with the recent positive trends in North American industrial manufacturing activity, our MRO customer base rebounded this quarter as well, posting growth in the high 20s as compared to double-digit decline in the fourth quarter. 
Now shifting to Europe. The European tools business realized impressive share gains across all regions driven by the rapid acceleration of e-commerce as well as a retail channel strength This performance was led by more than 80% organic growth in the U.K. While France, Central Europe, the Nordics, Italy and Iberia were all up over 30%. 
Finally, the momentum in emerging markets continued to accelerate with strong construction-related demand in addition to impressive traction in e-commerce. Latin America was up 77% organically, with all countries up over 50% and led by an outstanding 86% growth in Brazil. Asia delivered 62% organic growth with China and India both at least doubling in size, South Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam all grew in excess of 50%. While Japan, Thailand and Indonesia, each posted strong double-digit growth for the quarter. Russia and Turkey remained strong, delivering 52% and 89% growth, respectively. Those numbers are absolutely crazy, but they're wonderful. So let's turn our attention to tools and storage SBUs after reviewing the fantastic geographic revenue performance. 
Power Tools delivered 50% organic growth, which was the result of continued momentum from the positive home and construction trends as well as sharp commercial and supply chain execution combined with new product launches. 
New core innovations led the way, building upon our strength with Craftsman, the fastest-growing brand in the industry; and DEWALT, the largest professional tool brand in the world as measured by total revenue. We built these positions with industry-leading innovation, launching products such as FLEXVOLT, Atomic, Extreme, POWERDETECT and FLEXVOLT ADVANTAGE all within the last 5 years. These products are delivering growth well ahead of the SBU average and are positioned for our Pro users. To further highlight positive professional demand, FLEXVOLT grew over 80% in the quarter. 
This quarter and moving ahead, we are providing more top line disclosure for our Outdoor Products business, particularly as it increases importance as a growth catalyst and with our option to purchase the remaining 80% of MTD opening midyear. I am pleased to report it was a record-breaking start to the season with organic growth in excess of 120%. This performance was driven by the incremental listing wins we covered last quarter, and leveraging cordless innovations under the Black & Decker, Craftsman and DEWALT brands. All of our major retailers participated in this explosive growth. It is exciting to see our new products at the market and early season reads on sell-through are very positive. This is a major growth margin and ESG opportunity as we shape the conversion to electrification and bring our coreless capabilities to the outdoor equipment market. We could not be more excited about this industry and the growth potential it creates for our company over the next several years. 
Finally, hand tolls, accessories and storage grew [ 3% ] organically as market rebounds and new product introductions fueled the growth. We continue to innovate in our key construction, auto and industrial markets, We are seeing new product momentum, including a variety of craftsman and DEWALT plastic and metal storage solutions as well as robust growth in new DEWALT tape measures and accessories. 
So in summary, there are a few points I want to reinforce related to our Tools & Storage business. One, we continue to leverage an industry-leading position. The team has built this position over time, and it is supported by our innovation, brands, category breadth, operational excellence and focus on keeping our customers and end users at the center of what we do. 
Two, this is a global phenomena. The powerful trends that we are harnessing for growth are not unique to 1 geography. And three, this is fueled and enabled by the dedication, passion and agility of our people. The business delivered the largest first quarter in history as it relates to sales, profits and margin rate, and the execution was superb. 
Thank you to the entire team for a job well done. I am excited about the possibility of record-breaking performances continuing into future quarters. Well done, Tools team. 
Moving to Industrial. This segment delivered 11% total revenue growth, which includes 6%, volume; 3%, currency; and 3% from the CAM acquisition. This was partially offset by 1 point from an oil and gas product line divestiture. 
Segment organic growth continued to improve sequentially with positive 6% growth in the quarter. The operating margin reached 15.9%, an increase of 270 basis points versus prior year as the benefits from volume, productivity and cost reductions were only partially offset by new investments. 
Looking further within this segment, Engineered Fastening revenues were up 9% organically as we continue to see improving automotive and industrial end markets. Automotive fasteners were up 16%, outpacing global life vehicle production by approximately 500 basis points. This was held back somewhat as we moved through the quarter and navigated OEM disruptions due to their supply shortages. Our Automotive Systems business was up 17%, a very good sign that capital spending is improving with our automotive OEMs. 
Growth within industrial fasteners turned positive this quarter, delivering low double-digit growth, driven by the continued momentum in global manufacturing and industrial activity, combined with a modest impact from customer inventory increases. 
Infrastructure organic revenues were down 2%. However, attachment tools had 16% growth as demand increased from OEMs and independent dealers. This was more than offset by significantly reduced pipeline construction activity, which resulted in a 30% decline in oil and gas. 
Shifting to security. Total revenue was up 2%, with a 4-point positive impact from currency, while price and acquisitions each contributed 1 point. This was partially offset by a 4-point decline related to the international divestitures completed in the third quarter of last year. 
Overall, North America was flat organically as growth from health and safety offerings within automatic doors and health care were offset by lower installations within commercial electronic security. The field organization continues to experience productivity challenges as our customers slowly reopen and allow more on-site access. European organic growth was up 4% as new data-driven product solutions supported 17% growth in France and 4% in the Nordics. France, in particular, has embraced the technology transformation we ignited in this business in 2019 and is experiencing the growth that we believe is possible across the entirety of commercial electronic security. 
Our new solutions in health and safety continue to build momentum, contributing approximately 2 points of growth in the quarter. The positive secular trends and underlying demand once again proved resilient in these markets despite incremental lockdowns due to the pandemic. The bid and quote activity for these new solutions continues to build. And that, combined with the executable backlog at record highs gives us confidence that security is set up to deliver strong organic growth for the remainder of 2021. 
Overall security segment profit rate, excluding charges at 8.5%, up 10 basis points versus the prior year as price and cost control was partially offset by the impact from growth investments related to our SaaS solutions, touchless door technology and other health and safety options. 
I would now like to turn it over to Lee McChesney, who is our VP of Corporate Finance and CFO for Tools & Storage. Many of you know Lee from investor conferences over the last year, and he will now walk you through the cash flow for the quarter and our game plan to tackle inflation. Lee?"

Moving to Slide 7. I will now review our free cash flow performance. Free cash flow improved $242 million versus prior year behind the strong operational performance and earnings growth. Now please keep in min",495,"Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 7. I will now review our free cash flow performance. Free cash flow improved $242 million versus prior year behind the strong operational performance and earnings growth. 
Now please keep in mind that our free cash flow outflow in the first quarter is in line with normal working capital seasonality, which was somewhat amplified by the strong demand to start the year and as compared to a historically slower period for the business. Working capital balances also are higher than prior year as we work to serve the strong demand as well as improve the inventory positions for us and our customers. 
Now despite the higher balances, working capital turns hit 7.1%, a 1-point churn improvement versus prior year. We remain confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation for the year, inclusive of CapEx investments to support further growth. We will continue to drive working capital efficiency across the company in combination with a strong earnings performance. 
I'd now like to give you a quick update on commodity inflation. As many of you follow, steel and resin represent the 2 largest commodity exposures and they have been impacted by rapid spot market increases as a global supply chain response to the surge of demand and temporary supply gaps. This dynamic has occurred across many of our key commodities, components, finished goods that we purchased. We now expect inflation headwinds to approximate $235 million, which is up $160 million versus our previous outlook of $75 million. 
Currency, however, remains a $45 million positive offset to this cost pressure. The drivers of the incremental inflation are steel, resins, copper, aluminum and some purchase materials such as batteries and electrical components. 
And as a reminder, we generally lock in our supply agreements 1 to 2 quarters in advance, and this pressure has to work its way through inventory. And therefore, the majority of this year-over-year headwinds will be realized in the second half of the year. 
In response, we are initiating additional pricing and productivity actions, which will partially offset the 2021 impact of the headwinds as well provide a significant carryover benefits into 2022. We believe these actions can offset about 1/3 to 1/2 of the $160 million incremental headwinds and have included that assumption in our guidance. 
Additionally, we continue to have approximately $100 million of margin resiliency available over the rest of the year, which is not included in our guidance today. This will act as an additional contingency to help us offset any incremental headwinds that may materialize or support a better margin outcome for the full year. 
We are remaining agile in our response to inflation and are leveraging the SBD operating model to continue to deliver the strong margin levels we've established in full year 2020 and implied in our guidance for 2021. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Don, who will walk you through our updated guidance."

I will now outline the organic growth assumptions for both the second quarter and full year. We expect second quarter organic revenue growth to approximate 30% for the company. In 2Q, we expect the Tools & Storage busine",987,"Thanks, Lee. Turning to Slide 9. I will now outline the organic growth assumptions for both the second quarter and full year. We expect second quarter organic revenue growth to approximate 30% for the company. 
In 2Q, we expect the Tools & Storage business to grow 35% to 40% with continued strength across all regions and channels. We are planning for industrial to grow in the mid- to high teens with continued momentum in industrial fasteners, end markets and attachment tools. Automotive will continue to show growth on the easier comps but we have incorporated moderated demand levels versus Q1, acknowledging the OEM supply constraints in the industry. 
Finally, aerospace and oil and gas are expected to remain depressed, partially offsetting the stronger growth expectations in other areas of this segment. 
Turning to security, we expect low double-digit growth in the second quarter. We plan for revenue levels to improve sequentially as we will benefit from increased access to customer sites to execute on the record backlog from the first quarter. 
Shifting to the full year, we are raising the total company growth range to 11% to 13%, with upward revisions in Tools & Storage and Industrial. Our confidence of growing market demand in Tools & Storage continues to strengthen. We are raising the Tools & Storage our organic growth expectations to 14% to 16% versus our prior estimate of 4% to 8% for the full year. 
Both the first and second half assumptions improved. The first half assumption is based on stronger visibility to Q2 demand combined with the outstanding Q1 performance. 
The second half assumption includes the benefit from increases in channel inventory back to historical levels. 
Despite the improvement, we are assuming a decline between 2% to 4% in the back half, acknowledging the tough comps. This represents growth of 12% to 16% versus 2019 and is a reasonable 2-year growth assumption given the strong market recovery occurring. However, we are preparing the supply chain for stronger demand areas. And we will be ready should our planning assumption prove to be conservative, which is very -- which it very well could be given current global demand trends. 
The industrial outlook improved to 4% to 6% for 2021 as we have better visibility to industrial and attachment tool market recoveries. We have built in the expected automotive customer supply chain constraints into our view. 
And then finally, aerospace and oil gas will continue to be a significant headwind. Right now, our view is that these markets will remain depressed for 2021, but become an upside opportunity next year. 
Last week -- lastly, we are maintaining our security organic growth assumption at 4% to 6% for the full year. The record backlog in commercial electronic security is encouraging and coupled with our data and technology-based product offerings and health and safety solutions, we are optimistic that the growth can accelerate throughout the remainder of the year. 
Now I'll summarize the remaining guidance assumptions on Slide 10. We are raising and narrowing the 2021 adjusted EPS outlook to reflect the exceptional start to the year and improved demand outlook across most of our businesses. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $10.15 to $10.55 inclusive of various onetime charges related to facility moves deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. 
On an adjusted basis, we are increasing the EPS outlook from a $9.70 to $10.30 range, up to a $10.70 a range. At the midpoint, this is an increase of $0.85 versus the prior guide and a 20% EPS growth versus the prior year. 
The drivers for improving adjusted EPS are outlined on the right-hand side of the slide, walking from the $10 midpoint from our January guidance, incremental pricing and volume net of incremental growth investments along with margin resiliency and other actions contribute approximately $1.50. This is partially offset by commodity inflation headwinds of approximately $0.80.
 In addition, we are planning to call our Series C preferred stock and the elimination of the preferred dividend adds a $0.15 benefit to 2021, bringing us to the current adjusted EPS midpoint of $10.85 million. 
Demand variability that I covered earlier remains as the primary driver beyond the adjusted EPS. We have also disclosed our current year our current full year assumptions for the significant below-the-line items and our expectation for the pretax M&A and other charges to assist with your modeling. 
Additionally, the company is reiterating free cash flow to approximate GAAP net income. 
And lastly, we expect second quarter's adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 25% of the full year performance. 
So in summary, we expect 11% to 13% organic growth and approximately 18% to 22% adjusted EPS expansion for the company in 2021, a very healthy EPS expansion for the year. You had a balanced view recognizing the dynamic operating environment. As I said earlier, we are preparing for the potential for higher market demand beyond this guidance view. And As Lee mentioned, have $100 million of margin resiliency not included in our guidance as a contingency to drive better performance or withstand new volatility. 
From a capital allocation point of view, we are very well positioned and have excellent flexibility due to our current cash position and leverage ratios. Therefore, we can retire the preferred stock mentioned earlier, and react accordingly if our stock price trend presents an opportunity in the short term while staying on track with our expected timing of MTD later this year or early next. We are confident that we have positioned the company to deliver above-market organic growth with operating leverage, strong free cash flow generation and top quartile shareholder returns over the long term, all while maintaining the safety of our employees and continuing to assist in our communities. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks."

As we look to the future, our portfolio is uniquely positioned to benefit from these trends, several of which have been accelerated and amplified by the pandemic, the consumer reconnection with Home and Garden, e-commerce, electrification and health and safety. We are capitalizing on this opportunity by funding innovation commercial and capacity investments to support continued organic growth and share gains.

I'll start with that, and then Lee will probably add a little color, too. Yes, I mean, we're at $2.35 for inflation and the impact this year, up about $160 million from what we said back in January.

Yes, I mean, we're at $2.35 for inflation and the impact this year, up about $160 million from what we said back in January. I would say this is a very volatile environment right now, and it really depends on where the demand goes in the back half of the year. I do believe as the year progresses and we get closer to July, it's difficult to have a material impact in the current year if inflation continues to increase. 
That being said, there's been a few positive trends in some of these commodities in the last 2 or 3 weeks where it appears to be stabilizing. So 2 or 3 weeks does not make a trend. But it's something that at least is encouraging in the sense that maybe this is starting to modulate a little bit. But it will be 1 of the more volatile things that we'll have to manage. 
Now the good news is that I do believe we will be managing through a very strong demand market for the remainder of the year, most likely into next year as well. And so that clearly is a benefit associated with inflation. We are aggressively underway of focus on pricing actions across the 2 major businesses where this impact, which is obviously Tools & Storage and Industrial. 
Tools & Storage will do what they typically do, which is a very surgical approach focused on areas that we think pricing does not impact demand in a significant way. And so we will manage through that dynamic with our customers as we always do. And I think we'll have a pretty good success rate. 
Industrial actually is an area that we feel better about. We feel like we have good processes in place. We've already got price actions that we've taken in the last 30 days, and we will likely take some more in the next 90 days in those particular businesses. But we feel like that is well under control, and the industrial team has been very focused on that. 
So I think the area of interest that we're all going to be watching is making sure we get the right impact in pricing in the Tools & Storage business. 
Now that being said, we do what we normally do to manage through this dynamic, which is in the short term, we're looking at other areas of productivity We look at margin resiliency, our contingency to help offset that if needed. And we're optimistic as we go through the year that we will find a way to navigate this headwind and be able to offset it completely. Right now, as Lee said, we think we're more like 1/3 to 50% at this stage. But as the next 3 months go by, I think we're going to make more progress in that regard. Anything you'd add, Lee?"

And so for the full year, our operating margin rate will be up modestly year-over-year. 
When you look at the big drivers of that, clearly, a large part of that is in our Tools business because that's where a large part of the commodity headwind is focused at this stage. And so for the second quarter, Tools should down 19%, maybe a little bit better 19% than 19%. And in the back half, it will be around 17% to 17.5% margins. And so we look at that and we say that's just slightly below our 18% to 20% range that we laid out there, and we just want to remind everybody that range wasn't necessarily applicable for every single quarter. It was more about an annual performance and a long-term performance as well. 
And so for the year, we would expect the Tools operating margin rate to be somewhere between 18.5% and 19% and -- which would be a significant increase over last year's margin rate of 18.3%."

Batteries, I think we have pretty much solved the problem that if the second half growth accelerates beyond the guidance, first of all, were good at the guidance level. And we're only talking about would upside ever be constrained. Batteries no issue. I made a trip to Asia, specifically to free up battery capacity for the second half and we're successful in that regard. So batteries are no issue, and it just comes down to semiconductors and how many hundreds of millions of dollars of more upside versus what's in the guidance as it relates to revenue can we achieve before we start running into shortages and we're working on that issue as well, and we think we have some ability to make headway on that in that regard as well."

And at that time, e-commerce was 0 or close to 0, just a smidge. And year after year after year, we worked hard developing that channel after the merger. And last year, we were up in the almost $1.8 billion of revenue. And not only did we do it with the major e-commerce player in the United States, but we did it systematically around the globe. And so pretty much everywhere you look, we have deep relationships with the big B2B, B2C players. And a flourishing business. And that channel shift that occurred last year when the percent of revenue went from 12% to 18% in Tools was truly remarkable. And now almost 2x e-commerce growth in the first quarter, that $1.7 billion plus business has incredibly strong prospects globally for this year. And instead of resting on our laurels and just enjoying that advantage because we share about a 3:1 relative market share advantage in that channel globally. Instead of resting on laurels, we have taken a really significant investments in this channel beginning in the fourth quarter, third, fourth quarter of last year and then accelerating into 2021. To the extent that we now have big teams of people working on this project. B2B, B2C around the globe as well as we're starting to go in markets where we are under-indexed. 
So take, for example, China, India and Germany, and we are investing in B2C capability, and we'll be doing a lot in that regard because those channels are so difficult to penetrate, given the existing share positions of the players that are out there today. So I would say that the share gains are coming from the major power tools players and other tools -- and then maybe in hand tools, it's where the miner, the more local players. And I think that's going to continue. We'll see how the e-commerce investments grow in the industry over time, and I would expect them to. But right now, we have a big first mover advantage, and we are pressing the accelerator to the floor to make sure that we sustain that advantage for as long as possible."

And so they're ahead of the rest of the business in the geographies of electronic security, and they've been aggressively rolling this out, and they've used the pandemic as an opportunity to work with our customers, to help them with the areas I described, to ensure they achieve higher levels of productivity, they make better business decisions around -- in the case of -- if it's a retail operation, where the products are located in a store, when they do discounting and revenue and sales opportunities, et cetera. So this is a great pilot example of what the business can achieve. And then the North American business and the Nordics business, in particular, is gaining some traction in this space as well. They're probably 3 or 4 quarters behind where France is. But we really see this as an exciting opportunity to continue to transform the business and a great pilot as an example of what can be done."

And so I think that's the right way to think about it. The proof will be in the pudding, 2 to 3 quarters from now when we're able to look at what the actual GDP performance was and what the performance was for certain trends in the tool industry. But I believe that if you look at these rates right now, probably at least half of it is related to share gains, if not more."

So that the -- that's really the opportunity as we progress through the next 90 days, and we provide an update to all of you in July. Where are we at that stage? And I think that's the big opportunity in front of us, which leads a little bit into the first part of your question.that I personally ask Jim to comment on this as well because I know we had a strong point of view as well. I really think this is a robust market we're going to see for a while. And I think when you look at all the different dynamics that are happening in various geographies and the recovery coming out of the pandemic, people are still going to have a very intense focus on their homes because many of us will continue to work in a hybrid environment, even when we get back to an office on a part-time basis. So you want to have an environment at home that really is sufficient to meet the needs of both work and personal habits and behaviors. 
And then you have things like infrastructure, which are just massive bills across the globe. I mean we tend to talk about the U.S. as an area where there could be a potential large infrastructure investment. But there's a lot of other major countries really thinking about doing the same thing over the next 12 to 24 months. So you could see a significant influx into the economy from that as well, both in the U.S. and globally. 
So I sit here and wonder, is there really a dip coming in the next 6 to 12 months. And the more I think about it, the more I feel like that we're going to continue to see the strong demand and growth continue. Obviously, I don't think we're going 40% to 50% every quarter for the next 3 years. But I do think there's a path for growth for the next 2 to 3 years. Jim?"

But the only thing I would say is I think we're going to be able to solidify the base and then get back to a more normal kind of 5% to 10% kind of growth type environment after that. That's my best guess right now just based on everything I know about the secular trends, in particular, You think of what -- all the different things. We mentioned a number of them, but the resurgence of DIY, there's a whole generation of people now that have become familiar with DIY. We have a whole generation of people that are using Black & Decker and other Craftsman, other tools that will continue to add to their collections. We have the reconnection with Home & Garden that Don referenced. Outdoor seems to be -- the electrification seems to be taken off in a big way. And of course, we'll enjoy electrifying the small gas engine market when we do the MTD acquisition, which is in our planning assumptions for the second half of this year in terms of executing the option, and we don't know when that will close, and that closes not necessarily in our guidance. And then there's the urban exodus. There's a big article in the Wall Street Journal front page today about that. So this whole notion of gradual exodus from urban centers into suburban and rural areas, a tremendous amount of home improvement and home sales that go on as a result of that, and that is a generational thing as well and on and on and on. 
So I just believe the base is preservable. I think our forecast for the second half is on the conservative side. And in all likelihood, we'll see that base preserved in the second half in my view. But we have so many other uncertainties out there relative to inflation and other things that I think we took a very prudent approach to our guidance. We had a great increase and just the share gain in general of the company and our e-commerce share, which is definitely an ongoing phenomenon. 
So in balance, I think anybody is looking for a big contraction in 2022 is probably going to miss the boat, and we'll see."

I have to say it's an exciting day for us here at Stanley Black & Decker. Today, we have the opportunity to report an outstanding start to 2021, highlighted by record revenue and EPS and many other accomplishmen",1170,"Thanks, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. I have to say it's an exciting day for us here at Stanley Black & Decker. Today, we have the opportunity to report an outstanding start to 2021, highlighted by record revenue and EPS and many other accomplishments. These powerful results were backed by strong markets and excellent operational execution, which supports our improved outlook for the year. 
And thank you to our 53,000 employees around the globe who delivered these results by maintaining focus on our pandemic era priorities. The priorities of employee health and safety, serving our customers with continuous operations and doing our part to help our communities mitigate the impact of the virus, have served us extraordinarily well this past year. 
First quarter revenues were up 34% to $4.2 billion versus prior year. Each of our segments and regions contributed to deliver an all-time record 31% organic growth. Our Tools & Storage business continued on its extraordinary growth trajectory with 45% organic growth. Yes, 45% growth in the quarter. 
All regions and business units contributed to the performance with blazing hot markets across the globe, led by a confluence of positive factors. Vibrant markets and secular trends, including the consumers' reconnection with the home and garden, e-commerce and outdoor electrification in concert with our ubiquitous channel strategy and an intense focus on supply chain execution enabled a strong business growth. 
Our portfolio of iconic brands such as DEWALT, Craftsman and Stanley in combination with industry-leading innovation has proven to consistently deliver ongoing gains in market share at the POS level and now at the sell-in level as well. The Tools first quarter performance is an outstanding example of what this powerful combination can deliver. 
Industrial organic growth was 6% as we've seen a strong double-digit recovery in automotive, general Industrial and Attachment Tool end markets, along with share gains. This was partially muted by continued market declines in aerospace and Oil & Gas. And for Security, 1% organic growth was in line with our expectations given the many restrictions placed on our installation and service techs. 
We've made continual progress with our digital health and safety product offerings and the security business transformation to a data-enabled technology provider is accelerating. We are excited about the full potential of these opportunities to support revenue growth throughout the year. 
And there was great news regarding our operating margin rate as well. The rate for the quarter was 17.6%, up 760 basis points from the prior year, with volume leverage, productivity, cost control, price and margin resiliency all contributing. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was another all-time record at $3.13, up 161% over prior year. And both our operating cash flow and free cash flow were each about $240 million higher than in the same period in 2020, a year in which the company generated a record $1.7 billion in free cash flow. All-in, an impressive first quarter and a strong start to 2021. 
This great performance in the sustained market recovery through April has given us more visibility into the second quarter and to some extent, the back half as well. As a result, our point of view for 2021 and momentum going into 2022 has significantly improved since I outlined our initial observations during our January earnings call. 
First, as you can see, Tools remains on a roll. In addition to all the positives already mentioned, the pro is back in full force and the commercial and industrial markets are hot as well. Europe is far stronger previously imaginable, given many countries are still bogged down in lockdowns, and the emerging markets are blazing. We are clearly benefiting from secular trends that have been amplified and accelerated by the pandemic. 
We're also benefiting from the extraordinary efforts of our people to manage the supply chain effectively amidst numerous challenges, including parts availability, among others. With that said, many of our retail partners would like to replenish their inventories as our current production levels are basically serving their point-of-sale growth. 
In this regard, we recently have begun production in 2 new factories in Mexico, and an additional one in Fort Worth, Texas will be up and running in a matter of weeks. Our current view is that this will enable the approximate 4-week channel inventory rebuild to occur in the back half of this year. The secular surge in global DIY, driven by the consumers' reconnection with the home and garden continues to be a key demand driver across our global markets. The massive shift to e-commerce continues, and we achieved nearly 100% growth in this growing channel during the quarter. 
The electrification of the outdoor product market is accelerating just as we have launched a significant number of new products and increased listings. We now expect this business to reach $900 million in 2021, up approximately $250 million versus last year. We are already benefiting from our multiyear relationship with MTD and our option to acquire the remaining 80% at a very attractive 7 to 8x EBITDA multiple with a window that opens in July of this year. 
Our success comes from building a position as the world's leading tool company that can attract diverse world-class talent, an array of iconic brands, market-leading innovation, immense category breadth and depth and a passion to serve our customers' shareholders and other stakeholders. In this regard, I would like to underscore a key point. 
We are gaining share and making bold investments to widen our lead in the future. And as it relates to profitability, we, once again, delivered significant gross margin and operating margin expansion and are continuing to perform at historically strong levels. At this point, all temporary cost actions have been restored, and we are making significant investments, as I said. We have incorporated increased inflation into our outlook, and we are taking aggressive actions to protect our margins in 2021, 2022, and Lee will review those in a few moments. Additionally, our tech-enabled margin resiliency program will support our margin rates. 
And finally, the market rebounds across automotive, general Industrial and Attachment end markets and Security continued. We remain optimistic that this will continue and the potential for increased global infrastructure spend could enable further gains across the portfolio. 
So in summary, we have high conviction in our prospects for growth, supported by our catalyst, the positive trends I outlined, benefiting our markets and cyclical recoveries across the businesses. As a result, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $10.70 to $11 per share. This represents a significant update from our securities -- previous guidance. 
The revised midpoint of $10.85 now reflects a 20% increase versus prior year, with a total company organic growth at 11% to 13% for the year. And as you can see, there's a lot to be excited about in what lies ahead of us in terms of significant opportunities for value creation. 
And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan to cover the first quarter and our updated 2021 guidance."

In addition, the operating margin rate for the segment was 21.4%, up 990 basis points versus the prior year. This is the result of the team's relentless focus on margin excellence, and strong operational performance. 
Volume, price, productivity and cost control were the main drivers of this expansion. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher costs in supply chain, such as expediting product via airfreight to serve the incredibly strong demand as well as new growth investments to support share gains in the future. 
On a geographic basis, we had incredibly strong organic growth and market share gains across all regions, up 41% in North America, 47% in Europe and 67% in emerging markets. This performance was driven by our industry-leading innovation, strong professional demand and the ongoing trends from secular shifts related to e-commerce, outdoor product electrification and the consumers' reconnection with the home and garden. 
The U.S. retail channel delivered 48% organic growth as underlying consumer demand remained elevated with continued momentum from professional and DIY users. Additionally, our omnichannel and e-tailored e-commerce platforms nearly doubled in the first quarter, which further reinforces our conviction behind the additional investments we are making to capture this accelerating opportunity.
Point-of-sale growth for the quarter remained exceptionally strong and consistent with the high end of our forecasted Q1 range. Retailer inventories remained relatively in line with Q4 2020 levels. So the anticipated increase in store inventories of approximately 4 to 5 weeks is now expected to occur in the back half of the year. 
The North American commercial and industrial tool channels are continuing to experience positive sequential trends with growth in the mid-30s versus low single-digit decline in Q4 2020. Pure-play construction-focused customers within these channels were up close to 40%, more than 2x the mid-teens growth we experienced last quarter, a resounding signal that the pro is back and demand is clearly accelerating in this space. Also, with the recent positive trends in North American industrial manufacturing activity, our MRO customer base rebounded this quarter as well, posting growth in the high 20s as compared to double-digit decline in the fourth quarter. 
Now shifting to Europe. The European tools business realized impressive share gains across all regions driven by the rapid acceleration of e-commerce as well as a retail channel strength. This performance was led by more than 80% organic growth in the U.K., while France, Central Europe, the Nordics, Italy and Iberia were all up over 30%. 
Finally, the momentum in emerging markets continued to accelerate with strong construction-related demand in addition to impressive traction in e-commerce. Latin America was up 77% organically, with all countries up over 50% and led by an outstanding 86% growth in Brazil. Asia delivered 62% organic growth with China and India both at least doubling in size. South Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam all grew in excess of 50%, while Japan, Thailand and Indonesia each posted strong double-digit growth for the quarter. Russia and Turkey remained strong, delivering 52% and 89% growth, respectively. Those numbers are absolutely crazy, but they're wonderful. 
So let's turn our attention to Tools & Storage SBUs after reviewing the fantastic geographic revenue performance. Power Tools delivered 50% organic growth, which was the result of continued momentum from the positive home and construction trends as well as sharp commercial and supply chain execution combined with new product launches. 
New core innovations led the way, building upon our strength with Craftsman, the fastest-growing brand in the industry; and DEWALT, the largest professional tool brand in the world as measured by total revenue. We built these positions with industry-leading innovation, launching products such as FLEXVOLT, ATOMIC, XTREME, POWERDETECT and FLEXVOLT ADVANTAGE, all within the last 5 years. These products are delivering growth well ahead of the SBU average and are positioned for our pro users. To further highlight positive professional demand, FLEXVOLT grew over 80% in the quarter. 
This quarter and moving ahead, we are providing more top line disclosure for our outdoor products business, particularly as it increases importance as a growth catalyst and with our option to purchase the remaining 80% of MTD opening midyear. I am pleased to report it was a record-breaking start to the season with organic growth in excess of 120%. This performance was driven by the incremental listing wins we covered last quarter, and leveraging cordless innovations under the Black & Decker, Craftsman and DEWALT brands. 
All of our major retailers participated in this explosive growth. It is exciting to see our new products hit the market and early season reads on sell-through are very positive. This is a major growth margin and ESG opportunity as we shape the conversion to electrification and bring our coreless capabilities to the outdoor equipment market. We could not be more excited about this industry and the growth potential it creates for our company over the next several years. 
Finally, Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage grew 28% organically as market rebounds and new product introductions fueled the growth. We continue to innovate in our key construction, auto and industrial markets. We are seeing new product momentum, including a variety of Craftsman and DEWALT plastic and metal storage solutions as well as robust growth in the new DEWALT tape measures and accessories. 
So in summary, there are a few points I want to reinforce related to our Tools & Storage business. One, we continue to leverage an industry-leading position. The team has built this position over time, and it is supported by our innovation, brands, category breadth, operational excellence and focus on keeping our customers and end users at the center of what we do. Two, this is a global phenomenon. The powerful trends that we are harnessing for growth are not unique to 1 geography. And three, this is fueled and enabled by the dedication, passion and agility of our people. 
The business delivered the largest first quarter in history as it relates to sales, profits and margin rate, and the execution was superb. Thank you to the entire team for a job well done. I am excited about the possibility of record-breaking performances continuing into future quarters. Well done, Tools team. 
Moving to Industrial. This segment delivered 11% total revenue growth, which includes 6%, volume; 3%, currency; and 3% from the CAM acquisition. This was partially offset by 1 point from an Oil & Gas product line divestiture. 
Segment organic growth continued to improve sequentially with positive 6% growth in the quarter. The operating margin reached 15.9%, an increase of 270 basis points versus prior year as the benefits from volume, productivity and cost reductions were only partially offset by new growth investments. 
Looking further within this segment, Engineered Fastening revenues were up 9% organically as we continue to see improving automotive and industrial end markets. Automotive fasteners were up 16%, outpacing global life vehicle production by approximately 500 basis points. This was held back somewhat as we moved through the quarter and navigated OEM disruptions due to their supply shortages. Our automotive systems business was up 17%, a very good sign that capital spending is improving with our automotive OEMs. 
Growth within industrial fasteners turned positive this quarter, delivering low double-digit growth, driven by the continued momentum in global manufacturing and industrial activity, combined with a modest impact from customer inventory increases. Infrastructure organic revenues were down 2%. However, Attachment Tools had 16% growth as demand increased from OEMs and independent dealers. This was more than offset by significantly reduced pipeline construction activity, which resulted in a 30% decline in oil and gas. 
Shifting to Security. Total revenue was up 2%, with a 4-point positive impact from currency, while price and acquisitions each contributed 1 point. This was partially offset by a 4-point decline related to the international divestitures completed in the third quarter of last year. 
Overall, North America was flat organically as growth from health and safety offerings within automatic doors and health care were offset by lower installations within commercial electronic security. The field organization continues to experience productivity challenges as their customers slowly reopen and allow more on-site access. 
European organic growth was up 4% as new data-driven product solutions supported 17% growth in France and 4% in the Nordics. France, in particular, has embraced the technology transformation we ignited in this business in 2019 and is experiencing the growth that we believe is possible across the entirety of commercial electronic security. 
Our new solutions in health and safety continue to build momentum, contributing approximately 2 points of growth in the quarter. The positive secular trends and underlying demand once again proved resilient in these markets despite incremental lockdowns due to the pandemic. The bid and quote activity for these new solutions continues to build. And that, combined with the executable backlog at record highs gives us confidence that security is set up to deliver strong organic growth for the remainder of 2021. 
Overall security segment profit rate, excluding charges was 8.5%, up 110 basis points versus the prior year as price and cost control was partially offset by the impact from growth investments related to our SaaS solutions, touchless door technology and other health and safety options. 
I would now like to turn it over to Lee McChesney, who is our VP of Corporate Finance and CFO for Tools & Storage. Many of you know Lee from investor conferences over the last year, and he will now walk you through the cash flow for the quarter and our game plan to tackle inflation. Lee?"
304977,709751311,2260485,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 7. I will now review our free cash flow performance. Free cash flow improved $242 million versus prior year behind the strong operational performance and earnings growth. Now please keep in min",495,"Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 7. I will now review our free cash flow performance. Free cash flow improved $242 million versus prior year behind the strong operational performance and earnings growth. 
Now please keep in mind that our free cash flow outflow in the first quarter is in line with normal working capital seasonality, which was somewhat amplified by the strong demand to start the year and as compared to a historically slower period for the business. Working capital balances also are higher than prior year as we work to serve the strong demand as well as improve the inventory positions for us and our customers. 
Now despite the higher balances, working capital turns hit 7.1%, a 1-point churn improvement versus prior year. We remain confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation for the year, inclusive of CapEx investments to support further growth. We will continue to drive working capital efficiency across the company in combination with a strong earnings performance. 
I'd now like to give you a quick update on commodity inflation. As many of you follow, steel and resin represent the 2 largest commodity exposures and they have been impacted by rapid spot market increases as a global supply chain responds to the surge of demand and temporary supply gaps. This dynamic has occurred across many of our key commodities, components, finished goods that we purchase. 
We now expect inflation headwinds to approximate $235 million, which is up $160 million versus our previous outlook of $75 million. Currency, however, remains a $45 million positive offset to this cost pressure. The drivers of the incremental inflation are steel, resins, copper, aluminum and some purchase materials such as batteries and electrical components. 
And as a reminder, we generally lock in our supply agreements 1 to 2 quarters in advance, and this pressure has to work its way through inventory. And therefore, the majority of these year-over-year headwinds will be realized in the second half of the year. 
In response, we are initiating additional pricing and productivity actions, which will partially offset the 2021 impact of the headwinds as well provide us significant carryover benefits into 2022. We believe these actions can offset about 1/3 to 1/2 of the $160 million incremental headwinds and have included that assumption in our guidance. 
Additionally, we continue to have approximately $100 million of margin resiliency available over the balance of the year, which is not included in our guidance today. This will act as an additional contingency to help us offset any incremental headwinds that may materialize or support a better margin outcome for the full year. 
We are remaining agile in our response to inflation and are leveraging the SBD operating model to continue to deliver the strong margin levels we've established in full year 2020 and implied in our guidance for 2021. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Don, who will walk you through our updated guidance."
304977,709751311,2260485,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lee. Turning to Slide 9. I will now outline the organic growth assumptions for both the second quarter and full year. We expect second quarter organic revenue growth to approximate 30% for the company. In 2Q, we expect the Tools & Storage business",988,"Thanks, Lee. Turning to Slide 9. I will now outline the organic growth assumptions for both the second quarter and full year. We expect second quarter organic revenue growth to approximate 30% for the company. In 2Q, we expect the Tools & Storage business to grow 35% to 40% with continued strength across all regions and channels. We are planning for industrial to grow in the mid- to high teens with continued momentum in industrial fasteners, end markets and Attachment Tools. 
Automotive will continue to show growth on the easier comps but we have incorporated moderated demand levels versus Q1, acknowledging the OEM supply constraints in the industry. Finally, aerospace and oil and gas are expected to remain depressed, partially offsetting the stronger growth expectations in other areas of this segment. 
Turning to Security, we expect low double-digit growth in the second quarter. We plan for revenue levels to improve sequentially as we will benefit from increased access to customer sites to execute on the record backlog from the first quarter. 
Shifting to the full year, we are raising the total company growth range to 11% to 13%, with upward revisions in Tools & Storage and Industrial. Our confidence of growing market demand in Tools & Storage continues to strengthen. We are raising the Tools & Storage organic growth expectations to 14% to 16% versus our prior estimate of 4% to 8% for the full year. 
Both the first and second half assumptions improved. The first half assumption is based on stronger visibility to Q2 demand combined with the outstanding Q1 performance. The second half assumption includes the benefit from increases in channel inventory back to historical levels. 
Despite the improvement, we are assuming a decline between 2% to 4% in the back half, acknowledging the tough comps. This represents growth of 12% to 16% versus 2019 and is a reasonable 2-year growth assumption given the strong market recovery occurring. However, we are preparing the supply chain for stronger demand scenarios. And we will be ready should our planning assumption prove to be conservative, which is very -- which it very well could be given current global demand trends. 
The Industrial outlook improved to 4% to 6% for 2021 as we have better visibility to Industrial and Attachment Tool market recoveries. We have built in the expected automotive customer supply chain constraints into our view. And then finally, aerospace and Oil & Gas will continue to be a significant headwind. Right now, our view is that these markets will remain depressed for 2021, but become an upside opportunity next year.
Last week -- lastly, we are maintaining our security organic growth assumption at 4% to 6% for the full year. The record backlog in commercial electronic security is encouraging and coupled with our data and technology-based product offerings and health and safety solutions, we are optimistic that the growth can accelerate throughout the remainder of the year. 
Now I'll summarize the remaining guidance assumptions on Slide 10. We are raising and narrowing the 2021 adjusted EPS outlook to reflect the exceptional start to the year and improved demand outlook across most of our businesses. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $10.15 to $10.55, inclusive of various onetime charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. 
On an adjusted basis, we are increasing the EPS outlook from a $9.70 to $10.30 range, up to a $10.70 to $11 range. At the midpoint, this is an increase of $0.85 versus the prior guide and a 20% EPS growth versus the prior year. The drivers for improved adjusted EPS are outlined on the right-hand side of the slide. 
Walking from the $10 midpoint from our January guidance, incremental pricing and volume net of incremental growth investments along with margin resiliency and other actions contribute approximately $1.50. This is partially offset by commodity inflation headwinds of approximately $0.80. In addition, we are planning to call our Series C preferred stock and the elimination of the preferred dividend adds a $0.15 benefit to 2021, bringing us to the current adjusted EPS midpoint of $10.85 million.  
Demand variability that I covered earlier remains as the primary driver beyond the adjusted EPS. We have also disclosed our current year -- our current full year assumptions for the significant below-the-line items and our expectation for the pretax M&A and other charges to assist with your modeling. 
Additionally, the company is reiterating free cash flow to approximate GAAP net income. And lastly, we expect second quarter's adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 25% of the full year performance. 
So in summary, we expect 11% to 13% organic growth and approximately 18% to 22% adjusted EPS expansion for the company in 2021, a very healthy EPS expansion for the year, yet a balanced view, recognizing the dynamic operating environment. As I said earlier, we are preparing for the potential for higher market demand beyond this guidance view and as Lee mentioned, have $100 million of margin resiliency not included in our guidance as a contingency to drive better performance or withstand new volatility. 
From a capital allocation point of view, we are very well positioned and have excellent flexibility due to our current cash position and leverage ratios. Therefore, we can retire the preferred stock mentioned earlier, and react accordingly if our stock price trend presents an opportunity in the short term while staying on track with our expected timing of MTD later this year or early next. We are confident that we have positioned the company to deliver above-market organic growth with operating leverage, strong free cash flow generation and top quartile shareholder returns over the long term, all while maintaining the safety of our employees and continuing to assist in our communities. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks."

And as you out there have seen and heard, we had a very strong start to the year as we delivered record organic growth, reflecting positive secular trends, vibrant markets and a strong array of growth catalysts. I am pleased with our team's continued efforts and excited about the enormous potential given the improved outlook and strong momentum we've built over the last 12 months. 
As we look to the future, our portfolio is uniquely positioned to benefit from these trends, several of which have been accelerated and amplified by the pandemic, the consumer reconnection with home and garden, e-commerce, electrification and health and safety. We are capitalizing on this opportunity by funding innovation, commercial and capacity investments to support continued organic growth and share gains. Additionally, our option to acquire the remaining stake in MTD in July has the potential to add up to $3 billion of revenue in 2022 and create an exciting multiyear runway for growth and significant EPS and cash flow accretion. 
Our passion for positive differentiated performance, becoming known as one of the world's most innovative companies and elevating our commitment to corporate social responsibility, ESG, has never been stronger and that is in the wake of 1,016% TSR delivery during the 20 years or so since I've held C-level positions in this company with support during that entire period from Don and Lee.

I'll start with that, and then Lee will probably add a little color, too. Yes, I mean, we're at $235 million for inflation and the impact this year, up about $160 million from what we've said back in January. I would say this is a very volatile",496,"Yes. Sure. I'll start with that, and then Lee will probably add a little color, too. Yes, I mean, we're at $235 million for inflation and the impact this year, up about $160 million from what we've said back in January. I would say this is a very volatile environment right now, and it really depends on where the demand goes in the back half of the year. I do believe as the year progresses and we get closer to July, it's difficult to have a material impact in the current year if inflation continues to increase. 
That being said, there's been a few positive trends in some of these commodities in the last 2 or 3 weeks where it appears to be stabilizing. So 2 or 3 weeks does not make a trend, but it's something that at least is encouraging in the sense that maybe this is starting to modulate a little bit. But it will be one of the more volatile things that we'll have to manage. 
Now the good news is that I do believe we will be managing through a very strong demand market for the remainder of the year, most likely into next year as well. And so that clearly is a benefit associated with inflation. We are aggressively underway of focus on pricing actions across the 2 major businesses where this impacts, which is obviously Tools & Storage and Industrial. 
Tools & Storage will do what they typically do, which is a very surgical approach, focused on areas that we think pricing does not impact demand in a significant way. And so we will manage through that dynamic with our customers as we always do. And I think we'll have a pretty good success rate. 
Industrial actually is an area that we feel better about. We feel like we have good processes in place. We've already got price actions that we've taken in the last 30 days, and we will likely take some more in the next 90 days in those particular businesses. But we feel like that is well under control, and the industrial team has been very focused on that. So I think the area of interest that we're all going to be watching is making sure we get the right impact in pricing in the Tools & Storage business. 
Now that being said, we do what we normally do to manage through this dynamic, which is in the short term, we're looking at other areas of productivity. We look at margin resiliency as our contingency to help offset that if needed. And we're optimistic as we go through the year that we will find a way to navigate this headwind and be able to offset it completely. Right now, as Lee said, we think we're more like 1/3 to 50% at this stage. But as the next 3 months go by, I think we're going to make more progress in that regard.

The commodity headwind is close to $200 million in the second half. So a large portion of that $235 million is hitting us in the second half, so -- which really is a good lead into your first part of your question, which I do think the operating margin for the company will be somewhere around 15%, maybe a little bit higher than 15%. In the back half, it will be somewhere between 14% and 14.5% depending on how -- where the demand goes and our success and really offsetting that headwind along the lines I described. 
And so for the full year, our operating margin rate will be up modestly year-over-year. When you look at the big drivers of that, clearly, a large part of that is in our Tools business because that's where a large part of the commodity headwind is focused at this stage. And so for the second quarter, Tools should be around 19%, maybe a little bit better 19% -- than 19%. And in the back half, it will be around 17% to 17.5% margins. 
And so we look at that and we say that's just slightly below our 18% to 20% range that we laid out there, and we just want to remind everybody that range wasn't necessarily applicable for every single quarter. It was more about an annual performance and a long-term performance as well. And so for the year, we would expect the Tools operating margin rate to be somewhere between 18.5% and 19% and -- which would be a significant increase over last year's margin rate of 18.3%."

Batteries, I think we have pretty much solved the problem that if the second half growth accelerates beyond the guidance -- first of all, we're good at the guidance level. And we're only talking about would upside ever be constrained. Batteries no issue. And I made a trip to Asia, specifically to free up battery capacity for the second half and we were successful in that regard. 
So batteries are no issue, and it just comes down to semiconductors and how many hundreds of millions of dollars of more upside versus what's in the guidance as it relates to revenue can we achieve before we start running into shortages and we're working on that issue as well, and we think we have some ability to make headway on that in that regard as well."

And at that time, e-commerce was 0 or close to 0, just a smidge. And year after year after year, we worked hard developing that channel after the merger. And last year, we were up in the almost $1.8 billion of revenue. And not only did we do it with the major e-commerce player in the United States, but we did it systematically around the globe. And so pretty much everywhere you look, we have deep relationships with the big B2B, B2C players and a flourishing business. 
And that channel shift that occurred last year when the percent of revenue went from 12% to 18% in Tools was truly remarkable. And now almost 2x e-commerce growth in the first quarter, that $1.7 billion plus business has incredibly strong prospects globally for this year. 
And instead of resting on our laurels and just enjoying that advantage -- because we share about a 3:1 relative market share advantage in that channel globally. Instead of resting on laurels, we have taken a really significant investments in this channel beginning in the fourth quarter, third, fourth quarter of last year and then accelerating into 2021 to the extent that we now have big teams of people working on this project. 
B2B2C around the globe as well as we're starting to go in markets where we are under-indexed. So take, for example, China, India and Germany, and we are investing in B2C capability, and we'll be doing a lot in that regard because those channels are so difficult to penetrate, given the existing share positions of the players that are out there today. 
So I would say that the share gains are coming from the major power tools players and other tools -- and then maybe in hand tools, it's where the minor -- the more local players. And I think that's going to continue. We'll see how the e-commerce investments grow in the industry over time, and I would expect them to. But right now, we have a big first mover advantage, and we are pressing the accelerator to the floor to make sure that we sustain that advantage for as long as possible."

And so they're ahead of the rest of the business in the geographies of electronic security, and they've been aggressively rolling this out. And they've used the pandemic as an opportunity to work with our customers, to help them with the areas I described, to ensure they achieve higher levels of productivity, they make better business decisions around -- in the case of -- if it's a retail operation, where their products are located in a store, when they do discounting and revenue and sales opportunities, et cetera. So this is a great pilot example of what the business can achieve. 
And then the North American business and the Nordics business in particular, is gaining some traction in this space as well. They're probably 3 or 4 quarters behind where France is. But we really see this as an exciting opportunity to continue to transform the business and a great pilot as an example of what can be done."

The proof will be in the pudding 2 to 3 quarters from now when we're able to look at what the actual GDP performance was and what the performance was for certain trends in the tool industry.

So that the -- that's really the opportunity as we progress through the next 90 days, and we provide an update to all of you in July. Where are we at that stage? And I think that's the big opportunity in front of us, which leads a little bit into the first part of your question that I personally asked Jim to comment on this as well because I know we had a strong point of view as well. 
I really think this is a robust market we're going to see for a while. And I think when you look at all the different dynamics that are happening in various geographies and the recovery coming out of the pandemic, people are still going to have a very intense focus on their homes because many of us will continue to work in a hybrid environment, even when we get back to an office on a part-time basis. So you want to have an environment at home that really is sufficient to meet the needs of both work and personal habits and behaviors. 
And then you have things like infrastructure, which are just massive [ builds ] across the globe. I mean, we tend to talk about the U.S. as an area where there could be a potential large infrastructure investment. But there's a lot of other major countries really thinking about doing the same thing over the next 12 to 24 months. So you could see a significant influx into the economy from that as well, both in the U.S. and globally. 
So I sit here and wonder, is there really a dip coming in the next 6 to 12 months? And the more I think about it, the more I feel like that we're going to continue to see the strong demand and growth continue. Obviously, I don't think we're going 40% to 50% every quarter for the next 3 years. But I do think there's a path for growth for the next 2 to 3 years. Jim?"

But the only thing I would say is I think we're going to be able to solidify the base and then get back to a more normal kind of 5% to 10% kind of growth type environment after that. That's my best guess right now just based on everything I know about the secular trends, in particular. You think of what -- all the different things. We mentioned a number of them, but the resurgence of DIY, there's a whole generation of people now that have become familiar with DIY. 
We have a whole generation of people that are using DEWALT, Black & Decker and other Craftsman, other tools that will continue to add to their collections. We have the reconnection with home and garden that Don referenced. Outdoor seems to be -- the electrification seems to be taking off in a big way. And of course, we'll enjoy electrifying the small gas engine market when we do the MTD acquisition, which is in our planning assumptions for the second half of this year in terms of executing the option. And we don't know when that will close, and that closes not necessarily in our guidance. 
And then there's the urban exodus. There's a big article in the Wall Street Journal front page today about that. So this whole notion of gradual exodus from urban centers into suburban and rural areas, there's a tremendous amount of home improvement and home sales that go on as a result of that, and that is a generational thing as well, and on and on and on. 
So I just believe the base is preservable. I think our forecast for the second half is on the conservative side. And in all likelihood, we'll see that base preserved in the second half in my view. But we have so many other uncertainties out there relative to inflation and other things that I think we took a very prudent approach to our guidance. We had a great increase and just the share gain in general of the company and our e-commerce share, which is definitely an ongoing phenomenon. 
So in balance, I think anybody that's looking for a big contraction in 2022 is probably going to miss the boat, and we'll see."

This morning, we announced a record second quarter, which capped off a historic performance over the last 12 months. Over this period, we have delivered $3.1 billion revenue growth, now at a $17 billion LTM run",1511,"Thanks, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced a record second quarter, which capped off a historic performance over the last 12 months. Over this period, we have delivered $3.1 billion revenue growth, now at a $17 billion LTM run rate, adjusted operating margins to new heights approaching 17%, Tools operating margins are in excess of 20%, and we added $2.9 billion of sales growth in Tools, including outdoor over the last 4 quarters. My team and I are proud of the collective effort of our 56,000 Stanley Black & Decker colleagues. We thank them for their resilience and dedication, their agility to cut through the many challenges associated with executing on this massive growth trajectory during the global pandemic. The way they have stepped up is impressive, taking care of customers, our people, our communities. It's a great story. 
Turning to the second quarter. Revenues were up 37% versus prior year to $4.3 billion. We achieved an all-time organic growth record of 33% and marked the first time all 3 segments as currently organized, achieved double-digit organic growth in the same quarter. The extraordinary organic growth of 41% in Tools demonstrated the power of the world's leading tool company with the best brands and innovation in the industry. All regions delivered robust double-digit growth and our strong commercial and supply chain execution enabled us to capitalize on the positive secular trends and strong markets. Industrial accelerated to 14% organic growth behind the second straight quarter of double-digit growth and share gains in our automotive, general industrial and attachment tool businesses as recoveries in these end markets are continuing. The growth would have been even more robust, if not for auto OEM production delays related to electronic component shortages and by a few continued cyclically depressed markets such as aerospace. 
Security had its strongest quarter in the last 10 years, delivering 14% organic growth. The Security businesses transformation to a data-enabled technology provider is accelerating, and the team successfully converted a strong backlog into revenue. Order rates were red hot in the quarter, up 36% and the ending executable backlog was at record levels. We're excited about the full potential of these opportunities to support elevated revenue growth in the back half and beyond. 
Our overall company adjusted operating margin rate remained strong at 15.5%, up 270 basis points from the prior year, with volume leverage, price, mix benefits from innovation and margin resiliency more than overcoming the cost of growth investments, commodity inflation and higher expedited transportation costs required to serve the strong demand in Tools. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was a second quarter record at $3.08, up 93% over prior year, and free cash flow for the quarter was $339 million, up 28% versus prior year and over $300 million better on a year-to-date basis than our record-setting 2020, a year in which free cash flow was $1.5 billion. 
On the heels of this great performance, we entered the second half with positive momentum and a portfolio that is well positioned to capitalize on the key trends that are driving growth. The consumer reconnection with home and garden, e-commerce, electrification and health and safety. We are investing in our businesses to capture these opportunities and enable sustained above-market growth with margin expansion. And to that end, we are raising our 2021 full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $11.35 to $11.65 per share, a 27% increase versus prior year at the midpoint. 
Finally, I'd also like to highlight that last week, we increased our dividend for the 54th consecutive year. The quarterly payout now stands at $0.79 a share, which represents a 13% increase. This is a reflection of the continued confidence we have in the cash generating power of the company. A strong growing dividend is a key element of our shareholder value proposition and is consistent with our capital deployment strategy to return approximately half of our excess capital to shareholders over the long term. Of course, repurchases are the other major vehicle we could employ to do that. And notably, our Board increased our repurchase authorization last quarter to 20 million shares, giving us the flexibility to do some of that as well. 
During our May Growth Summit broadcast,  we showcased several significant catalysts that represent opportunities for a long and rewarding growth runway for Stanley Black & Decker. These catalysts capitalize on key 2020 trends, many of which are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. We are expecting that the key market drivers across our global tools market markets will continue to be strong demand drivers and support tools growth for some time, including the secular surge in consumers' reconnection with the home and garden as well as the cyclical expansion in North America home improvement driven by new and existing home sales associated with household formation and the urban exodus. We are investing more than $200 million in innovation, e-commerce, sales and marketing and others, and we've never been better positioned to capitalize on market trends. 
Across the board, we have strategic differentiators that make us the world's leading tool company. Our iconic brands, DEWALT, Craftsman, Stanley, Stanley FatMax and Black & Decker, our category depth, channel development and operations excellence and a track record and commitment to market-leading innovation, our pipeline has never been stronger. We are expanding our cordless product offerings up and down the power spectrum to new users and product categories. With our FLEXVOLT, FLEXVOLT Advantage and DEWALT power detect platforms we are the industry leader in maximizing power output with plans to nearly double the number of products on these platforms over the next 3 years. Our ATOMIC and XTREME platforms leverage the smallest, most power dense, brushless motor technology in the industry, to deliver the highest power-to-weight ratio available in compact 20-volt and 12-volt platforms and will expand the product offering across these platforms roughly 4x over the coming years. These breakthrough products have already delivered significant share gains, and they're just getting started. 
The massive acceleration in the shift of demand to e-commerce was amplified during the pandemic, which was an enormous positive for us. We have approximately 3x the share in e-commerce as our next closest competitor, and we grew our global e-commerce business from 13% of Tool sales to 18% in a matter of 12 months, now about a $2 billion 
This shift to e-commerce is going to continue, and we are doubling down our investments in talent, digital capabilities and our brands, including the revitalization of Black & Decker, which is an iconic brand that has a license to play in the largest breadth of categories within our portfolio. We see a significant opportunity over the coming years as the team reimagines Black & Decker to drive it towards more youthful buyers as an e-commerce lifestyle brand. The increased focus on ESG and climate and what that means for electrification presents a very compelling multiyear opportunity for us as well. Our existing cordless outdoor power equipment business has grown over 70% in the first half of the year and an engineered fastening, the move from internal combustion engines to hybrid and EV platforms ultimately results in a 3x increase in content per vehicle. 
And lastly, the transformation of our Security business to become a technology-driven data solutions provider is gaining significant momentum, and the timing is excellent. The team has done a great job creating various solutions and products that are focused on health safety, which has never been more relevant as the world continues to battle the pandemic. In addition to these growth opportunities, we are gaining momentum with our margin resiliency program. We continue to find new applications and use cases to apply our technology-enabled approach that will deliver a runway for sustainable margin expansion in the coming years. 
And now a brief update on MTD. As many of you know, our option to acquire the remaining 80% of MTD opened up at the beginning of this month. This opportunity is exciting as we bring leading brands and capabilities in the electric outdoor category as well as the ability to deploy the SBD operating model and apply our global scale. MTD brings superb product engineering and manufacturing expertise in outdoor power equipment, capabilities in robotics technology as well as access to the independent dealer channel in outdoor. We were just at MTD's facilities in Valley City, Ohio, last week and came away even more energized by the pipeline for innovation and the runway for growth in 2022 and beyond. The strategic fit is hand in glove and the revenue and cost synergy opportunities are compelling. We are currently in negotiations with MTD on the option execution. And should they come to a successful conclusion and subject to all regulatory approvals, we will begin work on tackling this multiyear opportunity for growth and margin expansion upon closing. 
And now I'll hand it over to Don Allan to cover a few financial details on MTD, a more detailed discussion on second quarter results and offer up some 2021 guidance. Don?"
304977,1671716801,2351379,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Before we leave Slide 5, as Jim mentioned, I want to make a few remarks about some significant financial attributes related to to this exciting potential transaction. First, over the last 12 months ending June 3",1768,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Before we leave Slide 5, as Jim mentioned, I want to make a few remarks about some significant financial attributes related to to this exciting potential transaction. First, over the last 12 months ending June 30, MTD achieved revenue of approximately $2.5 billion. They have seen great traction on their Spotlight 10 initiative, and have improved their EBITDA rate from approximately 4.5% in 2018 to high single digits over this LTM period. 
As I referenced at Investor Day, MTD has worked tirelessly to meet the supply chain challenges brought about by the pandemic, including limited throughput on larger products as well as component and input shortages. However, this has muted their output in revenue over the last 12 months. We believe these are temporary and manageable disruptions that can improve with our application of the SBD operating model. Consistent with Investor Day and taking into account our recent diligence, we believe that a combined MTD and SBD outdoor platform can become a growth catalyst to deliver $200 million in organic growth per year over the medium term. 
Our planning assumption for 2022 continues to call for the addition of MTD. Assuming $2.6 billion in revenue and continued progress on OM expansion, we believe this could contribute approximately 9% adjusted EBITDA margin or just over $230 million in consolidated adjusted EBITDA in 2022. Considering the benefits of our 20% stake currently in our P&L and applying interest and intangible amortization assumptions, this would result in approximately $0.50 of incremental adjusted EPS accretion in 2022. With our pathway for growth and margin expansion, this EPS accretion increases to over $1 by 2025, a strong P&L result that also carries a robust year for cash flow return on investment in the high teens. 
I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the second quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 46% revenue growth with volume up 38%, currency up 5% and price contributing an additional 3 points. The operating margin rate for the segment was 20.2%, up 320 basis points versus prior year. Volume, price and benefits from innovation and productivity were partially offset by commodity inflation, higher expedited transit costs to serve stronger demand and new growth investments. The extraordinary Tools & Storage growth was realized across the globe again in Q2, with organic growth of 30% in North America, 63% in Europe and 85% in emerging markets. This performance was driven by the ongoing strong professional demand and robust levels of innovation across our brands. In addition to the continuation of the global penetration of e-commerce, outdoor product electrification and the consumers' reconnection with home and garden. 
We continue to see growth in share gain across our brick-and-mortar and e-commerce platforms in U.S. retail, with the channel up 22% organically in the second quarter. POS remained robust, and retailer inventories ended the quarter still below normalized levels. Professional products are leading the growth across the front half and the share gains are consolidating. The first half 2021 POS is up approximately 40% compared to 2019. The North American commercial and industrial tool channels once again experienced positive sequential trends accelerating to 68% organic growth. The growth was supported by strong professional-driven demand and positive trends in manufacturing and industrial production, while our company-specific digital efforts drove share gains with our Industrial customers. The European Tools business realized 63% organic growth, driven by an expansion in commercial, retail brick-and-mortar and e-commerce channels due to the strength of the industrial rebound coupled with professional construction demand. All regions contributed to double-digit growth and share gains were led by the U.K., France and Greece, which were up 130%, 73% and 67%, respectively. 
Finally, emerging markets was up over 85%, driven by higher construction-related demand. All markets contributed to share gains. Latin America was up 130% -- I'm sorry, 136% organically, with all countries at least doubling and Asia delivered 36% organic growth with at least double-digit growth across the region and India up nearly 3x. Russia and Turkey delivered another solid performance with organic growth of 78% and 114%, respectively. 
As highlighted at our May Growth Summit, our e-commerce initiative is a strategic growth driver for the business, and we are continuing to invest for further expansion. Second quarter global e-commerce revenue was up nearly 40% versus 2020, with a double-digit growth result from each region. 
Turning our attention to the Tools & Storage SBUs, all 3 SBUs had excellent contributions to the overall performance. Power Tools delivered 39% organic growth, benefiting from supportive markets and our growth catalysts. This was enabled by the relentless supply chain execution, combined with new and innovative product launches across Craftsman, Stanley FatMax and DEWALT. This includes an industry-leading breakthrough innovations such as DEWALT Power Detect, FLEXVOLT Advantage, Atomic and XTREME.  
DEWALT FLEXVOLT was our first breakthrough as many of you know, and was once again a leader in 2021. Under this brand, we are introducing a 15 amp-hour battery and the 60-volt SDS MAX 2-inch both of which will be world's first innovations. Our FLEXVOLT system is now up to 45 products and is forecasted to represent over $600 million in 2021 revenue. They remains a key growth driver and is a unique and advantaged platform that we continue to leverage. 
We are passionate about innovation, and the pipeline continues to be robust. Stay tuned as more breakthroughs are on the horizon for our power tool products. The outdoor products business grew 40% organically, with all regions contributing. This performance was driven by new listings and cordless innovations under the Black & Decker Craftsman and DEWALT brands. This also includes expanding our offering in walk behind mowers and pressure washers, leveraging our FLEXVOLT technology and the Black & Decker robotic mower launch in Europe. We continue to expand our cordless technology and other innovations to the outdoor electric category to drive growth and are very encouraged about the future product pipeline. 
Finally, hand tools, accessories and storage grew 42% organically, fueled by robust market demand and new product introductions. We launched the new DEWALT Tough series tape measures and hammers as well as brought new power tool accessories to the market. We are expanding our offering of new metal and plastic storage solutions across both Craftsman and DEWALT brands, in addition to further innovations across our key construction, auto and industrial markets. 
In summary, growth continues across the globe and within all 3 of the Tools & Storage SBUs. Equally as important, this growth comes with strong margin performance as a result of the team's continued resilience and disciplined price and supply chain execution. It was a fantastic performance for the Tools & Storage and outdoor teams. Thank you, both teams. 
Now turning to Industrial. This segment delivered 16% total revenue growth, which includes 13% volume, 3% currency and 1 point of price. This was partially offset by 1 point from an oil and gas product line divestiture. Segment organic growth improved sequentially with positive 14% growth in the quarter. The operating margin rate of 10.9% was an increase of 210 basis points versus the prior year. Benefits from volume, price and productivity were partially offset by commodity inflation, growth investments and trophy markets in oil and gas as well as aerospace. 
Looking further within this segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 26% as we continue to see improving automotive and industrial end markets. Our automotive fastener and system sales were up 63% organically. Our fastener organic growth significantly outpaced global light vehicle production and was up nearly 90% in the second quarter. Our automotive systems business was up 5%, the second consecutive quarter of growth and a position of improving OEM capital investment. 
At the segment level, we had an approximate 2-point negative revenue impact versus our second quarter plan from OEM semiconductor shortages, which disrupted vehicle production throughout the quarter. Industrial fasteners accelerated to 29% organic growth behind the continued recovery in global manufacturing and industrial activity. All regions contributed double-digit growth and realized share gains. The business solidly outpaced the global industrial production index. 
Aerospace fastener revenues continued to reduce by -- versus 2020 as they deal with very slow markets due to limited new planned production. However, the recovery is on the horizon and expected likely to begin in 2022. Infrastructure organic revenues were down 11%. Attachment Tools realized 16% growth, which was driven by increased OEM and independent dealer demand. Momentum continues to build in this market with strong backlogs and order rates at our OEM and independent dealer customers. However, there was more than an offset by the dramatic reduction in pipeline activity, which resulted in a 55% decline in oil and gas. This market is longer cycle as we know and is yet to see a recovery in new pipeline construction. 
Shifting to Security. Total revenue was up 16% with 13% organic volume, a 6-point positive impact from currency and a 1 point contribution from price. This was partially offset by a 5-point decline related to the international divestitures that we completed in the third quarter of last year. Overall, North America was up 16% organically, we continue to get better access to customer sites and we're able to convert our backlog within commercial electronic security. North America also benefited from strong growth within automatic doors and health care. European organic growth was up 12% as new data-driven product solutions supported gains in France and the Nordics. A strong performance considering that many of these markets still have pandemic-related restrictions impacting installations. Our new digital solutions continued to build momentum, contributing approximately 2 to 3 points of growth as the business continues to execute a required digital transformation. Overall, order rates grew 36% in the second quarter, and the quarter end executable backlog was a record high, which positions the business to deliver high single-digit organic growth for the remainder of 2021. Overall Security segment profit rate, excluding charges, was 8.5%, down 110 basis points versus the prior year rate as price and volume gains were more than offset by the inefficiencies related to pandemic restrictions, and the cost impact from growth investments such as SaaS solutions, touchless door technology and other health and safety options. We believe these inefficiencies will save when the pandemic reaches its final stages. And as the growth investments contribute larger revenue dollars, we will see the profitability rate of this business expand as well. Now I will turn the call to Lee McChesney to review cash flow and an update on material inflation, expedited transit costs and our price actions. Lee?"
304977,1671716801,2351379,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Don, and good morning. Moving to Slide 7, we will review cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $339 million, which brings our year-to-date performance to $93 million. The quarter and year-to-date improvements versus pr",489,"Thank you, Don, and good morning. Moving to Slide 7, we will review cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $339 million, which brings our year-to-date performance to $93 million. The quarter and year-to-date improvements versus prior year are predominantly driven by robust operational performance and earnings growth, and was partially offset by higher working capital and capital spending versus prior year. We are investing in working capital to serve the end-user demand as well as improvement inventory positions for our customers and for us. 
Working capital turns at 6.7%, a 1.1 turn improvement versus prior year, reflecting efficiencies delivered in accordance with the SBD operating model and the strong revenue performance. We're also making CapEx investments to drive margin resiliency and productivity as well to expand capacity and support further growth. We've had a great start to the year for free cash flow, up over $300 million versus the record 2020 performance and remain confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation for full year 2021. 
Turning to Slide 8. On the left side of the page, I'll share some insight regarding the commodity and supply chain environment and SBD's countermeasures. Looking at the top of the slide, we have included approximately $80 million of incremental expedited transit costs in the second half that we will incur to serve our improved demand assumption. The level of spend is fairly consistent to what we've realized in the front half of the year. This includes items such as premiums for expediting, securing containers for our supply chain and airfreight to keep pace with a hot tool market. The could alleviate as the global supply chain rebalances and presents an opportunity for cost savings and margin improvement in 2022 and beyond. 
Now moving to commodity inflation. We continue to see elevated commodity prices and now expect $260 million of commodity inflation in the second half versus our prior assumption of $210 million. In particular, elevated steel pricing is largely driving the $50 million increase. And for the full year, this is up about $65 million and approximately a $300 million cost for 2021. Now in April, we discussed taking pricing and productivity actions to partially offset the incremental headwinds identified at that time. We are now in the full implementation mode and believe we should be in a position to offset approximately 50% of of the 2021 headwind. Netting material inflation and better price realization is a neutral effect versus the prior guidance. The goal is to have our actions in place during the third quarter so the 2022 carryover benefits of price and margin actions fully offset the carryover inflation. And finally, we also have $50 million to $60 million of margin resiliency savings that is not included in the guidance to absorb volatility or support better performance. 
Now I will turn it back to Don to cover our revenue assumptions for the back half."
304977,1671716801,2351379,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lee. Shifting to the right-hand side of the slide, I will now outline the full year organic growth and margin rate assumptions, both overall and by segment. We are raising the total company organic growth range to 16% to 18% versus our prior assum",892,"Thanks, Lee. Shifting to the right-hand side of the slide, I will now outline the full year organic growth and margin rate assumptions, both overall and by segment. We are raising the total company organic growth range to 16% to 18% versus our prior assumption of 11% to 13%. The primary driver is an improved outlook for Tools & Storage.  Our visibility and confidence for sustained market demand continues to strengthen in addition to bringing channel inventories back to historical levels. We are raising the organic growth expectations for the segment to the low 20s versus our prior estimate of 14% to 16%. This results in mid- to high single-digit organic growth in the second half, which is supported by increased customer inventory as well as continued strong global demand. This assumption represents second half organic growth of about 26% versus 2019, which is consistent with what we just delivered in the front half of 2021. The Industrial outlook is in the low to mid-single-digit range, which is slightly lower than our mid-single-digit assumption in April. The primary factors for the change are the impacts from the second quarter as well as moderating our assumption for oil and gas for the remainder of the year. Lastly, Security organic growth is assumed to be high single digits. The record backlog in commercial electronic security is encouraging. And coupled with our data and technology-based product offerings and health and safety solutions, we are optimistic for a strong second half for the business. 
We are assuming the margin rate for the entire company will improve 40 to 50 basis points year-over-year. We expect the Tools & Storage and Industrial margins to increase year-over-year even given, one, some of the significant inflationary pressures expected in the second half; and two, key new investments to drive 2022 growth. The Security margins will be relatively flat to the prior year as we manage through the inefficiencies related to the pandemic restrictions as well as the cost impact from our key growth investments. 
Now I'll summarize the remaining guidance assumptions on Slide 9. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $10.80, up to $11.20, inclusive of various onetime charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. On an adjusted basis, we are increasing the EPS outlook to $11.30 -- $11.35 up to $11.65 from the previous range of $10.70 to $11. Our revised 2021 guidance calls for organic revenue growth of 16% to 18%, as just mentioned.  And at the midpoint, adjusted EPS expansion of 27% versus prior year and 37% versus 2019. The updated outlook reflects our strong first half performance as well as improved visibility to demand in Tools & Storage. We continue to make investments to support our growth catalysts, increase the capacity in our supply chain and drive our margin resiliency initiative. The drivers for improved adjusted EPS are outlined on the right-hand side of this slide, walking from the $10.85 EPS midpoint from our April guidance, second quarter performance adds $0.35; second half volume leverage, net of expedited transit costs required to meet the improved second half demand adds $0.30. Lastly, as Lee referenced earlier, strong realization on our price actions offset increased commodity inflation and net to a neutral impact to our guidance. 
On the left side of this chart, we have disclosed our current year assumptions for the significant below-the-line items and our expectation for pretax M&A and other charges to assist with your modeling. Behind the strong start to the year, the company is reiterating free cash flow to approximate GAAP net income. Therefore, we believe the free cash flow will likely approximate $1.7 billion in 2021.  And lastly, we expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21.5% of full year earnings. 
So in summary, our revised guidance calls for organic revenue growth of 16% to 18% and approximately 26% to 29% adjusted EPS expansion for the company in 2021. This is a very strong year-over-year expansion, yet balanced recognizing in the dynamic operating environment we all continue to navigate. 
Many of you are probably trying to gauge what this all means for 2022. While it is too early to make a call in the markets for that period of time, our objective and mindset is to grow our core earnings in 2022 in addition to the MTD accretion I outlined earlier. As you heard from Lee, we are in a great position from a price cost perspective and are expecting a neutral impact in 2022 from these items at current commodity prices. Additionally, as you heard at our Growth Summit in May, we have invested in a powerful set of organic growth initiatives, and we are driving several key margin resiliency catalysts that give me confidence that organic revenue and earnings growth is achievable in 2022. The organization remains focused on day-to-day execution, implementing price increases and margin resiliency programs in response to commodity inflation, and we are operating in accordance with our SBD operating model. We believe the company is well positioned to deliver above-market organic growth with operating leverage, strong free cash flow generation and top quartile shareholder returns over the long term. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks."

But what's interesting when you look across all our brands, we're seeing strength everywhere. So you saw strength across the different geographies. I mentioned the robust organic growth numbers. You've seen it in all the SBUs and you're seeing it with all the brands. And so the activity is still pretty intense, both on the DIY and the professional side. Who knows how long the DIY trend will continue. The potential for a Delta variant, maybe slowing down certain activities in the U.S. and other countries could actually continue to stimulate DIY activity for a period of time. But we're really has us excited is what's happening on the professional side and how that continues to be very strong. The activity across the globe is continuing to expand at a very rapid pace. And obviously, the need for our products continues to expand with it as well. So we sit here today and feel pretty good about the trend we're seeing going into the back half. We do believe there is a way to demonstrate growth in 2022, as I said.

I was wondering if you can kind of give us -- you talked about a $200 million organic growth type of opportunity on a combined basis. But how do you see -- do you see that there was any kind of share issues that might have cropped up? I assume the broader market grew nicely and how you intend to perhaps regain that share and grow the business organically? And then when you talk about in negotiations for -- with MTD for the option exercise, I was just curious, I think too many people just seem relatively straightforward that you had the opportunity to exercise or not.

And the growth for MTD was minimal, nominal. And that can be traced entirely to supply chain issues. The demand was there and it continues to be there. But like many large equipment providers, they are -- they have struggled a bit with pandemic-related issues, labor shortages, also some component shortages and things like that. Some companies have been situated in ways to manage them through the turbulence and still come out with great growth, as you can see in our tool business, for example. Other companies may not have had all the wherewithal or the situation might not have lent itself to that same successful outcome. And so yes, there was a little bit of share loss because of the supply chain issues. But I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the fundamental strength of the company, the strength of the products the brands. The products themselves, I mean, we visited, as I mentioned last week, their headquarters and spend a couple of hours looking at their product innovation pipeline. And I can tell you, when we marry -- successfully completing this deal with regulatory approvals, et cetera, when we are able to marry the brands of Stanley Black & Decker with the products that they've come up with already, and -- it's going to be a very, very exciting combination. So we're not concerned about the supply chain issues being a long-term issue. We have included in our pro formas a significant amount of resource to manage through those.  We bring the scale and the expertise to help do that for them, with them. The negotiations really -- so if you think back to the structure, the structure was predicated on essentially a multiple of EBITDA. And the incremental EBITDA that has grown since the time we initially took our 20% stake times -- 5.5x. I mean that's the formula. So 5.5x the EBITDA growth under the theory that we both work together in different ways over the course of time to help them increase the EBITDA, so we should share that increase. And so 5.5x is half of 11x, which is what we paid for the 20%. And so really, the only negotiation of significance boils down to certain due diligence items, which would be debt-like items, maybe certain liabilities that we would see an environmental or tax or those types of things as well as maybe some adjustments here and there for -- to get from a GAAP EBITDA to an adjusted EBITDA which the formula is based on. So one example of that would be since the formula was such a quantitative formula that the temptation that those folks could have had and didn't actually do this, but they could have, say, for instance, decrease their R&D or they could have shut down their robotics business, which is loses a modest amount of money to increase the EBITDA. We ask them to not do anything that would impair the company strategically for the benefit of financial -- for their financial purchase price. And they've been very high integrity, and so there may be some adjustments to that sort, but that's fundamentally what's being negotiated."

Yes, I wouldn't say there's a material difference between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. You obviously have some differences in the sense of the timing of the pricing whereas we continue to have discussions with our customers on price to be implemented throughout the third quarter, and that should be completed by the end of the third quarter. So you have a bit of a cadence of that with a full quarter impact in the fourth quarter as a positive. So that will be a helpful trend. You also had something going the other way and the seasonality that plays out of Q3 versus Q4 every year. Just the mix of promotions and mix of activities that happened in Q4 versus Q3, can result in anywhere from an 80 basis point to 120 basis points decline in margins in the tools business from Q3 to Q4. And so when you factor those types of things in, we think the tools margins in the back half will be somewhere between 16% and 17%, so roughly 16.5% on average. Q3, will be around the high point of that range and Q4 will be at around the low point of that range. And so that's probably the right way to think it just due to the dynamic that I just described. The other 2 businesses will continue to modestly improve. as far as Q2, Q3 to Q4 in their profitability rates, but not in a significant way. So I think that's probably helpful color in that area for you."

So electric penetration into riders and zero turns is roughly about 1%, and has stayed pretty constant. So we can't paint MTD with that brush that you are painting them with, number one, because their mix is gas powered. And we know that other gas-powered heavy outdoor power equipment makers grew. And these include some companies that we're very familiar with that grew in the 10% to 20% range during that quarter. So it is what it is. It's not a shift to electric.

Globally, TTI is making some progress, making some investments around the world, but it's largely focused historically on North America and on Australia, New Zealand. So that's kind of the stage there. The interaction with retailers, I think the retailers are as optimistic as we are about the future. And I think they would love to have more inventory yesterday. And we keep getting that -- those reminders as we operate our factory system at full bore. And we're adding capacity. We're adding several plants this year, and that will help. We're also working on making sure that we're looking out far enough on all components that we need in expediting components all around the world to make sure that we can serve their needs from a supply chain perspective, and continue to gain share.

This morning, we announced a record second quarter, which capped off a historic performance over the last 12 months. Over this period, we have delivered $3.1 billion revenue growth now at a $17 billion LTM run rate. Adjusted operating margins reached new heights approaching 17%, Tools operating margins are in excess of 20%, and we added $2.9 billion of sales growth in Tools, including outdoor, over the last 4 quarters. My team and I are proud of the collective effort of our 56,000 Stanley Black & Decker colleagues. We thank them for their resilience and dedication, their agility to cut through the many challenges associated with executing on this massive growth trajectory during the global pandemic. The way they have stepped up is impressive, taking care of customers, our people, our communities. It's a great story.  
Turning to the second quarter. Revenues were up 37% versus prior year to $4.3 billion. We achieved an all-time organic growth record of 33% and marked the first time all 3 segments, as currently organized, achieved double-digit organic growth in the same quarter. The extraordinary organic growth of 41% in Tools demonstrated the power of the world's leading tool company with the best brands and innovation in the industry. All regions delivered robust double-digit growth and our strong commercial and supply chain execution enabled us to capitalize on the positive secular trends and strong markets. Industrial accelerated to 14% organic growth behind the second straight quarter of double-digit growth and share gains in our automotive, general industrial and Attachment Tool businesses as recoveries in these end markets are continuing. 
The growth would have been even more robust if not for auto OEM production delays related to electronic component shortages and by a few continued cyclically depressed markets such as aerospace. Security had its strongest quarter in the last 10 years, delivering 14% organic growth. The Security businesses transformation to a data-enabled technology provider is accelerating, and the team successfully converted a strong backlog into revenue. Order rates were red hot in the quarter, up 36%, and the ending executable backlog was at record levels. We're excited about the full potential of these opportunities to support elevated revenue growth in the back half and beyond.  
Our overall company adjusted operating margin rate remained strong at 15.5%, up 270 basis points from the prior year, with volume leverage, price, mix benefits from innovation and margin resiliency more than overcoming the cost of growth investments, commodity inflation and higher expedited transportation costs required to serve the strong demand in Tools. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was a second quarter record at $3.08, up 93% over prior year, and free cash flow for the quarter was $339 million, up 28% versus prior year and over $300 million better on a year-to-date basis than our record-setting 2020, a year in which free cash flow was $1.5 billion.  
On the heels of this great performance, we entered the second half with positive momentum and a portfolio that is well positioned to capitalize on the key trends that are driving growth, the consumer reconnection with home and garden, e-commerce, electrification and health and safety. We are investing across our businesses to capture these opportunities and enable sustained above-market growth with margin expansion. And to that end, we are raising our 2021 full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $11.35 to $11.65 per share, a 27% increase versus prior year at the midpoint.  
Finally, I'd also like to highlight that last week, we increased our dividend for the 54th consecutive year. The quarterly payout now stands at $0.79 a share, which represents a 13% increase. This is a reflection of the continued confidence we have in the cash generating power of the company. A strong growing dividend is a key element of our shareholder value proposition and is consistent with our capital deployment strategy to return approximately half of our excess capital to shareholders over the long term. Of course, repurchases are the other major vehicle we could employ to do that. And notably, our Board increased our repurchase authorization last quarter to 20 million shares, giving us the flexibility to do some of that as well.  
During our May Growth Summit broadcast,  we showcased several significant catalysts that represent opportunities for a long and rewarding growth runway for Stanley Black & Decker. These catalysts capitalize on key 2020's trends, many of which are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. We are expecting that the key market drivers across our global tools markets will continue to be strong demand drivers and support tools growth for some time, including the secular surge in consumers' reconnection with the home and garden as well as the cyclical expansion in North America home improvement driven by new and existing home sales associated with household formation and the urban exodus. 
We are investing more than $200 million in innovation, e-commerce, sales and marketing and others, and we've never been better positioned to capitalize on market trends. Across the board, we have strategic differentiators that make us the world's leading tool company. Our iconic brands, DEWALT, Craftsman, Stanley, Stanley FatMax and Black & Decker; our category depth; channel development and operations excellence and a track record and commitment to market-leading innovation, our pipeline has never been stronger. We are expanding our cordless product offerings up and down the power spectrum to new users and product categories. 
With our FLEXVOLT, FLEXVOLT ADVANTAGE and DEWALT POWER DETECT platforms we are the industry leader in maximizing power output with plans to nearly double the number of products on these platforms over the next 3 years. Our ATOMIC and XTREME platforms leverage the smallest, most power dense, brushless motor technology in the industry, to deliver the highest power-to-weight ratio available in compact 20-volt and 12-volt platforms and will expand the product offering across these platforms roughly 4x over the coming years. These breakthrough products have already delivered significant share gains, and they're just getting started.  
The massive acceleration in the shift of demand to e-commerce was amplified during the pandemic, which was an enormous positive for us. We have approximately 3x the share in e-commerce as our next closest competitor, and we grew our global e-commerce business from 13% of Tools sales to 18% in a matter of 12 months, now about a $2 billion channel. This shift to e-commerce is going to continue, and we are doubling down our investments in talent, digital capabilities and our brands, including the revitalization of Black & Decker, which is an iconic brand that has a license to play in the largest breadth of categories within our portfolio. 
We see a significant opportunity over the coming years as the team reimagines Black & Decker to drive it towards more youthful buyers as an e-commerce lifestyle brand. The increased focus on ESG and climate and what that means for electrification presents a very compelling multiyear opportunity for us as well. Our existing cordless outdoor power equipment business has grown over 70% in the first half of the year. And in Engineered Fastening, the move from internal combustion engines to hybrid and EV platforms ultimately results in a 3x increase in content per vehicle.  
And lastly, the transformation of our Security business to become a technology-driven data solutions provider is gaining significant momentum, and the timing is excellent. The team has done a great job creating various solutions and products that are focused on health and safety, which has never been more relevant as the world continues to battle the pandemic. In addition to these growth opportunities, we are gaining momentum with our margin resiliency program. We continue to find new applications and use cases to apply our technology-enabled approach that will deliver a runway for sustainable margin expansion in the coming years.  
And now a brief update on MTD. As many of you know, our option to acquire the remaining 80% of MTD opened up at the beginning of this month. This opportunity is exciting as we bring leading brands and capabilities in the electric outdoor category as well as the ability to deploy the SBD operating model and apply our global scale. MTD brings superb product engineering and manufacturing expertise in outdoor power equipment, capabilities in robotics technology as well as access to the independent dealer channel in outdoor. 
We were just at MTD's facilities in Valley City, Ohio, last week and came away even more energized by the pipeline for innovation and the runway for growth in 2022 and beyond. The strategic fit is hand in glove and the revenue and cost synergy opportunities are compelling. We are currently in negotiations with MTD on the option execution. And should they come to a successful conclusion and subject to all regulatory approvals, we will begin work on tackling this multiyear opportunity for growth and margin expansion upon closing.  
And now, I'll hand it over to Don Allan to cover a few financial details on MTD, a more detailed discussion on second quarter results and offer up some 2021 guidance. Don?"
304977,1671716801,2351499,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Before we leave Slide 5, as Jim mentioned, I want to make a few remarks about some significant financial attributes related to this exciting potential transaction. First, over the last 12 months ending June 30,",1769,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Before we leave Slide 5, as Jim mentioned, I want to make a few remarks about some significant financial attributes related to this exciting potential transaction. First, over the last 12 months ending June 30, MTD achieved revenue of approximately $2.5 billion. They have seen great traction on their Spotlight10 initiative and have improved their EBITDA rate from approximately 4.5% in 2018 to high single digits over this LTM period.  
As I referenced at Investor Day, MTD has worked tirelessly to meet the supply chain challenges brought about by the pandemic, including limited throughput on larger products as well as component and input shortages. However, this has muted their output in revenue over the last 12 months. We believe these are temporary and manageable disruptions that can improve with our application of the SBD operating model. Consistent with Investor Day and taking into account our recent diligence, we believe that a combined MTD and SBD outdoor platform can become a growth catalyst to deliver $200 million in organic growth per year over the medium term.  
Our planning assumption for 2022 continues to call for the addition of MTD. Assuming $2.6 billion in revenue and continued progress on OM expansion, we believe this could contribute approximately 9% adjusted EBITDA margin or just over $230 million in consolidated adjusted EBITDA in 2022. Considering the benefits of our 20% stake currently in our P&L and applying interest and intangible amortization assumptions, this would result in approximately $0.50 of incremental adjusted EPS accretion in 2022. With our pathway for growth and margin expansion, this EPS accretion increases to over $1 by 2025, a strong P&L result that also carries a robust year for cash flow return on investment in the high teens. 
I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the second quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 46% revenue growth with volume up 38%, currency up 5% and price contributing an additional 3 points. The operating margin rate for the segment was 20.2%, up 320 basis points versus prior year. Volume, price and benefits from innovation and productivity were partially offset by commodity inflation, higher expedited transit costs to serve stronger demand and new growth investments. The extraordinary Tools & Storage growth was realized across the globe again in Q2, with organic growth of 30% in North America, 63% in Europe and 85% in emerging markets. 
This performance was driven by the ongoing strong professional demand and robust levels of innovation across our brands, in addition to the continuation of the global penetration of e-commerce, outdoor product electrification and the consumers' reconnection with home and garden. We continue to see growth and share gain across our brick-and-mortar and e-commerce platforms in U.S. retail, with the channel up 22% organically in the second quarter. POS remained robust, and retailer inventories ended the quarter still below normalized levels. 
Professional products are leading the growth across the front half and the share gains are consolidating. The first half 2021 POS is up approximately 40% compared to 2019. The North American commercial and industrial tool channels once again experienced positive sequential trends accelerating to 68% organic growth. The growth was supported by strong professional-driven demand and positive trends in manufacturing and industrial production, while our company-specific marketing and digital efforts drove share gains with our Industrial customers. 
The European Tools business realized 63% organic growth, driven by an expansion in commercial, retail brick-and-mortar and e-commerce channels due to the strength of the industrial rebound, coupled with professional construction demand. All regions contributed to double-digit growth and share gains were led by the U.K., France and Greece, which were up 130%, 73% and 67%, respectively. Finally, emerging markets was up over 85%, driven by higher construction-related demand. 
All markets contributed to share gains. Latin America was up 130% -- I'm sorry, 136% organically, with all countries at least doubling and Asia delivered 36% organic growth with at least double-digit growth across the region and India up nearly 3x. Russia and Turkey delivered another solid performance with organic growth of 78% and 114%, respectively. As highlighted at our May Growth Summit, our e-commerce initiative is a strategic growth driver for the business, and we are continuing to invest for further expansion. Second quarter global e-commerce revenue was up nearly 40% versus 2020, with a double-digit growth result from each region.  
Turning our attention to the Tools & Storage SBUs, all 3 SBUs had excellent contributions to the overall performance. Power Tools delivered 39% organic growth, benefiting from supportive markets and our growth catalysts. This was enabled by the relentless supply chain execution, combined with new and innovative product launches across CRAFTSMAN, Stanley FatMax and DEWALT. This includes an industry-leading breakthrough innovations such as DEWALT POWER DETECT, FLEXVOLT ADVANTAGE, ATOMIC and XTREME.
DEWALT FLEXVOLT was our first breakthrough as many of you know, and was once again a leader in 2021. Under this brand, we are introducing a 15 amp-hour battery and the 60-volt SDS MAX 2-inch hammer, both of which will be world's first innovations. Our FLEXVOLT system is now up to 45 products and is forecasted to represent over $600 million in 2021 revenue. It remains a key growth driver and is a unique and advantaged platform that we continue to leverage. We are passionate about innovation, and the pipeline continues to be robust. Stay tuned as more breakthroughs are on the horizon for our power tool products. 
The outdoor products business grew 40% organically, with all regions contributing. This performance was driven by new listings and cordless innovations under the Black & Decker CRAFTSMAN and DEWALT brands. This also includes expanding our offering in walk behind mowers and pressure washers, leveraging our FLEXVOLT technology and the Black & Decker Robotic Mower launch in Europe. We continue to expand our cordless technology and other innovations to the outdoor electric category to drive growth and are very encouraged about the future product pipeline.  
Finally, Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage grew 42% organically, fueled by robust market demand and new product introductions. We launched the new DEWALT Tough series tape measures and hammers as well as brought new power tool accessories to the market. We are expanding our offering of new metal and plastic storage solutions across both CRAFTSMAN and DEWALT brands, in addition to further innovations across our key construction, auto and industrial markets. In summary, growth continues across the globe within all 3 of the Tools & Storage SBUs. Equally as important, this growth comes with strong margin performance as a result of the team's continued resilience and disciplined price and supply chain execution. It was a fantastic performance for the Tools & Storage and outdoor teams. Thank you, both teams.  
Now turning to Industrial. This segment delivered 16% total revenue growth, which includes 13% volume, 3% currency and 1 point of price. This was partially offset by 1 point from an oil and gas product line divestiture. Segment organic growth improved sequentially with positive 14% growth in the quarter. The operating margin rate of 10.9% was an increase of 210 basis points versus the prior year. Benefits from volume, price and productivity were partially offset by commodity inflation, growth investments and trophy markets in oil and gas as well as aerospace.  
Looking further within this segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 26% as we continue to see improving automotive and industrial end markets. Our automotive fastener and system sales were up 63% organically. Our fastener organic growth significantly outpaced global light vehicle production and was up nearly 90% in the second quarter. Our automotive systems business was up 5%, the second consecutive quarter of growth and a positive indication of improving OEM capital investment.  
At the segment level, we had an approximate 2-point negative revenue impact versus our second quarter plan from OEM semiconductor shortages, which disrupted vehicle production throughout the quarter. Industrial fasteners accelerated to 29% organic growth behind the continued recovery in global manufacturing and industrial activity. All regions contributed double-digit growth and realized share gains. The business solidly outpaced the global industrial production index.  
Aerospace fastener revenues continued to reduce by -- versus 2020 as they deal with very slow markets due to limited new planned production. However, the recovery is on the horizon and expected likely to begin in 2022. Infrastructure organic revenues were down 11%. Attachment Tools realized 16% growth, which was driven by increased OEM and independent dealer demand. Momentum continues to build in this market with strong backlogs and order rates at our OEM and independent dealer customers. However, there was more than an offset by the dramatic reduction in pipeline activity, which resulted in a 55% decline in oil and gas. This market is longer cycle as we know and is yet to see a recovery in new pipeline construction.  
Shifting to Security. Total revenue was up 16% with 13% organic volume, a 6-point positive impact from currency and a 1 point contribution from price. This was partially offset by a 5-point decline related to the international divestitures that we completed in the third quarter of last year. Overall, North America was up 16% organically. We continue to get better access to customer sites and we're able to convert our backlog within commercial electronic security. 
North America also benefited from strong growth within automatic doors and health care. European organic growth was up 12% as new data-driven product solutions supported gains in France and the Nordics. A strong performance considering that many of these markets still have pandemic-related restrictions impacting installations. Our new digital solutions continued to build momentum, contributing approximately 2 to 3 points of growth as the business continues to execute a required digital transformation. Overall, order rates grew 36% in the second quarter, and the quarter end executable backlog was a record high, which positions the business to deliver high single-digit organic growth for the remainder of 2021. 
Overall Security segment profit rate, excluding charges, was 8.5%, down 110 basis points versus the prior year rate as price and volume gains were more than offset by the inefficiencies related to pandemic restrictions, and the cost impact from growth investments such as SaaS solutions, touchless door technology and other health and safety options. We believe these inefficiencies will save when the pandemic reaches its final stages. And as the growth investments contribute larger revenue dollars, we will see the profitability rate of this business expand as well. 
Now I will turn the call to Lee McChesney to review cash flow and an update on material inflation, expedited transit costs and our price actions. Lee?"

Free cash flow in the second quarter was $339 million, which brings our year-to-date performance to $93 million. The quarter and year-to-date improvements versus prior year are predominantly driven by robust operational performance and earnings growth and was partially offset by higher working capital and capital spending versus prior year. We are investing in working capital to serve the end-user demand as well as improvement in inventory positions for our customers and for us.  
Working capital turns at 6.7, a 1.1 turn improvement versus prior year, reflecting efficiencies delivered in accordance with the SBD operating model and the strong revenue performance. We're also making CapEx investments to drive margin resiliency and productivity as well to expand capacity and support further growth. We've had a great start to the year for free cash flow, up over $300 million versus the record 2020 performance and remain confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation for full year 2021.  
Turning to Slide 8. On the left side of the page, I'll share some insight regarding the commodity and supply chain environment and SBD's countermeasures. Looking at the top of the slide, we have included approximately $80 million of incremental expedited transit costs in the second half that we will incur to serve our improved demand assumption. The level of spend is fairly consistent to what we've realized in the front half of the year. This includes items such as premiums for expediting, securing containers for our supply chain and airfreight to keep pace with a hot tool market. These costs should alleviate as the global supply chain rebalances and presents an opportunity for cost savings and margin improvement in 2022 and beyond.  
Now moving to commodity inflation. We continue to see elevated commodity prices and now expect $260 million of commodity inflation in the second half versus our prior assumption of $210 million. In particular, elevated steel pricing is largely driving the $50 million increase. And for the full year, this is up about $65 million and approximately a $300 million cost for 2021. Now in April, we discussed taking pricing and productivity actions to partially offset the incremental headwinds identified at that time. We are now in the full implementation mode and believe we should be in a position to offset approximately 50% of the 2021 headwind. Netting material inflation and better price realization is a neutral effect versus the prior guidance. The goal is to have our actions in place during the third quarter, so the 2022 carryover benefits of price and margin actions fully offset the carryover inflation. And finally, we also have $50 million to $60 million of margin resiliency savings that is not included in the guidance to absorb volatility or support better performance.  
Now I will turn it back to Don to cover our revenue assumptions for the back half."
304977,1671716801,2351499,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lee. Shifting to the right-hand side of the slide, I will now outline the full year organic growth and margin rate assumptions, both overall and by segment. We are raising the total company organic growth range to 16% to 18% versus our prior assum",890,"Thanks, Lee. Shifting to the right-hand side of the slide, I will now outline the full year organic growth and margin rate assumptions, both overall and by segment. We are raising the total company organic growth range to 16% to 18% versus our prior assumption of 11% to 13%. The primary driver is an improved outlook for Tools & Storage.  Our visibility and confidence for sustained market demand continues to strengthen in addition to bringing channel inventories back to historical levels. We are raising the organic growth expectations for the segment to the low 20s versus our prior estimate of 14% to 16%. This results in mid- to high single-digit organic growth in the second half, which is supported by increased customer inventory as well as continued strong global demand. 
This assumption represents second half organic growth of about 26% versus 2019, which is consistent with what we just delivered in the front half of 2021. The Industrial outlook is in the low to mid-single-digit range, which is slightly lower than our mid-single-digit assumption in April. The primary factors for the change are the impacts from the second quarter as well as moderating our assumption for oil and gas for the remainder of the year. Lastly, Security organic growth is assumed to be high single digits. The record backlog in commercial electronic security is encouraging. And coupled with our data and technology-based product offerings and health and safety solutions, we are optimistic for a strong second half for the business.  
We are assuming the margin rate for the entire company will improve 40 to 50 basis points year-over-year. We expect the Tools & Storage and Industrial margins to increase year-over-year, even given, one, some of the significant inflationary pressures expected in the second half; and two, key new investments to drive 2022 growth. The Security margins will be relatively flat to the prior year as we manage through the inefficiencies related to the pandemic restrictions as well as the cost impact from our key growth investments.  
Now I'll summarize the remaining guidance assumptions on Slide 9. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $10.80 up to $11.20, inclusive of various onetime charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. On an adjusted basis, we are increasing the EPS outlook to $11.30 -- $11.35 up to $11.65 from the previous range of $10.70 to $11. Our revised 2021 guidance calls for organic revenue growth of 16% to 18%, as just mentioned. And at the midpoint, adjusted EPS expansion of 27% versus prior year and 37% versus 2019. The updated outlook reflects our strong first half performance as well as improved visibility to demand in Tools & Storage. 
We continue to make investments to support our growth catalysts, increase the capacity in our supply chain and drive our margin resiliency initiatives. The drivers for improved adjusted EPS are outlined on the right-hand side of this slide. Walking from the $10.85 EPS midpoint from our April guidance, second quarter performance adds $0.35. Second half volume leverage, net of expedited transit costs required to meet the improved second half demand, adds $0.30. Lastly, as Lee referenced earlier, strong realization on our price actions offset increased commodity inflation and net to a neutral impact to our guidance.  
On the left side of this chart, we have disclosed our current year assumptions for the significant below-the-line items and our expectation for pretax M&A and other charges to assist with your modeling. Behind the strong start to the year, the company is reiterating free cash flow to approximate GAAP net income. Therefore, we believe the free cash flow will likely approximate $1.7 billion in 2021. And lastly, we expect third quarter's adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21.5% of full year earnings.  
So in summary, our revised guidance calls for organic revenue growth of 16% to 18% and approximately 26% to 29% adjusted EPS expansion for the company in 2021. This is a very strong year-over-year expansion, yet balanced recognizing the dynamic operating environment we all continue to navigate. Many of you are probably trying to gauge what this all means for 2022. While it is too early to make a call on the markets for that period of time, our objective and mindset is to grow our core earnings in 2022 in addition to the MTD accretion I outlined earlier. 
As you heard from Lee, we are in a great position from a price/cost perspective and are expecting a neutral impact in 2022 from these items at current commodity prices. Additionally, as you heard at our Growth Summit in May, we have invested in a powerful set of organic growth initiatives, and we are driving several key margin resiliency catalysts that give me confidence that organic revenue and earnings growth is achievable in 2022. The organization remains focused on day-to-day execution, implementing price increases and margin resiliency programs in response to commodity inflation, and we are operating in accordance with our SBD operating model. We believe the company is well positioned to deliver above-market organic growth with operating leverage, strong free cash flow generation and top quartile shareholder returns over the long term.  
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks."

I'll keep this summary very brief so as to get right to Q&A. And as you've seen and heard, we had a very strong finish to the first half as we delivered exceptional organic growth, strong margin performance, reflecting positive secular trends, vibrant markets and a strong array of growth catalysts. I'm pleased with the team's continued efforts and excited about the enormous potential given the improved outlook, strong momentum we've built over the last 12 months. And as we look to the future, our portfolio is uniquely positioned to benefit from these trends, several of which have been accelerated and amplified by the pandemic, the consumer reconnection with the home and garden, e-commerce, electrification and health and safety. 
We're capitalizing on this opportunity by funding innovation and commercial and capacity investments to support continued organic growth and share gains. And additionally, our option to acquire the remaining stake in MTD has the potential to generate significant revenue in 2022 and create an exciting multiyear runway for growth and significant EPS and cash flow accretion.

But what's interesting when you look across all our brands, we're seeing strength everywhere. So you saw strength across the different geographies. I mentioned the robust organic growth numbers. You've seen it in all the SBUs and you're seeing it with all the brands. And so the activity is still pretty intense, both on the DIY and the professional side. Who knows how long the DIY trend will continue. The potential for a Delta variant maybe slowing down certain activities in the U.S. and other countries could actually continue to stimulate DIY activity for a period of time. But what really has us excited is what's happening on the professional side and how that continues to be very strong. 
The activity across the globe is continuing to expand at a very rapid pace. And obviously, the need for our products continues to expand with it as well. So we sit here today and feel pretty good about the trend we're seeing going into the back half. We do believe there is a way to demonstrate growth in 2022, as I said.

And the growth for MTD was minimal, nominal. And that can be traced entirely to supply chain issues. The demand was there and it continues to be there. But like many large equipment providers, they are -- they have struggled a bit with pandemic-related issues, labor shortages, also some component shortages and things like that. Some companies have been situated in ways to manage them through the turbulence and still come out with great growth, as you can see in our tool business, for example. Other companies may not have had all the wherewithal or the situation might not have lent itself to that same successful outcome. And so yes, there was a little bit of share loss because of the supply chain issues. 
But I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the fundamental strength of the company, the strength of the products and the brands. The products themselves -- I mean, we visited, as I mentioned, last week their headquarters and spend a couple of hours looking at their product innovation pipeline. And I can tell you, when we marry -- successfully completing this deal with regulatory approvals, et cetera, when we are able to marry the brands of Stanley Black & Decker with the products that they've come up with already, and -- it's going to be a very, very exciting combination. So we're not concerned about the supply chain issues being a long-term issue. 
We have included in our pro formas a significant amount of resource to manage through those. We bring the scale and the expertise to help do that for them, with them. The negotiations really -- so if you think back to the structure, the structure was predicated on essentially a multiple of EBITDA. And the incremental EBITDA that has grown since the time we initially took our 20% stake times -- 5.5x. I mean that's the formula. So 5.5x the EBITDA growth under the theory that we both work together in different ways over the course of time to help them increase the EBITDA, so we should share that increase. And so 5.5x is half of 11x, which is what we paid for the 20%. So really, the only negotiation of significance boils down to certain due diligence items, which would be debt-like items, maybe certain liabilities that we would see an environmental or tax or those types of things as well as maybe some adjustments here and there for -- to get from a GAAP EBITDA to an adjusted EBITDA, which the formula is based on. 
So one example of that would be since the formula was such a quantitative formula that the temptation that those folks could have had and didn't actually do this, but they could have, say, for instance, decrease their R&D or they could have shut down their robotics business, which is -- loses a modest amount of money to increase the EBITDA. We ask them to not do anything that would impair the company strategically for the benefit of financial -- for their financial purchase price. And they've been very high integrity, and so there may be some adjustments of that sort, but that's fundamentally what's being negotiated."

Yes, I wouldn't say there's a material difference between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. You obviously have some differences in the sense of the timing of the pricing whereas we continue to have discussions with our customers on price to be implemented throughout the third quarter, and that should be completed by the end of the third quarter. So you have a bit of a cadence of that with a full quarter impact in the fourth quarter as a positive. So that will be a helpful trend. You also had something going the other way in the seasonality that plays out of Q3 versus Q4 every year. 
Just the mix of promotions and mix of activities that happened in Q4 versus Q3 can result in anywhere from an 80 basis point to 120 basis point decline in margins in the Tools business from Q3 to Q4. And so when you factor those types of things in, we think the Tools margins in the back half will be somewhere between 16% and 17%, so roughly 16.5% on average. Q3 will be around the high point of that range and Q4 will be at around the low point of that range. And so that's probably the right way to think is just due to that dynamic that I just described. The other 2 businesses will continue to modestly improve. as far as Q2, Q3 to Q4 in their profitability rates, but not in a significant way. So I think that's probably helpful color in that area for you."

So we can't paint MTD with that brush that you are painting them with, number one, because their mix is gas powered. And we know that other gas-powered heavy outdoor power equipment makers grew. And these include some companies that we're very familiar with that grew in the 10% to 20% range during that quarter. So it is what it is. It's not a shift to electric. We will make that happen later if we're able to execute on this. And that's kind of where we are at this point."

I mean, clearly, there's a very intense battle going on between us and TTI. TTI has picked an exclusive strategy in the home centers with one player as well as a kind of commercial and industrial strategy, predicated on a lot of feet on the street and lot of investment in sales and marketing resources in that regard. Brand to brand, I'd say when you look at the 2 brands, DEWALT and MILWAUKEE, we believe DEWALT is a stronger brand, but not by that much. When we look at CRAFTSMAN and RYOBI, we think that CRAFTSMAN is a far stronger brand than RYOBI, and that's based on actual research. 
So that's kind of the setup there. Globally, TTI is making some progress, making some investments around the world, but it's largely focused historically on North America and on Australia, New Zealand. So that's kind of the stage there. The interaction with retailers, I think the retailers are as optimistic as we are about the future. And I think they would love to have more inventory yesterday. And we keep getting that -- those reminders as we operate our factory system at full bore. And we're adding capacity. We're adding several plants this year, and that will help. We're also working on making sure that we're looking out far enough on all components that we need in expediting components all around the world to make sure that we can serve their needs from a supply chain perspective and continue to gain share. So interaction with retailers is great. It's intense. People are kind of really seeking more product, and we're doing everything we can to do that, meet their needs."

This morning, we announced a record third quarter, which was powered by 11% growth, primarily a result of an impressive 10% organic growth performance. Customer demand remained at robust levels across commercial and retail end markets. and strong trends continued in homebuilding and remodeling, commercial construction, professional activity and global economic growth. Innovation was also a positive, which is driving demand around electrification and other themes. We're continuing to prioritize meeting this heightened customer demand while operating in an unusually complex supply chain environment. I thank our 56,000 employees around the world for delivering record revenue under the circumstances. And in particular, I want to offer special thanks to our employee makers and plants, DCs and operations organizations as well as our sales and service people for their incredible dedication, agility and resilience to serve our customers during this period as they always do. 
Tools generated 13% organic growth in what we believe to be the strongest demand environment in our history, resulting from positive secular trends, robust professional activity and strong global markets. Our brands such as DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN, Stanley and Black & Decker, among others, were fueled by a steady stream of innovation and a strong and resilient supply chain, which is putting great products in the hands of our loyal end users across the globe. Industrial grew 1% organically, driven by continued double-digit growth and share gains in our general industrial and attachment tool businesses. as these end markets remained solid. 
Industrial growth was tempered, however, by lower auto production activity as OEMs continue to be impacted by electronic and other component shortages. Aerospace also experienced trough conditions as the industry recovery, while promising to be likely in the foreseeable future, has yet to occur. Security delivered another strong quarter with 8% organic growth. The security transformation to a data-enabled cloud-based technology provider is building significant momentum, and our team successfully converted this robust backlog into revenue growth. Order rates were strong and we posted a third straight record quarter and backlog. 
We're excited about the full potential of these opportunities to support elevated revenue growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. The overall company adjusted operating margin rate was 12.2%, down from the prior year as growth investments and higher supply chain costs that accelerated in the quarter more than offset volume leverage, price mix benefits and margin resiliency. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.77, down 4% year-over-year. And similar to most companies engaged in global trade, our supply chain costs were higher this quarter. We have worked tirelessly to get components and finished products to where they need to be to serve this extraordinary customer demand. Through data analytics, we now have visibility into every container on and off the water, and we utilize this visibility to prioritize and expedite the most critical items, often with premium freight. To offset the additional expenses, we have deployed price increases, surcharges and productivity measures. 
To be clear, we have made a conscious decision to incur temporarily higher expediting costs to serve our customers and meet demand as effectively as possible. We have sized the pricing and productivity actions to ensure that we are well positioned to address the inflation and achieve margin accretion in 2022. This implies that our actions will be sufficient to restore our margins to normalized levels as the actions catch up to the higher costs in 2022. And further, we remain highly confident in our multiyear growth and margin expansion plans. There are several positive secular demand trends that are benefiting our businesses, and we remain bullish on the resi and nonresi construction markets as well as the industrial recovery. 
We have developed an array of growth drivers to position our businesses to capture this opportunity, and we are continuing to invest in innovation, manufacturing, automation, inventory and our supply chain to meet the strong demand in the near term and fuel sustainable growth over the medium and long terms. 
And now I'll take a moment to review our recently announced MTD and Excel acquisitions. The combination of these 2 high-quality complementary companies with our existing outdoor business creates a powerful growth engine with approximately $4 billion of revenue across all categories and channels in the $25 billion-plus outdoor category. Of the $4 billion, we expect approximately $3 million of that in -- of the $4 billion to be a direct result of closing the 2 transactions in the coming weeks. Even before that, we are starting from a position of strength with strong outdoor brands in DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and Black & Decker as well as the fastest-growing franchise in cordless electric outdoor products. 
Our legacy outdoor business is benefiting from the long-term trend of electrification, primarily now in handheld products and walk-behind mowers. MTD is one of the leading players in U.S. retail with great brands such as Cub Cadet and Troy-Bilt and brings a relentless dedication to innovation. Excel focuses on zero-turn mowers and offers a range of premier commercial grade and prosumer equipment, with Tier 1 niche pro brands such as Hustler and Big Dog. Excel also brings us access to a strong and extensive professional dealer network. These acquisitions are complementary to each other and fill gaps in our current presence in the outdoor space, which brings me to another major growth driver. 
With these acquisitions, we have an ESG opportunity. to lead large-format electrification and outdoor. The customer adoption of electrified riders and zero-turn mowers is still in the early stages but the future potential is compelling. In collaboration with MTD, we have been making great progress since 2019 in developing innovative electrified solutions that offer a compelling value proposition in terms of run time, price point, and environmental impact. Additionally, MTD has semiautonomous and autonomous mowing technology, which we will commercialize in the coming years. 
Outdoor will undoubtedly unleash an array of impressive innovation over the next few years. Global channel development and professional branding are significant additional revenue synergies that we think as we think about ways to grow sales through our future outdoor activities, applying MTD's strong innovation with a leading professional brand like DEWALT presents an excellent opportunity to win the prouser with a full line of gas and electric options. To fully realize this potential, we plan to build on our existing position in retail as well as expand our sales in the pro dealer network. 
MTD has a strong presence in the retail channel with approximately 1,500 dealer locations. Excel exclusively distributes through its 1,400 outlet dealer channel, which is largely geographically complementary to MTD's dealers. The opportunities for brand, product and channel revenue synergies to expand sales and carry accretive margins are both meaningful and exciting. 
And finally, on one more outdoor growth front, we have an opportunity in the $4 billion high-margin parts service segment as we build our presence and serve our customers. The benefits from this growth will also come with margin expansion as we apply our SBD operating model and our global scale to execute on cost synergies, launch margin-accretive innovation and develop a vibrant professional franchise. We expect these opportunities to provide a pathway to mid-teens or higher margins over the long term. Both acquisitions are currently progressing through their respective regulatory processes. And for MTD, we are happy to say that the United States HSR review is complete. Additional reviews are underway in several other smaller countries. We currently anticipate to close in late 2021 or early '22 for both transactions pending successful completion of the regulatory processes. 
And as must be obvious, we're excited about the future of outdoor products at SBD. The significant ESG growth and margin opportunities have the potential for excellent value creation in 2022 and beyond. Extreme innovation is at the heart of SBD's culture. It is 1 of our 3 strategic pillars: performance, innovation and social responsibility. Innovation differentiates all our franchises and defines our brands. Over the last couple of years, we have brought incredible innovation to the market from FLEXVOLT to Atomic and Extreme and now DEWALT POWERSTACK and Black & Decker Reviva, which I will cover in a few moments. It is clear that our tools innovation machine has never been stronger. 
Nonetheless, we are doubling down on our investments in innovation and new product commercialization. These investments will support the largest pipeline we have ever had with new products across all our major categories and end users. Over the last 12 months, we have added approximately 1,300 new employees with deep domain expertise and technical knowledge in critical areas, including sales, engineering, product management, brand, industrial design, e-commerce and end-user insights. Our supply chain investments are also key innovation enablers moving closer to the customer, adding capacity, improves agility, customer responsiveness and speed to market as we develop and commercialize new products. We have approximately $200 million of new innovation and growth investment projects in process which are included in our second half 2021 run rate. 
These projects will allow us to effectively better serve the strong global product demand for tools and position us for sustained long-term growth. Earlier this month, we announced our latest breakthrough innovation, the DEWALT POWERSTACK battery, a remarkable design and engineering achievement. POWERSTACK is the world's first power tool battery to leverage lithium-ion pouch cell technology and introduces a new era of performance for DEWALT power tools. POWERSTACK batteries will begin shipping in the fourth quarter of this year with annual growth potential measured in hundreds of millions. This is another example of our leading-edge differentiated innovation, driving the revenue growth potential of our core business. The POWERSTACK battery is 25% smaller, 15% lighter than our comparable DEWALT 20-volt 2 amp-hour battery and it delivers 50% more power with 2x the charge cycles, making this revolutionary design the lightest and most powerful and longest-lasting compact battery from DEWALT. And it is compatible with our DEWALT 20-volt system. The combination of POWERSTACK and our proven capabilities to design and manufacture the best and most compact brushless motors in the industry, we have just unlocked a new dimension for smaller, lighter and more powerful tools with enormous runway ahead. 
The importance of this innovation cannot be overstated. More power, more compact, lighter, lasts longer, guaranteed tough. We love it and so are the market. DEWALT is again asserting itself as the industry leader in professional power tools. And now for something also very exciting, but quite different. It's never been more important for companies to turn their attention to building a sustainable future for our global community. The Black & Decker Reviva line is our latest customer offering and creating more sustainable products and driving innovation with purpose. This line of consumer DIY tools features 50% post-consumer recycled content in the enclosures, which reduces virgin plastic use and supports closing the loop in a circular economy. 
Partnering with Eastman to apply their Triton Renew material to our products has created the opportunity to reduce environmental impact, while continuing to develop the performance, durability and quality that our customers require. We are delighted to have found a long-term partner in Eastman, a company that will support and accelerate our wider, broader commitment to becoming a force for good in society. This product is a great example of how corporations can embrace ESG in a way that provides meaningful innovation to the consumer, reduces our impact on the environment and drives business performance. The Black & Decker revitalization is a major growth opportunity for the company, and Reviva is just one great example of how we're making that happen. 
And now I will turn it over to Don to talk about our supply chain investments, our business segment results and how we are positioning the company for sustained long-term growth. Don?"
304977,1683287090,2415442,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim just highlighted in his opening remarks, we continue to see a range of powerful secular business drivers that are creating a path for strong multiyear growth for our businesses. In support of that, I want",1644,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim just highlighted in his opening remarks, we continue to see a range of powerful secular business drivers that are creating a path for strong multiyear growth for our businesses. In support of that, I want to spend a moment to share a few of the many actions we have taken to position our company for significant growth in 2022 and beyond. Three areas I would like to highlight include our latest investments in expanded manufacturing capacity, strategic sourcing partnerships and the further acceleration of our factory automation initiatives. 
Beginning with our manufacturing footprint. We are aligning our new investments with our Make Where We Sell strategy as we expand capacity globally. For example, in 2021, we are opening 2 new power tool plants and 1 new hand tool facility in North America. These 3 new facilities will enable shorter lead times. And once in place, our North American capacity will have tripled since 2016. These new manufacturing plants will be accompanied by a parallel regional development of our local supply chain base over time, enhancing local market sourcing and speed to market. 
As it relates to strategic sourcing, we have acted and continued to focus on securing sufficient supply of battery cells and electronic components using our power tools to support our long-term growth plans, which include the growing tailwind from electrification. We have co-invested with key battery suppliers to secure dedicated capacity for the next several years. In addition, we are adding new qualified suppliers to diversify our sourcing and working to increase our inventories for battery cells. We made great progress in 2021 and are well positioned for significant supply increases related to battery cells. 
As it relates to electronic components, we are following a very similar plan. We have made progress in 2021 and are on our way to securing the chips and the throughput to support at least 25% growth in our electronic component supply for 2022. This area is currently an intense pain point. However, we see a road map for significant improvement by early spring of 2022. 
Finally, we are leveraging our Industry 4.0 capabilities to drive manufacturing automation throughout many of our factories. We are deploying multiple projects in our Charlotte manufacturing facility that have a payback of less than 1 year. These flexible automation projects enable the labor efficiency and increased throughput required to deliver outsized productivity and enable our Make Where We Sell strategy. 
In summary, we have positioned our business to have the capacity, supply and throughput to deliver significant growth in 2022 and beyond. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the third quarter. 
Tools & Storage delivered record revenues as we maintained our focus on ensuring we keep up with the existing market demands. This resulted in 14% revenue growth with volume up 11%, price up 2% and currency contributing an additional point. The operating margin rate for the segment was 15.7%, down from 21.5% in the third quarter of last year as volume, price, productivity and benefits from innovation were more than offset by accelerating transit costs incurred to meet the strong market demand. Additionally, rising commodity inflation and new growth investments related to digital marketing and feet on the street offset those positive items I mentioned. 
All regions delivered organic growth, with North America up 9%, Europe up 20% and emerging markets up 28%. This performance was supported across all markets as the secular shifts related to the reconnection with the home and garden as well as e-commerce were amplified by our industry-leading innovation and the strong professional demand. The high single-digit North American growth was underpinned by another strong retail performance, up 6% as point-of-sale demand remained at robust levels in U.S. retail, and channel inventory remained below historical levels. The strong professional-driven demand was also demonstrated in the commercial and industrial channels posting 15% growth versus the prior year. 
Our thesis on demand is playing out as underlying construction activity remains strong and the Pro is driving growth, overcoming a robust growth performance in the comparable period last year and a little bit of moderation in the DIY category. Further demonstrating the durability of these trends, our latest POS results showed mid-single-digit growth over the last 4 weeks, covering late September through mid-October, with the last measured week up double digits, a very good signal of the healthy backdrop in U.S. retail. 
The European Tools business experienced growth across all major geographies. along with the commercial, retail brick-and-mortar and e-commerce channels. The region grew 17% organically with a standout e-commerce outperformance, up 43% versus the prior year, in addition to a notable DEWALT brand strength performance, which achieved 27% growth. 
Finally, in emerging markets, growth was pervasive across all regions and was led by trade solutions, cordless power tools and continued e-commerce momentum. All markets are consistently contributing to share gains, including 36% organic growth in Latin America and 22% organic growth in Asia. Finally, our enterprise-wide e-commerce strategic growth initiative continues to deliver strong results with third quarter global e-commerce revenue up nearly 20% versus 2020. 
Now let's turn to the Tools & Storage SBUs. Power Tools delivered 11% organic growth, which was supported by the new and innovative product launches across CRAFTSMAN, DEWALT and Stanley FatMax. Two great examples of these innovations are, one, Stanley 20-volt product line launch with improved battery technology; and two, several new offerings across both the Extreme and Atomic platforms. 
Moving on to the Outdoor business. All regions contributed to an 11% organic growth performance. This was driven by new listings and cordless innovations under the Black & Decker, CRAFTSMAN and DEWALT brands. Notably, global sales were up over 50% year-to-date as compared to 2020. We delivered industry-leading growth, rolling out new offerings in mowers and handheld products in 2021. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the results of our 2022 line reviews where we gained significant listings with all our major retailers, supporting our belief that outdoor electrification has the potential to be a major growth catalyst for the company. 
Finally, hand tools, accessories and storage grew 16% organically, fueled by a robust market demand and new product introductions across our key construction, auto and industrial markets. A few highlights include the 20-volt spot laser and the Elite circular saw blade within the construction space. Within the automotive aftermarket, CRAFTSMAN unveiled a new set of V-Series mechanics tools that are designed to professional specifications. We also launched a Lennox Gentech carbide band saw for our industrial customers. A lot of wonderful innovation in the third quarter. 
Also during the quarter, the Tools & Storage team was awarded 46 Pro Tool Innovation Awards, representing best-in-class products in the construction industry. Well done, Tools team. I want to thank all the Tools & Storage employees around the world for their perseverance to navigate this dynamic environment to deliver a fantastic revenue result for the quarter. Demand in tools remains robust, lapping strong 2020 growth comps and Q3 saw strong mid-20s percentile growth as compared to 2019. 
Now shifting to Industrial. Segment revenue expanded by 1%, as 2 points of price and 1 point of currency was partially offset by 1 point of volume and 1 point from an oil and gas product line divestiture. Operating margin was 7.9%, down versus 12.3% in the third quarter of last year as the benefits from price and productivity were more than offset by commodity inflation, growth investments and volume declines in higher-margin automotive and aerospace fasteners. 
Looking further within this segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were down 1% as strong general industrial growth of 23% was offset by market-driven aerospace declines and lower automotive OEM production, resulting from the global semiconductor shortage. Our auto fastener growth outperformed light vehicle production by approximately 15 points for the quarter and year-to-date periods. This shows our value-add business model is generating share gains despite the OEM production schedule fluctuations. Infrastructure organic revenues were up 7%, as 16% growth in attachment tools was partially offset by lower pipeline project activity in oil and gas. Momentum continues to build in the attachment tools markets with strong backlogs and order rates at our OEM and independent dealer customers. 
As we look forward into 2022 and beyond, we are prepared to serve the cyclical growth recovery across many of our industrial end markets. 
Now shifting to Security. Total revenue was up 5%, with 7% volume and 1 point contributions from price, currency and acquisitions, which was partially offset by a 5-point decline related to the international divestitures completed in the third quarter of last year. North America was up 12% organically, driven by strong backlog conversion in commercial electronic security and solid growth within automatic doors and health care. 
Europe was positive organically led by data-driven product solutions in France, which is one of our most mature businesses and activating the new health and safety growth opportunities that we have outlined in the past. Our security business transformation is consistently driving top line momentum. Order rates globally grew 14% in the third quarter, resulting in the third consecutive record quarter end backlog. Overall Security segment profit rate, excluding charges, was 9.2%, down versus the prior year rate of 11% as price and volume gains were more than offset by higher labor costs, pandemic-related inefficiencies and growth investments such as SaaS solutions, touchless door technology and other health and safety options. 
We now have broad customer access, but new safety protocols are extending installation time lines. We are implementing price actions for these new realities while we continue to invest to fuel top line momentum. 
I will now turn the call to Lee McChesney who will review cash flow and provide an update on our response to the rising costs in key areas of our supply chain. Lee?"

Moving to Slide 11, let's review free cash flow performance. Third quarter free cash flow was a use of cash of $125 million, which brings our year-to-date results to a use of cash of $31 million. As you heard from Jim, we are focused on",552,"Thank you, Don. 
Moving to Slide 11, let's review free cash flow performance. Third quarter free cash flow was a use of cash of $125 million, which brings our year-to-date results to a use of cash of $31 million. As you heard from Jim, we are focused on serving our customers and have invested in inventory to serve the robust demand environment here in 2021 and in '22 and beyond, which is a major item that explains the year-over-year performance. There's also a normal seasonality pattern to our working capital that typically results in a significant amount of our cash flow generation occurring in the fourth quarter. We expect 2021 will follow that pattern and are planning for strong fourth quarter cash performance, while ensuring that we make the appropriate investments in inventory and CapEx to support all of our exciting growth initiatives. 
Let's now move to Page 12 and dive into the supply chain. The environment certainly remains dynamic as we serve the robust demand across the markets. During the third quarter, we experienced accelerated input cost inflation and higher cost to serve demand. We've initiated a comprehensive set of pricing and productivity actions in response. I'll now outline our latest expectations for inflation and our game plan for price recovery. Compared to our July guidance, key commodity inputs such as steel, resins and purchase components accelerated throughout the third quarter, contributing an incremental $100 million in costs. In addition, container and transportation costs, which largely drive our cost to serve, experienced a dramatic increase during the quarter. Average container spot prices are now nearly 7x what we were paying earlier this year. Average transit time from Asian suppliers to the North American manufacturing facilities and distribution centers have increased more than twofold from approximately 40 days to 85. Combined, these container and transit cost impacts added an additional $130 million of cost pressure. 
These underlying assumptions raise our full year commodity and supply chain headwinds to an estimate of approximately $690 million. Assuming the known impacts continue, we also are forecasting approximately $600 million to $650 million of carryover cost headwinds for 2022. Now if you shift to the right side of the page, teams across the globe are actively engaged to fully address these headwinds with robust productivity actions to further boost their operational efficiency. We've also completed the price increases that we discussed with you in July and have recently taken further actions, which include communicating a new 5% surcharge in our North America Tools and Outdoor business, and further price increases across all of our businesses and regions during the fourth quarter. 
The combination of our market-leading brands, when coupled with a robust pipeline for innovation, provide a setup for volume and price-driven growth in 2022. And then finally, we continue to advance our margin resiliency initiatives and anticipate $100 million to $150 million of opportunity in 2022, which we can leverage to offset incremental headwinds, further invest in the business or contribute to margin outperformance. Within a complex environment, we believe that we've sized the productivity and pricing actions to exceed the anticipated 2022 headwinds, and we are taking the appropriate actions to position the business for margin improvement in the coming quarters. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Don to review guidance."
304977,1683287090,2415442,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lee. I will now outline the full year organic growth and margin rate assumptions overall and by segment. Our updated full year 2021 guidance calls for organic revenue growth of 16% to 17%. And at the midpoint, adjusted EPS expansion of 22% versus",880,"Thanks, Lee. I will now outline the full year organic growth and margin rate assumptions overall and by segment. Our updated full year 2021 guidance calls for organic revenue growth of 16% to 17%. And at the midpoint, adjusted EPS expansion of 22% versus the prior year and 31% versus 2019. 
Tools & Storage and Security organic growth expectations are consistent with our prior guidance, in the low 20s and the high single digits, respectively. The teams will continue to leverage price and cost actions in addition to operational productivity to counteract the extremely dynamic supply chain cost pressures. We are anticipating a relatively consistent level of revenue for Tools & Storage across Q3 and Q4, which both represent total growth in the mid- to high 20s versus the comparable periods in 2019.
Across all the segments, margin rates will be down year-over-year, largely due to the accelerated inflation impacts, which are partially mitigated by the incremental pricing actions that were or will be implemented during the third and fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $10.20 up to $10.45, inclusive of various onetime charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. On an adjusted basis, we are moderating the EPS outlook to $10.90 up to $11.10 from the previous range of $11.35 to $11.65. 
The key assumption changes to the company's prior EPS outlook includes the following 4 items: one, an incremental $230 million in commodity, transit and labor inflation, which is approximately $1.25 reduction to EPS; two, recent currency movements have resulted in a $0.15 negative EPS for 2021; three, these pressures will be partially mitigated by our incremental pricing actions and other actions, which add an incremental $0.30 to EPS; and then four, the benefit of a lower full year tax rate and other below-the-line assumption will contribute approximately $0.60 of improvement to EPS. 
We have also disclosed several key full year assumptions and our expectation for pretax M&A and other charges to assist you with your modeling. Lastly, the company expects free cash flow to be approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, which contemplates CapEx investment levels to be between 3% to 3.5% of revenue. This updated guidance reflects our desire to maintain temporarily higher levels of inventory to serve the strong demand and improve customer fill rates. That, combined with our supply chain investments, will set us up strong or very strong performance in 2022. 
So in summary, our revised guidance calls for consistent revenue expectations, generating organic growth of 16% to 17% and approximately 22% adjusted EPS expansion for the company in 2021. Considering the volatility in the operating environment that we all continue to navigate, this is an excellent top line performance with significant year-over-year EPS expansion. 
Moving to the right side of the page, I'll now outline some initial thoughts on 2022. While the environment remains dynamic, we have strong conviction that we can grow our core earnings base in addition to the MTD and Excel accretion. We have been investing in our supply chain and in a powerful set of organic growth initiatives that could fuel mid-single-digit organic volume growth in 2022. In addition, we have cost productivity to help us fund investments and enable healthy operating leverage. We are also actively addressing the inflationary environment with pricing actions that should result in 3.5 to 4 points of price next year and will allow us to move -- to more than fully recover the carryover impacts from inflation experienced in the second half of 2021. We believe this price and inflation dynamic can be a positive carryover benefit of approximately $0.20 of EPS in 2022. 
These factors added together should generate approximately $0.90 to $1.10 of EPS accretion. Additionally, MTD and Excel is expected to generate $0.50 of EPS and combined with the prior factors can result in significant double-digit EPS growth from operations. Below the line, we are assuming a $0.50 headwind, primarily from the tax benefit in 2021 which will not repeat next year. 
So to summarize, with the current inflation and demand environment, we are programming the business to deliver $1 of EPS growth versus our 2021 guidance. Tools & Security global markets continue to demonstrate strong demand and our customers have an optimistic view for 2022. Industrial will begin to see a cyclical recovery in 2022, most likely at a moderate pace. We have a clear plan for 2022 growth assuming that conditions we are experiencing today continue. These initial thoughts on what is possible in 2022 will be refined with our guidance to be issued in January once we have a clearer picture of various external inputs. 
That being said, the market demand environment remains very strong and supportive. We have a phenomenal set of growth catalysts across the businesses, and we are actively addressing the supply and inflation environment, which has not worsened from what we have experienced in Q3. We remain well positioned to deliver above-market organic growth with operating leverage, resulting in strong free cash flow generation that will drive top quartile shareholder returns over the long term. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim?"

It may not be obvious without stepping back from all this condensed information is this. When we deliver the organic growth in 2022 that Don discussed and when we closed the outdoor transactions, in combination, we will have added $6 billion of growth in the 2021, 2022 time period against a 2020 base of $14 billion. That is over 40% growth. 
So in summary, we continue to execute on the strong demand trends and deliver exceptional organic growth despite the temporarily challenging supply chain environment. We are enjoying positive secular trends, vibrant markets and a strong array of growth catalysts, and we expect this to continue. I am more than pleased with our team's efforts, and I'm excited about the enormous potential as we close out this year and look forward to continuing top and bottom line growth to drive shareholder value creation in the coming months and years.

We have really tied it to these cost to serve cost or additional cost to serve items that we believe, obviously, are transient in some level. It's just a question of how long they linger in the system. And we believe we have a very solid basis to make that price increase through a surcharge. We've received a lot of initial feedback from our customers and feel like we're in a very good place to ensure that gets in place in the fourth quarter. So feeling good about that at this stage. 
On the second question around data analytics, I mean, I believe that actually, on the pricing side, we got ahead of that a little earlier than we did on the supply chain side. And so we have fairly robust analytics in place around pricing. We look at pricing in a much broader way. So pricing is not just about list price increases or in this case, a surcharge. It's about how do you really manage the mix in the business appropriately, how do you manage the pricing of new products when you put them in the market to ensure that you're pricing them at the right premium, given the innovations that they are bringing to the end user. All those things have to be factored in. And our Tools team actually has a small organization that works on that full time. And their focus is really how do they drive margin improvement with all those different levers, which can be priced -- direct price increases, can be surcharges, can be mix management, new product introductions, as I mentioned. So all those things have to be looked at, and we've been doing that for about 2 years now. And so that's a little bit ahead of the supply chain data analytics that Jim described, which, really, that was driven by necessity in the summer and fall of last year, just given the complexity of the supply chain."

There's not a whole lot of restocking in that number. A couple of hundred million, maybe a tad more. But I think it is important to point out that the -- there's enough stock in the stores to support a POS growth environment, and then we're starting to see that in recent weeks. So we have gotten the inventories in retail up to where they were a year ago. And we still feel like there's maybe a 2-week to 3-week kind of additional opportunity for restocking and the retailers will enjoy higher fill rates when that happens.

We believe that everyone, for the most part, is doing some type of price increasing, the question is what geographies and what magnitude. Most of our competitors, if not all of them, are being impacted by higher logistical cost to serve, additional costs, so to speak. So everybody is dealing with the same dynamic. And it's a question of how much you want to have your margins impacted for a period of time versus offsetting it as quickly as you can with price increases. 
We've taken a very proactive approach where we have, as you saw, from leasing significant headwinds that we're dealing with here in 2021 that carry over into 2022. They appear to have stabilized in the last 30 to 45 days, which is, in our mind, a very positive sign. Maybe we've hit the peak in this area. So now it's really about how do you drive the price increases on various products in different geographies to more than offset that. And so we feel fairly confident at this point that we can get, if not 100% recovery on the price side versus the headwinds, pretty close to it. And so that's been our approach, then we have productivity that over and above that, that will help us fund investments and other things we need to do to continue to grow the business. That is the approach we're taking, and it's an unprecedented period of time around inflationary headwinds. But in some ways, it helps us do what we need to do because it is so significant and everyone in the industries that we serve are dealing with it."

So -- and one of the nice things about it, too, is that the pouch technology batteries do not compete with automotive. So we don't have to worry about the cylindrical cells that go into power tools being much, much a smaller part of the cylindrical cell market. 
I don't think cylindrical cells will go away over time, because the pouch cells are slightly more expensive. So there's probably a 10% to 20% type of premium on the cost of a battery that lasts twice as long. It's going to be a very pro oriented product. It's going to play beautifully with the Atomic and Extreme compact tools. And over time, I expect it to grow to be a significant part of the market. But I don't see a crowding out of the competitors. I mean there are active vital competitors who are continuing to invest, and it's a hotly contested race for market share. I think we're doing well, but so are some of the competitors."

This morning, we announced a record third quarter, which was powered by 11% growth, primarily a result of an impressive 10% organic growth performance. Customer demand remained at robust levels across commercial and retail end markets and strong trends continued in homebuilding and remodeling, commercial construction, professional activity and global economic growth. Innovation was also a positive, which is driving demand around electrification and other themes. 
We're continuing to prioritize meeting this heightened customer demand while operating in an unusually complex supply chain environment. I thank our 56,000 employees around the world for delivering record revenue under the circumstances. And in particular, I want to offer special thanks to our employee makers and plants, DCs and operations organizations as well as our sales and service people for their incredible dedication, agility and resilience to serve our customers during this period as they always do.  
Tools generated 13% organic growth in what we believe to be the strongest demand environment in our history, resulting from positive secular trends, robust professional activity and strong global markets. Our brands such as DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN, Stanley and Black & Decker, among others, were fueled by a steady stream of innovation and a strong and resilient supply chain, which is putting great products in the hands of our loyal end users across the globe. Industrial grew 1% organically, driven by continued double-digit growth and share gains in our general industrial and attachment tool businesses. as these end markets remained solid.  
Industrial growth was tempered, however, by lower auto production activity as OEMs continue to be impacted by electronic and other component shortages. Aerospace also experienced trough conditions as the industry recovery while promising to be likely in the foreseeable future, has yet to occur. Security delivered another strong quarter with 8% organic growth. The security transformation to a data-enabled cloud-based technology provider is building significant momentum, and our team successfully converted this robust backlog into revenue growth. Order rates were strong and we posted a third straight record quarter and backlog.  
We're excited about the full potential of these opportunities to support elevated revenue growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. The overall company adjusted operating margin rate was 12.2%, down from the prior year as growth investments and higher supply chain costs that accelerated in the quarter more than offset volume leverage, price mix benefits and margin resiliency. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.77, down 4% year-over-year. And similar to most companies engaged in global trade, our supply chain costs were higher this quarter. We have worked tirelessly to get components and finished products to where they need to be to serve this extraordinary customer demand. Through data analytics, we now have visibility into every container on and off the water, and we utilize this visibility to prioritize and expedite the most critical items, often with premium freight. To offset the additional expenses, we have deployed price increases, surcharges and productivity measures.  
To be clear, we have made a conscious decision to incur temporarily higher expediting costs to serve our customers and meet demand as effectively as possible. We have sized the pricing and productivity actions to ensure that we are well positioned to address the inflation and achieve margin accretion in 2022. This implies that our actions will be sufficient to restore our margins to normalized levels as the actions catch up to the higher costs in 2022. And further, we remain highly confident in our multiyear growth and margin expansion plans. There are several positive secular demand trends that are benefiting our businesses, and we remain bullish on the resi and nonresi construction markets as well as the industrial recovery.  
We have developed an array of growth drivers to position our businesses to capture this opportunity, and we are continuing to invest in innovation, manufacturing, automation, inventory and our supply chain to meet the strong demand in the near term and fuel sustainable growth over the medium and long terms.  
And now I'll take a moment to review our recently announced MTD and Excel acquisitions. The combination of these 2 high-quality complementary companies with our existing outdoor business creates a powerful growth engine with approximately $4 billion of revenue across all categories and channels in the $25 billion-plus outdoor category. Of the $4 billion, we expect approximately $3 million of that in -- of the $4 billion to be a direct result of closing the 2 transactions in the coming weeks. Even before that, we are starting from a position of strength with strong outdoor brands in DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and Black & Decker as well as the fastest-growing franchise in cordless electric outdoor products.  
Our legacy outdoor business is benefiting from the long-term trend of electrification, primarily now in handheld products and walk-behind mowers. MTD is one of the leading players in U.S. retail with great brands such as Cub Cadet and Troy-Bilt and brings a relentless dedication to innovation. Excel focuses on zero-turn mowers and offers a range of premier commercial grade and prosumer equipment, with Tier 1 niche pro brands such as Hustler and BigDog. Excel also brings us access to a strong and extensive professional dealer network. These acquisitions are complementary to each other and fill gaps in our current presence in the outdoor space, which brings me to another major growth driver.  
With these acquisitions, we have an ESG opportunity. to lead large-format electrification and outdoor. The customer adoption of electrified riders and zero-turn mowers is still in the early stages but the future potential is compelling. In collaboration with MTD, we have been making great progress since 2019 in developing innovative electrified solutions that offer a compelling value proposition in terms of run time, price point, and environmental impact. Additionally, MTD has semiautonomous and autonomous mowing technology, which we will commercialize in the coming years.  
Outdoor will undoubtedly unleash an array of impressive innovation over the next few years. Global channel development and professional branding are significant additional revenue synergies that we think as we think about ways to grow sales through our future outdoor activities, applying MTD's strong innovation with a leading professional brand like DEWALT presents an excellent opportunity to win the prouser with a full line of gas and electric options. To fully realize this potential, we plan to build on our existing position in retail as well as expand our sales in the pro dealer network.  
MTD has a strong presence in the retail channel with approximately 1,500 dealer locations. Excel exclusively distributes through its 1,400 outlet dealer channel, which is largely geographically complementary to MTD's dealers. The opportunities for brand, product and channel revenue synergies to expand sales and carry accretive margins are both meaningful and exciting. 
And finally, on one more outdoor growth front, we have an opportunity in the $4 billion high-margin parts service segment as we build our presence and serve our customers. The benefits from this growth will also come with margin expansion as we apply our SBD operating model and our global scale to execute on cost synergies, launch margin-accretive innovation and develop a vibrant professional franchise. We expect these opportunities to provide a pathway to mid-teens or higher margins over the long term. Both acquisitions are currently progressing through their respective regulatory processes. And for MTD, we are happy to say that the United States HSR review is complete. Additional reviews are underway in several other smaller countries. We currently anticipate to close in late 2021 or early '22 for both transactions pending successful completion of the regulatory processes.  
And as must be obvious, we're excited about the future of outdoor products at SBD. The significant ESG growth and margin opportunities have the potential for excellent value creation in 2022 and beyond. Extreme innovation is at the heart of SBD's culture. It is one of our 3 strategic pillars: performance, innovation and social responsibility. Innovation differentiates all our franchises and defines our brands. Over the last couple of years, we have brought incredible innovation to the market from FLEXVOLT to ATOMIC and XTREME and now DEWALT power stack and Black & Decker reviva, which I will cover in a few moments. It is clear that our tools innovation machine has never been stronger.  
Nonetheless, we are doubling down on our investments in innovation and new product commercialization. These investments will support the largest pipeline we have ever had with new products across all our major categories and end users. Over the last 12 months, we have added approximately 1,300 new employees with deep domain expertise and technical knowledge in critical areas, including sales, engineering, product management, brand, industrial design, e-commerce and end-user insights. Our supply chain investments are also key innovation enablers moving closer to the customer, adding capacity, improves agility, customer responsiveness and speed to market as we develop and commercialize new products. We have approximately $200 million of new innovation and growth investment projects in process which are included in our second half 2021 run rate.  
These projects will allow us to effectively better serve the strong global product demand for tools and position us for sustained long-term growth. Earlier this month, we announced our latest breakthrough innovation, the DEWALT POWERSTACK battery, a remarkable design and engineering achievement. POWERSTACK is the world's first power tool battery to leverage lithium-ion pouch cell technology and introduces a new era of performance for DEWALT power tools. POWERSTACK batteries will begin shipping in the fourth quarter of this year with annual growth potential measured in hundreds of millions. 
This is another example of our leading-edge differentiated innovation, driving the revenue growth potential of our core business. The POWERSTACK battery is 25% smaller, 15% lighter than our comparable DEWALT 20-volt 2 amp-hour battery and it delivers 50% more power with 2x the charge cycles, making this revolutionary design the lightest and most powerful and longest-lasting compact battery from DEWALT. And it is compatible with our DEWALT 20-volt system. The combination of POWERSTACK and our proven capabilities to design and manufacture the best and most compact brushless motors in the industry, we have just unlocked a new dimension for smaller, lighter and more powerful tools with enormous runway ahead.  
The importance of this innovation cannot be overstated. More power, more compact, lighter, lasts longer, guaranteed tough. We love it and so are the market. DEWALT is again asserting itself as the industry leader in professional power tools. And now for something also very exciting, but quite different. It's never been more important for companies to turn their attention to building a sustainable future for our global community. The Black & Decker reviva line is our latest customer offering and creating more sustainable products and driving innovation with purpose. This line of consumer's DIY tools features 50% post-consumer recycled content in the enclosures, which reduces virgin plastic use and supports closing the loop in a circular economy.  
Partnering with Eastman to apply their Tritan Renew material to our products has created the opportunity to reduce environmental impact, while continuing to develop the performance, durability and quality that our customers require. We are delighted to have found a long-term partner in Eastman, a company that will support and accelerate our wider, broader commitment to becoming a force for good in society. This product is a great example of how corporations can embrace ESG in a way that provides meaningful innovation to the consumer, reduces our impact on the environment and drives business performance. The Black & Decker revitalization is a major growth opportunity for the company, and reviva is just one great example of how we're making that happen.  
And now I will turn it over to Don to talk about our supply chain investments, our business segment results and how we are positioning the company for sustained long-term growth. Don?"

As Jim just highlighted in his opening remarks, we continue to see a range of powerful secular business drivers that are creating a path for strong multiyear growth for our businesses. In support of that, I want to spend a moment to share a few of the many actions we have taken to position our company for significant growth in 2022 and beyond. Three areas I would like to highlight include our latest investments in expanded manufacturing capacity, strategic sourcing partnerships and the further acceleration of our factory automation initiatives.  
Beginning with our manufacturing footprint. We are aligning our new investments with our Make Where We Sell strategy as we expand capacity globally. For example, in 2021, we are opening 2 new power tool plants and 1 new hand tool facility in North America. These 3 new facilities will enable shorter lead times. And once in place, our North American capacity will have tripled since 2016. These new manufacturing plants will be accompanied by a parallel regional development of our local supply chain base over time, enhancing local market sourcing and speed to market.  
As it relates to strategic sourcing, we have acted and continued to focus on securing sufficient supply of battery cells and electronic components using our power tools to support our long-term growth plans, which include the growing tailwind from electrification. We have co-invested with key battery suppliers to secure dedicated capacity for the next several years. In addition, we are adding new qualified suppliers to diversify our sourcing and working to increase our inventories for battery cells. We made great progress in 2021 and are well positioned for significant supply increases related to battery cells.  
As it relates to electronic components, we are following a very similar plan. We have made progress in 2021 and are on our way to securing the chips and the throughput to support at least 25% growth in our electronic component supply for 2022. This area is currently an intense pain point. However, we see a road map for significant improvement by early spring of 2022.  
Finally, we are leveraging our Industry 4.0 capabilities to drive manufacturing automation throughout many of our factories. We are deploying multiple projects in our Charlotte manufacturing facility that have a payback of less than 1 year. These flexible automation projects enable the labor efficiency and increased throughput required to deliver outsized productivity and enable our Make Where We Sell strategy.  
In summary, we have positioned our business to have the capacity, supply and throughput to deliver significant growth in 2022 and beyond. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the third quarter.  
Tools & Storage delivered record revenues as we maintained our focus on ensuring we keep up with the existing market demands. This resulted in 14% revenue growth with volume up 11%, price up 2% and currency contributing an additional point. The operating margin rate for the segment was 15.7%, down from 21.5% in the third quarter of last year as volume, price, productivity and benefits from innovation were more than offset by accelerating transit costs incurred to meet the strong market demand. Additionally, rising commodity inflation and new growth investments related to digital marketing and feet on the street offset those positive items I mentioned.  
All regions delivered organic growth, with North America up 9%, Europe up 20% and emerging markets up 28%. This performance was supported across all markets as the secular shifts related to the reconnection with the home and garden as well as e-commerce were amplified by our industry-leading innovation and the strong professional demand. The high single-digit North American growth was underpinned by another strong retail performance, up 6% as point-of-sale demand remained at robust levels in U.S. retail, and channel inventory remained below historical levels. The strong professional-driven demand was also demonstrated in the commercial and industrial channels posting 15% growth versus the prior year.  
Our thesis on demand is playing out as underlying construction activity remains strong and the Pro is driving growth, overcoming a robust growth performance in the comparable period last year and a little bit of moderation in the DIY category. Further demonstrating the durability of these trends, our latest POS results showed mid-single-digit growth over the last 4 weeks, covering late September through mid-October, with the last measured week up double digits, a very good signal of the healthy backdrop in U.S. retail.  
The European Tools business experienced growth across all major geographies along with the commercial, retail brick-and-mortar and e-commerce channels. The region grew 17% organically with a standout e-commerce outperformance, up 43% versus the prior year in addition to a notable DEWALT brand strength performance, which achieved 27% growth.  
Finally, in emerging markets, growth was pervasive across all regions and was led by trade solutions, cordless power tools and continued e-commerce momentum. All markets are consistently contributing to share gains, including 36% organic growth in Latin America and 22% organic growth in Asia. Finally, our enterprise-wide e-commerce strategic growth initiative continues to deliver strong results with third quarter global e-commerce revenue up nearly 20% versus 2020.  
Now let's turn to the Tools & Storage SBUs. Power Tools delivered 11% organic growth, which was supported by the new and innovative product launches across CRAFTSMAN, DEWALT and Stanley FatMax. Two great examples of these innovations are, one, Stanley 20-volt product line launch with improved battery technology; and two, several new offerings across both the XTREME and ATOMIC platforms.  
Moving on to the Outdoor business. All regions contributed to an 11% organic growth performance. This was driven by new listings and cordless innovations under the Black & Decker, CRAFTSMAN and DEWALT brands. Notably, global sales were up over 50% year-to-date as compared to 2020. We delivered industry-leading growth, rolling out new offerings in mowers and handheld products in 2021. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the results of our 2022 line reviews where we gained significant listings with all our major retailers, supporting our belief that outdoor electrification has the potential to be a major growth catalyst for the company. 
Finally, hand tools, accessories and storage grew 16% organically, fueled by a robust market demand and new product introductions across our key construction, auto and industrial markets. A few highlights include the 20-volt spot laser and the Elite circular saw blade within the construction space. Within the automotive aftermarket, CRAFTSMAN unveiled a new set of V-Series mechanics tools that are designed to professional specifications. We also launched a LENOX GEN-TECH carbide band saw for our industrial customers. A lot of wonderful innovation in the third quarter. 
Also during the quarter, the Tools & Storage team was awarded 46 Pro Tool Innovation Awards, representing best-in-class products in the construction industry. Well done, Tools team. I want to thank all the Tools & Storage employees around the world for their perseverance to navigate this dynamic environment to deliver a fantastic revenue result for the quarter. Demand in tools remains robust, lapping strong 2020 growth comps and Q3 saw strong mid-20s percentile growth as compared to 2019. 
Now shifting to Industrial. Segment revenue expanded by 1%, as 2 points of price and 1 point of currency was partially offset by 1 point of volume and 1 point from an oil and gas product line divestiture. Operating margin was 7.9%, down versus 12.3% in the third quarter of last year as the benefits from price and productivity were more than offset by commodity inflation, growth investments and volume declines in higher-margin automotive and aerospace fasteners. 
Looking further within this segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were down 1% as strong general industrial growth of 23% was offset by market-driven aerospace declines and lower automotive OEM production, resulting from the global semiconductor shortage. Our auto fastener growth outperformed light vehicle production by approximately 15 points for the quarter and year-to-date periods. This shows our value-add business model is generating share gains despite the OEM production schedule fluctuations. Infrastructure organic revenues were up 7%, as 16% growth in attachment tools was partially offset by lower pipeline project activity in oil and gas. Momentum continues to build in the attachment tools markets with strong backlogs and order rates at our OEM and independent dealer customers. 
As we look forward into 2022 and beyond, we are prepared to serve the cyclical growth recovery across many of our industrial end markets. 
Now shifting to Security. Total revenue was up 5%, with 7% volume and 1 point contributions from price, currency and acquisitions, which was partially offset by a 5-point decline related to the international divestitures completed in the third quarter of last year. North America was up 12% organically, driven by strong backlog conversion in commercial electronic security and solid growth within automatic doors and health care. 
Europe was positive organically led by data-driven product solutions in France, which is one of our most mature businesses and activating the new health and safety growth opportunities that we have outlined in the past. Our security business transformation is consistently driving top line momentum. Order rates globally grew 14% in the third quarter, resulting in the third consecutive record quarter end backlog. Overall Security segment profit rate, excluding charges, was 9.2%, down versus the prior year rate of 11% as price and volume gains were more than offset by higher labor costs, pandemic-related inefficiencies and growth investments such as SaaS solutions, touchless door technology and other health and safety options. 
We now have broad customer access, but new safety protocols are extending installation time lines. We are implementing price actions for these new realities while we continue to invest to fuel top line momentum. 
I will now turn the call to Lee McChesney who will review cash flow and provide an update on our response to the rising costs in key areas of our supply chain. Lee?"

Moving to Slide 11, let's review free cash flow performance. Third quarter free cash flow was a use of cash of $125 million, which brings our year-to-date results to a use of cash of $31 million. As you heard from Jim, we are focused on",552,"Thank you, Don. 
Moving to Slide 11, let's review free cash flow performance. Third quarter free cash flow was a use of cash of $125 million, which brings our year-to-date results to a use of cash of $31 million. As you heard from Jim, we are focused on serving our customers and have invested in inventory to serve the robust demand environment here in 2021 and in '22 and beyond, which is a major item that explains the year-over-year performance. There's also a normal seasonality pattern to our working capital that typically results in a significant amount of our cash flow generation occurring in the fourth quarter. We expect 2021 will follow that pattern and are planning for strong fourth quarter cash performance, while ensuring that we make the appropriate investments in inventory and CapEx to support all of our exciting growth initiatives. 
Let's now move to Page 12 and dive into the supply chain. The environment certainly remains dynamic as we serve the robust demand across the markets. During the third quarter, we experienced accelerated input cost inflation and higher cost to serve demand. We've initiated a comprehensive set of pricing and productivity actions in response. I'll now outline our latest expectations for inflation and our game plan for price recovery. Compared to our July guidance, key commodity inputs such as steel, resins and purchase components accelerated throughout the third quarter, contributing an incremental $100 million in costs. In addition, container and transportation costs, which largely drive our cost to serve, experienced a dramatic increase during the quarter. Average container spot prices are now nearly 7x what we were paying earlier this year. Average transit time from Asian suppliers to the North American manufacturing facilities and distribution centers have increased more than twofold from approximately 40 days to 85. Combined, these container and transit cost impacts added an additional $130 million of cost pressure. 
These underlying assumptions raise our full year commodity and supply chain headwinds to an estimate of approximately $690 million. Assuming the known impacts continue, we also are forecasting approximately $600 million to $650 million of carryover cost headwinds for 2022. Now if you shift to the right side of the page, teams across the globe are actively engaged to fully address these headwinds with robust productivity actions to further boost their operational efficiency. We've also completed the price increases that we discussed with you in July and have recently taken further actions, which include communicating a new 5% surcharge in our North America Tools and Outdoor business, and further price increases across all of our businesses and regions during the fourth quarter. 
The combination of our market-leading brands, when coupled with a robust pipeline for innovation, provide a setup for volume and price-driven growth in 2022. And then finally, we continue to advance our margin resiliency initiatives and anticipate $100 million to $150 million of opportunity in 2022, which we can leverage to offset incremental headwinds, further invest in the business or contribute to margin outperformance. Within a complex environment, we believe that we've sized the productivity and pricing actions to exceed the anticipated 2022 headwinds, and we are taking the appropriate actions to position the business for margin improvement in the coming quarters. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Don to review guidance."
304977,1683287090,2415557,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lee. I will now outline the full year organic growth and margin rate assumptions overall and by segment. Our updated full year 2021 guidance calls for organic revenue growth of 16% to 17%. And at the midpoint, adjusted EPS expansion of 22% versus",880,"Thanks, Lee. I will now outline the full year organic growth and margin rate assumptions overall and by segment. Our updated full year 2021 guidance calls for organic revenue growth of 16% to 17%. And at the midpoint, adjusted EPS expansion of 22% versus the prior year and 31% versus 2019. 
Tools & Storage and Security organic growth expectations are consistent with our prior guidance, in the low 20s and the high single digits, respectively. The teams will continue to leverage price and cost actions in addition to operational productivity to counteract the extremely dynamic supply chain cost pressures. We are anticipating a relatively consistent level of revenue for Tools & Storage across Q3 and Q4, which both represent total growth in the mid- to high 20s versus the comparable periods in 2019.
Across all the segments, margin rates will be down year-over-year, largely due to the accelerated inflation impacts, which are partially mitigated by the incremental pricing actions that were or will be implemented during the third and fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $10.20 up to $10.45, inclusive of various onetime charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. On an adjusted basis, we are moderating the EPS outlook to $10.90 up to $11.10 from the previous range of $11.35 to $11.65. 
The key assumption changes to the company's prior EPS outlook includes the following 4 items: one, an incremental $230 million in commodity, transit and labor inflation, which is approximately $1.25 reduction to EPS; two, recent currency movements have resulted in a $0.15 negative EPS for 2021; three, these pressures will be partially mitigated by our incremental pricing actions and other actions, which add an incremental $0.30 to EPS; and then four, the benefit of a lower full year tax rate and other below-the-line assumption will contribute approximately $0.60 of improvement to EPS. 
We have also disclosed several key full year assumptions and our expectation for pretax M&A and other charges to assist you with your modeling. Lastly, the company expects free cash flow to be approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, which contemplates CapEx investment levels to be between 3% to 3.5% of revenue. This updated guidance reflects our desire to maintain temporarily higher levels of inventory to serve the strong demand and improve customer fill rates. That, combined with our supply chain investments, will set us up strong or very strong performance in 2022. 
So in summary, our revised guidance calls for consistent revenue expectations, generating organic growth of 16% to 17% and approximately 22% adjusted EPS expansion for the company in 2021. Considering the volatility in the operating environment that we all continue to navigate, this is an excellent top line performance with significant year-over-year EPS expansion. 
Moving to the right side of the page, I'll now outline some initial thoughts on 2022. While the environment remains dynamic, we have strong conviction that we can grow our core earnings base in addition to the MTD and Excel accretion. We have been investing in our supply chain and in a powerful set of organic growth initiatives that could fuel mid-single-digit organic volume growth in 2022. In addition, we have cost productivity to help us fund investments and enable healthy operating leverage. We are also actively addressing the inflationary environment with pricing actions that should result in 3.5 to 4 points of price next year and will allow us to move -- to more than fully recover the carryover impacts from inflation experienced in the second half of 2021. We believe this price and inflation dynamic can be a positive carryover benefit of approximately $0.20 of EPS in 2022. 
These factors added together should generate approximately $0.90 to $1.10 of EPS accretion. Additionally, MTD and Excel is expected to generate $0.50 of EPS and combined with the prior factors can result in significant double-digit EPS growth from operations. Below the line, we are assuming a $0.50 headwind, primarily from the tax benefit in 2021 which will not repeat next year. 
So to summarize, with the current inflation and demand environment, we are programming the business to deliver $1 of EPS growth versus our 2021 guidance. Tools & Security global markets continue to demonstrate strong demand and our customers have an optimistic view for 2022. Industrial will begin to see a cyclical recovery in 2022, most likely at a moderate pace. We have a clear plan for 2022 growth assuming that conditions we are experiencing today continue. These initial thoughts on what is possible in 2022 will be refined with our guidance to be issued in January once we have a clearer picture of various external inputs. 
That being said, the market demand environment remains very strong and supportive. We have a phenomenal set of growth catalysts across the businesses, and we are actively addressing the supply and inflation environment, which has not worsened from what we have experienced in Q3. We remain well positioned to deliver above-market organic growth with operating leverage, resulting in strong free cash flow generation that will drive top quartile shareholder returns over the long term. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim?"

It may not be obvious without stepping back from all this condensed information is this. When we deliver the organic growth in 2022 that Don discussed and when we closed the outdoor transactions, in combination, we will have added $6 billion of growth in the 2021, 2022 time period against a 2020 base of $14 billion. That is over 40% growth. 
So in summary, we continue to execute on the strong demand trends and deliver exceptional organic growth despite the temporarily challenging supply chain environment. We are enjoying positive secular trends, vibrant markets and a strong array of growth catalysts, and we expect this to continue. I am more than pleased with our team's efforts, and I'm excited about the enormous potential as we close out this year and look forward to continuing top and bottom line growth to drive shareholder value creation in the coming months and years. 
And finally, I am excited about all the cultural advancements we have made in recent times to attract, inspire and engage talent in the 2020s requires an acute awareness and commitment to deliver what that talent is looking for in their company's employee value proposition.

We have really tied it to these cost to serve cost or additional cost to serve items that we believe, obviously, are transient in some level. It's just a question of how long they linger in the system. And we believe we have a very solid basis to make that price increase through a surcharge. We've received a lot of initial feedback from our customers and feel like we're in a very good place to ensure that gets in place in the fourth quarter. So feeling good about that at this stage. 
On the second question around data analytics, I mean, I believe that actually, on the pricing side, we got ahead of that a little earlier than we did on the supply chain side. And so we have fairly robust analytics in place around pricing. We look at pricing in a much broader way. So pricing is not just about list price increases or in this case, a surcharge. It's about how do you really manage the mix in the business appropriately, how do you manage the pricing of new products when you put them in the market to ensure that you're pricing them at the right premium, given the innovations that they are bringing to the end user. 
All those things have to be factored in. And our Tools team actually has a small organization that works on that full time. And their focus is really how do they drive margin improvement with all those different levers, which can be priced -- direct price increases, can be surcharges, can be mix management, new product introductions, as I mentioned. So all those things have to be looked at, and we've been doing that for about 2 years now. And so that's a little bit ahead of the supply chain data analytics that Jim described, which, really, that was driven by necessity in the summer and fall of last year, just given the complexity of the supply chain."

But you can see we delivered on our third quarter organic growth commitment, 10% despite the challenges that we faced.

There's not a whole lot of restocking in that number. A couple of hundred million, maybe a tad more. But I think it is important to point out that the -- there's enough stock in the stores to support a POS growth environment, and then we're starting to see that in recent weeks. So we have gotten the inventories in retail up to where they were a year ago. And we still feel like there's maybe a 2-week to 3-week kind of additional opportunity for restocking and the retailers will enjoy higher fill rates when that happens.

If you look about how things will kind of play out quarter-by-quarter, we will see a significant improvement in Q1 versus Q4. Things will get a little bit better in Q2 and then the back half, you'll see another step up of maybe 0.5 point to 1 point in the back half versus the front half. So we would expect continued progression and improvement in those areas as the cost to serve will still be very high, particularly in the first half of the year.

We believe that everyone, for the most part, is doing some type of price increasing, the question is what geographies and what magnitude. Most of our competitors, if not all of them, are being impacted by higher logistical cost to serve, additional costs, so to speak. So everybody is dealing with the same dynamic. And it's a question of how much you want to have your margins impacted for a period of time versus offsetting it as quickly as you can with price increases. 
We've taken a very proactive approach where we have, as you saw, from leasing significant headwinds that we're dealing with here in 2021 that carry over into 2022. They appear to have stabilized in the last 30 to 45 days, which is, in our mind, a very positive sign. Maybe we've hit the peak in this area. So now it's really about how do you drive the price increases on various products in different geographies to more than offset that. And so we feel fairly confident at this point that we can get, if not 100% recovery on the price side versus the headwinds, pretty close to it. And so that's been our approach, then we have productivity that over and above that, that will help us fund investments and other things we need to do to continue to grow the business. That is the approach we're taking, and it's an unprecedented period of time around inflationary headwinds. But in some ways, it helps us do what we need to do because it is so significant and everyone in the industries that we serve are dealing with it."

It is, as I mentioned in my remarks, 50% more power, 25% more compact, 15% lighter, and it lasts twice as long. You get twice as many charge cycles. So -- and one of the nice things about it, too, is that the pouch technology batteries do not compete with automotive. So we don't have to worry about the cylindrical cells that go into power tools being much, much a smaller part of the cylindrical cell market. 
I don't think cylindrical cells will go away over time, because the pouch cells are slightly more expensive. So there's probably a 10% to 20% type of premium on the cost of a battery that lasts twice as long. It's going to be a very pro oriented product. It's going to play beautifully with the Atomic and Extreme compact tools. And over time, I expect it to grow to be a significant part of the market. But I don't see a crowding out of the competitors. I mean there are active vital competitors who are continuing to invest, and it's a hotly contested race for market share. I think we're doing well, but so are some of the competitors."
