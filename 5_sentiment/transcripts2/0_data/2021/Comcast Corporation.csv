I'm really proud of our fourth quarter results and look forward to giving you a glimpse of what we're focused on and excited about once we come out of this pandemic. Our most recent performance was highlighted by",1791,"Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm really proud of our fourth quarter results and look forward to giving you a glimpse of what we're focused on and excited about once we come out of this pandemic. Our most recent performance was highlighted by cable, which grew EBITDA by over 12% and net cash flow by 26%. These are the best results of the year and of any fourth quarter in over a decade. We also have good news to share on our parks segment, which reached breakeven, excluding Beijing, even with Hollywood being closed. Our premium ad-supported streaming service, Peacock, now has 33 million sign-ups within just 6 months of its nationwide launch. And encouragingly, Sky's customer and revenue base essentially returned to pre-COVID levels this past quarter. Clearly, our company is strong, a testament to the tough decisions made by our leadership team and the excellent execution and coordination by our dedicated employees. 
Looking back over the whole year, 2020 was one of the most uncertain and challenging periods that any of us can remember. But we rose to the occasion, ensuring the safety and protection of our employees, providing customers with unparalleled service and innovative products that they relied on more than ever, strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet and continuing to invest for long-term growth and success. 
This year's cable results were nothing short of exceptional, hitting a number of company records. We generated 2 million net broadband additions for the year and $538,000 for the fourth quarter, reaching record low churn. High-speed Internet drove our highest ever full year net customer relationship additions of $1.6 million, bringing us to 33 million total customer relationships. Yet with just only 50% penetration of our footprint, there remains plenty of opportunity for future growth. We also delivered outstanding EBITDA growth of nearly 9% and cash flow growth of 16% for all of 2020. Broadband is the cornerstone of what we do, powered by our robust, flexible and reliable network and then many years of investments we've made have been on full display. We've continued to enhance our market-leading competitive position while keeping people connected protected, informed and entertained by proactively managing our network, increasing broadband speeds, expanding our Internet Essentials program for low-income households providing payment plans for customers struggling the most and offering Peacock and Flex for free. 
This pandemic has forced us to rethink the way we operate and service our customers. Immediately, we moved all of our care reps to work remotely from home, which has gone so well that we're leaning towards embracing this model permanently. In addition, we promoted further adoption of our digital self-help tools, such as Xfinity Assistant, which are available 24/7. We also expanded our self-installation eligibility, and now over 2/3 of our customers are connecting to our services this way. We are working hard with our communications and marketing efforts to enhance awareness of all we have to offer, which enables us to take costs out of the business while delivering a better experience for our customers. In fact, in the past 12 months, we've reduced agent-handled calls by over 16 million and truck rolls by 1.6 million, all while adding the more than 1.5 million net new customer relationships. 
Our efforts to reduce costs have been extremely successful, but what's even more exciting are the investments we're making to grow the overall business. A great example is Flex, which is offered to all of our broadband-only customers for free so that they can connect seamlessly to the streaming services they love. Within the first half of this year, Flex, along with X1, will be carrying all of the top streaming apps in the United States. We just added HBO Max. We'll be adding Disney+ in the near future, and we have many more on the road map. Flex has been a major win for us, and we continue to have really high hopes. 
Xfinity Mobile just came off a strong fourth quarter with nice sequential improvement in customer additions, resulting from a number of significant changes as we fully integrate mobile into our core cable operations, and reprioritized our sales channels. We're really excited for 2021 as we've recently expanded parts of our MVNO agreement with Verizon that will enable us to improve our range of offerings and acquire more customers more profitably. As we said from the beginning, an MVNO-led capital-light wireless model is the right one for us and has even more strategic opportunity in the years ahead. The services came back faster than we expected. This quarter, we added 26,000 net new customers and generated revenue growth of 4.8%, the highest we've seen since the pandemic began with less than 20% share of an approximately $50 billion total addressable commercial market in our footprint. We saw plenty of runway. So all in all, cable had a fantastic 2020, and we look forward to a very strong 2021 and beyond. 
While the global pandemic has had a more significant impact on NBCUniversal, we took advantage of this moment to make a number of changes in both management and operations that sets us up for success. The most notable example is the reorganization of our cable networks and broadcast television businesses, which are now combined, along with Peacock, in a structure meant to drive long-term cost efficiencies and revenue opportunities. We finished the year having renewed a number of carriage agreements with many of our valuable distribution partners, putting us in a position of strength as we enter 2021. 
Peacock has had an exceptional start, exceeding all of our internal targets. This premium hybrid AVOD service, which has a light ad load and is unlike any other, offers a breadth of content that appeals to just about every demographic at an unbeatable consumer value, much of it for free. Momentum has further accelerated with the addition of The Office, which we own and began streaming exclusively on Peacock as of January 1. Not only is The Office driving incremental users, but these viewers are naturally finding and watching other programs on this platform, like Parks and Rec, Yellowstone; our latest original, Saved by the Bell; mega hit movies from Universal and other studios and sporting events such as the Premier League, golf and even an NFL wild card game. And earlier this week, we announced that modern family will be coming to Peacock next month, followed by the WWE in March. 
In film, our decision to release our titles direct-to-consumer via premium video-on-demand when theaters were forced to close, has proven to be profitable and the right move for us. While we look forward to when we can enjoy the theatrical release of many franchise films, such as Fast 9 and the next Minions and Jurassic World, we will lean into what has become a successful hybrid distribution model. COVID had the most direct impact on our theme parks, which were either closed or running at limited capacity for the bulk of 2020. But I'm pleased with how quickly we were able to reopen Orlando and Osaka while ensuring the safety of our staff and guests. We continue to provide an amazing entertainment experience. Our guests are responding, as confirmed by our steadily increased attendance and our most recent financial results. What we saw this fourth quarter, especially in Orlando, gives us even more conviction in the momentum that our theme parks will experience when we reach a sustainable recovery. We may experience some near-term setbacks with the most recent pickup in COVID cases, but I'm optimistic as ever about the long-term trajectory of this very special business. 
Sky had a strong and encouraging fourth quarter. We added net new customers in every market bringing our customer base essentially back to pre-COVID levels. The same can be said for revenue, which was essentially flat from what we generated in the fourth quarter of 2019. And we continue to make meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives. Sky Q, which integrates streaming, has surpassed 60% penetration in the U.K. and is poised to continue with recent additions of Disney Plus, Discovery Plus and Amazon Prime video. We're really pleased with the success of Sky Originals, which contributed to the 20% increase in viewership on our Sky entertainment channels during the fourth quarter and all of 2020, reaffirming our commitment to creating Sky studios and expanding original programming. 
While the recent wave of COVID infections and related lockdowns across Europe are once again creating disruption, we are implementing the same protocols and procedures that worked the first time around with confidence of a similar pattern as this latest lockdown recedes. We really look forward to the second half of this year when we will also start to see the benefits from the reset of major sports rights contracts and cost savings that should result from a new, leaner operating model. And we're still on plan to double 2020 EBITDA over the next several years, as Jeremy recently laid out. 
Speaking of Jeremy, I want to thank him for his exceptional leadership of Sky and for his partnership since the acquisition. He and the team have established a unique world-class brand and a strong, well-run business that's now fully integrated. I'm thrilled for Dana Strong, who has now taken over as CEO of Sky. Many of you on this call have met with Dana since she joined our cable business as Head of Consumer Services back in 2018. She is an accomplished executive with a wonderful ability to transform, inspire and drive positive change. On top of all that, she also has over 20 years of international experience with nearly half of it spent in Europe. 
2021 offers a lot of promise for Comcast and hopefully for the entire world. While the first half will be more challenged than the second due to the most recent strain of COVID, we're really encouraged by the promise of a vaccine, which is the first step in putting the parts of our business that have been most impacted back on a path toward growth. This optimism is shared by our Board of Directors, which this morning announced an increase in our dividend for the 13th consecutive year. I'm also pleased that it's now our expectation that we will return to repurchasing shares in the back half of this year. 
While 2020 was not what any of us had imagined a year ago at this time, our execution, cooperation and fast decision-making enabled all parts of Comcast, NBC, Universal and Sky to respond and manage through a difficult environment, remarkably well. I'm truly proud of what we have accomplished, and our fourth quarter shows just how well this company is positioned to succeed. 
Mike, over to you."
173341,698628338,2183822,"Comcast Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Now I'll review our fourth quarter 2020 results and make some comments on current conditions and, where possible, on the year ahead. Let's begin on Slides 4 and 5 with our consolidated results. Revenue declined",2531,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Now I'll review our fourth quarter 2020 results and make some comments on current conditions and, where possible, on the year ahead. 
Let's begin on Slides 4 and 5 with our consolidated results. Revenue declined 2.4% to $27.7 billion for the fourth quarter and 4.9% to $103.6 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA declined 15% to $7.2 billion for the fourth quarter and 10% to $30.8 billion for the full year. Covet related severance and restructuring charges were $590 million in the fourth quarter and $828 million for the full year as we took actions to position our businesses for success in a post-COVID world. 
The corporate and other segment includes these charges and also includes Peacock for its launch year. For 2020, Peacock revenue of over $100 million while EBITDA losses approached $700 million. We continue to expect that EBITDA losses for 2020 and 2021 combined for Peacock will total roughly $2 billion. 
Adjusted earnings per share declined 29% to $0.56 for the quarter and 17% to $2.61 for the year. Finally, free cash flow was $1.7 billion in the quarter and $13.3 billion for the full year, reflecting the decline in EBITDA and the benefit from a reduction in working capital and capital expenditures, in part due to the pandemic. 
Now let's review our business segments starting with cable communications on Slide 6. For the fourth quarter, cable communications revenue increased 6.3%, while EBITDA increased 12% and adjusted EBITDA less capital grew 26%. For the full year, we grew customer relationships by $1.6 million, a 41% increase year-over-year with 455,000 net additions in the fourth quarter, driven by high-speed Internet, where we added 2 million net new residential and business customers this year and 538,000 in the fourth quarter. These record customer additions were the primary driver of our high-speed Internet revenue growth of 13% for the quarter and 10% for the full year. 
Other revenue highlights include acceleration in both business services and wireless. Business services posted 4.8% revenue growth and 26,000 net new customer additions primarily driven by improvement in small businesses. Wireless revenue grew 36% with 246,000 net new lines in the quarter, bringing us to 2.8 million total lines at year-end. Wireless is a strategic priority for us and should accelerate on the back of several actions we have taken. First, we've expanded our Verizon MVNO agreement. Second, we fully integrated mobile into our core operations. And third, we've refined our marketing and activated all of our sales channels, and we're seeing a nice lift in our retail stores which are now fully open. 
For video, revenue declined 0.7% with higher rates implemented in the beginning of 2020 more than offset by subscriber declines including a 248,000 net loss in customers this quarter, and advertising revenue increased 34% year-over-year or 2.2%, excluding political, which almost doubled what we had generated in the last presidential election cycle in 2016. 
Turning to expenses. Cable communications fourth quarter expenses increased 2.4%. Programming expenses were up 7.2% primarily due to the number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020, combined with annual escalators in existing agreements. Nonprogramming expenses declined slightly, reflecting lower technical and product support and customer service costs, which were partially offset by higher advertising, marketing and promotion spend to drive top line growth and higher expenses associated with the increased political advertising activity this quarter. Nonprogramming expenses per customer relationship decreased 5.1% despite our record customer growth. 
Cable Communications EBITDA grew by 12% in the quarter and 8.6% for the full year, with margins reaching 42.1%, an improvement of 170 basis points, excluding the RSN adjustments that impacted results earlier in the year. Cable capital expenditures decreased 1.1% resulting in CapEx intensity of 13.5%. For the full year, capital expenditures declined 4.4%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 11%, our lowest full year on record and an improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year, exclusive of RSN adjustments, driven by lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital partially offset by higher spending on scalable infrastructure, which was driven by our ongoing investment to enhance the capacity of our network to support increased data usage. 
Turning to the current environment. High-speed Internet customer additions remain healthy, and we have all the pieces in place for 2021 to be a very strong year. We also have to remember that 2020 was exceptional on many accounts, and because of that, we view 2019, which was also very strong for us, as the more appropriate year against which to benchmark our performance. 
Turning to video. We expect the higher video rates we implemented at the beginning of this year, resulting from our current programming renewal cycle to drive video sub losses back to the levels we had experienced in the first half of 2020. Our video strategy is centered on profitability. We do not chase unprofitable video subscribers as we can now offer Flex for free to those who prefer a streaming-only entertainment option. 
Looking to the full year, we expect cable communications revenue growth to exceed the 3.4% we just reported for 2020 as we remain focused on driving our connectivity businesses with better year-over-year comparisons in the first half. We expect programming expense growth to increase at high single-digit levels, similar to the fourth quarter as programming carriage renewals roll through in 2021. The programming expense growth is expected to moderate in 2022 and thereafter. Nonprogramming operating expense growth should normalize at a low single-digit increase to 2019 levels as we support the higher level of customer relationships and accelerate growth in our wireless business, which we expect will achieve stand-alone profitability in 2021. 
With our consistent discipline on expenses and capital investment, coupled with the trends at work as we remain focused on connectivity, we are confident in our ability to increase profitability, expand margins and improve CapEx intensity, both in 2021 and thereafter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for NBCUniversal. For the fourth quarter, NBCUniversal revenue decreased 18% to $7.5 billion, and EBITDA decreased 21% to $1.6 billion. Cable Networks revenue was down 6.4% in the fourth quarter, driven by a 38% decline in content licensing and other revenue, while distribution revenue was flat compared to a year ago, reflecting the absence of carriage renewals, combined with modest sequential improvement in subscriber losses. The delay to the start of the NBA and NHL seasons had a negative impact on our advertising revenue, which declined 4.2%, while the related shift of sports rights amortization out of the quarter was a benefit to EBITDA, which grew 22% year-over-year. For the full year, Cable Networks EBITDA increased 4% primarily driven by the sports-related impacts of COVID. Fewer sporting events in 2020 contributed to lower distribution and advertising revenue, as well as lower programming and production expenses of $655 million year-over-year. Seasons were shortened earlier in the year and current seasons were delayed, pushing a number of events and the related rights amortization costs for 2021. So looking to 2021, we expect healthy distribution revenue growth as a result of recent successful carriage renewals. We also currently expect significantly more sporting events compared to 2020, which should result in higher advertising revenue but also a significant increase in sports-related programming and production costs, equating to a low double-digit decline in Cable Networks' EBITDA this year. 
Turning to broadcast. Revenue decreased 12% in the fourth quarter due to a 39% decline in content licensing and a 9.6% decline in advertising revenue partially offset by another quarter of double-digit increases in retransmission consent fees. The content licensing revenue declines at both broadcast and cable networks were timing related as sales to streaming platforms, including Peacock, were more heavily concentrated in the first 9 months of the year. We also had a difficult comparison to a significant library deal in last year's fourth quarter. The decline in advertising revenue was driven by lower ratings, partly due to the delayed launch of our fall season. This was somewhat offset by record levels of political advertising at our local stations. The lower revenues were partially offset by a decline in operating costs, reflecting lower content licensing and the delay in production due to COVID-19, resulting in a decline of 24% to $356 million in broadcast EBITDA. 
Filmed Entertainment revenue declined 8.3%, and EBITDA increased 65% to $151 million for the fourth quarter. Theatrical revenue declined 70% due to theaters being either closed or operating at limited capacity, while content and licensing increased 23% driven by PVOD. Expenses were significantly lower due to fewer releases as a result of COVID-19. In 2021, we hope to debut a number of our franchised films in theaters. Such as Fast 9 and Minions 2, but the situation remains fluid, and we are still adjusting our 2021 slate to maximize value, as evidenced by our recent decision to push back the release of Boss Baby 2 from March to September. 
Theme parks revenue was $579 million in the quarter with an EBITDA loss of $15 million. These results reflect Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Japan operating at limited capacity while Hollywood remains closed. Results also include $45 million of Universal Beijing preopening costs. For 2021, keep in mind that the first quarter tends to be seasonally light in terms of attendance, and we also expect an increased COVID impact given new restrictions in Japan, which have also caused us to delay the opening of Super Nintendo World. We are pleased that Universal Beijing remains set to open this summer with preopening costs ramping to $300 million in the first half of this year. 
One last item I'd like to highlight, we will be changing the way we report for NBCUniversal starting in the first quarter of 2021 with the largest impact being to our television businesses as we combine Cable Networks and Broadcast into one segment along with Peacock. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for Sky, which I'll speak to on a constant currency basis. Sky revenue for the fourth quarter declined 0.9% to $5.2 billion, reflecting a 2.8% decline in direct-to-consumer revenue, driven mostly by our hospitality or pubs and clubs segment. Which was challenged by additional COVID-related lockdowns during the quarter. Excluding hospitality, direct-to-consumer revenue was essentially flat year-over-year with solid low single-digit growth in the U.K. Somewhat offsetting the decline in direct-to-consumer revenue was a 10% increase in content revenue as we monetized our original programming while advertising revenue grew 3.9% as Sky outperformed a challenged advertising market helped by a strong performance in the U.K. Sky added 244,000 net new customers in the quarter, bringing us essentially back to pre-COVID levels of total customer relationships with additions in all markets, driven by a very healthy streaming business. We've also seen strong uptake in our broadband and mobile products in the U.K. Sky EBITDA was $139 million as the fourth quarter was impacted by a number of expense items such as incremental sports rights amortization related to the shift of sporting events that have been delayed as a result of COVID-19, higher investments in entertainment programming, costs related to the launch of our new Sky channels last May as well as higher marketing spend to promote strategic initiatives such as Sky Q, growth in our mobile product in the U.K. and broadband in Italy. 
Looking ahead, we would characterize 2021 as a tale of 2 halves. The first half is under pressure due to the recent increase in COVID-related restrictions to the extreme levels we experienced at the beginning of the pandemic. With the government mandating the closure of pubs and clubs as well as many retail outlets, we are experiencing weakness in hospitality and advertising, and we now expect Sky's first quarter revenue to decline slightly year-over-year. We also expect first half expenses to be elevated when compared to 2020 as higher sports rights amortization resulting from sporting events being postponed from 2020 to 2021 will be with us through the second quarter. In nonsports-related costs, we will see an increase as we grow broadband and mobile in the U.K., broadband in Italy and launched the SMB business in the U.K. later this quarter. In the second half of '21, we expect a quick recovery in hospitality and advertising revenue once these latest restrictions are lifted and an acceleration in EBITDA growth from the tailwinds related to our major sports rights resets and more efficient operating structure. 
I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 9. We generated $13.3 billion in free cash flow and paid $4.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders in 2020. Consolidated total capital, which includes CapEx as well as software and intangibles, decreased 6.4% for the year to $11.6 billion, while working capital improved by $2.2 billion to a decline of $178 million for the full year, both reflecting an impact from COVID. Looking to 2021, we anticipate total capital will remain relatively flat to 2020 levels, while the working capital drag will increase relative to the levels we saw in 2019, which is the more appropriate comparison due to an increase in content investment, our broadcast of the Olympics and the reversal of COVID-related onetime tax deferrals. 
Turning to capital allocation. Our strategy has always been a balance of several important priorities: maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in profitable organic growth and returning capital to shareholders. First, on our balance sheet. We've made great progress reducing net debt from $108 billion post the Sky acquisition at the end of 2018 to $90 billion at the end of 2020. Second, we remain focused on organic investment in our businesses to grow the long-term earnings power of the company, including our CapEx investment in broadband and parks and continued investment behind other growth initiatives where we see strong return on investments, such as Xfinity Mobile, Peacock, Flex, Sky Q and broadband in Italy. Third, we are committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, and we have a proven track record. We have increased our dividend 13 years in a row, at a 17% CAGR, significantly in excess of the S&P over that same time period. In addition, we have a demonstrated history of buying back stock, having reduced our share count by nearly 20% between the NBCUniversal and Sky acquisitions. In 2021, we believe we will be able to return to our historical practice of returning ample capital to our shareholders. We are again raising the dividend by $0.08 a share to $1 per share, and we are planning to return to buying back our stock. As Brian mentioned, our hope is to start in the back half of this year, gradually ramping up to historical levels, while we continue to pace towards hitting our intended target leverage levels, which we currently expect to reach by year-end 2022. The specific timing and magnitude of our buyback activity will be subject to improvement in our businesses most impacted by the pandemic and the implications related to potential changes in tax policy.

But as we think about the longer term, how do you look at last year's performance and some of the specific drivers in terms of their durability beyond the pandemic?  And then for Jeff, you guys laid out, and I realize this is prior to your elevation as CEO, I think, 30 million to 35 million active accounts on Peacock by 24.

We're taking share and the sources are geographic all over the country where we serve and across the board competitively with DSL sources, telco, wired, wireless and other competitors. So I think while they're in '20, truly an exceptional year for performance. And as Brian said, I think the right way of looking at '20, you've got to look at the full year results. And when you do that, the $2 million net customer additions, it really is extraordinary. The fundamentals that we see going forward, low churn, we compete well on the front end because we've consistently invested in the best network in the marketplace, I think, that is ubiquitous. We deliver the best overall service, redefine the category in speed, coverage, control and now streaming. And so you add up all those things, I think you -- it points towards strong organic growth. But as you look to next year, as Mike said, we do have a healthy start to the year. We're really encouraged to -- at what we're seeing right out of the gates. But I do think 2020, as everybody went home, and there's just a lot more in a short period of time, folks that were working from home, schooling from home. I think there is -- that's a unique moment. But I think the fundamentals continue. We have penetration upside. There's growth opportunities that we believe strongly. I think '19 was a very strong year, too, by the way.

People sign up, then they use it actively and then the usage per user that drives the amount of hours we sell in advertising. And we were up significantly over all of our metrics versus what we anticipated going into the business. We're only -- we launched this on Comcast just over 9 months ago and nationally just over 6 months ago. So we're at the very beginning of this business. But we're very confident based on the small amount of time that the business model is exactly the right business model. People are signing up. They're using it more than we expected, and advertisers are very interested in buying it. So this steady growth is very promising for us. And we don't have anything to reframe at this point, but I think that the performance, that is much better than we expected, gives us a lot of optionality going forward, but we're just going to continue to drive this business model now and focus on the advertising revenue."

And while our restructuring definitely took a lot of cost out of the business, but you're starting to see in the numbers, the real purpose of it was to allow us to grow it in the future and really run it as one business. So Cable Networks, obviously, are a big part of the business. They're still the biggest EBITDA driver, and I don't expect that to change anytime in the near future. But we're looking at the 2 revenue streams of the business, it's subscription and advertising, as one business, broadcast, cable and Peacock, and we're programming it as such. We're selling it to advertisers as one platform as such. And so I think, over time, it will be harder and harder to distinguish between the profitability of Cable Networks and the rest of our television business because we're looking at it as  one business, but the restructuring allows us to run it like that, and we think that, that's going to allow us to really grow the business over time."

We've had a great partnership and glad that one important aspect of things is that improved MVNO. Brian mentioned the capital-light approach is working for us. We think it's going to work in the future. So I think as a starting point, this certainly will enable us to amplify what we're already doing, really push towards a range of offers to keep us very competitive. We continue to grab, switch and share in the mobile space. But you back up for a second, and we're just -- overall, we have been pleased, and we're very optimistic about the mobile business and what it will do, in particular, continues to perform very well for broadband retention. And so we're committed to accelerating growth in mobile and we mentioned this last time. And while the MVNO enhancement is a nice step forward, there are a lot of other things that we're doing like, really going after every single sales channel that we have. We reopened retail in a safe mode, new safety protocols. And every single sales channel, whether it's digital, call centers, you name it, we're really focusing on mobile. So we're also leaning into 5G. We'll participate very much in 5G, and we're featuring mobile in packaging with broadband, leading, in some cases. When there's a new product NPI, whether it's Apple, Samsung, we use that moment to literally lead with mobile. So I think, overall, we're really pleased. And I think it -- we feel good about the runway. I would also point towards our overarching plan that, one, we have access to, I think, the country's best network with Verizon, and so talked about that. I think we also are leveraging -- continue to leverage WiFi. And we are -- we've always uniquely provided a great experience, not just in the home. We're improving things outside in the public area. And then over time, I think the other key thing too is being able to add a third layer which could be our own targeted wireless infrastructure, which we might use to supplement the Verizon network and really go after the high dense usage areas, spectrum that we've already acquired. So I think all these factors point towards, I think, a unique opportunity for us."

Wherever the world may be in Japan in July, that will be up to the country and host committee. If in the event it doesn't happen, we have another Olympics coming in Beijing 7 months later or so.

I mean, obviously, we've been talking, Brian and I and team for a while about our desire to get back into the historical balance on capital allocation, which, as you know, is keeping the balance sheet strong, making healthy investments in the organic growth across our businesses, which I think from listening to the call today, anyone would, I hope, gather that we continue to be very much leaning into doing that where we see returns and opportunity to make investments in these businesses for growth and then get back to our balance with complete capital return. It's the 13th year we've increased the dividend, but we turned off buybacks for a while and want to return to being in that portion of the return element as well. So as I said, we're pleased with where the balance sheet is. We've gotten net debt down to $90 billion from 108 after Sky. Just the evidence that we're seeing in parks in the fourth quarter, we were breakeven x the Beijing pre-operating cost even with Hollywood closed and even with the capacity constraints, just gives us a high degree of confidence that when people can return to travel on the other side of vaccinations outpacing the virus, that we're going to see the COVID-impacted EBITDA businesses snap back to historical levels. 
To your point, it's going to take 12 months for it to run through and get a full -- and get it fully back. Hence, our point that in the second half of this year, we'd expect to see the beginnings of that. And rather than wait for a full 12 months, we'll start -- we hope and plan to begin our buyback at that moment. We'll keep it at the historical level, call it, as much as $5 billion ramp-up to that and probably stay there until we actually get to the definition that you called out with -- on a 12-month trailing basis to get to around or just inside 2.5x, and I expect that to happen by the end of 2022."

Historically, you've tended to redeploy that excess liquidity into your strategic M&A program. And so the question is how do you think about the medium- to long-term importance of preserving dry powder for that type of flexibility versus whether your current asset portfolio is sufficiently well suited to meet your long-term operating targets?"

Brian can obviously chime in. But I think we feel very good about the collection of businesses that we have, how they fit together, how the -- how sky is enabled together with cable and NBC things that our -- advances in the 3 pillars that Brian described, broadband streaming and aggregation. So I won't repeat too many of those proof points of what we are as a company. But we'll always look at M&A, but I don't think there's any doubt that we are very pleased and don't see any strategic gaps in the portfolio that we have. So we'll talk about it when we get to the 2.5x, but I wouldn't suggest that beyond that stage, we would just delever. I mean we get inside that number, and from there, we'll have options, and we'll discuss it with folks as we get there. But it's -- that's where we stand today. Brian, anything else you want to add?"

I would just add 2 other things. I think it's an important moment for us with -- today in getting to a point that we feel the businesses are healthy that we can see, we believe and we hope, obviously, things can change with progress with the vaccinations, and the impaired business is really having a road map to full recovery and beyond. And so getting back in balance with, as Mike described earlier, I think, is really important, something that I certainly really have wanted us to get to. Second, we've also said that we like the mix of businesses. Roughly 70% of the company being broadband-centric is -- proved to be a really successful model. And we've had 10 wonderful years of growth of NBCUniversal, and last year was the only exception to that. So we expect great growth in all our businesses. But having a mix with where the businesses can work together, but having majority of the company being broadband-centric has worked really well for us. So I think it's a -- we're very pleased with the company we've got. We've got a great scale. We've got momentum. That's where our focus is at and the main priority was today to get to this announcement of our expectations and then go ahead and hopefully see the world go in the right direction here and continuing the path we're on and get to the execution of that later in this year, so an important step today."

We've had it now for almost a month. Very pleased with how it's doing. Our usage among our customers are actually higher than we think the usage was amongst Netflix customers. And more importantly, what's happening is we're seeing that people who are watching The Office on Peacock are watching lots of our other comedies. So it's really driving Parks and Rec and really driving Brooklyn Nine-Nine, amongst others. So there's kind of an ecosystem effect. We've talked in previous quarters about how EPL has really worked for us this premier league and how those viewers also came in, to our surprise, a much greater percentage of them than turned and watched other things like Yellowstone and other comedies. So we believe there's kind of an ecosystem here like the whole world of broadcast where people will, we can cross-promote people into different things, and that certainly seems to be working, and The Office has really worked. WWE is kind of a perfect property for us because it allows us to, number one, thousands of hours of programming that were behind a paywall that we'll now put on the free service of Peacock, which will not only enhance the brand to WWE, but we can monetize an advertising. We get the events that were behind a paywall that used to be pay per view, can drive our $4.99 premium version of Peacock. And then remember, we have a big investment in WWE at USA on our linear networks. And so this kind of particularly fits into our model of operating the business as a whole and cross-promoting and selling advertising clients, one platform, one solution, as Linda calls it. So I think the model that we've constructed here to really kind of leverage our existing linear businesses and drive advertising is working. And I think comedy, sports, two of the success stories, certainly so far."

So let me just quickly say, I don't think there's anything new. We've managed successfully to work with different administrations with different regulatory perspectives around the broadband business. And -- but our view is obviously strongly felt that the long-standing light touch regulation has worked since President Clinton created that classification and hence reduces regulatory risk for investors and allows the company to invest more and that paid dividends unbelievably well during COVID. And we were never asked to down -- any services, and content providers and consumers really benefited, and that wasn't universally the case around the globe with different broadband regimes. But we do believe in net neutrality and have -- we're not going to discriminate block, throttle and some of the other principles that we've committed to. And so if there's a way to find, a way to quantify that and perhaps with this issue and a permanent more consistent place, that's certainly a possibility.

I'm really proud of our fourth quarter results and look forward to giving you a glimpse of what we're focused on and excited about once we come out of this pandemic. Our most recent performance was highlighted",1789,"Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm really proud of our fourth quarter results and look forward to giving you a glimpse of what we're focused on and excited about once we come out of this pandemic. 
Our most recent performance was highlighted by Cable, which grew EBITDA by over 12% and net cash flow by 26%. These are the best results of the year and of any fourth quarter in over a decade. We also have good news to share on our parks segment, which reached breakeven, excluding Beijing, even with Hollywood being closed. 
Our premium ad-supported streaming service, Peacock, now has 33 million sign-ups within just 6 months of its nationwide launch. And encouragingly, Sky's customer and revenue base essentially returned to pre-COVID levels this past quarter. Clearly, our company is strong, a testament to the tough decisions made by our leadership team and the excellent execution and coordination by our dedicated employees. 
Looking back over the whole year. 2020 was one of the most uncertain and challenging periods that any of us can remember. But we rose to the occasion, ensuring the safety and protection of our employees, providing customers with unparalleled service and innovative products that they relied on more than ever, strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet and continuing to invest for long-term growth and success. 
This year's Cable results were nothing short of exceptional, hitting a number of company records. We generated 2 million net broadband additions for the year and 538,000 for the fourth quarter, reaching record-low churn. High-speed Internet drove our highest-ever full year net customer relationship additions of 1.6 million, bringing us to 33 million total customer relationships. Yet with just only 50% penetration of our footprint, there remains plenty of opportunity for future growth. 
We also delivered outstanding EBITDA growth of nearly 9% and cash flow growth of 16% for all of 2020. Broadband is the cornerstone of what we do, powered by our robust, flexible and reliable network. And the many years of investments we've made have been on full display. We've continued to enhance our market-leading competitive position while keeping people connected, protected, informed and entertained by proactively managing our network, increasing broadband speeds, expanding our Internet Essentials program for low-income households, providing payment plans for customers struggling the most and offering Peacock and Flex for free. 
This pandemic has forced us to rethink the way we operate and service our customers. Immediately, we moved all of our care reps to work remotely from home, which has gone so well that we're leaning towards embracing this model permanently. In addition, we promoted further adoption of our digital self-help tools, such as Xfinity Assistant, which are available 24/7. We also expanded our self-installation eligibility. And now over 2/3 of our customers are connecting to our services this way. 
We are working hard with our communications and marketing efforts to enhance awareness of all we have to offer, which enables us to take cost out of the business while delivering a better experience for our customers. In fact, in the past 12 months, we've reduced agent-handled calls by over 16 million and truck rolls by 1.6 million, all while adding the more than 1.5 million net new customer relationships. 
Our efforts to reduce costs have been extremely successful. But what's even more exciting are the investments we're making to grow the overall business. A great example is Flex, which is offered to all of our broadband-only customers for free so that they can connect seamlessly to the streaming services they love. Within the first half of this year, Flex, along with X1, will be carrying all of the top streaming apps in the United States. We just added HBO Max. We'll be adding Disney+ in the near future. And we have many more on the road map. Flex has been a major win for us, and we continue to have really high hopes. 
Xfinity Mobile just came off a strong fourth quarter with nice sequential improvement in customer additions, resulting from a number of significant changes as we fully integrated mobile into our core cable operations and reprioritized our sales channels. We're really excited for 2021 as we've recently expanded parts of our MVNO agreement with Verizon that will enable us to improve our range of offerings and acquire more customers more profitably. As we said from the beginning, an MVNO-led, capital-light wireless model is the right one for us and has even more strategic opportunity in the years ahead. 
Business services came back faster than we expected. This quarter, we added 26,000 net new customers and generated revenue growth of 4.8%, the highest we've seen since the pandemic began. With less than 20% share of an approximately $50 billion total addressable commercial market in our footprint, we saw plenty of runway. So all in all, Cable had a fantastic 2020. And we look forward to a very strong 2021 and beyond. 
While the global pandemic has had a more significant impact on NBCUniversal, we took advantage of this moment to make a number of changes in both management and operations that sets us up for success. The most notable example is the reorganization of our cable networks and broadcast television businesses, which are now combined, along with Peacock, in a structure meant to drive long-term cost efficiencies and revenue opportunities. We finished the year having renewed a number of carriage agreements with many of our valuable distribution partners, putting us in a position of strength as we enter 2021. 
Peacock has had an exceptional start, exceeding all of our internal targets. This premium hybrid AVOD service, which has a light ad load and is unlike any other, offers a breadth of content that appeals to just about every demographic at an unbeatable consumer value, much of it for free. Momentum has further accelerated with the addition of The Office, which we own and began streaming exclusively on Peacock as of January 1. 
Not only is The Office driving incremental users, but these viewers are naturally finding and watching other programs on this platform, like Parks and Rec; Yellowstone; our latest original, Saved by the Bell; mega-hit movies from Universal and other studios; and sporting events such as the Premier League, golf and even an NFL Wild Card game. And earlier this week, we announced that Modern Family will be coming to Peacock next month, followed by the WWE in March. 
In film, our decision to release our titles direct-to-consumer via premium video on-demand when theaters were forced to close, has proven to be profitable and the right move for us. While we look forward to when we can enjoy the theatrical release of many franchise films, such as Fast 9 and the next Minions and Jurassic World, we will lean into what has become a successful hybrid distribution model. 
COVID had the most direct impact on our theme parks, which were either closed or running at limited capacity for the bulk of 2020. But I'm pleased with how quickly we were able to reopen Orlando and Osaka while ensuring the safety of our staff and guests. We continue to provide an amazing entertainment experience. Our guests are responding as confirmed by our steadily increased attendance and our most recent financial results. What we saw this fourth quarter, especially in Orlando, gives us even more conviction in the momentum that our theme parks will experience when we reach a sustainable recovery. We may experience some near-term setbacks with the most recent pickup in COVID cases. But I am optimistic as ever about the long-term trajectory of this very special business. 
Sky had a strong and encouraging fourth quarter. We added net new customers in every market, bringing our customer base essentially back to pre-COVID levels. The same can be said for revenue, which was essentially flat from what we generated in the fourth quarter of 2019. And we continue to make meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives. Sky Q, which integrates streaming, has surpassed 60% penetration in the U.K. and is poised to continue with recent additions of Disney+, discovery+ and Amazon Prime Video. We're really pleased with the success of Sky Originals, which contributed to the 20% increase in viewership on our Sky Entertainment channels during the fourth quarter and all of 2020, reaffirming our commitment to creating Sky Studios and expanding original programming. 
While the recent wave of COVID infections and related lockdowns across Europe are once again creating disruption, we are implementing the same protocols and procedures that worked the first time around with confidence of a similar pattern as this latest lockdown recedes. We really look forward to the second half of this year when we will also start to see the benefits from the reset of major sports rights contracts and cost savings that should result from a new, leaner operating model. And we're still on plan to double 2020 EBITDA over the next several years, as Jeremy recently laid out. 
Speaking of Jeremy, I want to thank him for his exceptional leadership of Sky and for his partnership since the acquisition. He and the team have established a unique world-class brand and a strong, well-run business that's now fully integrated. I'm thrilled for Dana Strong, who has now taken over as CEO of Sky. Many of you on this call have met with Dana since she joined our Cable business as Head of Consumer Services back in 2018. She is an accomplished executive with a wonderful ability to transform, inspire and drive positive change. And on top of all that, she also has over 20 years of international experience with nearly half of it spent in Europe. 
2021 offers a lot of promise for Comcast and hopefully for the entire world. While the first half will be more challenged than the second due to the most recent strain of COVID, we're really encouraged by the promise of a vaccine, which is the first step in putting the parts of our business that have been most impacted back on a path toward growth. This optimism is shared by our Board of Directors, which this morning announced an increase in our dividend for the 13th consecutive year. I'm also pleased that it's now our expectation that we will return to repurchasing shares in the back half of this year. 
While 2020 was not what any of us had imagined a year ago at this time, our execution, cooperation and fast decision-making enabled all parts of Comcast, NBC, Universal and Sky to respond and manage through a difficult environment remarkably well. I'm truly proud of what we have accomplished. And our fourth quarter shows just how well this company is positioned to succeed. 
Mike, over to you."
173341,698628338,2184165,"Comcast Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Now I'll review our fourth quarter 2020 results and make some comments on current conditions and, where possible, on the year ahead. Let's begin on Slides 4 and 5 with our consolidated results. Revenue declined",2531,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Now I'll review our fourth quarter 2020 results and make some comments on current conditions and, where possible, on the year ahead. 
Let's begin on Slides 4 and 5 with our consolidated results. Revenue declined 2.4% to $27.7 billion for the fourth quarter and 4.9% to $103.6 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA declined 15% to $7.2 billion for the fourth quarter and 10% to $30.8 billion for the full year. COVID-related severance and restructuring charges were $590 million in the fourth quarter and $828 million for the full year as we took actions to position our businesses for success in a post-COVID world. 
The Corporate and Other segment includes these charges and also includes Peacock for its launch year. For 2020, Peacock generated revenue of over $100 million while EBITDA losses approached $700 million. We continue to expect that EBITDA losses for 2020 and 2021 combined for Peacock will total roughly $2 billion. 
Adjusted earnings per share declined 29% to $0.56 for the quarter and 17% to $2.61 for the year. Finally, free cash flow was $1.7 billion in the quarter and $13.3 billion for the full year, reflecting the decline in EBITDA and the benefit from a reduction in working capital and capital expenditures, in part due to the pandemic. 
Now let's review our business segments, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 6. For the fourth quarter, Cable Communications revenue increased 6.3% while EBITDA increased 12% and adjusted EBITDA less capital grew 26%. For the full year, we grew customer relationships by 1.6 million, a 41% increase year-over-year with 455,000 net additions in the fourth quarter, driven by high-speed Internet, where we added 2 million net new residential and business customers this year and 538,000 in the fourth quarter. These record customer additions were the primary driver of our high-speed Internet revenue growth of 13% for the quarter and 10% for the full year. 
Other revenue highlights include acceleration in both business services and wireless. Business services posted 4.8% revenue growth and 26,000 net new customer additions, primarily driven by improvement in small businesses. Wireless revenue grew 36% with 246,000 net new lines in the quarter, bringing us to 2.8 million total lines at year-end. 
Wireless is a strategic priority for us and should accelerate on the back of several actions we have taken. First, we've expanded our Verizon MVNO agreement. Second, we fully integrated mobile into our core operations. And third, we've refined our marketing and activated all of our sales channels. And we're seeing a nice lift in our retail stores, which are now fully open. 
For video, revenue declined 0.7% with higher rates implemented in the beginning of 2020 more than offset by subscriber declines, including a 248,000 net loss in customers this quarter. And advertising revenue increased 34% year-over-year or 2.2%, excluding political, which almost doubled what we had generated in the last presidential election cycle in 2016. 
Turning to expenses. Cable Communications fourth quarter expenses increased 2.4%. Programming expenses were up 7.2% primarily due to the number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020, combined with annual escalators in existing agreements. Non-programming expenses declined slightly, reflecting lower technical and product support and customer service costs, which were partially offset by higher advertising, marketing and promotion spend to drive top line growth and higher expenses associated with the increased political advertising activity this quarter. Non-programming expenses per customer relationship decreased 5.1% despite our record customer growth. 
Cable Communications EBITDA grew by 12% in the quarter and 8.6% for the full year, with margins reaching 42.1%, an improvement of 170 basis points, excluding the RSN adjustments that impacted results earlier in the year. Cable capital expenditures decreased 1.1% resulting in CapEx intensity of 13.5%. For the full year, capital expenditures declined 4.4%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 11%, our lowest full year on record and an improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year, exclusive of RSN adjustments, driven by lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by higher spending on scalable infrastructure, which was driven by our ongoing investment to enhance the capacity of our network to support increased data usage. 
Turning to the current environment. High-speed Internet customer additions remain healthy. And we have all the pieces in place for 2021 to be a very strong year. We also have to remember that 2020 was exceptional on many accounts. And because of that, we view 2019, which was also very strong for us, as the more appropriate year against which to benchmark our performance. 
Turning to video. We expect the higher video rates we implemented at the beginning of this year, resulting from our current programming renewal cycle, to drive video sub losses back to the levels we had experienced in the first half of 2020. Our video strategy is centered on profitability. We do not chase unprofitable video subscribers as we can now offer Flex for free to those who prefer a streaming-only entertainment option. 
Looking to the full year. We expect Cable Communications revenue growth to exceed the 3.4% we just reported for 2020 as we remain focused on driving our connectivity businesses with better year-over-year comparisons in the first half. We expect programming expense growth to increase at high single-digit levels, similar to the fourth quarter as programming carriage renewals roll through in 2021, but programming expense growth is expected to moderate in 2022 and thereafter. 
Non-programming operating expense growth should normalize at a low single-digit increase to 2019 levels as we support the higher level of customer relationships and accelerate growth in our wireless business, which we expect will achieve stand-alone profitability in 2021. With our consistent discipline on expenses and capital investment, coupled with the trends at work as we remain focused on connectivity, we are confident in our ability to increase profitability, expand margins and improve CapEx intensity both in 2021 and thereafter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for NBCUniversal. For the fourth quarter, NBCUniversal revenue decreased 18% to $7.5 billion and EBITDA decreased 21% to $1.6 billion. Cable Networks revenue was down 6.4% in the fourth quarter, driven by a 38% decline in content licensing and other revenue, while distribution revenue was flat compared to a year ago, reflecting the absence of carriage renewals, combined with modest sequential improvement in subscriber losses. The delay to the start of the NBA and NHL seasons had a negative impact on our advertising revenue, which declined 4.2%, while the related shift of sports rights amortization out of the quarter was a benefit to the EBITDA, which grew 22% year-over-year. 
For the full year, Cable Networks EBITDA increased 4% primarily driven by the sports-related impacts of COVID. Fewer sporting events in 2020 contributed to lower distribution and advertising revenue as well as lower programming and production expenses of $655 million year-over-year. Seasons were shortened earlier in the year and current seasons were delayed, pushing a number of events and the related rights amortization costs for 2021. So looking to 2021, we expect healthy distribution revenue growth as a result of recent successful carriage renewals. We also currently expect significantly more sporting events compared to 2020, which should result in higher advertising revenue but also a significant increase in sports-related programming and production costs, equating to a low double-digit decline in Cable Networks EBITDA this year. 
Turning to Broadcast. Revenue decreased 12% in the fourth quarter due to a 39% decline in content licensing and a 9.6% decline in advertising revenue, partially offset by another quarter of double-digit increases in retransmission consent fees. The content licensing revenue declines at both Broadcast and Cable Networks were timing-related as sales to streaming platforms, including Peacock, were more heavily concentrated in the first 9 months of the year. We also had a difficult comparison to a significant library deal in last year's fourth quarter. 
The decline in advertising revenue was driven by lower ratings, partly due to the delayed launch of our fall season. This was somewhat offset by record levels of political advertising at our local stations. The lower revenues were partially offset by a decline in operating costs, reflecting lower content licensing and a delay in production due to COVID-19, resulting in a decline of 24% to $356 million in Broadcast EBITDA. 
Filmed Entertainment revenue declined 8.3% and EBITDA increased 65% to $151 million for the fourth quarter. Theatrical revenue declined 70% due to theaters being either closed or operating at limited capacity while content and licensing increased 23%, driven by PVOD. Expenses were significantly lower due to fewer releases as a result of COVID-19. In 2021, we hope to debut a number of our franchise films in theaters, such as Fast 9 and Minions 2. But the situation remains fluid, and we are still adjusting our 2021 slate to maximize value as evidenced by our recent decision to push back the release of Boss Baby 2 from March to September. 
Theme Parks revenue was $579 million in the quarter with an EBITDA loss of $15 million. These results reflect Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Japan operating at limited capacity while Hollywood remains closed. Results also include $45 million of Universal Beijing preopening costs. For 2021, keep in mind that the first quarter tends to be seasonally light in terms of attendance. And we also expect an increased COVID impact, given new restrictions in Japan, which have also caused us to delay the opening of Super Nintendo World. We are pleased that Universal Beijing remains set to open this summer with preopening costs ramping to $300 million in the first half of this year. 
One last item I'd like to highlight. We will be changing the way we report for NBCUniversal starting in the first quarter of 2021 with the largest impact being to our television businesses as we combine Cable Networks and Broadcast into one segment along with Peacock. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for Sky, which I'll speak to on a constant currency basis. Sky revenue for the fourth quarter declined 0.9% to $5.2 billion, reflecting a 2.8% decline in direct-to-consumer revenue, driven mostly by our hospitality or pubs and clubs segment, which was challenged by additional COVID-related lockdowns during the quarter. Excluding hospitality, direct-to-consumer revenue was essentially flat year-over-year with solid low single-digit growth in the U.K. 
Somewhat offsetting the decline in direct-to-consumer revenue was a 10% increase in content revenue as we monetized our original programming while advertising revenue grew 3.9% as Sky outperformed a challenged advertising market helped by a strong performance in the U.K. Sky added 244,000 net new customers in the quarter, bringing us essentially back to pre-COVID levels of total customer relationships with additions in all markets, driven by a very healthy streaming business. We've also seen strong uptake in our broadband and mobile products in the U.K. 
Sky EBITDA was $139 million as the fourth quarter was impacted by a number of expense items, such as incremental sports rights amortization related to the shift of sporting events that have been delayed as a result of COVID-19, higher investments in entertainment programming, costs related to the launch of our new Sky channels last May as well as higher marketing spend to promote strategic initiatives, such as Sky Q, growth in our mobile product in the U.K. and broadband in Italy. 
Looking ahead, we would characterize 2021 as a tale of 2 halves. The first half is under pressure due to the recent increase in COVID-related restrictions to the extreme levels we experienced at the beginning of the pandemic. With the government mandating the closure of pubs and clubs as well as many retail outlets, we are experiencing weakness in hospitality and advertising, and we now expect Sky's first quarter revenue to decline slightly year-over-year. We also expect first half expenses to be elevated when compared to 2020 as higher sports rights amortization resulting from sporting events being postponed from 2020 to 2021 will be with us through the second quarter. 
In non-sports-related costs, we will see an increase as we grow broadband and mobile in the U.K., broadband in Italy and launch the SMB business in the U.K. later this quarter. In the second half of '21, we expect a quick recovery in hospitality and advertising revenue once these latest restrictions are lifted and an acceleration in EBITDA growth from the tailwinds related to our major sports rights resets and more efficient operating structure. 
I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 9. We generated $13.3 billion in free cash flow and paid $4.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders in 2020. Consolidated total capital, which includes CapEx as well as software and intangibles, decreased 6.4% for the year to $11.6 billion while working capital improved by $2.2 billion to a decline of $178 million for the full year, both reflecting an impact from COVID. Looking to 2021, we anticipate total capital will remain relatively flat to 2020 levels while the working capital drag will increase relative to the levels we saw in 2019, which is the more appropriate comparison due to an increase in content investments, our broadcast of the Olympics and the reversal of COVID-related one-time tax deferrals. 
Turning to capital allocation. Our strategy has always been a balance of several important priorities: maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in profitable organic growth and returning capital to shareholders. First, on our balance sheet, we've made great progress reducing net debt from $108 billion post the Sky acquisition at the end of 2018 to $90 billion at the end of 2020. 
Second, we remain focused on organic investment in our businesses to grow the long-term earnings power of the company, including our CapEx investment in broadband and parks and continued investment behind other growth initiatives where we see strong return on investments, such as Xfinity Mobile, Peacock, Flex, Sky Q and broadband in Italy. 
Third, we are committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. And we have a proven track record. We have increased our dividend 13 years in a row at a 17% CAGR, significantly in excess of the S&P over that same time period. In addition, we have a demonstrated history of buying back stock, having reduced our share count by nearly 20% between the NBCUniversal and Sky acquisitions. 
In 2021, we believe we will be able to return to our historical practice of returning ample capital to our shareholders. We are again raising the dividend by $0.08 a share to $1 per share. And we are planning to return to buying back our stock. As Brian mentioned, our hope is to start in the back half of this year gradually ramping up to historical levels while we continue to pace towards hitting our intended target leverage levels, which we currently expect to reach by year-end 2022. The specific timing and magnitude of our buyback activity will be subject to improvement in our businesses most impacted by the pandemic and the implications related to potential changes in tax policy. 
So thanks for joining us on the call this morning, and I'll now hand it back to Marci to handle Q&A."

I mean I know you talked about 2019 as the benchmark year. But as we think about the longer term, how do you look at last year's performance and some of the specific drivers in terms of their durability beyond the pandemic?  
And then for Jeff, you guys laid out, and I realize this is prior to your elevation as CEO, I think, 30 million to 35 million active accounts on Peacock by '24. I know sign-ups and active accounts are different metrics, but it seems like you're nicely ahead of that trajectory. Can you just sort of reframe the opportunity with Peacock for us today versus kind of the initial outlook? And when might revenues become kind of material to NBC for that business?"

I think it starts with the main point that we've had great momentum in broadband for many quarters now, well before COVID. So there's been real strength in the category for us. And I think we point towards the fundamentals of broadband. And the fundamentals have been very consistent for us. And it starts with the market. The market is growing. We're taking share. And the sources are geographic all over the country where we serve and across the board competitively with DSL sources, telco, wired, wireless and other competitors. 
So I think while there in '20, truly an exceptional year for performance, and as Brian said, I think the right way of looking at '20, you've got to look at the full year results. And when you do that, the $2 million net customer additions, it really is extraordinary. The fundamentals that we see going forward, low churn, we compete well on the front end because we've consistently invested in the best network in the marketplace, I think. That is ubiquitous. We deliver the best overall service, redefined the category in speed, coverage, control and now streaming. And so you add up all those things, I think you -- it points towards strong organic growth. 
But as you look to next year, as Mike said, we do have a healthy start to the year. We're really encouraged to -- at what we're seeing right out of the gates. But I do think 2020, as everybody went home and there's just a lot more in a short period of time, folks that were working from home, schooling from home, I think there is -- that's a unique moment. But I think the fundamentals continue. We have penetration upside. There's growth opportunities that we believe strongly. I think '19 was a very strong year, too, by the way. I think that is the right one to look at as the best benchmark on a go-forward basis."

And we were up significantly over all of our metrics versus what we anticipated going into the business. We're only -- we launched this on Comcast just over 9 months ago and nationally just over 6 months ago. So we're at the very beginning of this business. 
But we're very confident, based on the small amount of time, that the business model is exactly the right business model. People are signing up. They're using it more than we expected. And advertisers are very interested in buying it. So this steady growth is very promising for us. And we don't have anything to reframe at this point. But I think that the performance, that is much better than we expected, gives us a lot of optionality going forward. But we're just going to continue to drive this business model now and focus on the advertising revenue."

So Cable Networks, obviously, are a big part of the business. They're still the biggest EBITDA driver. And I don't expect that to change anytime in the near future. 
But we're looking at the 2 revenue streams of the business, it's subscription and advertising, as one business, Broadcast, Cable and Peacock, and we're programming it as such. We're selling it to advertisers as one platform as such. And so I think, over time, it will be harder and harder to distinguish between the profitability of Cable Networks and the rest of our television business because we're looking at it as one business. But the restructuring allows us to run it like that. And we think that, that's going to allow us to really grow the business over time."

We've had a great partnership and glad that one important aspect of things is that improved MVNO. Brian mentioned the capital-light approach is working for us. We think it's going to work in the future. So I think as a starting point certainly will enable us to amplify what we're already doing, really push towards a range of offers to keep us very competitive. We continue to grab, switch and share in the mobile space. 
But you back up for a second, and we're just -- overall, we have been pleased and we're very optimistic about the mobile business and what it will do, in particular, continues to perform very well for broadband retention. And so we're committed to accelerating growth in mobile, and we mentioned this last time. And while the MVNO enhancement is a nice step forward, there are a lot of other things that we're doing like, really going after every single sales channel that we have. 
We reopened retail in a safe mode, new safety protocols. And every single sales channel, whether it's digital, call centers, you name it, we're really focusing on mobile. So we're also leaning into 5G. We'll participate very much in 5G. And we're featuring mobile in packaging with broadband leading in some cases. When there's a new product NPI, whether it's Apple, Samsung, we use that moment to literally lead with mobile. So I think, overall, we're really pleased. And I think it -- we feel good about the runway. 
I would also point towards our overarching plan that, one, we have access to, I think, the country's best network with Verizon and so talked about that. I think we also are leveraging -- continue to leverage WiFi. And we've always uniquely provided a great experience, not just in the home. We're improving things outside in the public area. And then over time, I think the other key thing, too, is being able to add a third layer, which could be our own targeted wireless infrastructure, which we might use to supplement the Verizon network and really go after the high dense usage areas from spectrum that we've already acquired. So I think all these factors point towards, I think, a unique opportunity for us."

I think it can be done in a variety of ways as we've seen sporting events all over the world take place from Premier League to the NFL and many others with limited spectators, no spectators or wherever the world may be in Japan in July, that will be up to the country and host committee. If in the event it doesn't happen, we have another Olympics coming in Beijing 7 months later or so. So I don't know, Jeff, whether you want to add anything to that.

And when you look at the long-term [ trajectory ] of the business, including our comment, is that we are confident in our ability to increase profitability, expand margins and improve capital intensity, not just in 2021, and that is versus reported 2020 numbers to your question, but really thereafter. 
I mean I think the business is set up for that for the long-term horizon beyond just the year ahead. So calling out specific numbers, I think, is of less utility, frankly, than giving you the broad backdrop that gives you the long-term lens through which you can judge all those pieces. But we're quite confident that all those things coming together, expense discipline and efficiency on the capital side, combined with innovation and focus on connectivity, allows us to give that outlook that -- of improving margins and capital intensity looking out ahead. In terms of -- Dave, I don't know if you have anything to add there?"

I think the focus of us really going after margin, capital intensity improvements, that's not going to stop. It starts with connectivity and building customer relationships in a profitable way, managing this video transition like we're doing and extreme focus around expenses that we, in a healthy way, Mike talked about it, Brian talked about it, just taken a lot of transactions out. Our digital focus and self-install kits, these are things that I think are very durable that will go beyond this -- what we're dealing with in this environment. 
I think we've learned a ton and we'll continue to operate the business in a unique way. So I think you look towards those kinds of activities, the amount of SIK today, 2/3 of the transactions that connects are that way and then 3/4 of our digital-capable transactions are being completed through our digital tools. We're going to continue to focus on all those things that just drive non-programming cost. And so we'll stay focused on all of that."

I mean, obviously, we've been talking, Brian and I and team, for a while about our desire to get back into the historical balance on capital allocation, which, as you know, is keeping the balance sheet strong, making healthy investments in the organic growth across our businesses, which I think from listening to the call today, anyone would, I hope, gather that we continue to be very much leaning into doing that where we see returns and opportunity to make investments in these businesses for growth and then get back to our balance with complete capital return. It's the 13th year we've increased the dividend. But we turned off buybacks for a while and want to return to being in that portion of the return element as well. 
So as I said, we're pleased with where the balance sheet is. We've gotten net debt down to $90 billion from $108 billion after Sky. Just the evidence that we're seeing in parks in the fourth quarter, we were breakeven ex the Beijing pre-operating cost, even with Hollywood closed and even with the capacity constraints, just gives us a high degree of confidence that when people can return to travel on the other side of vaccinations outpacing the virus that we're going to see the COVID-impacted EBITDA businesses snap back to historical levels. 
To your point, it's going to take 12 months for it to run through and get a full -- and get it fully back. Hence, our point that in the second half of this year, we'd expect to see the beginnings of that. And rather than wait for a full 12 months, we'll start -- we hope and plan to begin our buyback at that moment. We'll keep it at the historical level, call it, as much as $5 billion ramp-up to that and probably stay there until we actually get to the definition that you called out with -- on a 12-month trailing basis to get to around or just inside 2.5x. And I expect that to happen by the end of 2022."

Well, let me touch on the first one then and go into CBRS. But on Flex, starting, Craig, with the -- our current strategy just a little bit, that we're -- we package it with broadband, another great way of surrounding broadband with products that drive better retention outcomes. And that's -- it's working. It's working very well. So we target it to the streaming segment and give the customer a great experience with the X1 voice and all the apps. So we've got tons of apps. We'll have just about everything, pleased with the Peacock performance for sure, all the other apps that we've launched, including HBO Max and soon to be later on this quarter, Disney. 
I think today, it is more targeted. But as you mentioned, I really do think the next phase that we're working on and developing for and turning our innovation focus is that this is a long-term platform opportunity for us. And an aspect of the company that we have, called Xumo, that I think you all didn't know that, that's one piece of being able to drive -- help drive advertising. We can participate in revenue in the app splits that we get. And so we think of this with scale. 
And as you build a common software stack that includes Sky, do it together, which we're already working on, and then you have opportunities and -- which we've talked about going to smart TVs but really leveraging unique scale internationally that we can have, whether it's a device or whether it's a software solution. But I think these are the things that we'll look at. Right now, it's working great within footprint, but we're building out plans beyond that."

So Mike, when you were responding to his question on the buybacks, you talked about ramping back up towards the historical level of $5 billion a year until you get back to sort of that long-term leverage target of about 2.5 turns.

Historically, you've tended to redeploy that excess liquidity into your strategic M&A program. And so the question is how do you think about the medium- to long-term importance of preserving dry powder for that type of flexibility versus whether your current asset portfolio is sufficiently well suited to meet your long-term operating targets?"

And so getting back in balance with, as Mike described earlier, I think, is really important, something that I certainly really have wanted us to get to. 
Second, we've also said that we like the mix of businesses. Roughly 70% of the company, being broadband-centric, is -- proved to be a really successful model. And we've had 10 wonderful years of growth of NBCUniversal. And last year was the only exception to that. So we expect great growth in all our businesses. But having a mix with -- where the businesses can work together, but having majority of the company being broadband-centric has worked really well for us. 
So I think it's a -- we're very pleased with the company we've got. We've got a great scale. We've got momentum. That's where our focus is at.

We've had it now for almost a month, very pleased with how it's doing. Our usage among our customers are actually higher than we think the usage was amongst Netflix customers. And more importantly, what's happening is we're seeing that people who are watching The Office on Peacock are watching lots of our other comedies. So it's really driving Parks and Rec and really driving Brooklyn Nine-Nine, amongst others. So there's kind of an ecosystem effect. 
We've talked in previous quarters about how EPL has really worked for us, English Premier League, and how those viewers also came in to our surprise, a much greater percentage of them, then turned and watched other things like Yellowstone and other comedies. So we believe there's kind of an ecosystem here, like the whole world of broadcast, where people will -- we can cross-promote people into different things. And that certainly seems to be working and The Office has really worked. 
WWE is kind of a perfect property for us because it allows us to, number one, thousands of hours of programming that were behind a paywall that we'll now put on the free service of Peacock, which will not only enhance the brand of WWE, but we can monetize in advertising. We get the events that were behind a paywall that used to be pay per view can drive our $4.99 premium version of Peacock. 
And then remember, we have a big investment in WWE at USA on our linear networks. And so this kind of particularly fits into our model of operating the business as a whole and cross-promoting and selling advertising clients one platform, one solution, as Linda calls it. So I think the model that we've constructed here to really kind of leverage our existing linear businesses and drive advertising is working. And I think comedy, sports, two of the success stories certainly so far."

So let me just quickly say I don't think there's anything new. We've managed successfully to work with different administrations with different regulatory perspectives around the broadband business. And -- but our view is obviously strongly felt that the long-standing light touch regulation has worked since President Clinton created that classification and hence reduces regulatory risk for investors and allows the company to invest more and that paid dividends unbelievably well during COVID. 
And we were never asked to [ down-res ] any services. And content providers and consumers really benefited. And that wasn't universally the case around the globe with different broadband regimes. But we do believe in net neutrality and have -- we're not going to discriminate, block, throttle on some of the other principles that we've committed to. And so if there's a way to find a way to codify that and perhaps put this issue in a permanent, more consistent place, that's certainly a possibility.

I'm really proud of our fourth quarter results and look forward to giving you a glimpse of what we're focused on and excited about once we come out of this pandemic. 
Our most recent performance was highlighted by Cable, which grew EBITDA by over 12% and net cash flow by 26%. These are the best results of the year and of any fourth quarter in over a decade. We also have good news to share on our parks segment, which reached breakeven, excluding Beijing, even with Hollywood being closed. 
Our premium ad-supported streaming service, Peacock, now has 33 million sign-ups within just 6 months of its nationwide launch. And encouragingly, Sky's customer and revenue base essentially returned to pre-COVID levels this past quarter. Clearly, our company is strong, a testament to the tough decisions made by our leadership team and the excellent execution and coordination by our dedicated employees. 
Looking back over the whole year. 2020 was one of the most uncertain and challenging periods that any of us can remember. But we rose to the occasion, ensuring the safety and protection of our employees, providing customers with unparalleled service and innovative products that they relied on more than ever, strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet and continuing to invest for long-term growth and success. 
This year's Cable results were nothing short of exceptional, hitting a number of company records. We generated 2 million net broadband additions for the year and 538,000 for the fourth quarter, reaching record-low churn. High-speed Internet drove our highest-ever full year net customer relationship additions of 1.6 million, bringing us to 33 million total customer relationships. Yet with just only 50% penetration of our footprint, there remains plenty of opportunity for future growth. 
We also delivered outstanding EBITDA growth of nearly 9% and cash flow growth of 16% for all of 2020. Broadband is the cornerstone of what we do, powered by our robust, flexible and reliable network. And the many years of investments we've made have been on full display. We've continued to enhance our market-leading competitive position while keeping people connected, protected, informed and entertained by proactively managing our network, increasing broadband speeds, expanding our Internet Essentials program for low-income households, providing payment plans for customers struggling the most and offering Peacock and Flex for free. 
This pandemic has forced us to rethink the way we operate and service our customers. Immediately, we moved all of our care reps to work remotely from home, which has gone so well that we're leaning towards embracing this model permanently. In addition, we promoted further adoption of our digital self-help tools, such as Xfinity Assistant, which are available 24/7. We also expanded our self-installation eligibility. And now over 2/3 of our customers are connecting to our services this way. 
We are working hard with our communications and marketing efforts to enhance awareness of all we have to offer, which enables us to take cost out of the business while delivering a better experience for our customers. In fact, in the past 12 months, we've reduced agent-handled calls by over 16 million and truck rolls by 1.6 million, all while adding the more than 1.5 million net new customer relationships. 
Our efforts to reduce costs have been extremely successful. But what's even more exciting are the investments we're making to grow the overall business. A great example is Flex, which is offered to all of our broadband-only customers for free so that they can connect seamlessly to the streaming services they love. Within the first half of this year, Flex, along with X1, will be carrying all of the top streaming apps in the United States. We just added HBO Max. We'll be adding Disney+ in the near future. And we have many more on the road map. Flex has been a major win for us, and we continue to have really high hopes. 
Xfinity Mobile just came off a strong fourth quarter with nice sequential improvement in customer additions, resulting from a number of significant changes as we fully integrated mobile into our core cable operations and reprioritized our sales channels. We're really excited for 2021 as we've recently expanded parts of our MVNO agreement with Verizon that will enable us to improve our range of offerings and acquire more customers more profitably. As we said from the beginning, an MVNO-led, capital-light wireless model is the right one for us and has even more strategic opportunity in the years ahead. 
Business services came back faster than we expected. This quarter, we added 26,000 net new customers and generated revenue growth of 4.8%, the highest we've seen since the pandemic began. With less than 20% share of an approximately $50 billion total addressable commercial market in our footprint, we saw plenty of runway. So all in all, Cable had a fantastic 2020. And we look forward to a very strong 2021 and beyond. 
While the global pandemic has had a more significant impact on NBCUniversal, we took advantage of this moment to make a number of changes in both management and operations that sets us up for success. The most notable example is the reorganization of our cable networks and broadcast television businesses, which are now combined, along with Peacock, in a structure meant to drive long-term cost efficiencies and revenue opportunities. We finished the year having renewed a number of carriage agreements with many of our valuable distribution partners, putting us in a position of strength as we enter 2021. 
Peacock has had an exceptional start, exceeding all of our internal targets. This premium hybrid AVOD service, which has a light ad load and is unlike any other, offers a breadth of content that appeals to just about every demographic at an unbeatable consumer value, much of it for free. Momentum has further accelerated with the addition of The Office, which we own and began streaming exclusively on Peacock as of January 1. 
Not only is The Office driving incremental users, but these viewers are naturally finding and watching other programs on this platform, like Parks and Rec; Yellowstone; our latest original, Saved by the Bell; mega-hit movies from Universal and other studios; and sporting events such as the Premier League, golf and even an NFL Wild Card game. And earlier this week, we announced that Modern Family will be coming to Peacock next month, followed by the WWE in March. 
In film, our decision to release our titles direct-to-consumer via premium video on-demand when theaters were forced to close, has proven to be profitable and the right move for us. While we look forward to when we can enjoy the theatrical release of many franchise films, such as Fast 9 and the next Minions and Jurassic World, we will lean into what has become a successful hybrid distribution model. 
COVID had the most direct impact on our theme parks, which were either closed or running at limited capacity for the bulk of 2020. But I'm pleased with how quickly we were able to reopen Orlando and Osaka while ensuring the safety of our staff and guests. We continue to provide an amazing entertainment experience. Our guests are responding as confirmed by our steadily increased attendance and our most recent financial results. What we saw this fourth quarter, especially in Orlando, gives us even more conviction in the momentum that our theme parks will experience when we reach a sustainable recovery. We may experience some near-term setbacks with the most recent pickup in COVID cases. But I am optimistic as ever about the long-term trajectory of this very special business. 
Sky had a strong and encouraging fourth quarter. We added net new customers in every market, bringing our customer base essentially back to pre-COVID levels. The same can be said for revenue, which was essentially flat from what we generated in the fourth quarter of 2019. And we continue to make meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives. Sky Q, which integrates streaming, has surpassed 60% penetration in the U.K. and is poised to continue with recent additions of Disney+, discovery+ and Amazon Prime Video. We're really pleased with the success of Sky Originals, which contributed to the 20% increase in viewership on our Sky Entertainment channels during the fourth quarter and all of 2020, reaffirming our commitment to creating Sky Studios and expanding original programming. 
While the recent wave of COVID infections and related lockdowns across Europe are once again creating disruption, we are implementing the same protocols and procedures that worked the first time around with confidence of a similar pattern as this latest lockdown recedes. We really look forward to the second half of this year when we will also start to see the benefits from the reset of major sports rights contracts and cost savings that should result from a new, leaner operating model. And we're still on plan to double 2020 EBITDA over the next several years, as Jeremy recently laid out. 
Speaking of Jeremy, I want to thank him for his exceptional leadership of Sky and for his partnership since the acquisition. He and the team have established a unique world-class brand and a strong, well-run business that's now fully integrated. I'm thrilled for Dana Strong, who has now taken over as CEO of Sky. Many of you on this call have met with Dana since she joined our Cable business as Head of Consumer Services back in 2018. She is an accomplished executive with a wonderful ability to transform, inspire and drive positive change. And on top of all that, she also has over 20 years of international experience with nearly half of it spent in Europe. 
2021 offers a lot of promise for Comcast and hopefully for the entire world. While the first half will be more challenged than the second due to the most recent strain of COVID, we're really encouraged by the promise of a vaccine, which is the first step in putting the parts of our business that have been most impacted back on a path toward growth. This optimism is shared by our Board of Directors, which this morning announced an increase in our dividend for the 13th consecutive year. I'm also pleased that it's now our expectation that we will return to repurchasing shares in the back half of this year. 
While 2020 was not what any of us had imagined a year ago at this time, our execution, cooperation and fast decision-making enabled all parts of Comcast, NBC, Universal and Sky to respond and manage through a difficult environment remarkably well. I'm truly proud of what we have accomplished. And our fourth quarter shows just how well this company is positioned to succeed. 
Mike, over to you."
173341,698628338,2252285,"Comcast Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Now I'll review our fourth quarter 2020 results and make some comments on current conditions and, where possible, on the year ahead. Let's begin on Slides 4 and 5 with our consolidated results. Revenue declined",2531,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Now I'll review our fourth quarter 2020 results and make some comments on current conditions and, where possible, on the year ahead. 
Let's begin on Slides 4 and 5 with our consolidated results. Revenue declined 2.4% to $27.7 billion for the fourth quarter and 4.9% to $103.6 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA declined 15% to $7.2 billion for the fourth quarter and 10% to $30.8 billion for the full year. COVID-related severance and restructuring charges were $590 million in the fourth quarter and $828 million for the full year as we took actions to position our businesses for success in a post-COVID world. 
The Corporate and Other segment includes these charges and also includes Peacock for its launch year. For 2020, Peacock generated revenue of over $100 million while EBITDA losses approached $700 million. We continue to expect that EBITDA losses for 2020 and 2021 combined for Peacock will total roughly $2 billion. 
Adjusted earnings per share declined 29% to $0.56 for the quarter and 17% to $2.61 for the year. Finally, free cash flow was $1.7 billion in the quarter and $13.3 billion for the full year, reflecting the decline in EBITDA and the benefit from a reduction in working capital and capital expenditures, in part due to the pandemic. 
Now let's review our business segments, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 6. For the fourth quarter, Cable Communications revenue increased 6.3% while EBITDA increased 12% and adjusted EBITDA less capital grew 26%. For the full year, we grew customer relationships by 1.6 million, a 41% increase year-over-year with 455,000 net additions in the fourth quarter, driven by high-speed Internet, where we added 2 million net new residential and business customers this year and 538,000 in the fourth quarter. These record customer additions were the primary driver of our high-speed Internet revenue growth of 13% for the quarter and 10% for the full year. 
Other revenue highlights include acceleration in both business services and wireless. Business services posted 4.8% revenue growth and 26,000 net new customer additions, primarily driven by improvement in small businesses. Wireless revenue grew 36% with 246,000 net new lines in the quarter, bringing us to 2.8 million total lines at year-end. 
Wireless is a strategic priority for us and should accelerate on the back of several actions we have taken. First, we've expanded our Verizon MVNO agreement. Second, we fully integrated mobile into our core operations. And third, we've refined our marketing and activated all of our sales channels. And we're seeing a nice lift in our retail stores, which are now fully open. 
For video, revenue declined 0.7% with higher rates implemented in the beginning of 2020 more than offset by subscriber declines, including a 248,000 net loss in customers this quarter. And advertising revenue increased 34% year-over-year or 2.2%, excluding political, which almost doubled what we had generated in the last presidential election cycle in 2016. 
Turning to expenses. Cable Communications fourth quarter expenses increased 2.4%. Programming expenses were up 7.2% primarily due to the number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020, combined with annual escalators in existing agreements. Non-programming expenses declined slightly, reflecting lower technical and product support and customer service costs, which were partially offset by higher advertising, marketing and promotion spend to drive top line growth and higher expenses associated with the increased political advertising activity this quarter. Non-programming expenses per customer relationship decreased 5.1% despite our record customer growth. 
Cable Communications EBITDA grew by 12% in the quarter and 8.6% for the full year, with margins reaching 42.1%, an improvement of 170 basis points, excluding the RSN adjustments that impacted results earlier in the year. Cable capital expenditures decreased 1.1% resulting in CapEx intensity of 13.5%. For the full year, capital expenditures declined 4.4%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 11%, our lowest full year on record and an improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year, exclusive of RSN adjustments, driven by lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by higher spending on scalable infrastructure, which was driven by our ongoing investment to enhance the capacity of our network to support increased data usage. 
Turning to the current environment. High-speed Internet customer additions remain healthy. And we have all the pieces in place for 2021 to be a very strong year. We also have to remember that 2020 was exceptional on many accounts. And because of that, we view 2019, which was also very strong for us, as the more appropriate year against which to benchmark our performance. 
Turning to video. We expect the higher video rates we implemented at the beginning of this year, resulting from our current programming renewal cycle, to drive video sub losses back to the levels we had experienced in the first half of 2020. Our video strategy is centered on profitability. We do not chase unprofitable video subscribers as we can now offer Flex for free to those who prefer a streaming-only entertainment option. 
Looking to the full year. We expect Cable Communications revenue growth to exceed the 3.4% we just reported for 2020 as we remain focused on driving our connectivity businesses with better year-over-year comparisons in the first half. We expect programming expense growth to increase at high single-digit levels, similar to the fourth quarter as programming carriage renewals roll through in 2021, but programming expense growth is expected to moderate in 2022 and thereafter. 
Non-programming operating expense growth should normalize at a low single-digit increase to 2019 levels as we support the higher level of customer relationships and accelerate growth in our wireless business, which we expect will achieve stand-alone profitability in 2021. With our consistent discipline on expenses and capital investment, coupled with the trends at work as we remain focused on connectivity, we are confident in our ability to increase profitability, expand margins and improve CapEx intensity both in 2021 and thereafter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for NBCUniversal. For the fourth quarter, NBCUniversal revenue decreased 18% to $7.5 billion and EBITDA decreased 21% to $1.6 billion. Cable Networks revenue was down 6.4% in the fourth quarter, driven by a 38% decline in content licensing and other revenue, while distribution revenue was flat compared to a year ago, reflecting the absence of carriage renewals, combined with modest sequential improvement in subscriber losses. The delay to the start of the NBA and NHL seasons had a negative impact on our advertising revenue, which declined 4.2%, while the related shift of sports rights amortization out of the quarter was a benefit to the EBITDA, which grew 22% year-over-year. 
For the full year, Cable Networks EBITDA increased 4% primarily driven by the sports-related impacts of COVID. Fewer sporting events in 2020 contributed to lower distribution and advertising revenue as well as lower programming and production expenses of $655 million year-over-year. Seasons were shortened earlier in the year and current seasons were delayed, pushing a number of events and the related rights amortization costs for 2021. So looking to 2021, we expect healthy distribution revenue growth as a result of recent successful carriage renewals. We also currently expect significantly more sporting events compared to 2020, which should result in higher advertising revenue but also a significant increase in sports-related programming and production costs, equating to a low double-digit decline in Cable Networks EBITDA this year. 
Turning to Broadcast. Revenue decreased 12% in the fourth quarter due to a 39% decline in content licensing and a 9.6% decline in advertising revenue, partially offset by another quarter of double-digit increases in retransmission consent fees. The content licensing revenue declines at both Broadcast and Cable Networks were timing-related as sales to streaming platforms, including Peacock, were more heavily concentrated in the first 9 months of the year. We also had a difficult comparison to a significant library deal in last year's fourth quarter. 
The decline in advertising revenue was driven by lower ratings, partly due to the delayed launch of our fall season. This was somewhat offset by record levels of political advertising at our local stations. The lower revenues were partially offset by a decline in operating costs, reflecting lower content licensing and a delay in production due to COVID-19, resulting in a decline of 24% to $356 million in Broadcast EBITDA. 
Filmed Entertainment revenue declined 8.3% and EBITDA increased 65% to $151 million for the fourth quarter. Theatrical revenue declined 70% due to theaters being either closed or operating at limited capacity while content and licensing increased 23%, driven by PVOD. Expenses were significantly lower due to fewer releases as a result of COVID-19. In 2021, we hope to debut a number of our franchise films in theaters, such as Fast 9 and Minions 2. But the situation remains fluid, and we are still adjusting our 2021 slate to maximize value as evidenced by our recent decision to push back the release of Boss Baby 2 from March to September. 
Theme Parks revenue was $579 million in the quarter with an EBITDA loss of $15 million. These results reflect Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Japan operating at limited capacity while Hollywood remains closed. Results also include $45 million of Universal Beijing preopening costs. For 2021, keep in mind that the first quarter tends to be seasonally light in terms of attendance. And we also expect an increased COVID impact, given new restrictions in Japan, which have also caused us to delay the opening of Super Nintendo World. We are pleased that Universal Beijing remains set to open this summer with preopening costs ramping to $300 million in the first half of this year. 
One last item I'd like to highlight. We will be changing the way we report for NBCUniversal starting in the first quarter of 2021 with the largest impact being to our television businesses as we combine Cable Networks and Broadcast into one segment along with Peacock. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for Sky, which I'll speak to on a constant currency basis. Sky revenue for the fourth quarter declined 0.9% to $5.2 billion, reflecting a 2.8% decline in direct-to-consumer revenue, driven mostly by our hospitality or pubs and clubs segment, which was challenged by additional COVID-related lockdowns during the quarter. Excluding hospitality, direct-to-consumer revenue was essentially flat year-over-year with solid low single-digit growth in the U.K. 
Somewhat offsetting the decline in direct-to-consumer revenue was a 10% increase in content revenue as we monetized our original programming while advertising revenue grew 3.9% as Sky outperformed a challenged advertising market helped by a strong performance in the U.K. Sky added 244,000 net new customers in the quarter, bringing us essentially back to pre-COVID levels of total customer relationships with additions in all markets, driven by a very healthy streaming business. We've also seen strong uptake in our broadband and mobile products in the U.K. 
Sky EBITDA was $139 million as the fourth quarter was impacted by a number of expense items, such as incremental sports rights amortization related to the shift of sporting events that have been delayed as a result of COVID-19, higher investments in entertainment programming, costs related to the launch of our new Sky channels last May as well as higher marketing spend to promote strategic initiatives, such as Sky Q, growth in our mobile product in the U.K. and broadband in Italy. 
Looking ahead, we would characterize 2021 as a tale of 2 halves. The first half is under pressure due to the recent increase in COVID-related restrictions to the extreme levels we experienced at the beginning of the pandemic. With the government mandating the closure of pubs and clubs as well as many retail outlets, we are experiencing weakness in hospitality and advertising, and we now expect Sky's first quarter revenue to decline slightly year-over-year. We also expect first half expenses to be elevated when compared to 2020 as higher sports rights amortization resulting from sporting events being postponed from 2020 to 2021 will be with us through the second quarter. 
In non-sports-related costs, we will see an increase as we grow broadband and mobile in the U.K., broadband in Italy and launch the SMB business in the U.K. later this quarter. In the second half of '21, we expect a quick recovery in hospitality and advertising revenue once these latest restrictions are lifted and an acceleration in EBITDA growth from the tailwinds related to our major sports rights resets and more efficient operating structure. 
I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 9. We generated $13.3 billion in free cash flow and paid $4.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders in 2020. Consolidated total capital, which includes CapEx as well as software and intangibles, decreased 6.4% for the year to $11.6 billion while working capital improved by $2.2 billion to a decline of $178 million for the full year, both reflecting an impact from COVID. Looking to 2021, we anticipate total capital will remain relatively flat to 2020 levels while the working capital drag will increase relative to the levels we saw in 2019, which is the more appropriate comparison due to an increase in content investments, our broadcast of the Olympics and the reversal of COVID-related one-time tax deferrals. 
Turning to capital allocation. Our strategy has always been a balance of several important priorities: maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in profitable organic growth and returning capital to shareholders. First, on our balance sheet, we've made great progress reducing net debt from $108 billion post the Sky acquisition at the end of 2018 to $90 billion at the end of 2020. 
Second, we remain focused on organic investment in our businesses to grow the long-term earnings power of the company, including our CapEx investment in broadband and parks and continued investment behind other growth initiatives where we see strong return on investments, such as Xfinity Mobile, Peacock, Flex, Sky Q and broadband in Italy. 
Third, we are committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. And we have a proven track record. We have increased our dividend 13 years in a row at a 17% CAGR, significantly in excess of the S&P over that same time period. In addition, we have a demonstrated history of buying back stock, having reduced our share count by nearly 20% between the NBCUniversal and Sky acquisitions. 
In 2021, we believe we will be able to return to our historical practice of returning ample capital to our shareholders. We are again raising the dividend by $0.08 a share to $1 per share. And we are planning to return to buying back our stock. As Brian mentioned, our hope is to start in the back half of this year gradually ramping up to historical levels while we continue to pace towards hitting our intended target leverage levels, which we currently expect to reach by year-end 2022. The specific timing and magnitude of our buyback activity will be subject to improvement in our businesses most impacted by the pandemic and the implications related to potential changes in tax policy. 
So thanks for joining us on the call this morning, and I'll now hand it back to Marci to handle Q&A."

But as we think about the longer term, how do you look at last year's performance and some of the specific drivers in terms of their durability beyond the pandemic?

I think it starts with the main point that we've had great momentum in broadband for many quarters now, well before COVID. So there's been real strength in the category for us. And I think we point towards the fundamentals of broadband. And the fundamentals have been very consistent for us. And it starts with the market. The market is growing. We're taking share. And the sources are geographic all over the country where we serve and across the board competitively with DSL sources, telco, wired, wireless and other competitors. 
So I think while there in '20, truly an exceptional year for performance, and as Brian said, I think the right way of looking at '20, you've got to look at the full year results. And when you do that, the $2 million net customer additions, it really is extraordinary. The fundamentals that we see going forward, low churn, we compete well on the front end because we've consistently invested in the best network in the marketplace, I think. That is ubiquitous. We deliver the best overall service, redefined the category in speed, coverage, control and now streaming. And so you add up all those things, I think you -- it points towards strong organic growth. 
But as you look to next year, as Mike said, we do have a healthy start to the year. We're really encouraged to -- at what we're seeing right out of the gates. But I do think 2020, as everybody went home and there's just a lot more in a short period of time, folks that were working from home, schooling from home, I think there is -- that's a unique moment. But I think the fundamentals continue. We have penetration upside. There's growth opportunities that we believe strongly. I think '19 was a very strong year, too, by the way. I think that is the right one to look at as the best benchmark on a go-forward basis."

As Mike says, we're going to redo how we report starting next quarter. And we view the whole television business as a whole. And while our restructuring definitely took a lot of cost out of the business, but you're starting to see in the numbers, the real purpose of it was to allow us to grow it in the future and really run it as one business. So Cable Networks, obviously, are a big part of the business. They're still the biggest EBITDA driver. And I don't expect that to change anytime in the near future. 
But we're looking at the 2 revenue streams of the business, it's subscription and advertising, as one business, Broadcast, Cable and Peacock, and we're programming it as such. We're selling it to advertisers as one platform as such. And so I think, over time, it will be harder and harder to distinguish between the profitability of Cable Networks and the rest of our television business because we're looking at it as one business. But the restructuring allows us to run it like that. And we think that, that's going to allow us to really grow the business over time."

We've had a great partnership and glad that one important aspect of things is that improved MVNO. Brian mentioned the capital-light approach is working for us. We think it's going to work in the future. So I think as a starting point certainly will enable us to amplify what we're already doing, really push towards a range of offers to keep us very competitive. We continue to grab, switch and share in the mobile space. 
But you back up for a second, and we're just -- overall, we have been pleased and we're very optimistic about the mobile business and what it will do, in particular, continues to perform very well for broadband retention. And so we're committed to accelerating growth in mobile, and we mentioned this last time. And while the MVNO enhancement is a nice step forward, there are a lot of other things that we're doing like, really going after every single sales channel that we have. 
We reopened retail in a safe mode, new safety protocols. And every single sales channel, whether it's digital, call centers, you name it, we're really focusing on mobile. So we're also leaning into 5G. We'll participate very much in 5G. And we're featuring mobile in packaging with broadband leading in some cases. When there's a new product NPI, whether it's Apple, Samsung, we use that moment to literally lead with mobile. So I think, overall, we're really pleased. And I think it -- we feel good about the runway. 
I would also point towards our overarching plan that, one, we have access to, I think, the country's best network with Verizon and so talked about that. I think we also are leveraging -- continue to leverage WiFi. And we've always uniquely provided a great experience, not just in the home. We're improving things outside in the public area. And then over time, I think the other key thing, too, is being able to add a third layer, which could be our own targeted wireless infrastructure, which we might use to supplement the Verizon network and really go after the high dense usage areas from spectrum that we've already acquired. So I think all these factors point towards, I think, a unique opportunity for us."

I think it can be done in a variety of ways as we've seen sporting events all over the world take place from Premier League to the NFL and many others with limited spectators, no spectators or wherever the world may be in Japan in July, that will be up to the country and host committee. If in the event it doesn't happen, we have another Olympics coming in Beijing 7 months later or so. So I don't know, Jeff, whether you want to add anything to that.

I mean, obviously, we've been talking, Brian and I and team, for a while about our desire to get back into the historical balance on capital allocation, which, as you know, is keeping the balance sheet strong, making healthy investments in the organic growth across our businesses, which I think from listening to the call today, anyone would, I hope, gather that we continue to be very much leaning into doing that where we see returns and opportunity to make investments in these businesses for growth and then get back to our balance with complete capital return. It's the 13th year we've increased the dividend. But we turned off buybacks for a while and want to return to being in that portion of the return element as well. 
So as I said, we're pleased with where the balance sheet is. We've gotten net debt down to $90 billion from $108 billion after Sky. Just the evidence that we're seeing in parks in the fourth quarter, we were breakeven ex the Beijing pre-operating cost, even with Hollywood closed and even with the capacity constraints, just gives us a high degree of confidence that when people can return to travel on the other side of vaccinations outpacing the virus that we're going to see the COVID-impacted EBITDA businesses snap back to historical levels. 
To your point, it's going to take 12 months for it to run through and get a full -- and get it fully back. Hence, our point that in the second half of this year, we'd expect to see the beginnings of that. And rather than wait for a full 12 months, we'll start -- we hope and plan to begin our buyback at that moment. We'll keep it at the historical level, call it, as much as $5 billion ramp-up to that and probably stay there until we actually get to the definition that you called out with -- on a 12-month trailing basis to get to around or just inside 2.5x.

But on Flex, starting, Craig, with the -- our current strategy just a little bit, that we're -- we package it with broadband, another great way of surrounding broadband with products that drive better retention outcomes.

We'll have just about everything, pleased with the Peacock performance for sure, all the other apps that we've launched, including HBO Max and soon to be later on this quarter, Disney. 
I think today, it is more targeted. But as you mentioned, I really do think the next phase that we're working on and developing for and turning our innovation focus is that this is a long-term platform opportunity for us. And an aspect of the company that we have, called Xumo, that I think you all didn't know that, that's one piece of being able to drive -- help drive advertising. We can participate in revenue in the app splits that we get. And so we think of this with scale. 
And as you build a common software stack that includes Sky, do it together, which we're already working on, and then you have opportunities and -- which we've talked about going to smart TVs but really leveraging unique scale internationally that we can have, whether it's a device or whether it's a software solution.

Historically, you've tended to redeploy that excess liquidity into your strategic M&A program.

And so getting back in balance with, as Mike described earlier, I think, is really important, something that I certainly really have wanted us to get to. 
Second, we've also said that we like the mix of businesses. Roughly 70% of the company, being broadband-centric, is -- proved to be a really successful model. And we've had 10 wonderful years of growth of NBCUniversal. And last year was the only exception to that. So we expect great growth in all our businesses.

We've had it now for almost a month, very pleased with how it's doing. Our usage among our customers are actually higher than we think the usage was amongst Netflix customers. And more importantly, what's happening is we're seeing that people who are watching The Office on Peacock are watching lots of our other comedies. So it's really driving Parks and Rec and really driving Brooklyn Nine-Nine, amongst others. So there's kind of an ecosystem effect. 
We've talked in previous quarters about how EPL has really worked for us, English Premier League, and how those viewers also came in to our surprise, a much greater percentage of them, then turned and watched other things like Yellowstone and other comedies. So we believe there's kind of an ecosystem here, like the whole world of broadcast, where people will -- we can cross-promote people into different things. And that certainly seems to be working and The Office has really worked. 
WWE is kind of a perfect property for us because it allows us to, number one, thousands of hours of programming that were behind a paywall that we'll now put on the free service of Peacock, which will not only enhance the brand of WWE, but we can monetize in advertising. We get the events that were behind a paywall that used to be pay per view can drive our $4.99 premium version of Peacock. 
And then remember, we have a big investment in WWE at USA on our linear networks. And so this kind of particularly fits into our model of operating the business as a whole and cross-promoting and selling advertising clients one platform, one solution, as Linda calls it. So I think the model that we've constructed here to really kind of leverage our existing linear businesses and drive advertising is working. And I think comedy, sports, two of the success stories certainly so far."

So let me just quickly say I don't think there's anything new. We've managed successfully to work with different administrations with different regulatory perspectives around the broadband business. And -- but our view is obviously strongly felt that the long-standing light touch regulation has worked since President Clinton created that classification and hence reduces regulatory risk for investors and allows the company to invest more and that paid dividends unbelievably well during COVID. 
And we were never asked to [ down-res ] any services. And content providers and consumers really benefited. And that wasn't universally the case around the globe with different broadband regimes. But we do believe in net neutrality and have -- we're not going to discriminate, block, throttle on some of the other principles that we've committed to. And so if there's a way to find a way to codify that and perhaps put this issue in a permanent, more consistent place, that's certainly a possibility.

I'm really proud of our fourth quarter results and look forward to giving you a glimpse of what we're focused on and excited about once we come out of this pandemic. Our most recent performance was highlighted",1789,"Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm really proud of our fourth quarter results and look forward to giving you a glimpse of what we're focused on and excited about once we come out of this pandemic. 
Our most recent performance was highlighted by Cable, which grew EBITDA by over 12% and net cash flow by 26%. These are the best results of the year and of any fourth quarter in over a decade. We also have good news to share on our parks segment, which reached breakeven, excluding Beijing, even with Hollywood being closed. 
Our premium ad-supported streaming service, Peacock, now has 33 million sign-ups within just 6 months of its nationwide launch. And encouragingly, Sky's customer and revenue base essentially returned to pre-COVID levels this past quarter. Clearly, our company is strong, a testament to the tough decisions made by our leadership team and the excellent execution and coordination by our dedicated employees. 
Looking back over the whole year. 2020 was one of the most uncertain and challenging periods that any of us can remember. But we rose to the occasion, ensuring the safety and protection of our employees, providing customers with unparalleled service and innovative products that they relied on more than ever, strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet and continuing to invest for long-term growth and success. 
This year's Cable results were nothing short of exceptional, hitting a number of company records. We generated 2 million net broadband additions for the year and 538,000 for the fourth quarter, reaching record-low churn. High-speed Internet drove our highest-ever full year net customer relationship additions of 1.6 million, bringing us to 33 million total customer relationships. Yet with just only 50% penetration of our footprint, there remains plenty of opportunity for future growth. 
We also delivered outstanding EBITDA growth of nearly 9% and cash flow growth of 16% for all of 2020. Broadband is the cornerstone of what we do, powered by our robust, flexible and reliable network. And the many years of investments we've made have been on full display. We've continued to enhance our market-leading competitive position while keeping people connected, protected, informed and entertained by proactively managing our network, increasing broadband speeds, expanding our Internet Essentials program for low-income households, providing payment plans for customers struggling the most and offering Peacock and Flex for free. 
This pandemic has forced us to rethink the way we operate and service our customers. Immediately, we moved all of our care reps to work remotely from home, which has gone so well that we're leaning towards embracing this model permanently. In addition, we promoted further adoption of our digital self-help tools, such as Xfinity Assistant, which are available 24/7. We also expanded our self-installation eligibility. And now over 2/3 of our customers are connecting to our services this way. 
We are working hard with our communications and marketing efforts to enhance awareness of all we have to offer, which enables us to take cost out of the business while delivering a better experience for our customers. In fact, in the past 12 months, we've reduced agent-handled calls by over 16 million and truck rolls by 1.6 million, all while adding the more than 1.5 million net new customer relationships. 
Our efforts to reduce costs have been extremely successful. But what's even more exciting are the investments we're making to grow the overall business. A great example is Flex, which is offered to all of our broadband-only customers for free so that they can connect seamlessly to the streaming services they love. Within the first half of this year, Flex, along with X1, will be carrying all of the top streaming apps in the United States. We just added HBO Max. We'll be adding Disney+ in the near future. And we have many more on the road map. Flex has been a major win for us, and we continue to have really high hopes. 
Xfinity Mobile just came off a strong fourth quarter with nice sequential improvement in customer additions, resulting from a number of significant changes as we fully integrated mobile into our core cable operations and reprioritized our sales channels. We're really excited for 2021 as we've recently expanded parts of our MVNO agreement with Verizon that will enable us to improve our range of offerings and acquire more customers more profitably. As we said from the beginning, an MVNO-led, capital-light wireless model is the right one for us and has even more strategic opportunity in the years ahead. 
Business services came back faster than we expected. This quarter, we added 26,000 net new customers and generated revenue growth of 4.8%, the highest we've seen since the pandemic began. With less than 20% share of an approximately $50 billion total addressable commercial market in our footprint, we saw plenty of runway. So all in all, Cable had a fantastic 2020. And we look forward to a very strong 2021 and beyond. 
While the global pandemic has had a more significant impact on NBCUniversal, we took advantage of this moment to make a number of changes in both management and operations that sets us up for success. The most notable example is the reorganization of our cable networks and broadcast television businesses, which are now combined, along with Peacock, in a structure meant to drive long-term cost efficiencies and revenue opportunities. We finished the year having renewed a number of carriage agreements with many of our valuable distribution partners, putting us in a position of strength as we enter 2021. 
Peacock has had an exceptional start, exceeding all of our internal targets. This premium hybrid AVOD service, which has a light ad load and is unlike any other, offers a breadth of content that appeals to just about every demographic at an unbeatable consumer value, much of it for free. Momentum has further accelerated with the addition of The Office, which we own and began streaming exclusively on Peacock as of January 1. 
Not only is The Office driving incremental users, but these viewers are naturally finding and watching other programs on this platform, like Parks and Rec; Yellowstone; our latest original, Saved by the Bell; mega-hit movies from Universal and other studios; and sporting events such as the Premier League, golf and even an NFL Wild Card game. And earlier this week, we announced that Modern Family will be coming to Peacock next month, followed by the WWE in March. 
In film, our decision to release our titles direct-to-consumer via premium video on-demand when theaters were forced to close, has proven to be profitable and the right move for us. While we look forward to when we can enjoy the theatrical release of many franchise films, such as Fast 9 and the next Minions and Jurassic World, we will lean into what has become a successful hybrid distribution model. 
COVID had the most direct impact on our theme parks, which were either closed or running at limited capacity for the bulk of 2020. But I'm pleased with how quickly we were able to reopen Orlando and Osaka while ensuring the safety of our staff and guests. We continue to provide an amazing entertainment experience. Our guests are responding as confirmed by our steadily increased attendance and our most recent financial results. What we saw this fourth quarter, especially in Orlando, gives us even more conviction in the momentum that our theme parks will experience when we reach a sustainable recovery. We may experience some near-term setbacks with the most recent pickup in COVID cases. But I am optimistic as ever about the long-term trajectory of this very special business. 
Sky had a strong and encouraging fourth quarter. We added net new customers in every market, bringing our customer base essentially back to pre-COVID levels. The same can be said for revenue, which was essentially flat from what we generated in the fourth quarter of 2019. And we continue to make meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives. Sky Q, which integrates streaming, has surpassed 60% penetration in the U.K. and is poised to continue with recent additions of Disney+, discovery+ and Amazon Prime Video. We're really pleased with the success of Sky Originals, which contributed to the 20% increase in viewership on our Sky Entertainment channels during the fourth quarter and all of 2020, reaffirming our commitment to creating Sky Studios and expanding original programming. 
While the recent wave of COVID infections and related lockdowns across Europe are once again creating disruption, we are implementing the same protocols and procedures that worked the first time around with confidence of a similar pattern as this latest lockdown recedes. We really look forward to the second half of this year when we will also start to see the benefits from the reset of major sports rights contracts and cost savings that should result from a new, leaner operating model. And we're still on plan to double 2020 EBITDA over the next several years, as Jeremy recently laid out. 
Speaking of Jeremy, I want to thank him for his exceptional leadership of Sky and for his partnership since the acquisition. He and the team have established a unique world-class brand and a strong, well-run business that's now fully integrated. I'm thrilled for Dana Strong, who has now taken over as CEO of Sky. Many of you on this call have met with Dana since she joined our Cable business as Head of Consumer Services back in 2018. She is an accomplished executive with a wonderful ability to transform, inspire and drive positive change. And on top of all that, she also has over 20 years of international experience with nearly half of it spent in Europe. 
2021 offers a lot of promise for Comcast and hopefully for the entire world. While the first half will be more challenged than the second due to the most recent strain of COVID, we're really encouraged by the promise of a vaccine, which is the first step in putting the parts of our business that have been most impacted back on a path toward growth. This optimism is shared by our Board of Directors, which this morning announced an increase in our dividend for the 13th consecutive year. I'm also pleased that it's now our expectation that we will return to repurchasing shares in the back half of this year. 
While 2020 was not what any of us had imagined a year ago at this time, our execution, cooperation and fast decision-making enabled all parts of Comcast, NBC, Universal and Sky to respond and manage through a difficult environment remarkably well. I'm truly proud of what we have accomplished. And our fourth quarter shows just how well this company is positioned to succeed. 
Mike, over to you."
173341,698628338,2252287,"Comcast Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Now I'll review our fourth quarter 2020 results and make some comments on current conditions and, where possible, on the year ahead. Let's begin on Slides 4 and 5 with our consolidated results. Revenue declined",2531,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Now I'll review our fourth quarter 2020 results and make some comments on current conditions and, where possible, on the year ahead. 
Let's begin on Slides 4 and 5 with our consolidated results. Revenue declined 2.4% to $27.7 billion for the fourth quarter and 4.9% to $103.6 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA declined 15% to $7.2 billion for the fourth quarter and 10% to $30.8 billion for the full year. COVID-related severance and restructuring charges were $590 million in the fourth quarter and $828 million for the full year as we took actions to position our businesses for success in a post-COVID world. 
The Corporate and Other segment includes these charges and also includes Peacock for its launch year. For 2020, Peacock generated revenue of over $100 million while EBITDA losses approached $700 million. We continue to expect that EBITDA losses for 2020 and 2021 combined for Peacock will total roughly $2 billion. 
Adjusted earnings per share declined 29% to $0.56 for the quarter and 17% to $2.61 for the year. Finally, free cash flow was $1.7 billion in the quarter and $13.3 billion for the full year, reflecting the decline in EBITDA and the benefit from a reduction in working capital and capital expenditures, in part due to the pandemic. 
Now let's review our business segments, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 6. For the fourth quarter, Cable Communications revenue increased 6.3% while EBITDA increased 12% and adjusted EBITDA less capital grew 26%. For the full year, we grew customer relationships by 1.6 million, a 41% increase year-over-year with 455,000 net additions in the fourth quarter, driven by high-speed Internet, where we added 2 million net new residential and business customers this year and 538,000 in the fourth quarter. These record customer additions were the primary driver of our high-speed Internet revenue growth of 13% for the quarter and 10% for the full year. 
Other revenue highlights include acceleration in both business services and wireless. Business services posted 4.8% revenue growth and 26,000 net new customer additions, primarily driven by improvement in small businesses. Wireless revenue grew 36% with 246,000 net new lines in the quarter, bringing us to 2.8 million total lines at year-end. 
Wireless is a strategic priority for us and should accelerate on the back of several actions we have taken. First, we've expanded our Verizon MVNO agreement. Second, we fully integrated mobile into our core operations. And third, we've refined our marketing and activated all of our sales channels. And we're seeing a nice lift in our retail stores, which are now fully open. 
For video, revenue declined 0.7% with higher rates implemented in the beginning of 2020 more than offset by subscriber declines, including a 248,000 net loss in customers this quarter. And advertising revenue increased 34% year-over-year or 2.2%, excluding political, which almost doubled what we had generated in the last presidential election cycle in 2016. 
Turning to expenses. Cable Communications fourth quarter expenses increased 2.4%. Programming expenses were up 7.2% primarily due to the number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020, combined with annual escalators in existing agreements. Non-programming expenses declined slightly, reflecting lower technical and product support and customer service costs, which were partially offset by higher advertising, marketing and promotion spend to drive top line growth and higher expenses associated with the increased political advertising activity this quarter. Non-programming expenses per customer relationship decreased 5.1% despite our record customer growth. 
Cable Communications EBITDA grew by 12% in the quarter and 8.6% for the full year, with margins reaching 42.1%, an improvement of 170 basis points, excluding the RSN adjustments that impacted results earlier in the year. Cable capital expenditures decreased 1.1% resulting in CapEx intensity of 13.5%. For the full year, capital expenditures declined 4.4%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 11%, our lowest full year on record and an improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year, exclusive of RSN adjustments, driven by lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by higher spending on scalable infrastructure, which was driven by our ongoing investment to enhance the capacity of our network to support increased data usage. 
Turning to the current environment. High-speed Internet customer additions remain healthy. And we have all the pieces in place for 2021 to be a very strong year. We also have to remember that 2020 was exceptional on many accounts. And because of that, we view 2019, which was also very strong for us, as the more appropriate year against which to benchmark our performance. 
Turning to video. We expect the higher video rates we implemented at the beginning of this year, resulting from our current programming renewal cycle, to drive video sub losses back to the levels we had experienced in the first half of 2020. Our video strategy is centered on profitability. We do not chase unprofitable video subscribers as we can now offer Flex for free to those who prefer a streaming-only entertainment option. 
Looking to the full year. We expect Cable Communications revenue growth to exceed the 3.4% we just reported for 2020 as we remain focused on driving our connectivity businesses with better year-over-year comparisons in the first half. We expect programming expense growth to increase at high single-digit levels, similar to the fourth quarter as programming carriage renewals roll through in 2021, but programming expense growth is expected to moderate in 2022 and thereafter. 
Non-programming operating expense growth should normalize at a low single-digit increase to 2019 levels as we support the higher level of customer relationships and accelerate growth in our wireless business, which we expect will achieve stand-alone profitability in 2021. With our consistent discipline on expenses and capital investment, coupled with the trends at work as we remain focused on connectivity, we are confident in our ability to increase profitability, expand margins and improve CapEx intensity both in 2021 and thereafter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for NBCUniversal. For the fourth quarter, NBCUniversal revenue decreased 18% to $7.5 billion and EBITDA decreased 21% to $1.6 billion. Cable Networks revenue was down 6.4% in the fourth quarter, driven by a 38% decline in content licensing and other revenue, while distribution revenue was flat compared to a year ago, reflecting the absence of carriage renewals, combined with modest sequential improvement in subscriber losses. The delay to the start of the NBA and NHL seasons had a negative impact on our advertising revenue, which declined 4.2%, while the related shift of sports rights amortization out of the quarter was a benefit to the EBITDA, which grew 22% year-over-year. 
For the full year, Cable Networks EBITDA increased 4% primarily driven by the sports-related impacts of COVID. Fewer sporting events in 2020 contributed to lower distribution and advertising revenue as well as lower programming and production expenses of $655 million year-over-year. Seasons were shortened earlier in the year and current seasons were delayed, pushing a number of events and the related rights amortization costs for 2021. So looking to 2021, we expect healthy distribution revenue growth as a result of recent successful carriage renewals. We also currently expect significantly more sporting events compared to 2020, which should result in higher advertising revenue but also a significant increase in sports-related programming and production costs, equating to a low double-digit decline in Cable Networks EBITDA this year. 
Turning to Broadcast. Revenue decreased 12% in the fourth quarter due to a 39% decline in content licensing and a 9.6% decline in advertising revenue, partially offset by another quarter of double-digit increases in retransmission consent fees. The content licensing revenue declines at both Broadcast and Cable Networks were timing-related as sales to streaming platforms, including Peacock, were more heavily concentrated in the first 9 months of the year. We also had a difficult comparison to a significant library deal in last year's fourth quarter. 
The decline in advertising revenue was driven by lower ratings, partly due to the delayed launch of our fall season. This was somewhat offset by record levels of political advertising at our local stations. The lower revenues were partially offset by a decline in operating costs, reflecting lower content licensing and a delay in production due to COVID-19, resulting in a decline of 24% to $356 million in Broadcast EBITDA. 
Filmed Entertainment revenue declined 8.3% and EBITDA increased 65% to $151 million for the fourth quarter. Theatrical revenue declined 70% due to theaters being either closed or operating at limited capacity while content and licensing increased 23%, driven by PVOD. Expenses were significantly lower due to fewer releases as a result of COVID-19. In 2021, we hope to debut a number of our franchise films in theaters, such as Fast 9 and Minions 2. But the situation remains fluid, and we are still adjusting our 2021 slate to maximize value as evidenced by our recent decision to push back the release of Boss Baby 2 from March to September. 
Theme Parks revenue was $579 million in the quarter with an EBITDA loss of $15 million. These results reflect Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Japan operating at limited capacity while Hollywood remains closed. Results also include $45 million of Universal Beijing preopening costs. For 2021, keep in mind that the first quarter tends to be seasonally light in terms of attendance. And we also expect an increased COVID impact, given new restrictions in Japan, which have also caused us to delay the opening of Super Nintendo World. We are pleased that Universal Beijing remains set to open this summer with preopening costs ramping to $300 million in the first half of this year. 
One last item I'd like to highlight. We will be changing the way we report for NBCUniversal starting in the first quarter of 2021 with the largest impact being to our television businesses as we combine Cable Networks and Broadcast into one segment along with Peacock. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for Sky, which I'll speak to on a constant currency basis. Sky revenue for the fourth quarter declined 0.9% to $5.2 billion, reflecting a 2.8% decline in direct-to-consumer revenue, driven mostly by our hospitality or pubs and clubs segment, which was challenged by additional COVID-related lockdowns during the quarter. Excluding hospitality, direct-to-consumer revenue was essentially flat year-over-year with solid low single-digit growth in the U.K. 
Somewhat offsetting the decline in direct-to-consumer revenue was a 10% increase in content revenue as we monetized our original programming while advertising revenue grew 3.9% as Sky outperformed a challenged advertising market helped by a strong performance in the U.K. Sky added 244,000 net new customers in the quarter, bringing us essentially back to pre-COVID levels of total customer relationships with additions in all markets, driven by a very healthy streaming business. We've also seen strong uptake in our broadband and mobile products in the U.K. 
Sky EBITDA was $139 million as the fourth quarter was impacted by a number of expense items, such as incremental sports rights amortization related to the shift of sporting events that have been delayed as a result of COVID-19, higher investments in entertainment programming, costs related to the launch of our new Sky channels last May as well as higher marketing spend to promote strategic initiatives, such as Sky Q, growth in our mobile product in the U.K. and broadband in Italy. 
Looking ahead, we would characterize 2021 as a tale of 2 halves. The first half is under pressure due to the recent increase in COVID-related restrictions to the extreme levels we experienced at the beginning of the pandemic. With the government mandating the closure of pubs and clubs as well as many retail outlets, we are experiencing weakness in hospitality and advertising, and we now expect Sky's first quarter revenue to decline slightly year-over-year. We also expect first half expenses to be elevated when compared to 2020 as higher sports rights amortization resulting from sporting events being postponed from 2020 to 2021 will be with us through the second quarter. 
In non-sports-related costs, we will see an increase as we grow broadband and mobile in the U.K., broadband in Italy and launch the SMB business in the U.K. later this quarter. In the second half of '21, we expect a quick recovery in hospitality and advertising revenue once these latest restrictions are lifted and an acceleration in EBITDA growth from the tailwinds related to our major sports rights resets and more efficient operating structure. 
I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 9. We generated $13.3 billion in free cash flow and paid $4.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders in 2020. Consolidated total capital, which includes CapEx as well as software and intangibles, decreased 6.4% for the year to $11.6 billion while working capital improved by $2.2 billion to a decline of $178 million for the full year, both reflecting an impact from COVID. Looking to 2021, we anticipate total capital will remain relatively flat to 2020 levels while the working capital drag will increase relative to the levels we saw in 2019, which is the more appropriate comparison due to an increase in content investments, our broadcast of the Olympics and the reversal of COVID-related one-time tax deferrals. 
Turning to capital allocation. Our strategy has always been a balance of several important priorities: maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in profitable organic growth and returning capital to shareholders. First, on our balance sheet, we've made great progress reducing net debt from $108 billion post the Sky acquisition at the end of 2018 to $90 billion at the end of 2020. 
Second, we remain focused on organic investment in our businesses to grow the long-term earnings power of the company, including our CapEx investment in broadband and parks and continued investment behind other growth initiatives where we see strong return on investments, such as Xfinity Mobile, Peacock, Flex, Sky Q and broadband in Italy. 
Third, we are committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. And we have a proven track record. We have increased our dividend 13 years in a row at a 17% CAGR, significantly in excess of the S&P over that same time period. In addition, we have a demonstrated history of buying back stock, having reduced our share count by nearly 20% between the NBCUniversal and Sky acquisitions. 
In 2021, we believe we will be able to return to our historical practice of returning ample capital to our shareholders. We are again raising the dividend by $0.08 a share to $1 per share. And we are planning to return to buying back our stock. As Brian mentioned, our hope is to start in the back half of this year gradually ramping up to historical levels while we continue to pace towards hitting our intended target leverage levels, which we currently expect to reach by year-end 2022. The specific timing and magnitude of our buyback activity will be subject to improvement in our businesses most impacted by the pandemic and the implications related to potential changes in tax policy. 
So thanks for joining us on the call this morning, and I'll now hand it back to Marci to handle Q&A."

I mean I know you talked about 2019 as the benchmark year. But as we think about the longer term, how do you look at last year's performance and some of the specific drivers in terms of their durability beyond the pandemic?  
And then for Jeff, you guys laid out, and I realize this is prior to your elevation as CEO, I think, 30 million to 35 million active accounts on Peacock by '24. I know sign-ups and active accounts are different metrics, but it seems like you're nicely ahead of that trajectory. Can you just sort of reframe the opportunity with Peacock for us today versus kind of the initial outlook? And when might revenues become kind of material to NBC for that business?"

I think it starts with the main point that we've had great momentum in broadband for many quarters now, well before COVID. So there's been real strength in the category for us. And I think we point towards the fundamentals of broadband. And the fundamentals have been very consistent for us. And it starts with the market. The market is growing. We're taking share. And the sources are geographic all over the country where we serve and across the board competitively with DSL sources, telco, wired, wireless and other competitors. 
So I think while there in '20, truly an exceptional year for performance, and as Brian said, I think the right way of looking at '20, you've got to look at the full year results. And when you do that, the $2 million net customer additions, it really is extraordinary. The fundamentals that we see going forward, low churn, we compete well on the front end because we've consistently invested in the best network in the marketplace, I think. That is ubiquitous. We deliver the best overall service, redefined the category in speed, coverage, control and now streaming. And so you add up all those things, I think you -- it points towards strong organic growth. 
But as you look to next year, as Mike said, we do have a healthy start to the year. We're really encouraged to -- at what we're seeing right out of the gates. But I do think 2020, as everybody went home and there's just a lot more in a short period of time, folks that were working from home, schooling from home, I think there is -- that's a unique moment. But I think the fundamentals continue. We have penetration upside. There's growth opportunities that we believe strongly. I think '19 was a very strong year, too, by the way. I think that is the right one to look at as the best benchmark on a go-forward basis."

And we were up significantly over all of our metrics versus what we anticipated going into the business. We're only -- we launched this on Comcast just over 9 months ago and nationally just over 6 months ago. So we're at the very beginning of this business. 
But we're very confident, based on the small amount of time, that the business model is exactly the right business model. People are signing up. They're using it more than we expected. And advertisers are very interested in buying it. So this steady growth is very promising for us. And we don't have anything to reframe at this point.

And while our restructuring definitely took a lot of cost out of the business, but you're starting to see in the numbers, the real purpose of it was to allow us to grow it in the future and really run it as one business. So Cable Networks, obviously, are a big part of the business. They're still the biggest EBITDA driver. And I don't expect that to change anytime in the near future. 
But we're looking at the 2 revenue streams of the business, it's subscription and advertising, as one business, Broadcast, Cable and Peacock, and we're programming it as such. We're selling it to advertisers as one platform as such. And so I think, over time, it will be harder and harder to distinguish between the profitability of Cable Networks and the rest of our television business because we're looking at it as one business. But the restructuring allows us to run it like that. And we think that, that's going to allow us to really grow the business over time."

We've had a great partnership and glad that one important aspect of things is that improved MVNO. Brian mentioned the capital-light approach is working for us. We think it's going to work in the future. So I think as a starting point certainly will enable us to amplify what we're already doing, really push towards a range of offers to keep us very competitive. We continue to grab, switch and share in the mobile space. 
But you back up for a second, and we're just -- overall, we have been pleased and we're very optimistic about the mobile business and what it will do, in particular, continues to perform very well for broadband retention. And so we're committed to accelerating growth in mobile, and we mentioned this last time. And while the MVNO enhancement is a nice step forward, there are a lot of other things that we're doing like, really going after every single sales channel that we have. 
We reopened retail in a safe mode, new safety protocols. And every single sales channel, whether it's digital, call centers, you name it, we're really focusing on mobile. So we're also leaning into 5G. We'll participate very much in 5G. And we're featuring mobile in packaging with broadband leading in some cases. When there's a new product NPI, whether it's Apple, Samsung, we use that moment to literally lead with mobile. So I think, overall, we're really pleased. And I think it -- we feel good about the runway. 
I would also point towards our overarching plan that, one, we have access to, I think, the country's best network with Verizon and so talked about that. I think we also are leveraging -- continue to leverage WiFi. And we've always uniquely provided a great experience, not just in the home. We're improving things outside in the public area. And then over time, I think the other key thing, too, is being able to add a third layer, which could be our own targeted wireless infrastructure, which we might use to supplement the Verizon network and really go after the high dense usage areas from spectrum that we've already acquired. So I think all these factors point towards, I think, a unique opportunity for us."

So that gives us just great expectation for the future. So sitting here today, I believe there will be an Olympics. I hope there will be an Olympics, and I think that's our best intelligence at this time, and we're excited about that. 
I think it can be done in a variety of ways as we've seen sporting events all over the world take place from Premier League to the NFL and many others with limited spectators, no spectators or wherever the world may be in Japan in July, that will be up to the country and host committee. If in the event it doesn't happen, we have another Olympics coming in Beijing 7 months later or so. So I don't know, Jeff, whether you want to add anything to that. But we're very hopeful and believe that they'll find a way to safely and successfully have the Olympics, which for us is a television event and would be an amazing moment for the world to come back together post what we've all globally been through, which is so unprecedented.

I mean, obviously, we've been talking, Brian and I and team, for a while about our desire to get back into the historical balance on capital allocation, which, as you know, is keeping the balance sheet strong, making healthy investments in the organic growth across our businesses, which I think from listening to the call today, anyone would, I hope, gather that we continue to be very much leaning into doing that where we see returns and opportunity to make investments in these businesses for growth and then get back to our balance with complete capital return. It's the 13th year we've increased the dividend. But we turned off buybacks for a while and want to return to being in that portion of the return element as well. 
So as I said, we're pleased with where the balance sheet is. We've gotten net debt down to $90 billion from $108 billion after Sky. Just the evidence that we're seeing in parks in the fourth quarter, we were breakeven ex the Beijing pre-operating cost, even with Hollywood closed and even with the capacity constraints, just gives us a high degree of confidence that when people can return to travel on the other side of vaccinations outpacing the virus that we're going to see the COVID-impacted EBITDA businesses snap back to historical levels. 
To your point, it's going to take 12 months for it to run through and get a full -- and get it fully back. Hence, our point that in the second half of this year, we'd expect to see the beginnings of that. And rather than wait for a full 12 months, we'll start -- we hope and plan to begin our buyback at that moment. We'll keep it at the historical level, call it, as much as $5 billion ramp-up to that and probably stay there until we actually get to the definition that you called out with -- on a 12-month trailing basis to get to around or just inside 2.5x. And I expect that to happen by the end of 2022."

So I wonder if you could just expand on Flex a little bit and talk about what your hopes and expectations are for Flex. And could you grow that into a national product that is widely distributed or even a global product that's widely distributed as an aggregator platform? 
And then with respect to wireless, I wonder if you could just update us on your thinking about the CBRS spectrum now that we're out of the CBRS quiet period and what you might do now with strand-mounted small cells for traffic offload, whether you're testing that in any markets or how much traffic you expect you might be able to offload from the MVNO agreement."

Well, let me touch on the first one then and go into CBRS. But on Flex, starting, Craig, with the -- our current strategy just a little bit, that we're -- we package it with broadband, another great way of surrounding broadband with products that drive better retention outcomes. And that's -- it's working. It's working very well. So we target it to the streaming segment and give the customer a great experience with the X1 voice and all the apps. So we've got tons of apps. We'll have just about everything, pleased with the Peacock performance for sure, all the other apps that we've launched, including HBO Max and soon to be later on this quarter, Disney. 
I think today, it is more targeted. But as you mentioned, I really do think the next phase that we're working on and developing for and turning our innovation focus is that this is a long-term platform opportunity for us. And an aspect of the company that we have, called Xumo, that I think you all didn't know that, that's one piece of being able to drive -- help drive advertising. We can participate in revenue in the app splits that we get. And so we think of this with scale. 
And as you build a common software stack that includes Sky, do it together, which we're already working on, and then you have opportunities and -- which we've talked about going to smart TVs but really leveraging unique scale internationally that we can have, whether it's a device or whether it's a software solution. But I think these are the things that we'll look at. Right now, it's working great within footprint, but we're building out plans beyond that."

And I think we'll have more to talk about throughout the year. Same sort of answer on the wireless question. I think we're set up for future opportunities with some of the investments we've made and some of our early success. So I share your clients' enthusiasm.

So Mike, when you were responding to his question on the buybacks, you talked about ramping back up towards the historical level of $5 billion a year until you get back to sort of that long-term leverage target of about 2.5 turns. But if I think longer term, if you were to sort of remain at your historical buyback pace, you would probably continue to delever, and I think actually quite rapidly. 
Historically, you've tended to redeploy that excess liquidity into your strategic M&A program. And so the question is how do you think about the medium- to long-term importance of preserving dry powder for that type of flexibility versus whether your current asset portfolio is sufficiently well suited to meet your long-term operating targets?"

But I don't think there's any doubt that we are very pleased and don't see any strategic gaps in the portfolio that we have. So we'll talk about it when we get to the 2.5x.

I think it's an important moment for us with -- today in getting to a point that we feel the businesses are healthy, that we can see, we believe and we hope, obviously, things can change with progress with the vaccinations and the impaired businesses really having a road map to full recovery and beyond. And so getting back in balance with, as Mike described earlier, I think, is really important, something that I certainly really have wanted us to get to. 
Second, we've also said that we like the mix of businesses. Roughly 70% of the company, being broadband-centric, is -- proved to be a really successful model. And we've had 10 wonderful years of growth of NBCUniversal. And last year was the only exception to that. So we expect great growth in all our businesses. But having a mix with -- where the businesses can work together, but having majority of the company being broadband-centric has worked really well for us. 
So I think it's a -- we're very pleased with the company we've got. We've got a great scale. We've got momentum. That's where our focus is at. And the main priority was today to get to this announcement of our expectations and then go ahead and hopefully see the world go in the right direction here and continue on the path we're on and get to the execution of that later in this year, so an important step today."

We've had it now for almost a month, very pleased with how it's doing. Our usage among our customers are actually higher than we think the usage was amongst Netflix customers. And more importantly, what's happening is we're seeing that people who are watching The Office on Peacock are watching lots of our other comedies. So it's really driving Parks and Rec and really driving Brooklyn Nine-Nine, amongst others. So there's kind of an ecosystem effect. 
We've talked in previous quarters about how EPL has really worked for us, English Premier League, and how those viewers also came in to our surprise, a much greater percentage of them, then turned and watched other things like Yellowstone and other comedies. So we believe there's kind of an ecosystem here, like the whole world of broadcast, where people will -- we can cross-promote people into different things. And that certainly seems to be working and The Office has really worked. 
WWE is kind of a perfect property for us because it allows us to, number one, thousands of hours of programming that were behind a paywall that we'll now put on the free service of Peacock, which will not only enhance the brand of WWE, but we can monetize in advertising. We get the events that were behind a paywall that used to be pay per view can drive our $4.99 premium version of Peacock. 
And then remember, we have a big investment in WWE at USA on our linear networks. And so this kind of particularly fits into our model of operating the business as a whole and cross-promoting and selling advertising clients one platform, one solution, as Linda calls it. So I think the model that we've constructed here to really kind of leverage our existing linear businesses and drive advertising is working. And I think comedy, sports, two of the success stories certainly so far."

So let me just quickly say I don't think there's anything new. We've managed successfully to work with different administrations with different regulatory perspectives around the broadband business. And -- but our view is obviously strongly felt that the long-standing light touch regulation has worked since President Clinton created that classification and hence reduces regulatory risk for investors and allows the company to invest more and that paid dividends unbelievably well during COVID. 
And we were never asked to [ down-res ] any services. And content providers and consumers really benefited. And that wasn't universally the case around the globe with different broadband regimes. But we do believe in net neutrality and have -- we're not going to discriminate, block, throttle on some of the other principles that we've committed to. And so if there's a way to find a way to codify that and perhaps put this issue in a permanent, more consistent place, that's certainly a possibility.

We certainly got off to a great start this year. Our entire company performed well, and we once again had particularly strong results at Cable, which posted its third consecutive quarter of double-digit EBITDA growth, ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit net cash flow growth. We added 461,000 broadband customers, which drove 380,000 customer relationship additions. This is the best first quarter on record. 
Our connect activity was healthy and broadband churn improved for the 13th quarter in a row, hitting our lowest churn rate in our company's history. I'm very proud of this quarter's results and our long record of growth, which I believe is a direct result of disciplined investment, fantastic innovation and consistent execution in a highly competitive market. 
This morning, I'd like to go a bit deeper in 2 areas: the robustness of our network in the U.S. and more broadly how we positioned ourselves to successfully compete against alternative providers and technologies. We've spent nearly $30 billion in the last decade, building an expansive fiber dense network comprised of 191,000 route miles that carries an immense amount of traffic has demonstrated extraordinary performance throughout the pandemic. Under Tony Werner, our retiring Chief Technology Officer, we have consistently engineered our network to anticipate change. And during his 15-plus years at Comcast, he has helped transform us into a product and technology innovator and leader. Tony, we thank you. 
He's being succeeded by Charlie Herrin. Many of you on this call are familiar with Charlie, he helped develop game-changing products, including scaling X1 and most recently led to successful effort to redefine how we interact with customers, which has resulted in significantly higher NPS scores and lower operating costs. Charlie, Dave and I have been fortunate to work together for 20 years. Under Dave and Tony, we've recruited the best engineering talent around the world and now are working as 1 global tech team to create platforms, apps, experiences that evolve the way people connect and consume entertainment. We've done all this while keeping the network our #1 priority. 
We've introduced the xFi advanced gateway. The most powerful of its kind. Our highest users are connecting a wide variety of devices in the home and streaming multiple services simultaneously over WiFi. Our xFi pods integrate with Xfinity Gateways to form a mesh network that maximizes WiFi coverage. All you do is plug one of these pods into an outlet to get great coverage in every room. We provide our customers with what they need, which goes well beyond extraordinary connectivity and speed. Xfinity is the only broadband provider to offer advanced security for monitoring devices inside and soon outside of the home. 
We also uniquely provide our customers with a whole home speed test and enable parents to manage internet time spent by streaming application. This is all backed by a network that is built to consistently deliver the fastest speeds and outperform well into the future with 2 major initiatives underway. The first is virtualizing our network by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning. We're taking functions that were once performed by thousands of large and expensive pieces of hardware and moving them into the cloud, which alone has reduced innovation cycles from years down to just months. We're also automating many of our core network functions so that we can deliver instant capacity as well as identify and fix network issues before they ever affect a customer. 
Our second priority is further enhancing how we deliver our broadband product over our network. We currently offer downstream speeds of 1.2 gigs across our entire footprint using our DOCSIS 3.1 architecture. And can increase upstream in a capital-efficient way. We're making great progress to deliver multi-gig symmetrical speeds. And in the last 6 months, we completed 2 important milestones on our road map. In October, we conducted a successful live test of 1.25 gig symmetrical speeds. And earlier this month, our engineers completed the first ever live lab test of DOCSIS 4.0, which establishes a foundation for us to deliver multi-gigabit speeds over our existing network without the need for massive digging and construction projects. 
Let me next talk about Xfinity Mobile. Where we're having great success. This past quarter, we reached breakeven on a stand-alone basis for the first time and added 278,000 mobile lines, the highest quarterly addition since launch. We just announced a new unlimited family plan, which can provide $600 in annual savings relative to other competitor family plans. 
Now let's turn to Sky, which despite renewed lockdowns in Europe, generated revenue growth and delivered the best first quarter customer relationships net addition in 6 years. I am particularly encouraged by our strong performance in the U.K. excluding pubs and clubs, which remain closed, U.K. direct-to-consumer revenue grew 8% over the first quarter 2020, and 11% relative to 2019. Churn continued to trend down, 2/3 of our customer base in the U.K. now have Sky Q. We're seeing great acceleration in mobile, and we just launched Sky Connect, our B2B broadband service that leverages the expertise of Comcast Cable. Dana Strong is off to a great start and is sinking up more than ever with Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, so that together, we're all innovating more quickly, better serving our customers and viewers and increasing operating efficiencies. 
We're also encouraged by the trends we're seeing across NBCU. Our Park segment broke even, excluding Beijing, for the second consecutive quarter driven by remarkable attendance at Universal Orlando. We can see firsthand the pent-up demand for high-quality entertainment and family fund outside of the home, and we remain incredibly bullish on the Park's business. While Osaka recently had to close temporarily, Universal Studios Hollywood reopened on April 16, the first time since the pandemic started. Our long-term excitement stems from the fact that we have a fabulous road map of new attractions and experiences awaiting guests as they safely return to our current parks. 
In NBCUniversal media segment under Jeff Shell and Mark Lazarus, we're starting to see the benefits of our new operating structure. Excluding Peacock, adjusted EBITDA increased 10% year-over-year. Our news content continues to experience tremendous momentum and distribution revenue is trending above expectations, a testament to the strength of our linear brands. We're back in business on the studio side with more than 30 television series currently in production and we're excited for our first big theatrical debut with Fast 9 launching in both the U.S. and China later in the second quarter. 
We're also making great progress with Peacock, our premium ad-supported streaming service. Just 1 year post launch, we've had 42 million sign-ups. Monthly users of the service are consuming nearly 20% more programming hours each month than our traditional audience on NBC. And we just crossed 1 billion total hours watched, nearly double our plan when we launched. This strength in users and engagement has enabled us to create additional advertising inventory outside of our initial partnership. 
With CPMs at a material premium to linear prime time. Key to Peacock's domestic success has been Xfinity with X1 and Flex driving subscriber acquisitions and healthy engagement. With Peacock, we've created great options for ourselves with several opportunities on the horizon. We've recently secured more original programming with creative partners like WWE and the NFL. Providing a strong path to upsell into Peacock premium.  As Peacock gain scale in the U.S., we see compelling ways we can expand internationally. We're looking to take advantage of the brand and scale of Sky across our European markets and potentially strike partnerships with local programmers and distributors in geographies where it makes sense. We plan to share more information on Peacock, throughout this year. 
So in summary, we're all very proud and encouraged by our first quarter results. This performance is a testament to the resilience and evolution of our company. Excellent execution of our growth initiatives combined with tight cost control, brings us 1 step closer to our balance sheet goals and I am eager to see us return to our historical practice of repurchasing shares starting in the second half of this year. 
Lastly, I want to thank our team. Everyone across the company has continued to show up and innovate for our customers, audience, guests and each other. We were recently named as 1 of the top 5 big companies to work for in the U.S. and 1 of the top 10 inclusive companies in the U.K., a testament to the work and passion of our wonderful employees. Mike, over to you."

I'll begin on Slide 4 with our first quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 2.2% to $27.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.5% to $8.4 billion, adjusted EPS increased 7% to $0.76 per share. And finally, we generated $5.3 billion of free cash flow. 
Now let's turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable revenue increased 5.9% to $15.8 billion. EBITDA increased 12% to $6.8 billion and EBITDA less capital grew 16% to $5.1 billion. We added 380,000 net new customer relationships, up 2.4% over last year's first quarter and up 27% over the first quarter of 2019. This was the best first quarter on record and was driven by broadband. Where we added 461,000 net new residential and business customers, only slightly below last year's first quarter and 23% above the first quarter of 2019. 
We saw healthy connect activity, and this quarter marked the lowest broadband churn in our history. This positive momentum has continued into the second quarter. And from what we see today, we anticipate total broadband additions for the year to grow by mid-single-digit levels compared to 2019, which, aside from the extraordinary growth we had in an unusual 2020 was the best year in more than a decade. The strong customer additions, coupled with ARPU growth of 4.4%, drove a 12% increase in broadband revenue for the first quarter, the largest driver of overall Cable revenue, and we expect this trend will continue. We also saw an acceleration in both business services and wireless. Business services revenue increased 6.1% and delivered 11,000 net new customer additions, primarily driven by continued improvement in small business. Wireless revenue grew 50% due to an increase in both customer lines and higher device sales. We added 278,000 net new lines in the quarter, the best results since launching this business in 2017 bringing us to 3.1 million total lines as of quarter end. 
Turning to video. Revenue was consistent with the prior year, reflecting very healthy ARPU growth of 6.8% and offset by net video subscriber losses totaling 491,000, which we felt mostly on the connect side as residential churn improved year-over-year. We believe our residential rate adjustment at the beginning of the year was a significant contributor to both the ARPU increase and the video subscriber loss in the quarter, and we expect video losses in the second quarter will remain elevated. 
We currently anticipate Cable Communications revenue growth in the second quarter to accelerate by a few hundred basis points from the 5.9% we just reported, partly due to the comparison to last year's second quarter, which was most significantly impacted by COVID-19 as well as our focus on driving growth in our connectivity businesses. 
Turning to expenses. Cable Communications first quarter expenses increased 1.5%. The programming expenses were up 5.5%, primarily due to the number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020, combined with annual escalators in existing agreements. Looking to the second quarter, we expect programming expense growth to increase at low double-digit levels due to the continued impact of contract renewals as well as the comparison to last year's second quarter, which was favorably impacted by adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees. For the full year, we continue to expect programming expense to increase at high single-digit levels. 
Non programming expenses declined 1.1% on an absolute basis and 5.9% on a per relationship basis, while our customer relationships grew 5% year-over-year. Nonprogramming expenses should increase at high single-digit rate in the second quarter due in part to the comparison to last year, which reflected the slowdown in business activity due to COVID-19 as well as our continued focus on driving growth in our core broadband and wireless businesses. Cable Communications EBITDA grew by 12%, with margins reaching 43.2%, reflecting 250 basis points of year-over-year improvement. These results include the important milestone of our wireless business reaching breakeven for the first time since launch. 
Cable capital expenditures increased 8%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 8.7%, up slightly compared to last year and driven by a 23% increase in scalable infrastructure as we continue to invest to enhance the capacity of our network. This spending was partially offset by lower customer premise equipment and support. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. As you know, we recently issued an 8-K with updated trending schedules and a new reporting format that reflects the way the business is now managed. We moved Peacock, which was previously reported in our corporate results to NBCUniversal. And now we present NBCU in 3 business segments: Media, which combines our TV businesses in Peacock, Studios, which combines our film and television studio businesses, and theme parks. I will discuss today's results in this new format. 
Let's start with total NBCUniversal results. Revenue decreased 9.1% to $7 billion and EBITDA was down 12% to $1.5 billion. Media revenue increased 3.2%, driven by 9.1% growth in distribution revenue, which reflected higher rates post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020, partially offset by subscriber declines, which showed sequential improvement. Advertising revenue declined 3.4% as lower entertainment ratings and tough political comps were partially offset by more sports in the quarter, strength in news and the launch of Peacock. Media EBITDA declined 3.7% when including Peacock, which generated revenue of $91 million and an EBITDA loss of $277 million. Excluding Peacock, media EBITDA increased 10%, primarily driven by lower expenses, which was partly due to lower entertainment costs associated with fewer original hours aired and partly due to our new operating model. 
This year-over-year reduction more than offset higher sports cost resulting from additional events. Looking to the second quarter, we expect healthy growth in distribution revenue to continue. We will have significantly more sporting events compared to last year, which should result in higher advertising revenue, but also a significant increase in sports-related programming and production costs. Studio revenue was flat compared to last year, primarily reflecting higher content licensing revenue, offset by lower theatrical revenue. Content licensing revenue increased 14% primarily due to licensing deals, including the office, which became exclusively available for streaming on Peacock this past January. Theatrical revenue decreased 88%, reflecting the deferral of theatrical releases due to COVID-19. Significantly fewer releases in the first quarter resulted in lower expenses, driving EBITDA growth of 66%. 
We're excited to be releasing Fast 9 in theaters later in the second quarter, but we delayed the release of Minions 2 from July of this year to July of 2022, which will shift the profits from 2021 to 2022 as well as we continue to manage our film fleet to maximize value. Theme parks revenue decreased 33.1% in the quarter and generated an EBITDA loss of $61 million, which included $100 million of Universal Beijing preopening costs. These results reflect Universal Orlando resort operating at limited capacity, but trends remain encouraging as attendance continue to rebound, and we've been at or near capacity limits through spring break. 
Hollywood remained closed during the quarter, but we recently opened at a 25% capacity limit and expect this to move higher by June 15. In Japan, we recently had to close our park temporarily due to rising COVID cases, but prior to this, we had seen strong demand. Looking ahead, we expect our EBITDA results to improve in the back half of the year as domestic attendance trends improve, and we remain on track to open our new park Universal Beijing this summer. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the first quarter, Sky revenue increased 2% to $5 billion, largely reflecting healthy growth in our U.K. business. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 1.8% with growth in the U.K. even stronger. This result was driven by higher average rates per customer and strong customer growth across all markets. We generated 221,000 net customer additions the best first quarter in 6 years, driven by streaming across our markets as well as steady momentum in mobile and broadband within the U.K. Advertising revenue increased 3.4% as we continue to outperform the market, particularly in the U.K., where the ad market is rebounding more quickly than we expected, and we are driving growth through advanced advertising. 
Sky generated $364 million in EBITDA in the first quarter. As expected, this reflects elevated expenses, including higher sports rights amortization, resulting from more events in the current quarter as well as higher expenses associated with successfully growing our mobile and broadband businesses and investment in key growth initiatives, which now include Sky Connect, our recently launched commercial broadband business in the U.K. For the second quarter, we expect revenue growth to accelerate to low double-digit levels on a constant currency basis due to the comparison to last year's second quarter, which was the most impacted by COVID-19 as well as continued strength in our U.K. business. 
We also anticipate significantly higher Sports rights amortization compared to last year when events were paused. As a result, we expect to generate a similar level of EBITDA in the second quarter as we did in the first quarter. We were recently outbid for some of the broadcast rights for Serie A in Italy as we stood firm and our disciplined approach to sports-related costs. We believe this was the right long-term financial decision, but we expect a reduction in programming and production expenses and a potential decline in customer relationships in Italy as a result. 
We continue to expect Sky EBITDA in the second half of this year to accelerate from first half levels, reflecting the benefits of a reset to major sports rights as well as a more efficient operating structure. 
I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. Free cash flow was $5.3 billion in the quarter, an increase of roughly 60% year-over-year primarily due to an improvement in net working capital and higher EBITDA. Net working capital will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis, and we still expect the full year drag increase relative to 2019 due to an increase in content investments, our broadcast of the Olympics and the reversal of COVID related onetime tax deferrals. 
Consolidated total capital, which includes capital expenditures as well as software intangibles decreased 1.1% in the first quarter to $2.5 billion, reflecting a decline at NBCU, which was partially offset by increases at Sky and Cable. We ended the first quarter with $104 billion of debt with a weighted average cost of 3.6% and a weighted average life of 14.5 years and net debt of $86 billion for a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.7x. Throughout the pandemic, we have maintained an elevated cash balance to fortify our liquidity position, and we ended the first quarter with $15 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We expect to gradually reduce our cash position by deploying excess cash towards debt reduction throughout the remainder of the year as our business operations continue to recover. 
Finally, we remain committed to our long-standing balanced approach to capital allocation, which consists of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for profitable growth and returning capital to shareholders for a strong commitment to our recurring dividends and our expected return to share repurchases in the second half of this year.

So I have a broad-based question that covers basically all the divisions. In Cable, it feels like they're beginning for advanced advertising.

I'm just -- I don't know if this is the year of peak losses for Peacock, but theme park seem like they're on a 5-year growth trend, advertise -- ad production is coming back, et cetera.

To be more specific on your question in regards to where do we see the most leverage, if I had to boil it down, I would say, the U.K., the U.K. is an extraordinary position for growth. We got a very diverse revenue base with DTH having its best performance in Q1 in 6 years, streaming is going well. Mobile is going very well. Broadband is growing well with a lot of innovation potential. And so I think what we see in the U.K. is a lot of growth left in that business and a really solid business to build upon in the rest of the portfolio."

So there's a lot of different places I could pick and choose from a cause NBCUniversal, but let me just talk about 2 points of leverage that I'm excited about. I think, first of all, as we've talked about in previous calls, we really adjusted our cost base across the entire company during the pandemic. We didn't do this just to cut cost. We obviously looked at where the business was going and changed our organization, particularly on the TV side, but I'm excited about the business being kind of adjusting the new cost base and as we grow revenue side, that's going to help. And then the obvious other 1 that really was affected and has been affected during the pandemic is our Parks business, which normally is a really, really great business. But obviously, during a pandemic when you closed, it's not a good business. It's going to be choppy, getting open again as things surge and come back and so forth, but it's hard not to get excited about our Parks business, the demand is there. We're seeing it in Orlando. We have no international travel yet, which is a significant part of the business, and we still are hitting capacity, the capacity we've set for ourselves based on safety protocols every day. Just reopened Hollywood, and we're seeing the same thing in Hollywood. Japan is obviously going back and forth, but we're excited long-term about that park and then Beijing coming. And the other thing that's happened during the pandemic is we've continued to build attraction. So we are hitting the return of the market with some pretty exciting attractions in each of our Parks. We have Nintendo, which we think is one of the great attractions that we've ever built in Japan and come in Beijing as well. We have out in Los Angeles, our new pets attraction, we're getting stellar reviews and people love it. 
And then most excitingly to me, we have a new roller coaster in Orlando called the [ Vaasa ] coaster, a jurassic roller coaster, which I rode a couple of weeks ago. It is both spectacular and petrifying. And I think when we open that to the public in June, can be another driver for our business. I'm very excited about the Parks business. And it's the 1 business that's going to come back really strongly from the death of pandemic."

So let me just take the opportunity with your question to maybe spend a minute or 2 on Peacock and just provide a little bit more granularity and how we're doing more broadly than your question. So first of all, we are very pleased wit",680,"Doug, this is Jeff. So let me just take the opportunity with your question to maybe spend a minute or 2 on Peacock and just provide a little bit more granularity and how we're doing more broadly than your question. So first of all, we are very pleased with our steady growth on Peacock, and we're particularly pleased that we chose this business model, which is an ad-supported AVOD model for the business. It was the right decision to pursue that clearly for our company. Our revenue in that model is a mix of both subscription revenue and ad revenue. And if you actually break down what drives the ad revenue in the future, it's really 4 things we track. The first thing is sign-ups. I think Brian mentioned in his opening that we reached $42 million sign-ups. This is up $9 million from last quarter, and we're very pleased not just with that growth, but with a steady growth in that over time as we've added things. 
The second metric is how many of those people who sign up use the service on a regular basis, we internally use a metric known as MAAs, which I think others in the industry also use, monthly active accounts, that's how many households actually use it monthly. It's either -- to be granular, it's either somebody who pays a household pays a great subscription fee or somebody who uses it monthly. And by that basis, roughly 1/3 of our sign-ups are by our metrics MAAs. And that -- put that in the context, that is about 1/3 of where Hulu is today. We've only been national for less than a year, Hulu has been 13 years. So we're very pleased with how that's grown steadily and MAA is the way we track them actually kind of understate the engagement because there are many people who use it, but just not enough to be an MAA. If you actually made it quarterly assumption, then we'd be up to another $10 million above that number. So one of the upsides for us is converting those non MAA sign-ups, to MAAs, which we think we'll do over time. 
The third metric is usage, which is very strong to whole or projections. And to put that in context, the peak and average Peacock MAA is using Peacock more than an average TV viewer is watching NBC. So we're very pleased with that. And then finally, how do we monetize those users and usage is the CPM, which gets to your question, we set out, as you mentioned, in the sponsorship model. So the vast majority of our revenue coming out was set up by 10 charter advertisers. But we actually are exceeding the guarantees that we made to those advertisers. So we are already, even this quarter, selling some of the excess inventory on a spot basis. And we're achieving CPMs that are equal or in some cases, above what we're getting on NBC Prime, which is our gold standard. That's very encouraging. 
And to answer your question, in Q4 of this year, that's when the sponsorship deals roll off and we start selling all of our inventory on a spot basis, but we're in early stages of the upfront right now. So we're already starting to talk to advertisers about making upfront commitments that include Peacock. Let me just mention 1 other thing. All of this success is without most of the programming that we anticipated. We anticipated launching with the Olympics. We have not had -- we have 2 Olympics in the next 7 months. We're going to do some pretty exciting things on Peacock with our Olympics programming. And then even though we're back in production, as Mike mentioned, or Brian mentioned on 30 shows right now, most of those have not hit Peacock yet. So the strength of our original programming that we have planned to launch with is really coming in future quarters. So very encouraged by Peacock going forward, very steady growth so far, and we're confident about the future."

As you know, there's a lot of focus on symmetric offers, particularly in Washington. And I'm just wondering, from a business point of view, do you think there's real demand there? And what kind of time line should we be thinking about in terms of adding that capability or more of that capability to your network? And can you talk a little bit about what that might mean for capital intensity, which I'm sure is what most investors are focused on. And then for Dana, there's been an unbelievable amount of kind of tectonic shifts in the European Sports landscape just this year. And you mentioned Sky, Serie A. Can you just put all this in context, when you look at the Bundes League deal, what we're reading about with the EPL, Serie A. Is this helpful to Sky hitting its EBITDA targets of doubling over time? Or is this a headwind? Can you maybe just -- because these are obviously massive contracts. Could you just talk a little bit about the soccer background, that would be great for all of us."

Ben, so this is a focus for us over the next several years, but overall, our approach, our strategy is to continue to enhance broadband completely in that you want to have the best overall speeds in the marketplace. That go from the house of the bus",500,"Sure. Ben, so this is a focus for us over the next several years, but overall, our approach, our strategy is to continue to enhance broadband completely in that you want to have the best overall speeds in the marketplace. That go from the house of the business, great WiFi coverage within the where people are, control streaming, now mobile is part of the overall solution and making it all seamless. So it's the overall experience that we're focusing on, but we continue to improve speeds along the way, we got 20 years in a row, we got constant increases in terms of speeds. And we address both downstream and upstream. 
Let me put usage in perspective in terms of what we've seen pre pandemic most certainly through the pandemic where a network met the moment and then some. But putting usage perspective, upstream is less than a tenth of downstream. And so name the application, whether it's video streaming, whether it's gaming, host of education applications. Our network has, I think, really stood up and as Brian talked about earlier. And so while our competitors are spending heavily to try to catch up to us, we've already -- they're testing, we're not standing still. We've done 2 gigabits of download speed for testing, symmetrical 1 gig. And so we have an architecture that I think is going to continue to put us in position to do it in an effective and a very efficient, capital-efficient way. So again, not standing still. 
So we feel very good about the long-term architecture because of DOCSIS. DOCSIS 3.1 that we have is a very -- is a strong road map that we can deliver. And so right now, as we sit here, we have 1.2 gigabits deployed throughout our entire footprint. We've increased the upstream speed and so over time, I think we can address symmetrical issues. But in the near term, the midterm, we are in a very good position, and I do not see an incremental need for upgrade in terms of capital, we constantly invest in the network. This is not something that just happened overnight. We invest all the time and we're making our infrastructure more efficient as we virtualize things like CMTSs, and we're just taking cost out of how we deliver this, couple that with the great DOCSIS standard. I think we're in a pretty good position. So broadband, commercial and residential is growing. It's a great business. We're going to continue to strengthen our lead position. 
And I think it's going to continue to be a great return on investment for us. And we decide to accelerate our plans, our CapEx intensity might be a little bit higher 1 year versus the other. But we're still going to be in the ballpark of what we've been doing, and it's just not going to be uptick by a material amount. So I feel very good about our position, and I really like our long-term road map."

There has certainly been a lot of noise around sport and football in Europe over the past 4 or 6 weeks. But if you put it all into context, what I would say is that Sky has had a very good track record of renewing Sports rights, and we're generally feeling good that, that track record will continue. With English Premier League at the last renewal, we made a deliberate choice to reduce our investment by 15%, we still secured an improved set of rights. In Bundesliga, for the upcoming season. We continue to hold all of the rights to the very best games, but we weren't able to secure a discount to our previous contract. And the Serie A, I think it just demonstrates that we will walk away when we feel the economics don't work. 
I think more importantly and to broaden the periscope a bit, I would underscore that Sky has been on a journey for over 15 years to really expand our value proposition beyond Sport. And that's worked extraordinarily well. And I think it comes through in the performance of the business, the fundamentals are in the right place. Our customers are taking more products and services our viewing is up significantly on Sky channels. Our churn is significantly lower. Sky streaming is growing considerably, and the aggregation platform is really working. As Brian mentioned, with 2/3 of customers in the U.K. So I think we feel very, very comfortable that the business fundamentals are very well positioned across all of our markets. We really like the position that we're in, and we feel confident we can continue to build and grow on these fundamentals. 
So I think the core of your question is to remain confident in our ambition to double the EBITDA over the next several years. And I would say, yes, we do remain confident in that ambition and I would say that's based on confidence in a range of factors. Strong bounce back that we're already seeing after the effects of COVID. Our ability to continue to use the retail engine to drive the customer base and reduce churn through aggregation and our strategy for multiservice bundles, a very good disciplined cost focus. The team is executing very well. Secure content supply and then really a diversification of that to our expansion into originals and exclusive has worked very well. And we still see a lot of strength in the U.K. growth opportunities. So all of that gives me a lot of confidence to say we're on track for our ambition of doubling EBITDA over the next several years."

We do believe that by having the best product, and I think we have that you're in the enviable position. And so we balance constantly looking at new technologies where competitors might be coming over the last, I don't know, 15 years. We've had lots and lots of fiber competition. We've had lots of overbuild competition, DSL competition, we've added 20 million broadband, it's an over a consistent period of time. And so I think we know how to compete. We go from market share, and we do that while we're able to increase the EBITDA and free cash flow from the business, we really focused on the business sector. Haven't talked a lot about that today. They had a great quarter and real momentum as all businesses are reopening. People are rethinking their relationships, and we have the latest, greatest, best technology. And you'll be hearing a lot or, I think, from our business services unit. 
In wireless, just to add to all the points Dave made about our focus on mobile while, yes, we bought some spectrum and we'll be doing some trials to see how we can offload, and that really will prove to be a cost savings. If we get it right. In dense areas, that whole relationship requires a healthy partnership with a wireless MNO. And in the case of Verizon, we're really pleased with the partnership, restructured it so that we're able to make these unlimited offerings in a way that continues our profitability march and real value for consumers. And in a way that Verizon is happy that their network is getting used. 
So good work to our team that worked hard and to Verizon's team who are bringing great [ 2 ] offerings to the market with expanding mobile. So net-net, I think both of those important 2 products and we now bundle them together, put us in a position to continue to grow and be able to compete with where the world evolves itself."

Can you quantify at all what you expect to come from stimulus, including how many essentials customers you have and whether you expect those customers to now generate higher ARPU under the stimulus plan? And then on the wireless business, I just want to drill down on a question that was asked before. With the new pricing, do you think that you can still be EBITDA positive in that business even with the new pricing, which presumably will mean at least somewhat lower ARPU going forward?"

So first, on stimulus. There probably will be some nonpay benefit and that we -- there are a couple of different ways that could play out, but our voluntary churn and nonpay churn have been consistently been running low for the past year and been trending lower pre pandemic. So our earlier churn performance was regardless of when stimulus checks were received, but could be some -- a little bit of additional support around that. But I think you have to look at the longer-term trends. Our performance overall reflects what we've been talking about. We're building a great network and improving the products constantly. So I think there could be just a little bit of non pay support, but again we're already doing fairly well there. 
Regards to wireless, I think in terms of EBITDA, the new pricing. Yes. The way that we think about this, it's a long-term growth opportunity. Certainly, for broadband, we've talked about it. But when you look at the overall marketplace, you feel -- we feel good about that we're -- we have a little over 3 million lines, less than 2 million customer relationships, mobile relationships out of a pool of 33 million customer relationships. So low penetration, lots of runway. So we always -- and take a look at any of our approaches to key categories. We take a very disciplined approach towards packaging and improving value. 
And so yes, we feel very good about unlimited as part of the portfolio and not changing the strategy or materially the results in terms of ARPU and mobile and the impact towards EBITDA. So overall, again, Brian mentioned it that we really appreciate and the Verizon relationship. It's important for us and I think we're good for them, very good for them. And it's -- so it's a good win-win for us to be able to add this new set of unlimited to already strong portfolio. So feel good about our ability to continue to drive healthy EBITDA with it."

It is obviously very important for our traditional business, #1 show in prime time for over a decade and with our Allan Chris and Drew Brees on like Tirico and our talent, we're -- that is a very important temp pull for our existing business. At the same time, as the business evolves and moves to streaming and on demand. That deal also gave us a lot of content that now we can use on Peacock and our other platforms, whether it's [ SIMO Cassi ] games and exclusive games or additional rights to show highlights and other footage. It's really the perfect deal with Premier Sport in the U.S. So that really is kind of our model. The Olympics is the same thing where we have rights to use content across multiple platforms. Same thing with golf, which is an important [indiscernible] handful for us, and we'll continue to be aggressive and look for Sports that not only we can get for a price that we think we can get a return on, but also properties where we can drive usage, both linear and digital and WWE is kind of the perfect one on that, where we were able to take a franchise that was already important to us on U.S.A. and our linear networks and extended across in the Peacock in a way that's been very successful.  So we're thrilled with our portfolio now. We'll continue to be opportunistic. We find opportunities that match all those things. 
Turning to Peacock spending. I think it's important to recognize that we really have -- and Mark Lazarus has laid this out pretty well. We want to build our television business to match what consumers are doing. Consumers are watching content across a variety of different platforms, not just linear, not just streaming, but lots of different ways. And our spending really should be looked at in that context, not just what we're discretely spending on Peacock, but what we're spending across our whole portfolio. And when you look at that, we match up pretty well versus our competitors. And with Peacock, we actually don't, as I mentioned earlier, we don't even have the benefit of most of the spending that we had planned because of the production delays with COVID. So at the moment, we're pretty pleased with the content we have on Peacock and the content that's coming in future days. 
And as I said before, with the success of Peacock, I think Brian mentioned this opening, we have a lot of options going forward, and we'll continue to watch the way the world changes and how our product evolves, and we'll evaluate those options."

We certainly got off to a great start this year. Our entire company performed well, and we once again had particularly strong results at Cable, which posted its third consecutive quarter of double-digit EBITDA growth, ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit net cash flow growth. We added 461,000 broadband customers, which drove 380,000 customer relationship additions. This is the best first quarter on record.  
Our connect activity was healthy and broadband churn improved for the 13th quarter in a row, hitting our lowest churn rate in our company's history. I'm very proud of this quarter's results and our long record of growth, which I believe is a direct result of disciplined investment, fantastic innovation and consistent execution in a highly competitive market.  
This morning, I'd like to go a bit deeper in 2 areas: the robustness of our network in the U.S. and more broadly, how we positioned ourselves to successfully compete against alternative providers and technologies. We've spent nearly $30 billion in the last decade building an expansive fiber-dense network. Comprised of 191,000 route miles that carries an immense amount of traffic has demonstrated extraordinary performance throughout the pandemic.
Under Tony Werner, our retiring Chief Technology Officer, we have consistently engineered our network to anticipate change. And during his 15-plus years at Comcast, he has helped transform us into a product and technology innovator and leader. Tony, we thank you.  
He's being succeeded by Charlie Herrin. Many of you on this call are familiar with Charlie. He helped develop game-changing products, including scaling X1 and most recently led the successful effort to redefine how we interact with customers, which has resulted in significantly higher NPS scores and lower operating costs. Charlie, Dave and I have been fortunate to work together for 20 years. 
Under Dave and Tony, we've recruited the best engineering talent around the world and now are working as one global tech team to create platforms, apps and experiences that evolve the way people connect and consume entertainment. We've done all this while keeping the network our #1 priority.  
We've introduced the xFi Advanced Gateway, the most powerful of its kind. Our highest users are connecting a wide variety of devices in the home and streaming multiple services simultaneously over WiFi. Our xFi Pods integrate with Xfinity Gateways to form a mesh network that maximizes WiFi coverage. All you do is plug one of these pods into an outlet to get great coverage in every room.
We provide our customers with what they need, which goes well beyond extraordinary connectivity and speed. Xfinity is the only broadband provider to offer advanced security for monitoring devices inside and soon outside of the home. We also uniquely provide our customers with a whole home speed test and enable parents to manage Internet time spent by streaming application.
This is all backed by a network that is built to consistently deliver the fastest speeds and outperform well into the future with 2 major initiatives underway. The first is virtualizing our network by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning. We're taking functions that were once performed by thousands of large and expensive pieces of hardware and moving them into the cloud, which alone has reduced innovation cycles from years down to just months. We're also automating many of our core network functions so that we can deliver instant capacity as well as identify and fix network issues before they ever affect a customer.  
Our second priority is further enhancing how we deliver our broadband product over our network. We currently offer downstream speeds of 1.2 gigs across our entire footprint using our DOCSIS 3.1 architecture and can increase upstream in a capital-efficient way. We're making great progress to deliver multi-gig symmetrical speeds.
And the last 6 months, we completed 2 important milestones on our road map. In October, we conducted a successful live test of 1.25-gig symmetrical speeds. And earlier this month, our engineers completed the first-ever live lab test of DOCSIS 4.0, which establishes a foundation for us to deliver multi-gigabit speeds over our existing network without the need for massive digging and construction projects.  
Let me next talk about Xfinity Mobile where we're having great success. This past quarter, we reached breakeven on a stand-alone basis for the first time and added 278,000 mobile lines, the highest quarterly addition since launch. We just announced a new unlimited family plan, which can provide $600 in annual savings relative to other competitor family plans.  
Now let's turn to Sky, which, despite renewed lockdowns in Europe, generated revenue growth and delivered the best first quarter customer relationships net addition in 6 years. I am particularly encouraged by our strong performance in the U.K.. Excluding pubs and clubs, which remain closed, U.K. direct-to-consumer revenue grew 8% over the first quarter 2020 and 11% relative to 2019.
Churn continued to trend down. 2/3 of our customer base in the U.K. now have Sky Q. We're seeing great acceleration in mobile. And we just launched Sky Connect, our B2B broadband service that leverages the expertise of Comcast Cable. Dana Strong is off to a great start and is sinking up more than ever with Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal so that together, we're all innovating more quickly, better serving our customers and viewers and increasing operating efficiencies.
We're also encouraged by the trends we're seeing across NBCU. Our Parks segment broke even, excluding Beijing, for the second consecutive quarter, driven by remarkable attendance at Universal Orlando. We can see firsthand the pent-up demand for high-quality entertainment and family fun outside of the home, and we remain incredibly bullish on the Parks business. While Osaka recently had to close temporarily, Universal Studios Hollywood reopened on April 16, the first time since the pandemic started. Our long-term excitement stems from the fact that we have a fabulous road map of new attractions and experiences awaiting guests as they safely return to our current parks.  
In NBCUniversal's Media segment under Jeff Shell and Mark Lazarus, we're starting to see the benefits of our new operating structure. Excluding Peacock, adjusted EBITDA increased 10% year-over-year. Our news content continues to experience tremendous momentum, and distribution revenue is trending above expectations, a testament to the strength of our linear brands. We're back in business on the studio side with more than 30 television series currently in production, and we're excited for our first big theatrical debut with Fast 9 launching in both the U.S. and China later in the second quarter.  
We're also making great progress with Peacock, our premium ad-supported streaming service. Just 1 year post-launch, we've had 42 million sign-ups. Monthly users of the service are consuming nearly 20% more programming hours each month than our traditional audience on NBC. And we just crossed 1 billion total hours watched, nearly double our plan when we launched. This strength in users and engagement has enabled us to create additional advertising inventory outside of our initial partnership with CPMs at a material premium to linear prime time.
Key to Peacock's domestic success has been Xfinity with X1 and Flex driving subscriber acquisitions and healthy engagement. With Peacock, we've created great options for ourselves with several opportunities on the horizon. We've recently secured more original programming with creative partners like WWE and the NFL, providing a strong path to upsell into Peacock Premium. And as Peacock gained scale in the U.S., we see compelling ways we can expand internationally. We're looking to take advantage of the brand and scale of Sky across our European markets and potentially strike partnerships with local programmers and distributors in geographies where it makes sense. We plan to share more information on Peacock throughout this year.  
So in summary, we're all very proud and encouraged by our first quarter results. This performance is a testament to the resilience and evolution of our company. Excellent execution of our growth initiatives, combined with tight cost control, brings us one step closer to our balance sheet goals. And I am eager to see us return to our historical practice of repurchasing shares starting in the second half of this year.  
Lastly, I want to thank our team. Everyone across the company has continued to show up and innovate for our customers, audience, guests and each other. We were recently named as 1 of the top 5 big companies to work for in the U.S. and 1 of the top 10 inclusive companies in the U.K., a testament to the work and passion of our wonderful employees.
Mike, over to you."

I'll begin on Slide 4 with our first quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 2.2% to $27.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.5% to $8.4 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 7% to $0.76 per share. And f",1914,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our first quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 2.2% to $27.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.5% to $8.4 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 7% to $0.76 per share. And finally, we generated $5.3 billion of free cash flow. 
Now let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable revenue increased 5.9% to $15.8 billion. EBITDA increased 12% to $6.8 billion, and EBITDA less capital grew 16% to $5.1 billion.
We added 380,000 net new customer relationships, up 2.4% over last year's first quarter and up 27% over the first quarter of 2019. This was the best first quarter on record and was driven by broadband, where we added 461,000 net new residential and business customers, only slightly below last year's first quarter and 23% above the first quarter of 2019.  
We saw healthy connect activity, and this quarter marked the lowest broadband churn in our history. This positive momentum has continued into the second quarter. And from what we see today, we anticipate total broadband additions for the year to grow by mid-single-digit levels compared to 2019, which, aside from the extraordinary growth we had in an unusual 2020, was the best year in more than a decade. The strong customer additions, coupled with ARPU growth of 4.4%, drove a 12% increase in broadband revenue for the first quarter, the largest driver of overall Cable revenue, and we expect this trend will continue.
We also saw an acceleration in both business services and wireless. Business services revenue increased 6.1% and delivered 11,000 net new customer additions, primarily driven by continued improvement in small business. Wireless revenue grew 50% due to an increase in both customer lines and higher device sales. We added 278,000 net new lines in the quarter, the best result since launching this business in 2017, bringing us to 3.1 million total lines as of quarter end.  
Turning to video, revenue was consistent with the prior year, reflecting very healthy ARPU growth of 6.8%, offset by net video subscriber losses totaling 491,000, which we felt mostly on the connect side as residential churn improved year-over-year. We believe our residential rate adjustment at the beginning of the year was a significant contributor to both the ARPU increase and the video subscriber loss in the quarter, and we expect video losses in the second quarter will remain elevated.  
We currently anticipate Cable Communications revenue growth in the second quarter to accelerate by a few hundred basis points from the 5.9% we just reported, partly due to the comparison to last year's second quarter, which was most significantly impacted by COVID-19 as well as our focus on driving growth in our connectivity businesses. 
Turning to expenses. Cable Communications first quarter expenses increased 1.5%. Programming expenses were up 5.5%, primarily due to the number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020, combined with annual escalators in existing agreements.
Looking to the second quarter, we expect programming expense growth to increase at low double-digit levels due to the continued impact of contract renewals as well as the comparison to last year's second quarter, which was favorably impacted by adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees. For the full year, we continue to expect programming expense to increase at high single-digit levels.  
Non-programming expenses declined 1.1% on an absolute basis and 5.9% on a per-relationship basis, while our customer relationships grew 5% year-over-year. Non-programming expenses should increase at high single-digit rate in the second quarter due in part to the comparison to last year, which reflected the slowdown in business activity due to COVID-19 as well as our continued focus on driving growth in our core broadband and wireless businesses.
Cable Communications EBITDA grew by 12% with margins reaching 43.2%, reflecting 250 basis points of year-over-year improvement. These results include the important milestone of our wireless business reaching breakeven for the first time since launch. Cable capital expenditures increased 8%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 8.7%, up slightly compared to last year and driven by a 23% increase in scalable infrastructure as we continue to invest to enhance the capacity of our network. This spending was partially offset by lower customer premise equipment and support.  
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. As you know, we recently issued an 8-K with updated trending schedules and a new reporting format that reflects the way the business is now managed. We moved Peacock, which was previously reported in our corporate results, to NBCUniversal. And now we present NBCU in 3 business segments: Media, which combines our TV businesses and Peacock; Studios, which combines our film and television studio businesses; and Theme Parks. I will discuss today's results in this new format.  
Let's start with total NBCUniversal results. Revenue decreased 9.1% to $7 billion, and EBITDA was down 12% to $1.5 billion. Media revenue increased 3.2%, driven by 9.1% growth in distribution revenue, which reflected higher rates post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020, partially offset by subscriber declines, which showed sequential improvement. Advertising revenue declined 3.4% as lower entertainment ratings and tough political comps were partially offset by more sports in the quarter, strength in news and the launch of Peacock.
Media EBITDA declined 3.7% when including Peacock, which generated revenue of $91 million and an EBITDA loss of $277 million. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA increased 10%, primarily driven by lower expenses, which was partly due to lower entertainment costs associated with fewer original hours aired and partly due to our new operating model. This year-over-year reduction more than offset higher sports cost resulting from additional events.
Looking to the second quarter, we expect healthy growth in distribution revenue to continue. We will have significantly more sporting events compared to last year, which should result in higher advertising revenue, but also a significant increase in sports-related programming and production costs. 
Studio revenue was flat compared to last year, primarily reflecting higher content licensing revenue, offset by lower theatrical revenue. Content licensing revenue increased 14%, primarily due to licensing deals, including The Office, which became exclusively available for streaming on Peacock this past January. Theatrical revenue decreased 88%, reflecting the deferral of theatrical releases due to COVID-19. Significantly fewer releases in the first quarter resulted in lower expenses, driving EBITDA growth of 66%.  
We're excited to be releasing Fast 9 in theaters later in the second quarter, but we delayed the release of Minions 2 from July of this year to July of 2022, which will shift the profits from 2021 to 2022 as well, as we continue to manage our film slate to maximize value.
Theme Parks revenue decreased 33.1% in the quarter and generated an EBITDA loss of $61 million, which included $100 million of Universal Beijing preopening costs. These results reflect Universal Orlando Resort operating at limited capacity, but trends remain encouraging as attendance continue to rebound, and we've been at or near capacity limits through spring break. Hollywood remained closed during the quarter, but we recently opened at a 25% capacity limit and expect this to move higher by June 15.
In Japan, we recently had to close our park temporarily due to rising COVID cases. But prior to this, we had seen strong demand. Looking ahead, we expect our EBITDA results to improve in the back half of the year as domestic attendance trends improve, and we remain on track to open our new park, Universal Beijing, this summer.  
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the first quarter, Sky revenue increased 2% to $5 billion, largely reflecting healthy growth in our U.K. business. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 1.8%, with growth in the U.K. even stronger. This result was driven by higher average rates per customer and strong customer growth across all markets.
We generated 221,000 net customer additions, the best first quarter in 6 years, driven by streaming across our markets as well as steady momentum in mobile and broadband within the U.K. Advertising revenue increased 3.4% as we continue to outperform the market, particularly in the U.K., where the ad market is rebounding more quickly than we expected, and we are driving growth through advanced advertising.  
Sky generated $364 million in EBITDA in the first quarter. As expected, this reflects elevated expenses, including higher sports rights amortization resulting from more events in the current quarter as well as higher expenses associated with successfully growing our mobile and broadband businesses and investment in key growth initiatives, which now include Sky Connect, our recently launched commercial broadband business in the U.K.
For the second quarter, we expect revenue growth to accelerate to low double-digit levels on a constant currency basis due to the comparison to last year's second quarter, which was the most impacted by COVID-19, as well as continued strength in our U.K. business. We also anticipate significantly higher sports rights amortization compared to last year when events were paused. As a result, we expect to generate a similar level of EBITDA in the second quarter as we did in the first quarter.
We were recently outbid for some of the broadcast rights for Serie A in Italy as we stood firm in our disciplined approach to sports-related costs. We believe this was the right long-term financial decision, but we expect a reduction in programming and production expenses and a potential decline in customer relationships in Italy as a result. We continue to expect Sky EBITDA in the second half of this year to accelerate from first half levels, reflecting the benefits of a reset to major sports rights as well as a more efficient operating structure.  
I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. Free cash flow was $5.3 billion in the quarter, an increase of roughly 60% year-over-year, primarily due to an improvement in net working capital and higher EBITDA. Net working capital will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis, and we still expect the full year drag increase relative to 2019 due to an increase in content investments, our broadcast of the Olympics and the reversal of COVID-related onetime tax deferrals.  
Consolidated total capital, which includes capital expenditures as well as software and intangibles, decreased 1.1% in the first quarter to $2.5 billion, reflecting a decline at NBCU, which was partially offset by increases at Sky and Cable.
We ended the first quarter with $104 billion of debt with a weighted average cost of 3.6% and a weighted average life of 14.5 years and net debt of $86 billion for a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.7x. Throughout the pandemic, we have maintained an elevated cash balance to fortify our liquidity position, and we ended the first quarter with $15 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We expect to gradually reduce our cash position by deploying excess cash towards debt reduction throughout the remainder of the year as our business operations continue to recover.  
Finally, we remain committed to our long-standing balanced approach to capital allocation, which consists of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for profitable growth and returning capital to shareholders for a strong commitment to our recurring dividends and our expected return to share repurchases in the second half of this year.

So I have a broad-based question that covers basically all the divisions.
In Cable, it feels like the beginning for advanced advertising. We're seeing strength still in broadband. The price decrease in mobile should drive market share. In NBCU, which seems like the division with the most upside coming out of COVID, I'm just -- I don't know if this is the year of peak losses for Peacock, but Theme Parks seem like they're on a 5-year growth trend, advertise -- production is coming back, et cetera. Sky, you can see the leverage.
So my question finally is, where do you see the most leverage overall in each of the businesses? And can margins and free cash flow continue to improve?"

I think Q1 -- our Q1 results demonstrate the position that we're in, subscriber numbers processed, in fact, quarter 1 in about 6 years, churn is down, revenue is up. All of the fundamental factors of the business position us well to exit COVID.
To be more specific on your question in regards to where do we see the most leverage, if I had to boil it down, I would say the U.K. The U.K. is an extraordinary position for growth. We got a very diverse revenue base with DTH having its best performance in Q1 in 6 years. Streaming is going well. Mobile is going very well. Broadband is growing well with a lot of innovation potential. And so I think what we see in the U.K. is a lot of growth left in that business and a really solid business to build upon in the rest of the portfolio."

So there's a lot of different places I could pick and choose from across NBCUniversal, but let me just talk about 2 points of leverage that I'm excited about. I think, first of all, as we've talked about in previous calls, we really adjusted our cost base across the entire company during the pandemic. We didn't do this just to cut cost. We obviously looked at where the business was going and changed our organization, particularly on the TV side. But I'm excited about the business being kind of adjusting the new cost base. And as we grow revenue side, that's going to help.
And then the obvious other one that really was affected and has been affected during the pandemic is our Parks business, which normally is a really, really great business. But obviously, during a pandemic when you're closed, it's not a good business. It's going to be choppy getting open again as things surge and come back and so forth, but it's hard not to get excited about our Parks business. The demand is there. We're seeing it in Orlando. We have no international travel yet, which is a significant part of the business. And we still are hitting capacity, the capacity we've set for ourselves based on safety protocols every day. Just reopened Hollywood, and we're seeing the same thing in Hollywood. Japan is obviously going back and forth, but we're excited long term about that park and then Beijing coming.
And the other thing that's happened during the pandemic is we've continued to build attraction. So we are hitting the return of the market with some pretty exciting attractions in each of our parks. We have Nintendo, which we think is one of the great attractions that we've ever built in Japan, will come in Beijing as well. We have, out in Los Angeles, our new Pets attraction. We're getting stellar reviews, and people love it. 
And then most excitingly to me, we have a new rollercoaster in Orlando called the VelociCoaster, a Jurassic rollercoaster, which I rode a couple of weeks ago. It is both spectacular and petrifying. And I think when we open that to the public in June, it can be another driver for our business. So I'm very excited about the Parks business, and it's the one business that's going to come back really strongly from the depths of the pandemic."

173341,708227110,2262844,"Comcast Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Doug, this is Jeff. So let me just take the opportunity with your question to maybe spend a minute or 2 on Peacock and just provide a little bit more granularity and how we're doing more broadly than your question.So first of all, we are very pleased wi",680,"Doug, this is Jeff. So let me just take the opportunity with your question to maybe spend a minute or 2 on Peacock and just provide a little bit more granularity and how we're doing more broadly than your question.
So first of all, we are very pleased with our steady growth on Peacock, and we're particularly pleased that we chose this business model, which is an ad-supported AVOD model for the business. It was the right decision to pursue that clearly for our company. Our revenue in that model is a mix of both subscription revenue and ad revenue. And if you actually break down what drives the ad revenue in the future, it's really 4 things we track. The first thing is sign-ups. I think Brian mentioned in his opening that we reached 42 million sign-ups. This is up 9 million from last quarter. And we're very pleased not just with that growth, but with a steady growth in that over time as we've added things. 
The second metric is how many of those people who sign up use the service on a regular basis. We internally use a metric known as MAAs, which I think others in the industry also use, monthly active accounts. That's how many households actually use it monthly. It's either -- to be granular, it's either somebody who pays -- a household that pays a great subscription fee or somebody who uses it monthly. And by that basis, roughly 1/3 of our sign-ups are, by our metrics, MAAs. And that -- to put that into context, that is about 1/3 of where Hulu is today. We've only been national for less than a year, Hulu has been 13 years.
So we're very pleased with how that's grown steadily. And MAAs, the way we track them, actually kind of understate the engagement because there are many people who use it, but just not enough to be an MAA. If you actually made a quarterly assumption, then we'd be up to another 10 million above that number. So one of the upsides for us is converting those non-MAA sign-ups to MAAs, which we think we'll do over time. 
The third metric is usage, which is very strong, double our projections. And to put that in context, the peak -- an average Peacock MAA is using Peacock more than an average TV viewer is watching NBC. So we're very pleased with that.
And then finally, how do we monetize those users and usage is the CPM, which gets to your question, we set out, as you mentioned, in the sponsorship model. So the vast majority of our revenue coming out was set up by 10 charter advertisers. But we actually are exceeding the guarantees that we made to those advertisers. So we are already, even this quarter, selling some of the excess inventory on a spot basis. And we're achieving CPMs that are equal or, in some cases, above what we're getting on NBC prime, which is our gold standard. That's very encouraging. 
And to answer your question, in Q4 of this year, that's when the sponsorship deals roll off and we start selling all of our inventory on a spot basis, but we're in early stages of the upfront right now. So we're already starting to talk to advertisers about making upfront commitments that include Peacock.
Let me just mention one other thing. All of this success is without most of the programming that we anticipated. We anticipated launching with the Olympics. We have not had -- we have 2 Olympics in the next 7 months. We're going to do some pretty exciting things on Peacock with our Olympics programming. And then even though we're back in production, as Mike mentioned or Brian mentioned on 30 shows right now, most of those have not hit Peacock yet. So the strength of our original programming that we have planned to launch with is really coming in future quarters. So very encouraged by Peacock going forward, very steady growth so far, and we're confident about the future."

And what kind of time line should we be thinking about in terms of adding that capability or more of that capability to your network? And can you talk a little bit about what that might mean for capital intensity, which I'm sure is what most investors are focused on?
And then for Dana, there's been an unbelievable amount of kind of tectonic shifts in the European sports landscape just this year. And you mentioned Sky -- Serie A. Can you just put all this in context? When you look at the Bundesliga deal, what we're reading about with the EPL, Serie A, is this helpful to Sky hitting its EBITDA targets of doubling over time? Or is this a headwind? Can you maybe just -- because these are obviously massive contracts. Could you just talk a little bit about the soccer background? That would be great for all of us."

Ben, so this is a focus for us over the next several years. But overall, our approach, our strategy is to continue to enhance broadband completely in that you want to have the best overall speeds in the marketplace that go from to the house or the business, great WiFi coverage within where people are, control streaming, now mobile is part of the overall solution and making it all seamless. So it's the overall experience that we're focusing on, but we continue to improve speeds along the way. 20 years in a row, constant increases in terms of speeds. And we address both downstream and upstream. 
Let me put usage in perspective in terms of what we've seen pre-pandemic and most certainly through the pandemic where our network met the moment and then some. But putting usage in perspective, upstream is less than 1/10 of downstream. And so name the application, whether it's video streaming, whether it's gaming, host of education applications, our network has, I think, really stood up and as Brian talked about earlier.
And so while our competitors are spending heavily to try to catch up to us, we've already -- they're testing, we're not standing still. We've done 2 gigabits of download speed. We're testing symmetrical 1 gig. And so we have an architecture that I think is going to continue to put us in position to do it in an effective and a very efficient, capital-efficient way. So again, not standing still. So we feel very good about the long-term architecture because of DOCSIS. DOCSIS 3.1 that we have is a very -- is a strong road map that we can deliver.
And so right now, as we sit here, we have 1.2 gigabits deployed throughout our entire footprint. We've increased the upstream speed. And so over time, I think we can address symmetrical issues. But in the near term, the midterm, we are in a very good position. And I do not see an incremental need for upgrade in terms of capital. We constantly invest in the network. This is not something that just happened overnight. We invest all the time. And we're making our infrastructure more efficient as we virtualize things like CMTSs, and we're just taking cost out of how we deliver this. Couple that with the great DOCSIS standard, I think we're in a pretty good position.
So broadband, commercial and residential is growing. It's a great business. We're going to continue to strengthen our lead position. And I think it's going to continue to be a great return on investment for us. And we decide to accelerate our plans, our CapEx intensity might be a little bit higher 1 year versus the other. But we're still going to be in the ballpark of what we've been doing, and it's just not going to be uptick by a material amount. So I feel very good about our position, and I really like our long-term road map."

There has certainly been a lot of noise around sport and football in Europe over the past 4 or 6 weeks. But if you put it all into context, what I would say is that Sky has had a very good track record of renewing sports rights, and we're generally feeling good that, that track record will continue. With English Premier League, at the last renewal, we made a deliberate choice to reduce our investment by 15%, but we still secured an improved set of rights. In Bundesliga, for the upcoming season, we continue to hold all of the rights to the very best games, but we were able to secure a discount to our previous contract. And the Serie A, I think it just demonstrates that we will walk away when we feel the economics don't work. 
I think more importantly and to broaden the periscope a bit, I would underscore that Sky has been on a journey for over 15 years to really expand our value proposition beyond sport, and that's worked extraordinarily well. And I think it comes through in the performance of the business. The fundamentals are in the right place. Our customers are taking more products and services. Our viewing is up significantly on Sky channels. Our churn is significantly lower. Sky streaming is growing considerably, and the aggregation platform is really working, as Brian mentioned, with 2/3 of customers in the U.K.
So I think we feel very, very comfortable that the business fundamentals are very well positioned across all of our markets. We really like the position that we're in, and we feel confident we can continue to build and grow on these fundamentals.
So I think the core of your question is, do we remain confident in our ambition to double the EBITDA over the next several years? And I would say, yes, we do remain confident in that ambition, and I would say that's based on confidence in a range of factors: strong bounce back that we're already seeing after the effects of COVID, our ability to continue to use the retail engine to drive the customer base and reduce churn through aggregation and our strategy for multiservice bundles, a very good disciplined cost focus. The team is executing very well. Secure content supply, and then really a diversification of that to our expansion into originals and exclusives has worked very well. And we still see a lot of strength in the U.K. growth opportunities. So all of that gives me a lot of confidence to say we're on track for our ambition of doubling EBITDA over the next several years. Thanks."

Dave, why don't you also feel free to jump in on -- I think Dave gave pretty complete answers on broadband. We do believe that by having the best product, and I think we have that, you're in the enviable position. And so we balance, constantly looking at new technologies where competitors might be coming over the last, I don't know, 15 years. We've had lots and lots of fiber competition. We've had lots of overbuild competition, DSL competition. We've added 20 million broadband just in over a consistent period of time.
And so I think we know how to compete. We go for market share, and we do that while we're able to increase the EBITDA and free cash flow from the business. We really focused on the business sector, haven't talked a lot about that today. They had a great quarter and real momentum. As all businesses are reopening, people are rethinking their relationships, and we have the latest, greatest, best technology. And you'll be hearing a lot more, I think, from our business services unit. 
In wireless, just to add to all the points Dave made about our focus on mobile, well, yes, we bought some spectrum and we'll be doing some trials to see how we can offload, and that really will prove to be a cost savings if we get it right in dense areas. That whole relationship requires a healthy partnership with a wireless MNO. And in the case of Verizon, we were really pleased with the partnership. We restructured it so that we're able to make these unlimited offerings in a way that continues our profitability march and real value for consumers and in a way that Verizon is happy that their network is getting used. 
So good work to our team that worked hard and to Verizon's team who are bringing great new offerings to the market with expanding mobile. So net-net, I think both of those important 2 products, and we now bundle them together, put us in a position to continue to grow and be able to compete with where the world evolves itself."

And how you think that -- what impact that's likely to have on your business? Can you quantify at all what you expect to come from stimulus, including how many Essentials customers you have and whether you expect those customers to now generate higher ARPU under the stimulus plan?
And then on the wireless business, I just want to drill down on a question that was asked before. With the new pricing, do you think that you can still be EBITDA positive in that business even with the new pricing, which presumably will mean at least somewhat lower ARPU going forward?"

So first, on stimulus, the -- there probably will be some non-pay benefit and that we -- there are a couple of different ways that could play out, but our voluntary churn and non-pay churn have been consistently been running low for the past year and had been trending lower pre-pandemic. So our earlier churn performance was regardless of when stimulus checks were received, but could be some -- a little bit of additional support around that. But I think you have to look at the longer-term trends. Our performance overall reflects what we've been talking about. We're building a great network and improving the products constantly. So I think there could be just a little bit of non-pay support. But again, we're already doing fairly well there. 
In regards to wireless, I think in terms of EBITDA, the new pricing, yes, the way that we think about this, it's a long-term growth opportunity, certainly, for broadband. We've talked about it. But when you look at the overall marketplace, you feel -- we feel good about that we're -- we have a little over 3 million lines, less than 2 million customer relationships, mobile relationships out of a pool of 33 million customer relationships. So low penetration, lots of runway. So we always -- and take a look at any of our approaches to key categories, we take a very disciplined approach towards packaging and improving value. 
And so, yes, we feel very good about unlimited as part of the portfolio and not changing the strategy or materially the results in terms of ARPU and mobile and the impact towards EBITDA. So overall, again, Brian mentioned it, we really appreciate the Verizon relationship. It's important for us. And I think we're good for them, very good for them. And it's -- so it's a good win-win for us to be able to add this new set of unlimited to an already strong portfolio. So feel good about our ability to continue to drive healthy EBITDA with it."

The NFL really kind of encompasses what we want in sports rights. It is obviously very important for our traditional business, #1 show in prime time for over a decade. And with our Al and Cris and now Drew Brees and Mike Tirico and our talent, we're -- that is a very important tent-pole for our existing business.
At the same time, as the business evolves and moves to streaming and on-demand, that deal also gave us a lot of content that now we can use on Peacock and our other platforms, whether it's simulcast of games and exclusive games or additional rights to show highlights and other footage. It's really the perfect deal with the premier sport in the U.S. So that really is kind of our model. The Olympics is the same thing where we have rights to use content across multiple platforms. Same thing with golf, which is an important tent-pole for us.
And we'll continue to be aggressive and look for sports that not only we can get for a price that we think we can get a return on, but also properties where we can drive usage, both linear and digital. And WWE is kind of the perfect one on that where we were able to take a franchise that was already important to us on USA and our linear networks and extended across in the Peacock in a way that's been very successful.  So we're thrilled with our portfolio now. We'll continue to be opportunistic. We'll find opportunities that match all those things. 
Turning to Peacock spending, I think it's important to recognize that we really have -- and Mark Lazarus has laid this out pretty well. We want to build our television business to match what consumers are doing. Consumers are watching content across a variety of different platforms, not just linear, not just streaming, but lots of different ways. And our spending really should be looked at in that context, not just what we're discretely spending on Peacock, but what we're spending across our whole portfolio. And when you look at that, we match up pretty well versus our competitors.
And with Peacock, we actually don't, as I mentioned earlier, we don't even have the benefit of most of the spending that we had planned because of the production delays with COVID. So at the moment, we're pretty pleased with the content we have on Peacock and the content that's coming in future days. And as I said before, with the success of Peacock, and I think Brian mentioned in his opening, we have a lot of options going forward. And we'll continue to watch the way the world changes and how our product evolves, and we'll evaluate those options."

I'm really excited to report the strong second quarter results, which were highlighted by exceptional performance at Cable, delivering 11% revenue growth and a nearly 15% increase in adjusted EBITDA. This was fue",1602,"Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm really excited to report the strong second quarter results, which were highlighted by exceptional performance at Cable, delivering 11% revenue growth and a nearly 15% increase in adjusted EBITDA. This was fueled by our fantastic success in broadband. 
We added 354,000 broadband customers, an increase compared to both the same period last year and to 2019, and that drove 294,000 total customer relationship additions. These were the best broadband and customer relationship results we've had for any second quarter on record. 
Our broadband connect activity is healthy, and churn improved for the 14th quarter in a row. In fact, we hit the lowest second quarter churn rate in our company's history. Based on our first half results, combined with the strength we're seeing in current trends, we now expect total broadband net additions for 2021 to increase mid-teens relative to 2019. 
We also added 280,000 wireless subscriber lines, the highest of any quarter since launch. And Xfinity Mobile is now a stand-alone profitable business. We got here on time, if not a bit earlier than expected, and we are experiencing the fastest sales momentum we've ever had, a testament to the changes we implemented in the back half of last year when we reprioritized wireless across our sales channels and integrated this business more fully into our core operations. And this past April, we introduced a fabulous unlimited family plan, which we just started offering to our small business customers as well. 
So I couldn't be more pleased with Dave Watson and the team he has assembled as they have a relentless focus on connectivity, which has never been more important they truly put the customer first, offering innovative and differentiated products and services. And pretty unique to the market, we now offer 1.2 gigs of downstream to essentially all 60 million homes and businesses in our footprint. The foundation of our success is our network, which we constantly evolve so that we can easily handle capacity growth, increase in subscribers and the changing usage patterns of our customers who continue to take faster speeds. 
Currently, there are typically 25 connected devices in the home, with 8 active at any one time, and this increases every year. That drives in-home WiFi usage to 15x that of wireless. Delivering huge amount of data at consistent speeds and reducing latency is what's powering our growth. And we're doing this in a cost-efficient way. 
Virtualizing our network, combined with our suite of digital tools, also allows us to continue to improve the customer experience while identifying additional cost savings. And the progress we've made is evident in our results. During the second quarter, total agent calls decreased by 10% and total interactions were down by 7%. We also saw a 22% reduction in truck rolls, despite an over 5% increase in our customer base. 
So as I look ahead, I think about our philosophy since the early days of broadband, which has been to bet on a never-ending cycle of new technologies, devices and applications that come from Silicon Valley and new startups everywhere that need to take advantage of greater speeds and capacity over time. We see this transformation happening every day and continue to believe that this is ongoing for the foreseeable future. 
So what does that mean for our network? Well, since October of 2020, we've been trialing gig and multi-gig symmetrical speeds over our DOCSIS infrastructure to great success. With upstream comprising today less than 10% of total broadband usage, even during a peak, we don't really have a consumer use case for this technology capability yet, but the strategy for our network is to plan ahead. We're investing in architecture that lets us go beyond where consumers are, and we can do all of this in a way that won't affect the capital intensity ratios we currently enjoy. Dave can provide more detail about the technological decisions we're making during the Q&A. 
With Cable comprising roughly 70% of our consolidated EBITDA, broadband is a top strategic priority, and I could not be more pleased with the strength of this quarter and the first half of 2021. 
Looking at other parts of our business. For the first time since the pandemic, our Theme Parks returned nicely to profitability. This was led by Orlando, where we've seen strong domestic demand in both per cap spending and in attendance, which returned to 2019 levels, somewhat faster than I thought might happen, despite virtually no international visitation. 
And in Hollywood, since restrictions have been lifted, attendance is growing week after week. We continue to see firsthand, the pent-up demand for high-quality entertainment and family fun outside of the home, and we remain incredibly bullish on our Theme Parks. 
Our Studio business is also coming back. We've returned to pre-pandemic television production levels, and we're really optimistic about our upcoming films, especially after the success of Fast 9, which debuted at #1 in all territories at launch, and with $600 million of worldwide box office to date remains the biggest U.S. film launch since the pandemic began. Following Fast, we successfully released BOS Baby 2 and the latest installment of Purge. And over the July 4 weekend, we had the top 3 films at the domestic box office. The first time that's happened for any Studio since 1995. 
We have a great slate ahead with DRV enhancement in September, followed by a new Halloween in October, and we end the year with [ SYNC 2 ]. 
Next, let's talk about our media and production strategy, which across the entire company, is aligned around one purpose, create premium programming which we can then scale and monetize for the very best global distribution outlets. Peacock adds to what we already offer. It's a great complement to our linear brands, which are successful in their own right. And together, these platforms provide a continuous loop of content and promotion that seamlessly drive viewership across our ecosystem, offering a different access point to attract new audiences while giving existing viewers more of what they love. 
We are clearly capitalizing on the strength of our media brands, having just completed the strongest advertising upfront in our history, securing double-digit increases in both volume and price across our entire portfolio. And I'm pleased to report that as of this week, Peacock has 54 million sign-ups and over 20 million monthly active accounts. This is 50% higher than our last report, driven by a number of factors: the day and date release of BOSS Baby 2; debut of Dr. Death, our most successful original to date; and the airing of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The third quarter, thus far, has been a particularly strong period, and we will work hard to manage retention and grow from here, recognizing we are unlikely to replicate such tremendous performance, but we remain optimistic, with a lot of programming strength ahead of us, such as more premium originals; Monday Night Football; the Beijing Olympics; and our reimagined Dynamic Pay1 Window, which starting in 2022, shifts our film titles to Peacock exclusively for the first and last 4-month segments in the Pay Window, with Amazon Prime and Netflix sharing rights for the 10 months in between. 
By showcasing content across multiple platforms, Universal films will constantly refresh across the streaming ecosystem. Audiences will have multiple access points with which to consume our content, and we will generate more third-party revenue while retaining the most valuable window for Peacock. 
So as you can see, we've successfully been able to pivot, coming up with creative ways to keep up with consumer demand and in many cases, making even more money than we did before. 
At Sky, we are pleased revenue is back to pre-COVID levels, despite the lingering impact that COVID continues to have on our pubs and clubs segment. Sky's results were led by the U.K. with revenue and EBITDA ahead of 2019, and we're seeing momentum across a number of areas. Premium TV churn is at record low levels. In streaming, we posted ARPU growth of over 20% for the fourth consecutive quarter. And in broadband, where we just introduced our 500-meg offering, we experienced improved churn relative to both 2020 and 2019 despite a 6% price increase in the quarter. 
In addition, Sky Mobile had the strongest second quarter activations on record with churn averaging 40% better than industry average. And today, we're announcing the debut of our international streaming strategy for Peacock. Later this year, we will leverage Sky's significant scale and powerful brand to include Peacock at no additional cost for its 20 million customers across Europe. The benefits of this launch are tremendous. We will unlock incremental advertising revenue, introduce the Peacock brand and content catalog via Sky's established platforms in key European markets and directly monetize our programming investments. 
A decision to make Peacock the anchor tenant on Xfinity's X1 and Flex platforms for its domestic launch has been a key driver of brand awareness, scale, consumption and promotion, and we see a similar opportunity with Sky. We're utilizing all the wonderful assets of our company to create value for audiences everywhere, and we look forward to finalizing agreements with other programming and distribution partners outside of our Sky markets. 
So summing up, this was a fabulous quarter and a great first half of the year. I'm so pleased we are now in a position to buy back stocks, which we will report on in Mike's section. This is a truly very special company, and I'm excited for the road ahead. Mike, over to you."
173341,1671479226,2354307,"Comcast Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our second quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 20% to $28.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to $8.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 22% to $0.84 per share. And f",1949,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our second quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 20% to $28.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to $8.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 22% to $0.84 per share. And finally, we generated $4.8 billion of free cash flow. 
Now let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable revenue increased 11% to $16 billion, EBITDA increased nearly 15% to $7.1 billion and net cash flow grew close to 15% to $5 billion. As a reminder, last year's second quarter was most significantly impacted by COVID-19, including adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees. Excluding the impact of these RSN adjustments, Cable Communications revenue increased 9.3% with no corresponding impact to EBITDA. 
We added 294,000 net new customer relationships, up 35% over last year's second quarter and up 93% over the second quarter of 2019. This was the best second quarter on record and was driven by broadband, where we added 354,000 net new residential and business customers, up 10% over last year's second quarter and 69% above the second quarter of 2019. These strong results were driven by improved churn and healthy connects relative to both 2020 and 2019, and this was the lowest second quarter broadband churn on record. 
Looking ahead, as Brian mentioned earlier, based on our strong results through the first half of the year as well as current trends, we now expect total broadband net additions for 2021 be up mid-teens from the 1.4 million net adds in 2019. 
Broadband revenue increased 14% and grew 13%, excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's second quarter. These results were driven by strong growth in volume and rates. Wireless revenue grew 70% due to an increase in both customer lines and higher device sales. We added 280,000 net new lines in the quarter, the best result since launching this business in 2017, bringing us to 3.4 million total lines as of quarter end. We are encouraged by the initial results on our new unlimited plan, which is driving a notable increase in unlimited connects as well as a lift in overall volume. 
Turning to video. Revenue increased 2.6% or 0.5%, excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's second quarter, reflecting healthy growth in rates, mostly offset by net video subscriber losses totaling 399,000. While our residential rate adjustment at the beginning of the year was the primary driver of the increase in rates, we believe it was also a contributor to the video subscriber loss in the quarter. 
Business Services revenue increased 10%, primarily driven by higher rates though the comparison to last year when business services was significantly impacted by COVID-19. Over the past year, we have bounced back, rates have recovered and customer growth is strong as we added 17,000 net new customers in the quarter and 70,000 over the past year, primarily driven by continued improvement in small business. 
Last, advertising revenue increased 59%, reflecting an overall market recovery compared to last year when we experienced reduced spending from advertisers due to COVID-19. As we move to the second half of the year, we will have difficult comparisons to last year when we benefited from strong political advertising. 
Turning to expenses. Cable Communications second quarter expenses increased 8.2%. Programming expenses increased 12% and were up 5%, excluding the impact of RSN adjustments last year, primarily due to the number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020, combined with annual escalators in existing agreements. Looking to the third quarter, we expect programming expense growth to increase at high single-digit levels due to the continued impact of contract renewals as well as the comparison to last year's third quarter, which was also favorably impacted by RSN fee adjustments. For the full year, we continue to expect programming expense to increase at high single-digit levels. 
Nonprogramming expenses increased 5.7% or 0.5% on a per relationship basis due to higher technical and product support and advertising, marketing and promotion spend to drive growth in our core broadband and wireless businesses. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower bad debt expense. These trends should continue in the third quarter. 
Cable Communications EBITDA grew nearly 15% to $7.1 billion, including a contribution of $68 million from our wireless business, the best results since launch. Cable EBITDA margins reached 44.2%, reflecting 140 basis points of year-over-year improvement. While the RSN fee adjustments had no impact on EBITDA, they did impact margins last year. [ Excluding ] the RSN adjustment impact, margins expanded 200 basis points year-over-year. Cable cap expenditures increased 17%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 10.6%, up 50 basis points compared to last year. These results were driven by an increase in scalable infrastructure as we continue to enhance the capacity of our network as well as increases in broadband-related CPE and line extensions. As Brian mentioned, we have decided to move a bit faster to the next phase of DOCSIS using very cost-effective technology, allowing us to maintain the CapEx intensity level we achieved in 2020, which was the lowest in our history, and we expect to be at this level for the next few years. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Let's start with total NBC Universal results. Revenue increased 39% to $8 billion, and EBITDA increased 13%, $1.6 billion. Media revenue increased 26%, driven by higher advertising, distribution and other revenue. Advertising revenue increased 33%, reflecting the timing of sports and overall market recovery compared to last year and the launch of Peacock. We had significantly more sporting events compared to last year when sports were paused, which benefited our advertising revenue. Excluding this benefit, advertising grew at mid-teens levels. 
Distribution revenue increased 19% or high single digits, excluding the RSN fee adjustments that impacted last year's results. This growth reflects higher rates post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020, partially offset by subscriber declines, which were sequentially flat. 
Media EBITDA declined 16% to $1.4 billion, including Peacock, which generated revenue of $122 million and an EBITDA loss of $363 million. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA was essentially flat, driven by higher sports costs associated with the increase in sporting events this quarter compared to both last year and 2019. As a reminder, our third quarter Media results will be impacted by our broadcast of the Summer Olympics. 
Studio revenue increased 8.4%, driven by higher theatrical revenue, reflecting the success of Fast 9 in theaters and compared to last year when theaters were mainly closed due to COVID-19. Studio EBITDA decreased 52% to $156 million as a result of higher expenses associated with our theatrical releases compared to last year when releases were paused, the timing of content licensing sales and the comparison to last year, which included transactions with Peacock related to our initial launch of the service. 
In the second half, EBITDA comparisons to last year will remain challenging as we continue to launch new theatrical releases and ramp our TV production. 
Theme Parks revenue increased by $958 million [ to ] $1.1 billion and generated EBITDA of $221 million, which included about $150 million of Universal Beijing preopening costs. This is the first profitable quarter we've had since the pandemic began in the first quarter of 2020 and was driven by strong results at our Universal Orlando Resort. Orlando has had exceptionally strong demand, with June attendance exceeding 2019 levels as well as strong per cap growth, despite virtually no international guests during the quarter due to COVID-related travel constraints. 
We opened our Jurassic World-themed roller coaster, the VelociCoaster, on June 10 with some of the highest guest satisfaction scores we've had. Hollywood has been operating without capacity restriction since mid-June and has experienced strong demand, aided by the opening of our Secret Life of Pets traction in April. We're optimistic that our domestic parks are on a path to return to historic levels of profitability, but we need international visitation to resume, which remains dependent on COVID-related travel restrictions being lifted. 
At our Japan Park, results continue to be challenging. After closing in late April, we reopened on June 1 with capacity restrictions that are likely to remain in place through the summer. 
Last, as we prepare to open our newest park, Universal Beijing, we expect overall results will be negatively impacted by up to $250 million in the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the second quarter, Sky revenue increased 15% to $5.2 billion, largely reflecting strong growth in our U.K. business. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 7.7%, primarily reflecting higher average revenue per customer relationship. Results in the U.K. drove the bulk of the growth and benefited from the comparison to last year when sports subscriptions were paused as well as a rate increase, higher mobile device sales and improving hospitality revenue as pubs and clubs reopen. While customer relationships grew in the U.K., overall customer relationships declined 248,000, primarily driven by customer losses in Italy and Germany to the end of the football season. As we have previously said, we have reset our football rights in Germany and Italy. As a result, we anticipate lower programming and production expense, along with continued customer losses in the third and fourth quarters. We believe this disciplined approach to sports-related cost is the right long-term financial decision for the business. 
Advertising revenue increased 79% with results in the U.K. driving the growth and reflecting the overall market recovery from COVID-19 as well as an increase in the number of sporting events compared to last year when sports were paused. Sky generated $560 million in EBITDA, a 32% decline compared to last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting higher sports rights amortization related to more events in the current quarter. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower entertainment costs due to production delays. 
I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. The Free cash flow was $4.8 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 20% year-over-year, largely due to the timing of last year's federal tax payments, which were deferred to the third quarter. While net working capital was a positive contribution to free cash flow in the quarter, we continue to expect it will be a negative drag on our full year results and higher compared to 2019 levels due to an increase in content investments and our broadcast of the Olympics. Consolidated total capital, which includes capital expenditures as well as software and intangibles, increased 5.2% in the second quarter to $2.8 billion, reflecting an increase in Cable, which was partially offset by a decline at NBCU. For the full year, we now expect capital to be slightly above 2020 levels, reflecting our plan, as I've previously mentioned, to accelerate enhancements to our network. 
In the second quarter, our return of capital to shareholders included dividend payments totaling $1.2 billion, up 9.5% year-over-year. We also resumed our share repurchase activity late in the second quarter, totaling $500 million as of June 30. As previously communicated, we intend to stay at historical buyback levels until we reach our intended target leverage levels, which we currently expect to reach sometime in 2022. With our return to share repurchase in the quarter, we are happy to get back to our long-standing balanced approach to capital allocation, which consists of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for profitable growth and returning capital to shareholders. 
Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call."

How do we think -- I know you gave the 3Q sort of onetime item for Beijing. As we get to 4Q, are the Beijing losses done? Is it an easy comp next year? How should we think about profitability overall? 
Dave, can you unpack the margin expansion for us in the quarter? It looks like advertising and wireless probably drove all of the margin expansion. When I think about the last few years, you've got a lot of margin expansion from leveraging nonprogramming costs. Was there just unusual year-over-year comps within the Cable business relative to 2Q of last [indiscernible] next couple of quarters, and you get back to sort of normal margin expansion on nonprogramming line? Or is there other investments you're making that we should consider?"

On the parts, we're very -- first of all, I would start by saying we're very pleased with not just the quarter, but the trajectory of that we're opening. As Mike went through, Orlando is, on attendance standpoint, pretty close to back where we were in 2019, even though we don't have any international visitors, and you would expect those international visitors to pick up over time in Hollywood. We've only been over a couple of months, and we're already approaching our capacity, and we're excited about the next couple of months and following [ overnight ]. 
So the domestic parks, obviously, with COVID, you just don't know. It's -- things could be lumpy. Things could be nonlinear. But so far, the trajectory is really good, and we expect that to continue. And I would say the thing we're most pleased with is the protocols of work, and we've been able to keep people safe and keep our workers safe and keep our guests safe. And that, I think, is driving the confidence in coming to our parks. 
Internationally, Brian and I actually were in Japan. And even though that country is a little bit behind as far as COVID, we've been able to get our Park back open. We're open again with some capacity constraints. We have a great attraction there that we were able to see, Nintendo, which is one of our best attractions that we've ever built anywhere in the world that rivals Harry Potter. And I'm very excited for that, not only in Japan, but for Epic Universe down the road and our other parks eventually. So Japan is behind, but feels like it's heading in the right direction. And so that's going to be great. 
And then lastly, with Beijing, we're ready to go in Beijing. The Park's ready. It's awesome. It's our most technologically advanced Park. And we expect -- right now, what we're doing is going through the final approvals of rides and the process you have to go through. And that is somewhat indeterminate, but we expect that Park to open in the next couple of months. And when it does open, as you mentioned, those pre-operating costs go away, and we start getting attendance in. So Beijing should be a good contributor to us remainder of the year when it opens and then on to next year. So overall, our Parks are on a good trajectory, and it's hard to see what happens with COVID, but we're pretty pleased. Dave?"

So we walk through a couple of things on margin in the quarter and looking forward. we feel very good about our position on the progress that we continue to make on margin improvement, real focus around the fundamentals. And so while there'll be some things within a quarter that move a little bit, the fundamentals are the things that we stay extremely focused on. And it starts with broadband. And both residential and commercial, both are -- just drive higher revenue, both are margin accretive and just to help us deploy digital solutions, in particular, in residential at a higher rate. So those fundamentals are -- continue to bring this foot to where we're at. 
As we scale mobile, as you said, there are improvements there, advertising as well with advanced advertising provides support. But it's primarily the focus around connectivity and just driving more customer relationships there in that space connected with the digital customer experience improvements is such a win-win for the customer and for us. 
Just to provide perspective in the quarter, our total agent calls decreased by 10% with total interactions lower [ at ] 7%, and we saw a 22% reduction in truck rolls. And this is despite an overall 5% increase in the customer base. So you go back over time, this is just a continuation. Over the past 5 years, we constantly made progress, taking 37% or almost 100 million calls out of the run rate and reduced truck rolls by 25%. 
So Doug, it's been -- this is a real focus for us. And while I don't think we'll grow the second half of the year margins at the same rate that we did in the first half, we're in a really good place, and we're doing it in a healthy and sustainable way. And so I like the road map that we have around digital tools and the experience. I like the run rate around connectivity. And while we'll invest in areas like business services in mobile, sales and marketing, the things that are just going to help us grow we're going to continue to stay extremely focused on margin."

And I think like it continues to be a tailwind year-on-year. Do you have a sense of what sort of normal looks like as you think about OpEx? I mean you guys just sounded quite bullish on margins going forward. But there is some concern that as activity normalizes that some costs come back in the business. I'm wondering if you could just tackle that? 
And the same thing for you, Dave. I mean churn, it sounds like it keeps coming down. Do we go back to normal churn from pre-COVID or not? I don't know if you have any sense of that when you look at different geographies in your footprint, if you can glean anything there. 
And then Brian, I'm sure you know there's been lots of press articles on Comcast buying lots of different businesses. And I'm wondering, now that you've laid out at least some of your Peacock international strategy, all these articles seem to assume that you don't have enough scale in NBC to achieve your strategic goals around streaming.

I think given a feel for what the second half looks like is the best I'll do at this stage.

But I think that's the best sense for the second half of the year. And I'll let Dave comment on churn, but it's a little bit of the same message, which is we'll see what normal looks like.

And then just to complement not just speed, but our devices, the pods, the ability to provide great WiFi coverage inside the home is just so critical and staying ahead of that curve is key and then adding value extensions to broadband like mobile, like Flex that impact churn.

And you got with the Peacock and Sky and Peacock and Xfinity and even in our Olympics advertising. And we like -- and we are investing behind the businesses. So I don't think -- I think Mike Cavanagh has been very front that we don't need M&A. We have majority broadband-centric company, and we like the mix. 
So what might that drive us to consider at least, which is any kind of partnership where we have unique special capabilities that could lead in globally or internationally to enhancing our streaming position, that's something you might talk to others and consider. But as to your scale question, I really think it would -- we have all the parts. And Jeff, why don't you comment on that in just a second and maybe with some more specifics. But if you look at the results of Peacock this quarter, again, we're probably we're the fastest-growing streaming service, 50% in 90 days. We have a brand that's only a year old, and it's either the #1 or #2 new brand in America that's been created. So I really think our corporate focus is as we've said many times, was to get back in balance on capital returns. 
I'm probably most pleased this quarter that we were able to get to that place, buy back stock, as Mike just talked about. So I do think we have the scale. I think we have an amazing company, and I feel fortunate with our position. Jeff, why don't you talk a little more about the scale?"
173341,1671479226,2354307,"Comcast Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Brian. Ben, when you talk about scale with respect to streaming and Peacock, to get more granular for a second, there really are 3 elements of scale. One is the scale of the platform technologically. And as Brian just mentioned, we launched o",524,"Yes. Thanks, Brian. Ben, when you talk about scale with respect to streaming and Peacock, to get more granular for a second, there really are 3 elements of scale. One is the scale of the platform technologically. And as Brian just mentioned, we launched on the back of of the Sky platform, and we've leveraged our Xfinity and Dave's team significantly. So I think we have proved that we would have never launched the success technologically with a platform that looks great and works without the scale that we have already at the company. 
There is scale with respect to the brand, and that's why I'm thrilled with today's announcement that Peacock is going to be in 20 million Sky homes, and eventually, we'll roll it out across the globe. 
And then the most important by far element of scale for streaming is content. And we are really at the beginning of our content rollout on Peacock. That's why this quarter's growth is really extraordinary because this quarter, as Brian went through, we had a pretty good movie with BOSS Baby 2. We had our first real good drama with Dr. Death. And we had -- and we have obviously rolled into the Olympics here where we're halfway through the first week of the Olympics. 
Looking forward, -- we -- as part of our plan, we have another Olympics. We have lots of original programming, which Mike mentioned. We're ramping our production right now, and we'll be rolling out over the next year. Brian mentioned our movies. We have the -- what I think is one of the top studios in Hollywood, and we have lots of movies coming directly to Peacock. And eventually, we're going to have the Hulu content coming back. So we have plenty of content coming. And this quarter showed that when you put that content on a service that's good, you can actually get pretty good growth in the streaming world. And so personally, I don't think we've ever lacked for the capital to do what we need to do to grow our business. 
And what I'll end with is a perfect example that happened in the last week was we, at Universal, acquired the rights to the next 3 Exorcist movies. And a pretty unique deal that was done in tandem with Peacock, we wouldn't have been able to do it if we didn't have a streaming service where we basically got the right on the back of the strength of our studio where we have Jason Blum and a horror pedigree that's unmatched and [indiscernible] and her team's ability to market movies. But because we did it with Peacock, we have full optionality going forward. Do we put the second and third movies direct on Peacock? Do we do coming hybrid? We can really kind of adapt and be flexible based on how the market works. 
So we have the scale across our company to do things like that. And I don't think we're lacking for scale personally. I think we can achieve our success at Peacock without anything additional, and I think this quarter proved it."

You've come out of the pandemic in a stronger position than you were even going in at really all of the businesses, Cable, NBCU and Sky, in every aspect, whether it's share gains, margin, growth in developing businesses, et cetera. So sitting here today, what do you think the biggest ongoing benefits will be from all the changes that have been implemented? And then what are your key longer-term goals from here? You've talked about the near-term goals. 
And then Jeff, I don't even know where to start because there's so much going on at NBCU. But can you give us a little more color on the upfront and the cost platform benefits? And maybe to drill down a little bit into Peacock, what should we expect in the next year or so in terms of incremental cost for the international rollout as well as increased content? And then finally, you said in the past that you expect this Olympics to be the most profitable, but you've been hit with a little bit of bad luck, I mean, in terms of COVID getting a little bit worse and stuff going on with the athletes. Do you still have that view? Like how do you think about this Olympics or the next one in terms of profitability?"

It's been an extraordinary year. I'm really proud of the company, first of all, on some of our initiatives, our commitment of $1 billion over 10 years to both the digital divide and have broadband be accessible and affordable for many more people. 
And so I guess I'd start by saying the momentum is on us to keep this fabulous execution. Dave talked a lot about that focus. I think what kind of gets lost perhaps a little bit in broadband is not just the consumer broadband, which clearly record second quarter, now saying, again, that this year, we expect mid-teens growth from 2019. I did not expect that 6 months ago. 
So how do we keep that momentum and build on it, that comes down to great products and the network and a team and a management team. We've made a lot of changes. We've had some retirements and other things and the backfilling and moving executives, promoting executives, all of that has put our team in an excellent place. 
We've learned how to work in a hybrid manner. And whatever comes next, I don't think this team will miss a beat. And so I thank them for their focus. But as I think about broadband, we really don't talk about business services enough to have a $9 billion business from 0, built literally with 0 market share and growing only 1 direction and keep expanding the definition of that market from small to medium to now really enterprise. And every couple of weeks, I get an e-mail that talks about some major accounts that we've just won for the first time, and it could lead to way more volume over time. 
So Bill Stemper, who has run that business really since inception and has done an exceptional job. And we're trying to do that now at Sky and expand that market. 
And then we've talked a little bit about wireless and mobile. And we've really pivoted to being a strategic opportunity with fantastic customer satisfaction ratings, a great relationship with Verizon that enables us now to peak and compete well and to innovate. And so on and on, I think keeping our focus there. 
So in the longer term, I think we have an opportunity to see the idle trend of direct-to-consumer digitization computing power evolving our -- the way we live, how relevant will our company remain and be and help lead that change. 
And I look at the tech company results, and you just see this trend accelerating. So what are some of the takeaways? Well, first of all, being an enabler and a critical opportunity to innovate our network to help be as relevant in the future as we are today is job 1. 
I think digital advertising. We saw some of the results from the tech companies, and we look at our own creating more inventory. So the strategy for Peacock for me feels really smart. We're creating more digital inventory. That's the Holy Grail of adds. That's why we're able to get a premium, and Jeff can talk about Olympics a bit. But in the big picture, we're reimagining how people consume. And that consumption is enabled by broadband and now enabled by Peacock and hope to do that in a more significant way and then retaining talent and being a company where people want to work, but at all levels of the company. And that's being reimagined in our society. And we read about it every day, how people have more choices and more balance in their life. 
Figuring that out, we have a talented team that is leading us and that I really want to thank here and at this quarter and this first half of the year. And coming through the pandemic, it feels like, hopefully, there's an opportunity to be a real light even if we have a few more moments. This company is well positioned. And I just really feel that way. So thanks for giving us a chance to ask that question. That's so good. Jeff?"

It's, as Brian just mentioned, the strength of our platform,",646,"Jessica Thanks, Brian. So on the upfront, let me take kind of in order, Jessica, how you asked the question. So on the upfront, I think we've been -- I think we've talked about that in the past. It's, as Brian just mentioned, the strength of our platform, combined with Linda's -- [indiscernible] care owner team's approach -- 1 platform approach was the perfect way to approach this Red Hot upfront. And as Brian said and Mike said, double-digit increases in both volume and pricing, and we'll see those results in the years ahead, and particularly happy with both the volume on Peacock and the CPMs on Peacock. So that -- we could not have been more pleased with how we did in the upfront. 
As far as Peacock, I should mention that 1 of the things I didn't talk about is we concluded our Amazon and Samsung deals this [ quarter 2 ]. There is a lot going on at NBC. We're now fully distributed for Peacock, and that's going to have benefits as we roll out all our additional content. 
I would say that we look at where we are today and being much further ahead than we expected to be at this point, we'll probably ramp up our investment modestly over what we've done in the past. But as I mentioned, we have so much content coming to Peacock that it doesn't have to be significant. I will say with Peacock and then segue to the Olympics, we're learning a lot as consumption happens on the Olympics here at day 6. And not to ruin anybody tuning in, but we have big upset just happened in the last hour and I didn't watch tonight on NBC to see that, but an exciting U.S. team. And we're not -- we've had some bad luck. But if you look at the product, it's fantastic. And it really is impossible. 
And so what I would say is on Peacock, what we will learn in this Olympics, we will take to Beijing and change the product, change the offering and each Olympic outboard, and we're really excited about that. It's impossible to understate the importance of the Olympics to NBCUniversal. It's not really financially. It's more operationally across the company. We have 4,000 people literally working on it. Brian and I were in Tokyo. I came back and saw our team in Connecticut. You have people, this is their life work. You go from room to room. You have experts on surfing and volleyball and gymnastic. And it's a -- it is an operation that would be very difficult to replicate the talent and the experience that our team brings to it, and they show it every night in NBC. And then of course, the Olympics were the perfect property to show the strength of our platform across not only NBC Universal, but Comcast and Xfinity and Sky. 
So the Olympics, obviously, as you said, Jessica, we had a little bit of bad luck. There was a drumbeat of negativity. We got moved a year and those spectators on. And that has resulted a little bit in linear ratings being probably less than we expected. But the flip side of that is the digital strength kind of offsets that. So when you look at what's happening with Peacock, that's directly related to the Olympics. 
So net-net, with all of this bad luck, we're going to be profitable on the Olympics, which we're very happy with, and we're very happy with the product. And then if you watch every night, you'll see we use this as a firehouse to promote everything else we're doing at the company, not just across NBCUniversal but also Comcast. So the Olympics, I think we're very pleased with the Olympics and very proud of our team and got a ways to go here."

So -- and the reasons why that we're -- we continue to be excited, it is a terrific long-term platform, but it is helping broadband, as I mentioned earlier. So they were generating about $2 of incremental revenue just on the pay per view. The rev share side of things and advertising opportunities will be above that. 
So today, in terms of what we're doing within footprint, there are parts of what you mentioned. We absolutely include it as part of the broadband subscription. It's a key part of now that with broadband. You get this great streaming platform. So we're doing that. We have -- if you're a traditional video customer, we have devices that enable full home, the X1 experience throughout. So we have that. But we are not bashful about letting our customers -- broadband customers, in particular, that really important streaming segment know that this is included. 
Outside of footprint, -- we are -- we have syndication partners that we're working with, Cox, the Canadian companies, and we continue to explore ways of doing that. And we think that it's a terrific long-term platform to buy together uniquely. The way that we do with the voice remote, it gives a full capability. We've been investing in X1. We can leverage that platform. 
So we do qualify. We ask the customer if they want it. And then we -- but we stay right on it and deliver a great service. And the feedback that we're getting and engagement is very strong. So it's a really important part of broadband growth today, and we'll explore outside of footprint opportunities, ways of doing even more over time."

And then second, did you register for the next wireless auction?  
Phil, this is Dave. So on the sales momentum side of mobile, one of the things that's happened as we got through the first pandemic phase that we did shut down last year, retail slowed things down. And what we saw in the back half of last year just continued through this year every single sales channel now we focused on Retail's back -- and -- but in addition to that, extremely focused on our call centers, the digital tools that optimize buy flows for mobile and how we go to market, it's -- that has been a huge change, just the fact that we lead with mobile is so key. And mobile and broadband being a package.  
So those fundamentals have emerged and really an important part of our go-to-market strategy. We've invested in tools, not only for the customer but for our agents and how they sell mobile, just improving the experience for customers really key. So -- and a lot of marketing investment around the mobile message. If you live in our footprint and you're watching this great Olympics coverage that Jeff and the team are doing, you can't miss the fact that we are really, really focused around the mobile business. So -- but I think that natural combination of broadband plus mobile will continue. 
So the other big addition recently is clearly the unlimited packages that we've rolled out, and that is adding to it. We've seen a nice shift in mix, and we continue to have by the gig. But adding on Unlimited really closed and filled the gap that we had in our competitive portfolio. So now with great unlimited pricing from multiline families, and you can mix and match still between buy the gig and Unlimited, we're in a unique position in our footprint. 
So like our momentum, the 280,000 lines was just terrific and set a record for us, but we're continuing to stay focused, and we see that this is a real opportunity for us going forward. 
So on the auction side, I think the last part..."

We're going to think about it in terms of we want to keep a strong balance sheet. So I think, think of us as wanting to be comfortably in the range of ratios that would support the single A rating. We want to make sure we're investing behind our businesses, primarily organically, but occasionally, tuck-in acquisitions or all that. You'd see that in a normal course all the time in our business. 
And then capital return is the other leg of the stool. We've been -- this company has historically been very strong and important part of the priorities to return capital. We've increased the dividend for 13-plus years running and 1 of the few companies that have had as strong a level of consistent dividend increase. And you look back between the time of the NBC deal and the Sky deal, the level of free cash flow that was returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends combined was incredibly strong. So I think we would continue to execute against that. 
The first half of the year -- I guess, the remainder of this year, think of us as continuing to be at the historical levels for now. We've got a level of working capital this year that continue. We continue to expect it will be higher than it was in 2019. That's mostly going to be hitting us in the second half of this year with Olympics and the ramping of content spend, but the dynamics of EBITDA growth and future prospects is as you described. So we'll take it a quarter at a time as -- and we'll talk more probably at the end of the year."

We added 354,000 broadband customers, an increase compared to both the same period last year and to 2019. And that drove 294,000 total customer relationship additions. These were the best broadband and customer relationship results we've had for any second quarter on record. 
Our broadband connect activity is healthy, and churn improved for the 14th quarter in a row. In fact, we hit the lowest second quarter churn rate in our company's history.

And we are experiencing the fastest sales momentum we've ever had, a testament to the changes we implemented in the back half of last year when we reprioritized wireless across our sales channels and integrated this business more fully into our core operations. And this past April, we introduced a fabulous Unlimited family plan, which we just started offering to our small business customers as well. 
So I couldn't be more pleased with Dave Watson and the team he has assembled as they have a relentless focus on connectivity, which has never been more important. They truly put the customer first, offering innovative and differentiated products and services. And pretty unique to the market, we now offer 1.2 gigs of downstream to essentially all 60 million homes and businesses in our footprint. 
The foundation of our success is our network, which we constantly evolve so that we can easily handle capacity growth, increase in subscribers and the changing usage patterns of our customers who continue to take faster speeds. Currently, there are typically 25 connected devices in the home, with 8 active at any one time, and this increases every year. That drives in-home Wi-Fi usage to 15x that of wireless. Delivering huge amount of data at consistent speeds and reducing latency is what's powering our growth. And we're doing this in a cost-efficient way.
Virtualizing our network, combined with our suite of digital tools, also allows us to continue to improve the customer experience while identifying additional cost savings. And the progress we've made is evident in our results. During the second quarter, total agent calls decreased by 10%, and total interactions were down by 7%. We also saw a 22% reduction in truck rolls, despite an over 5% increase in our customer base. 
So as I look ahead, I think about our philosophy since the early days of broadband, which has been to bet on a never-ending cycle of new technologies, devices and applications that come from Silicon Valley and new start-ups everywhere that need to take advantage of greater speeds and capacity over time. We see this transformation happening every day and continue to believe that this is ongoing for the foreseeable future.
So what does that mean for our network? Well, since October of 2020, we've been trialing gig and multi-gig symmetrical speeds over our DOCSIS infrastructure to great success. With upstream comprising today less than 10% of total broadband usage, even during a peak, we don't really have a consumer use case for this technology capability yet. But the strategy for our network is to plan ahead. We're investing in architecture that lets us go beyond where consumers are, and we can do all of this in a way that won't affect the capital intensity ratios we currently enjoy. Dave can provide more detail about the technological decisions we're making during the Q&A. 
With Cable comprising roughly 70% of our consolidated EBITDA, broadband is a top strategic priority. And I could not be more pleased with the strength of this quarter and the first half of 2021. 
Looking at other parts of our business. For the first time since the pandemic, our Theme Parks returned nicely to profitability. This was led by Orlando, where we've seen strong domestic demand in both per cap spending and in attendance, which returned to 2019 levels, somewhat faster than I thought might happen, despite virtually no international visitation. 
And in Hollywood, since restrictions have been lifted, attendance is growing week after week. We continue to see firsthand, the pent-up demand for high-quality entertainment and family fun outside of the home. And we remain incredibly bullish on our Theme Parks. 
Our Studios business is also coming back. We've returned to prepandemic television production levels, and we're really optimistic about our upcoming films, especially after the success of Fast 9, which debuted at #1 in all territories at launch, and with $600 million of worldwide box office to date, remains the biggest U.S. film launch since the pandemic began. Following Fast, we successfully released Boss Baby 2 and the latest installment of Purge. And over the July 4 weekend, we had the top 3 films at the domestic box office, the first time that's happened for any studio since 1995. We have a great slate ahead with Dear Evan Hansen in September, followed by a new Halloween in October. And we end the year with Sing 2. 
Next, let's talk about our media and production strategy, which across the entire company, is aligned around one purpose: create premium programming which we can then scale and monetize for the very best global distribution outlets. Peacock adds to what we already offer. It's a great complement to our linear brands, which are successful in their own right. And together, these platforms provide a continuous loop of content and promotion that seamlessly drive viewership across our ecosystem, offering a different access point to attract new audiences while giving existing viewers more of what they love.
We are clearly capitalizing on the strength of our media brands, having just completed the strongest advertising upfront in our history, securing double-digit increases in both volume and price across our entire portfolio. And I'm pleased to report that as of this week, Peacock has 54 million sign-ups and over 20 million monthly active accounts. This is 50% higher than our last report, driven by a number of factors: the Day and Date release of Boss Baby 2; debut of Dr. Death, our most successful original to date; and the airing of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. 
The third quarter, thus far, has been a particularly strong period, and we will work hard to manage retention and grow from here, recognizing we are unlikely to replicate such tremendous performance. But we remain optimistic with a lot of programming strength ahead of us, such as more premium originals; Monday Night Football; the Beijing Olympics; and our reimagined dynamic Pay-One window, which starting in 2022, shifts our film titles to Peacock exclusively for the first and last 4-month segments in the Pay window, with Amazon Prime and Netflix sharing rights for the 10 months in between. 
By showcasing content across multiple platforms, Universal films will constantly refresh across the streaming ecosystem. Audiences will have multiple access points with which to consume our content, and we will generate more third-party revenue while retaining the most valuable window for Peacock. So as you can see, we've successfully been able to pivot, coming up with creative ways to keep up with consumer demand and in many cases, making even more money than we did before. 
At Sky, we are pleased revenue is back to pre-COVID levels, despite the lingering impact that COVID continues to have on our pubs and clubs segment. Sky's results were led by the U.K. with revenue and EBITDA ahead of 2019, and we're seeing momentum across a number of areas. Premium TV churn is at record low levels. In streaming, we posted ARPU growth of over 20% for the fourth consecutive quarter. And in broadband, where we just introduced our 500-meg offering, we experienced improved churn relative to both 2020 and 2019 despite a 6% price increase in the quarter. In addition, Sky Mobile had the strongest second quarter activations on record with churn averaging 40% better than industry average. 
And today, we're announcing the debut of our international streaming strategy for Peacock. Later this year, we will leverage Sky's significant scale and powerful brand to include Peacock at no additional cost for its 20 million customers across Europe. The benefits of this launch are tremendous. We will unlock incremental advertising revenue, introduce the Peacock brand and content catalog via Sky's established platforms in key European markets and directly monetize our programming investments.
The decision to make Peacock the anchor tenant on Xfinity's X1 and Flex platforms for its domestic launch has been a key driver of brand awareness, scale, consumption and promotion, and we see a similar opportunity with Sky. We're utilizing all the wonderful assets of our company to create value for audiences everywhere, and we look forward to finalizing agreements with other programming and distribution partners outside of our Sky markets. 
So summing up, this was a fabulous quarter and a great first half of the year. I'm so pleased we are now in a position to buy back stock, which we will report on in Mike's section. This is a truly very special company, and I'm excited for the road ahead. 
Mike, over to you."
173341,1671479226,2354673,"Comcast Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our second quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 20% to $28.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to $8.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 22% to $0.84 per share. And f",1945,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our second quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 20% to $28.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to $8.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 22% to $0.84 per share. And finally, we generated $4.8 billion of free cash flow. 
Now let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable revenue increased 11% to $16 billion, EBITDA increased nearly 15% to $7.1 billion and net cash flow grew close to 15% to $5 billion. As a reminder, last year's second quarter was most significantly impacted by COVID-19, including adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees. Excluding the impact of these RSN adjustments, Cable Communications revenue increased 9.3% with no corresponding impact to EBITDA.
We added 294,000 net new customer relationships, up 35% over last year's second quarter and up 93% over the second quarter of 2019. This was the best second quarter on record and was driven by broadband, where we added 354,000 net new residential and business customers, up 10% over last year's second quarter and 69% above the second quarter of 2019. These strong results were driven by improved churn and healthy connects relative to both 2020 and 2019. And this was the lowest second quarter broadband churn on record. Looking ahead, as Brian mentioned earlier, based on our strong results through the first half of the year as well as current trends, we now expect total broadband net additions for 2021 to be up mid-teens from the 1.4 million net adds in 2019. 
Broadband revenue increased 14% and grew 13%, excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's second quarter. These results were driven by strong growth in volume and rates. Wireless revenue grew 70% due to an increase in both customer lines and higher device sales. We added 280,000 net new lines in the quarter, the best result since launching this business in 2017, bringing us to 3.4 million total lines as of quarter end. We are encouraged by the initial results on our new Unlimited plan, which is driving a notable increase in Unlimited connects as well as a lift in overall volume. 
Turning to video. Revenue increased 2.6% or 0.5%, excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's second quarter, reflecting healthy growth in rates, mostly offset by net video subscriber losses totaling 399,000. While our residential rate adjustment at the beginning of the year was the primary driver of the increase in rates, we believe it was also a contributor to the video subscriber loss in the quarter. 
Business services revenue increased 10%, primarily driven by higher rates though the comparison to last year when business services was significantly impacted by COVID-19. Over the past year, we have bounced back, rates have recovered and customer growth is strong as we added 17,000 net new customers in the quarter and 70,000 over the past year, primarily driven by continued improvement in small business. 
Last, advertising revenue increased 59%, reflecting an overall market recovery compared to last year when we experienced reduced spending from advertisers due to COVID-19. As we move to the second half of the year, we will have difficult comparisons to last year when we benefited from strong political advertising.
Turning to expenses. Cable Communications second quarter expenses increased 8.2%. Programming expenses increased 12% and were up 5%, excluding the impact of RSN adjustments last year, primarily due to the number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020, combined with annual escalators in existing agreements. Looking to the third quarter, we expect programming expense growth to increase at high single-digit levels due to the continued impact of contract renewals as well as the comparison to last year's third quarter, which was also favorably impacted by RSN fee adjustments. For the full year, we continue to expect programming expense to increase at high single-digit levels.
Nonprogramming expenses increased 5.7% or 0.5% on a per relationship basis due to higher technical and product support and advertising, marketing and promotion spend to drive growth in our core broadband and wireless businesses. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower bad debt expense. These trends should continue in the third quarter. 
Cable Communications EBITDA grew nearly 15% to $7.1 billion, including a contribution of $68 million from our wireless business, the best results since launch. Cable EBITDA margins reached 44.2%, reflecting 140 basis points of year-over-year improvement. While the RSN fee adjustments had no impact on EBITDA, they did impact margins last year. Excluding the RSN adjustment impact, margins expanded 200 basis points year-over-year. Cable capital expenditures increased 17%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 10.6%, up 50 basis points compared to last year. These results were driven by an increase in scalable infrastructure as we continue to enhance the capacity of our network as well as increases in broadband-related CPE and line extensions. 
As Brian mentioned, we have decided to move a bit faster to the next phase of DOCSIS using very cost-effective technology, allowing us to maintain the CapEx intensity level we achieved in 2020, which was the lowest in our history. And we expect to be at this level for the next few years. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Let's start with total NBCUniversal results. Revenue increased 39% to $8 billion, and EBITDA increased 13%, $1.6 billion. Media revenue increased 26%, driven by higher advertising, distribution and other revenue. Advertising revenue increased 33%, reflecting the timing of sports and overall market recovery compared to last year and the launch of Peacock. We had significantly more sporting events compared to last year when sports were paused, which benefited our advertising revenue. Excluding this benefit, advertising grew at mid-teens levels.
Distribution revenue increased 19% or high single digits, excluding the RSN fee adjustments that impacted last year's results. This growth reflects higher rates post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020, partially offset by subscriber declines, which were sequentially flat.
Media EBITDA declined 16% to $1.4 billion, including Peacock, which generated revenue of $122 million and an EBITDA loss of $363 million. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA was essentially flat, driven by higher sports costs associated with the increase in sporting events this quarter compared to both last year and 2019. As a reminder, our third quarter Media results will be impacted by our broadcast of the Summer Olympics. 
Studio revenue increased 8.4%, driven by higher theatrical revenue, reflecting the success of Fast 9 in theaters and compared to last year when theaters were mainly closed due to COVID-19. Studio EBITDA decreased 52% to $156 million as a result of higher expenses associated with our theatrical releases compared to last year when releases were paused, the timing of content licensing sales and the comparison to last year, which included transactions with Peacock related to our initial launch of the service. In the second half, EBITDA comparisons to last year will remain challenging as we continue to launch new theatrical releases and ramp our TV production. 
Theme Parks revenue increased by $958 million to $1.1 billion and generated EBITDA of $221 million, which included about $150 million of Universal Beijing preopening costs. This is the first profitable quarter we've had since the pandemic began in the first quarter of 2020 and was driven by strong results at our Universal Orlando Resort. Orlando has had exceptionally strong demand, with June attendance exceeding 2019 levels as well as strong per cap growth, despite virtually no international guests during the quarter due to COVID-related travel constraints. We opened our Jurassic World-themed roller coaster, the VelociCoaster, on June 10 with some of the highest guest satisfaction scores we've had. 
Hollywood has been operating without capacity restriction since mid-June and has experienced strong demand, aided by the opening of our Secret Life of Pets attraction in April. We're optimistic that our domestic parks are on a path to return to historic levels of profitability, but we need international visitation to resume, which remains dependent on COVID-related travel restrictions being lifted.
At our Japan park, results continue to be challenging. After closing in late April, we reopened on June 1 with capacity restrictions that are likely to remain in place through the summer. Last, as we prepare to open our newest park, Universal Beijing, we expect overall results will be negatively impacted by up to $250 million in the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the second quarter, Sky revenue increased 15% to $5.2 billion, largely reflecting strong growth in our U.K. business. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 7.7%, primarily reflecting higher average revenue per customer relationship. Results in the U.K. drove the bulk of the growth and benefited from the comparison to last year when sports subscriptions were paused as well as a rate increase, higher mobile device sales and improving hospitality revenue as pubs and clubs reopen. 
While customer relationships grew in the U.K., overall customer relationships declined 248,000, primarily driven by customer losses in Italy and Germany to the end of the football season. As we have previously said, we have reset our football rights in Germany and Italy. As a result, we anticipate lower programming and production expense, along with continued customer losses in the third and fourth quarters. We believe this disciplined approach to sports-related cost is the right long-term financial decision for the business. 
Advertising revenue increased 79% with results in the U.K. driving the growth and reflecting the overall market recovery from COVID-19 as well as an increase in the number of sporting events compared to last year when sports were paused. Sky generated $560 million in EBITDA, a 32% decline compared to last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting higher sports rights amortization related to more events in the current quarter. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower entertainment costs due to production delays.
I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. The Free cash flow was $4.8 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 20% year-over-year, largely due to the timing of last year's federal tax payments, which were deferred to the third quarter. While net working capital was a positive contribution to free cash flow in the quarter, we continue to expect it will be a negative drag on our full year results and higher compared to 2019 levels due to an increase in content investments and our broadcast of the Olympics. 
Consolidated total capital, which includes capital expenditures as well as software and intangibles, increased 5.2% in the second quarter to $2.8 billion, reflecting an increase at Cable, which was partially offset by a decline at NBCU. For the full year, we now expect capital to be slightly above 2020 levels, reflecting our plan, as I've previously mentioned, to accelerate enhancements to our network. 
In the second quarter, our return of capital to shareholders included dividend payments totaling $1.2 billion, up 9.5% year-over-year. We also resumed our share repurchase activity late in the second quarter, totaling $500 million as of June 30. As previously communicated, we intend to stay at historical buyback levels until we reach our intended target leverage levels, which we currently expect to reach sometime in 2022. With our return to share repurchase in the quarter, we are happy to get back to our long-standing balanced approach to capital allocation, which consists of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for profitable growth and returning capital to shareholders. 
Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call."

You've got Beijing shifting from preopening losses to opening. The U.S. is more fully opening. Japan, at some point, a little more fully opening. How do we think -- I know you gave the 3Q sort of onetime item for Beijing. As we get to 4Q, are the Beijing losses done? Is it an easy comp next year? How should we think about profitability overall? 
Dave, can you unpack the margin expansion for us in the quarter? It looks like advertising and wireless probably drove all of the margin expansion. When I think about the last few years, you've got a lot of margin expansion from leveraging nonprogramming costs. Was there just unusual year-over-year comps within the Cable business relative to 2Q of last year that expires over the next couple of quarters, and you get back to sort of normal margin expansion on nonprogramming line? Or is there other investments you're making that we should consider?"

So on the parks, we're very -- first of all, I would start by saying we're very pleased with not just the quarter, but the trajectory of how we're opening. As Mike went through, Orlando is, on attendance standpoint, pretty close to back where we were in 2019 even though we don't have any international visitors. And you would expect those international visitors to pick up over time in Hollywood. We've only been open a couple of months, and we're already approaching our capacity. And we're excited about the next couple of months and Halloween Horror Nights.
So the domestic parks, obviously, with COVID, you just don't know. It's -- things could be lumpy. Things could be nonlinear. But so far, the trajectory is really good, and we expect that to continue. And I would say the thing we're most pleased with is the protocols have worked, and we've been able to keep people safe and keep our workers safe and keep our guests safe. And that, I think, is driving the confidence in coming to our parks. 
Internationally, Brian and I actually were in Japan. And even though that country is a little bit behind as far as COVID, we've been able to get our park back open. We're open again with some capacity constraints. We have a great attraction there that we were able to see, Nintendo, which is one of our best attractions that we've ever built anywhere in the world that rivals Harry Potter. And I'm very excited for that, not only in Japan, but for Epic Universe down the road and our other parks eventually. So Japan is behind, but feels like it's heading in the right direction. And so that's going to be great. 
And then lastly, with Beijing, we're ready to go in Beijing. The park's ready. It's awesome. It's our most technologically advanced park. And we expect -- right now, what we're doing is going through the final approvals of rides and the process you have to go through. And that is somewhat indeterminate, but we expect that park to open in the next couple of months. And when it does open, as you mentioned, those pre-operating costs go away, and we start getting attendance in. So Beijing should be a good contributor to us remainder of the year when it opens and then on to next year. So overall, our Parks are on a good trajectory, and it's hard to see what happens with COVID, but we're pretty pleased. Dave?"

So we'd walked through a couple of things on margin in the quarter and looking forward. It's -- we feel very good about our position on the progress that we continue to make on margin improvement, real focus around the fundamentals. And so while ther",358,"Yes. So we'd walked through a couple of things on margin in the quarter and looking forward. It's -- we feel very good about our position on the progress that we continue to make on margin improvement, real focus around the fundamentals. And so while there'll be some things within a quarter that move a little bit, the fundamentals are the things that we stay extremely focused on. And starts with broadband. And both residential and commercial, both are -- just drive higher revenue. Both are margin accretive and just help us deploy digital solutions, in particular, in residential at a higher rate. So those fundamentals are -- continue to bring us to where we're at. 
As we scale mobile, as you said, there are improvements there, advertising as well with advanced advertising providing support. But it's primarily the focus around connectivity and just driving more customer relationships there in that space, connected with the digital customer experience improvements, is such a win-win for the customer and for us. 
Just to provide perspective in the quarter, our total agent calls decreased by 10% with total interactions lower at 7%, and we saw a 22% reduction in truck rolls. And this is despite an overall 5% increase in the customer base. So if you go back over time, this is just a continuation. Over the past 5 years, we've constantly made progress, taking 37% or almost 100 million calls out of the run rate and reduced truck rolls by 25%. 
So Doug, it's been -- this is a real focus for us. And while I don't think we'll grow the second half of the year margins at the same rate that we did the first half, we're in a really good place. And we're doing it in a healthy and sustainable way. And so I like the road map that we have around digital tools and the experience. I like the run rate around connectivity. And while we'll invest in areas like business services, in mobile, sales and marketing, the things that are just going to help us grow, we're going to continue to stay extremely focused on margin."

And I think like it continues to be a tailwind year-on-year. Do you have a sense of what sort of normal looks like as you think about OpEx? I mean you guys just sounded quite bullish on margins going forward. But there is some concern that as activity normalizes, that some costs come back in the business. I'm wondering if you could just tackle that. 
And the same thing for you, Dave. I mean churn, it sounds like it keeps coming down. Do we go back to normal churn from pre-COVID or not? I don't know if you have any sense of that when you look at different geographies in your footprint, if you can glean anything there. 
And then, Brian, I'm sure you know there's been lots of press articles on Comcast buying lots of different businesses. And I'm wondering, now that you've laid out at least some of your Peacock international strategy, all these articles seem to assume that you don't have enough scale in NBC to achieve your strategic goals around streaming.

I think giving a feel for what the second half looks like is the best I'll do at this stage.

And I'll let Dave comment on churn, but it's a little bit of the same message, which is we'll see what normal looks like.

Yes, so we expect, over time, to have a little bit more normalization as you go into quarters like Q2, like Q3 with student activity, move activity, seasonality that could impact the churn. But we're reaching a level that we expected in terms of overall broadband churn performance. And this is -- it's the redefinition of great broadband, I think, that's helping deliver this -- some of this churn improvement. 
We have a fantastic network. We talked about it. Brian and Mike mentioned it. Continuing to invest in the network. We're going to stay ahead of the curve in terms of capacity, in usage. So a lot of focus around the network. 
And then just to complement not just speed, but our devices, the pods, the ability to provide great Wi-Fi coverage inside the home is just so critical. And staying ahead of that curve is key. And then adding value extensions to broadband, like Mobile, like Flex that impact churn. And so these are early days for us in terms of as we -- both of those categories are exciting for us, but they're impacting broadband in a positive way. 
So can't give specific guidance in terms of where churn would go. But the fundamentals of -- and the focus around attracting healthy and keeping healthy customer relationships and connectivity is so key. So we're very excited about the prospects of Mobile and Flex impacting that over time."

It's an exceptional quarter. And I believe we have much more organic growth ahead. And we have a very special, unique company, across distribution and content, working so well together. And you see that with Peacock and Sky and Peacock and Xfinity and even in our Olympics advertising. And we like -- and we are investing behind the businesses. So I don't think -- I think Mike Cavanagh has been very blunt that we don't need M&A. We have a majority broadband-centric company, and we like the mix. 
So what might that drive us to consider at least, which is any kind of partnership where we have unique special capabilities that could lead in -- globally or internationally to enhancing our streaming position. That's something you might talk to others and consider. 
But as to your scale question, I really think it would -- we have all the parts. And Jeff, why don't you comment on that in just a second and maybe with some more specifics. But if you look at the results of Peacock this quarter, again, we're probably -- we're the fastest-growing streaming service, 50% in 90 days. We have a brand that's only a year old, and it's either the #1 or #2 new brand in America that's been created. So I really think our corporate focus is, as we've said many times, was to get back in balance on capital returns.
I'm probably most pleased this quarter that we were able to get to that place, buy back stock, as Mike just talked about. So I do think we have the scale. I think we have an amazing company, and I feel fortunate with our position. 
Jeff, why don't you talk a little more about the scale?"
173341,1671479226,2354673,"Comcast Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Brian. Ben, when you talk about scale with respect to streaming and Peacock, just to get more granular for a second, there really are 3 elements of the scale.

Ben, when you talk about scale with respect to streaming and Peacock, just to get more granular for a second, there really are 3 elements of the scale. One is the scale of the platform technologically. And as Brian just mentioned, we launched on the back of the Sky platform. And we've leveraged our Xfinity and Dave's team significantly. So I think we have proved that we would have never launched -- this success technologically with a platform that looks great and works without the scale that we have already at the company. There is scale with respect to the brand, and that's why I'm thrilled with today's announcement that Peacock is going to be in 20 million Sky homes, and eventually, we'll roll it out across the globe. 
Then the most important by far element of scale as far as streaming is content. And we are really at the beginning of our content rollout on Peacock. That's why this quarter's growth is really extraordinary. Because this quarter, as Brian went through, we had a pretty good movie with Boss Baby 2. We had our first real good drama with Dr. Death. And we had -- and we have obviously rolled into the Olympics here where we're halfway through the first week of the Olympics.
Looking forward, we -- as part of our plan, we have another Olympics. We have lots of original programming, which Mike mentioned. We're ramping our production right now on. And we'll be rolling out over the next year. Brian mentioned our movies. We have the -- what I think is one of the top studios in Hollywood, and we have lots of movies coming directly to Peacock. And eventually, we're going to have the Hulu content coming back. 
So we have plenty of content coming. And this quarter showed that when you put that content on a service that's good, you can actually get pretty good growth in the streaming world. And so personally, I don't think we've ever lacked for the capital to do what we needed to do to grow our business. 
And what I'll end with is a perfect example that happened in the last week was we, at Universal, acquired the rights to the next 3 Exorcist movies in a pretty unique deal that was done in tandem with Peacock. We wouldn't have been able to do it if we didn't have a streaming service. Where we basically got the rights on the back of the strength of our studio where we have Jason Blum and a horror pedigree that's unmatched and Donna Langley and her team's ability to market movies. But because we did it with Peacock, we have full optionality going forward. Do we put the second and third movies direct on Peacock? Do we do something hybrid? We can really kind of adapt and be flexible based on how the market works. 
So we have the scale across our company to do things like that. And I don't think we're lacking for scale personally. I think we can achieve our success at Peacock without anything additional, and I think this quarter proved it."

So sitting here today, what do you think the biggest ongoing benefits will be from all the changes that have been implemented? And then what are your key longer-term goals from here? You've talked about the near-term goals. 
And then Jeff, I don't even know where to start because there's so much going on at NBCU. But can you give us a little more color on the upfront and the cost platform benefits? And maybe to drill down a little bit into Peacock, what should we be -- expect in the next year or so in terms of incremental cost for the international rollout as well as increased content? And then finally, you said in the past that you expect this Olympics to be the most profitable, but you've been hit with a little bit of bad luck, I mean, in terms of COVID getting a little bit worse and stuff going on with the athletes. Do you still have that view? Like how do you think about this Olympics or the next one in terms of profitability?"

It's been an extraordinary year. I'm really proud of the company, first of all, on some of our initiatives, our commitment of $1 billion over 10 years to close the digital divide and have broadband be accessible and affordable for many more people. And so I guess I'd start by saying the momentum, it's on us to keep this fabulous execution. Dave talked a lot about that focus. 
I think what kind of gets lost perhaps a little bit in broadband is not just the consumer broadband, which clearly, record second quarter. Now saying again that this year, we expect mid-teens growth from 2019. I did not expect that 6 months ago. 
So how do we keep that momentum and build on it, that comes down to great products and the network and a team and a management team. We've made a lot of changes. We've had some retirements and other things and the backfilling and moving executives, promoting executives. All that has put our team in an excellent place. We've learned how to work in a hybrid manner. And whatever comes next, I don't think this team will miss a beat. And so I thank them for their focus. 
But as I think about broadband, we really don't talk about business services enough to have a $9 billion business from 0, built literally with 0 market share and growing only 1 direction and keep expanding the definition of that market from small, to medium, to now really enterprise. And every couple of weeks, I get an e-mail that talks about some major account that we've just won for the first time, and it could lead to way more volume over time. So Bill Stemper, who has run that business really since inception and has done an exceptional job. And we're trying to do that now at Sky and expand that market. 
And then, we've talked a little bit about wireless and mobile. And we've really pivoted to being a strategic opportunity with fantastic customer satisfaction ratings, a great relationship with Verizon that enables us now to compete and compete well and to innovate and so on and on. I think keeping our focus there. 
So in the longer term, I think we have an opportunity to see the vital trend of direct-to-consumer, digitization, computing power evolving our -- the way we live, how relevant will our company remain and be and help lead that change. And I look at the tech company results, and you just see this trend accelerating. 
So what are some of the takeaways? Well, first of all, being an enabler and a critical opportunity to innovate our network to help be as relevant in the future as we are today is job one. I think digital advertising. We saw some of the results from the tech companies, and we look at our own, creating more inventory. So the strategy for Peacock for me feels really smart. We're creating more digital inventory. That's the Holy Grail of ads. That's why we're able to get a premium, and Jeff can talk about Olympics a bit. But in the big picture, we're reimagining how people consume. And that consumption is enabled by broadband and now enabled by Peacock and hope to do that in a more significant way. 
And then retaining talent and being a company where people want to work, but at all levels of the company. And that's being reimagined in our society. And we read about it every day, how people have more choices and more balance in their life. 
Figuring that out, we have a talented team that is leading us and that I really want to thank here and at this quarter and this first half of the year. And coming through the pandemic, it feels like, hopefully, there's an opportunity to be a real light even if we have a few more moments. This company is well positioned, and I just really feel that way. So thanks for giving us a chance to ask that question. Pass it to you, Jeff?"

It's, as Brian just mentioned, the strength of our pl",646,"Jessica. Thanks, Brian. So on the upfront, let me take it kind of in order, Jessica, of how you asked the question. So on the upfront, I think we've been -- I think we've talked about that in the past. It's, as Brian just mentioned, the strength of our platform, combined with Linda's -- Linda Yaccarino and her team's approach, one platform approach was the perfect way to approach this red-hot upfront. And as Brian said and Mike said, double-digit increases in both volume and pricing, and we'll see those results in the years ahead. And particularly happy with both the volume on Peacock and the CPMs on Peacock. So that, we could not have been more pleased with how we did in the upfront. 
As far as Peacock, I should mention that one of the things I didn't talk about is we concluded our Amazon and Samsung deals this quarter 2. There is a lot going on at NBC. We're now fully distributed for Peacock, and that's going to have benefits as we roll out all our additional content.
I would say that we look at where we are today, and being much further ahead than we expected to be at this point, we'll probably ramp up our investment modestly over what we've done in the past. But as I mentioned, we have so much content coming to Peacock that it doesn't have to be significant. 
I will say with Peacock and then segue to the Olympics, we're learning a lot as consumption happens on the Olympics here at day 6. And not to ruin anybody tuning in, but we have a big upset just happened in the last hour. And you should tune in and watch tonight on NBC to see that, but exciting U.S. team. And we're not -- we've had some bad luck. But if you look at the product, it's fantastic. And it really is impossible. And so what I would say is on Peacock, what we will learn in this Olympics, we will take to Beijing and change the product, change the offering in each Olympic out forward, and we're really excited about that. 
It's impossible to understate the importance of the Olympics to NBCUniversal. It's not really financially. It's more operationally across the company. We have 4,000 people literally working on it. Brian and I were in Tokyo. I came back and saw our team in Connecticut. You have people, this is their life work. You go from room to room. You have experts on surfing and volleyball and gymnastics. And it's a -- it is an operation that would be very difficult to replicate the talent and the experience that our team brings to it, and they show it every night in NBC. And then of course, the Olympics are the perfect property to show the strength of our platform across not only NBCUniversal, but Comcast and Xfinity and Sky.
So the Olympics, obviously, as you said, Jessica, we had a little bit of bad luck. There was a drumbeat of negativity. We got moved a year and no spectators. And that has resulted a little bit in linear ratings being probably less than we expected. But the flip side of that is the digital strength has kind of offset that. So when you look at what's happening with Peacock, that's directly related to the Olympics. 
So net-net, with all this bad luck, we're going to be profitable on the Olympics, which we're very happy with, and we're very happy with the product. And then if you watch every night, you'll see we use this as a firehouse to promote everything else we're doing at the company, not just across NBCUniversal but also Comcast. So the Olympics, I think we're very pleased with the Olympics and very proud of our team and got a ways to go here."

So -- and the reasons why that we're -- we continue to be excited, it is a terrific long-term platform, but it is helping broadband, as I mentioned earlier. So they were generating about $2 of incremental revenue just on the pay per view, the rev share side of things. And advertising opportunities will be above that.
So today, in terms of what we're doing within footprint, there are parts of what you mentioned. We absolutely include it as part of the broadband subscription. It's a key part now that with broadband, you get this great streaming platform. So we're doing that. 
We have -- if you're a traditional video customer, we have devices that enable full home, the X1 experience throughout. So we have that. But we are not bashful about letting our customers -- broadband customers, in particular, that really important streaming segment, know that this is included. 
Outside of footprint, we are -- we have syndication partners that we're working with, Cox, the Canadian companies. And we continue to explore ways of doing that. And we think that it's a terrific long-term platform to tie together uniquely. The way that we do with the voice remote, it gives full capability. We've been investing in X1. We can leverage that platform. 
So we do qualify. We ask the customer if they want it. And then we -- but we stay right on it and deliver a great service. And the feedback that we're getting and engagement is very strong.

Retail's back and -- but in addition to that, extremely focused on our call centers, the digital tools that optimize buy flows for mobile and how we go to market. It's -- that has been a huge change, just the fact that we lead with mobile is so key and mobile and broadband being a package. 
So those fundamentals have emerged and really an important part of our go-to-market strategy. We've invested in tools, not only for the customer but for our agents and how they sell mobile, just improving the experience for customers is really key. So -- and a lot of marketing investment around the mobile message. If you live in our footprint and you're watching this great Olympics coverage that Jeff and the team are doing, you can't miss the fact that we are really, really focused around the mobile business. So -- but I think that natural combination of broadband plus mobile will continue.
So the other big addition recently is clearly the Unlimited packages that we've rolled out, and that is adding to it. We've seen a nice shift in mix, and we continue to have By the Gig. But adding on Unlimited really closed and filled the gap that we had in our competitive portfolio. So now with great Unlimited pricing for multiline kind of families, and you can mix and match still between By the Gig and Unlimited, we're in a unique position in our footprint. 
So like our momentum, the 280,000 lines was just terrific and set a record for us. But we're continuing to stay focused, and we see that this is a real opportunity for us going forward. So on the auction side, I think the last part..."

We're going to think about it in terms of we want to keep a strong balance sheet. So I think, think of us as wanting to be comfortably in the range of ratios that would support the single A rating. We want to make sure we're investing behind our businesses, primarily organically, but occasionally, tuck-in acquisitions or all that. You see that in the normal course all the time in our business. 
And then capital return is the other leg of the stool. We've been -- this company has historically been very strong, and an important part of the priorities is to return capital. We've increased the dividend for 13-plus years running and 1 of the few companies that have had as strong a level of consistent dividend increase. And you look back between the time of the NBC deal and the Sky deal, the level of free cash flow that was returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends combined was incredibly strong. So I think we would continue to execute against that. 
The first half of the year -- I guess, the remainder of this year, think of us as continuing to be at the historical levels for now. We've got a level of working capital this year that we continue to expect will be higher than it was in 2019. That's mostly going to be hitting us in the second half of this year with Olympics and the ramping of content spend. But the dynamics of EBITDA growth and future prospects is as you described. So we'll take it a quarter at a time as -- and we'll talk more probably at the end of the year."

I'm really excited to report the strong second quarter results, which were highlighted by exceptional performance at Cable, delivering 11% revenue growth and a nearly 15% increase in adjusted EBITDA. This was fue",1601,"Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm really excited to report the strong second quarter results, which were highlighted by exceptional performance at Cable, delivering 11% revenue growth and a nearly 15% increase in adjusted EBITDA. This was fueled by our fantastic success in broadband. 
We added 354,000 broadband customers, an increase compared to both the same period last year and to 2019. And that drove 294,000 total customer relationship additions. These were the best broadband and customer relationship results we've had for any second quarter on record. 
Our broadband connect activity is healthy, and churn improved for the 14th quarter in a row. In fact, we hit the lowest second quarter churn rate in our company's history. Based on our first half results, combined with the strength we're seeing in current trends, we now expect total broadband net additions for 2021 to increase mid-teens relative to 2019. 
We also added 280,000 wireless subscriber lines, the highest of any quarter since launch. And Xfinity Mobile is now a stand-alone, profitable business. We got here on time, if not a bit earlier than expected. And we are experiencing the fastest sales momentum we've ever had, a testament to the changes we implemented in the back half of last year when we reprioritized wireless across our sales channels and integrated this business more fully into our core operations. And this past April, we introduced a fabulous Unlimited family plan, which we just started offering to our small business customers as well. 
So I couldn't be more pleased with Dave Watson and the team he has assembled as they have a relentless focus on connectivity, which has never been more important. They truly put the customer first, offering innovative and differentiated products and services. And pretty unique to the market, we now offer 1.2 gigs of downstream to essentially all 60 million homes and businesses in our footprint. 
The foundation of our success is our network, which we constantly evolve so that we can easily handle capacity growth, increase in subscribers and the changing usage patterns of our customers who continue to take faster speeds. Currently, there are typically 25 connected devices in the home, with 8 active at any one time, and this increases every year. That drives in-home Wi-Fi usage to 15x that of wireless. Delivering huge amount of data at consistent speeds and reducing latency is what's powering our growth. And we're doing this in a cost-efficient way.
Virtualizing our network, combined with our suite of digital tools, also allows us to continue to improve the customer experience while identifying additional cost savings. And the progress we've made is evident in our results. During the second quarter, total agent calls decreased by 10%, and total interactions were down by 7%. We also saw a 22% reduction in truck rolls, despite an over 5% increase in our customer base. 
So as I look ahead, I think about our philosophy since the early days of broadband, which has been to bet on a never-ending cycle of new technologies, devices and applications that come from Silicon Valley and new start-ups everywhere that need to take advantage of greater speeds and capacity over time. We see this transformation happening every day and continue to believe that this is ongoing for the foreseeable future.
So what does that mean for our network? Well, since October of 2020, we've been trialing gig and multi-gig symmetrical speeds over our DOCSIS infrastructure to great success. With upstream comprising today less than 10% of total broadband usage, even during a peak, we don't really have a consumer use case for this technology capability yet. But the strategy for our network is to plan ahead. We're investing in architecture that lets us go beyond where consumers are, and we can do all of this in a way that won't affect the capital intensity ratios we currently enjoy. Dave can provide more detail about the technological decisions we're making during the Q&A. 
With Cable comprising roughly 70% of our consolidated EBITDA, broadband is a top strategic priority. And I could not be more pleased with the strength of this quarter and the first half of 2021. 
Looking at other parts of our business. For the first time since the pandemic, our Theme Parks returned nicely to profitability. This was led by Orlando, where we've seen strong domestic demand in both per cap spending and in attendance, which returned to 2019 levels, somewhat faster than I thought might happen, despite virtually no international visitation. 
And in Hollywood, since restrictions have been lifted, attendance is growing week after week. We continue to see firsthand, the pent-up demand for high-quality entertainment and family fun outside of the home. And we remain incredibly bullish on our Theme Parks. 
Our Studios business is also coming back. We've returned to prepandemic television production levels, and we're really optimistic about our upcoming films, especially after the success of Fast 9, which debuted at #1 in all territories at launch, and with $600 million of worldwide box office to date, remains the biggest U.S. film launch since the pandemic began. Following Fast, we successfully released Boss Baby 2 and the latest installment of Purge. And over the July 4 weekend, we had the top 3 films at the domestic box office, the first time that's happened for any studio since 1995. We have a great slate ahead with Dear Evan Hansen in September, followed by a new Halloween in October. And we end the year with Sing 2. 
Next, let's talk about our media and production strategy, which across the entire company, is aligned around one purpose: create premium programming which we can then scale and monetize for the very best global distribution outlets. Peacock adds to what we already offer. It's a great complement to our linear brands, which are successful in their own right. And together, these platforms provide a continuous loop of content and promotion that seamlessly drive viewership across our ecosystem, offering a different access point to attract new audiences while giving existing viewers more of what they love.
We are clearly capitalizing on the strength of our media brands, having just completed the strongest advertising upfront in our history, securing double-digit increases in both volume and price across our entire portfolio. And I'm pleased to report that as of this week, Peacock has 54 million sign-ups and over 20 million monthly active accounts. This is 50% higher than our last report, driven by a number of factors: the Day and Date release of Boss Baby 2; debut of Dr. Death, our most successful original to date; and the airing of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. 
The third quarter, thus far, has been a particularly strong period, and we will work hard to manage retention and grow from here, recognizing we are unlikely to replicate such tremendous performance. But we remain optimistic with a lot of programming strength ahead of us, such as more premium originals; Monday Night Football; the Beijing Olympics; and our reimagined dynamic Pay-One window, which starting in 2022, shifts our film titles to Peacock exclusively for the first and last 4-month segments in the Pay window, with Amazon Prime and Netflix sharing rights for the 10 months in between. 
By showcasing content across multiple platforms, Universal films will constantly refresh across the streaming ecosystem. Audiences will have multiple access points with which to consume our content, and we will generate more third-party revenue while retaining the most valuable window for Peacock. So as you can see, we've successfully been able to pivot, coming up with creative ways to keep up with consumer demand and in many cases, making even more money than we did before. 
At Sky, we are pleased revenue is back to pre-COVID levels, despite the lingering impact that COVID continues to have on our pubs and clubs segment. Sky's results were led by the U.K. with revenue and EBITDA ahead of 2019, and we're seeing momentum across a number of areas. Premium TV churn is at record low levels. In streaming, we posted ARPU growth of over 20% for the fourth consecutive quarter. And in broadband, where we just introduced our 500-meg offering, we experienced improved churn relative to both 2020 and 2019 despite a 6% price increase in the quarter. In addition, Sky Mobile had the strongest second quarter activations on record with churn averaging 40% better than industry average. 
And today, we're announcing the debut of our international streaming strategy for Peacock. Later this year, we will leverage Sky's significant scale and powerful brand to include Peacock at no additional cost for its 20 million customers across Europe. The benefits of this launch are tremendous. We will unlock incremental advertising revenue, introduce the Peacock brand and content catalog via Sky's established platforms in key European markets and directly monetize our programming investments.
The decision to make Peacock the anchor tenant on Xfinity's X1 and Flex platforms for its domestic launch has been a key driver of brand awareness, scale, consumption and promotion, and we see a similar opportunity with Sky. We're utilizing all the wonderful assets of our company to create value for audiences everywhere, and we look forward to finalizing agreements with other programming and distribution partners outside of our Sky markets. 
So summing up, this was a fabulous quarter and a great first half of the year. I'm so pleased we are now in a position to buy back stock, which we will report on in Mike's section. This is a truly very special company, and I'm excited for the road ahead. 
Mike, over to you."
173341,1671479226,2355809,"Comcast Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our second quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 20% to $28.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to $8.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 22% to $0.84 per share. And f",1945,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our second quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 20% to $28.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to $8.9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 22% to $0.84 per share. And finally, we generated $4.8 billion of free cash flow. 
Now let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable revenue increased 11% to $16 billion, EBITDA increased nearly 15% to $7.1 billion and net cash flow grew close to 15% to $5 billion. As a reminder, last year's second quarter was most significantly impacted by COVID-19, including adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees. Excluding the impact of these RSN adjustments, Cable Communications revenue increased 9.3% with no corresponding impact to EBITDA.
We added 294,000 net new customer relationships, up 35% over last year's second quarter and up 93% over the second quarter of 2019. This was the best second quarter on record and was driven by broadband, where we added 354,000 net new residential and business customers, up 10% over last year's second quarter and 69% above the second quarter of 2019. These strong results were driven by improved churn and healthy connects relative to both 2020 and 2019. And this was the lowest second quarter broadband churn on record. Looking ahead, as Brian mentioned earlier, based on our strong results through the first half of the year as well as current trends, we now expect total broadband net additions for 2021 to be up mid-teens from the 1.4 million net adds in 2019. 
Broadband revenue increased 14% and grew 13%, excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's second quarter. These results were driven by strong growth in volume and rates. Wireless revenue grew 70% due to an increase in both customer lines and higher device sales. We added 280,000 net new lines in the quarter, the best result since launching this business in 2017, bringing us to 3.4 million total lines as of quarter end. We are encouraged by the initial results on our new Unlimited plan, which is driving a notable increase in Unlimited connects as well as a lift in overall volume. 
Turning to video. Revenue increased 2.6% or 0.5%, excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's second quarter, reflecting healthy growth in rates, mostly offset by net video subscriber losses totaling 399,000. While our residential rate adjustment at the beginning of the year was the primary driver of the increase in rates, we believe it was also a contributor to the video subscriber loss in the quarter. 
Business services revenue increased 10%, primarily driven by higher rates though the comparison to last year when business services was significantly impacted by COVID-19. Over the past year, we have bounced back, rates have recovered and customer growth is strong as we added 17,000 net new customers in the quarter and 70,000 over the past year, primarily driven by continued improvement in small business. 
Last, advertising revenue increased 59%, reflecting an overall market recovery compared to last year when we experienced reduced spending from advertisers due to COVID-19. As we move to the second half of the year, we will have difficult comparisons to last year when we benefited from strong political advertising.
Turning to expenses. Cable Communications second quarter expenses increased 8.2%. Programming expenses increased 12% and were up 5%, excluding the impact of RSN adjustments last year, primarily due to the number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020, combined with annual escalators in existing agreements. Looking to the third quarter, we expect programming expense growth to increase at high single-digit levels due to the continued impact of contract renewals as well as the comparison to last year's third quarter, which was also favorably impacted by RSN fee adjustments. For the full year, we continue to expect programming expense to increase at high single-digit levels.
Nonprogramming expenses increased 5.7% or 0.5% on a per relationship basis due to higher technical and product support and advertising, marketing and promotion spend to drive growth in our core broadband and wireless businesses. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower bad debt expense. These trends should continue in the third quarter. 
Cable Communications EBITDA grew nearly 15% to $7.1 billion, including a contribution of $68 million from our wireless business, the best results since launch. Cable EBITDA margins reached 44.2%, reflecting 140 basis points of year-over-year improvement. While the RSN fee adjustments had no impact on EBITDA, they did impact margins last year. Excluding the RSN adjustment impact, margins expanded 200 basis points year-over-year. Cable capital expenditures increased 17%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 10.6%, up 50 basis points compared to last year. These results were driven by an increase in scalable infrastructure as we continue to enhance the capacity of our network as well as increases in broadband-related CPE and line extensions. 
As Brian mentioned, we have decided to move a bit faster to the next phase of DOCSIS using very cost-effective technology, allowing us to maintain the CapEx intensity level we achieved in 2020, which was the lowest in our history. And we expect to be at this level for the next few years. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Let's start with total NBCUniversal results. Revenue increased 39% to $8 billion, and EBITDA increased 13%, $1.6 billion. Media revenue increased 26%, driven by higher advertising, distribution and other revenue. Advertising revenue increased 33%, reflecting the timing of sports and overall market recovery compared to last year and the launch of Peacock. We had significantly more sporting events compared to last year when sports were paused, which benefited our advertising revenue. Excluding this benefit, advertising grew at mid-teens levels.
Distribution revenue increased 19% or high single digits, excluding the RSN fee adjustments that impacted last year's results. This growth reflects higher rates post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020, partially offset by subscriber declines, which were sequentially flat.
Media EBITDA declined 16% to $1.4 billion, including Peacock, which generated revenue of $122 million and an EBITDA loss of $363 million. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA was essentially flat, driven by higher sports costs associated with the increase in sporting events this quarter compared to both last year and 2019. As a reminder, our third quarter Media results will be impacted by our broadcast of the Summer Olympics. 
Studio revenue increased 8.4%, driven by higher theatrical revenue, reflecting the success of Fast 9 in theaters and compared to last year when theaters were mainly closed due to COVID-19. Studio EBITDA decreased 52% to $156 million as a result of higher expenses associated with our theatrical releases compared to last year when releases were paused, the timing of content licensing sales and the comparison to last year, which included transactions with Peacock related to our initial launch of the service. In the second half, EBITDA comparisons to last year will remain challenging as we continue to launch new theatrical releases and ramp our TV production. 
Theme Parks revenue increased by $958 million to $1.1 billion and generated EBITDA of $221 million, which included about $150 million of Universal Beijing preopening costs. This is the first profitable quarter we've had since the pandemic began in the first quarter of 2020 and was driven by strong results at our Universal Orlando Resort. Orlando has had exceptionally strong demand, with June attendance exceeding 2019 levels as well as strong per cap growth, despite virtually no international guests during the quarter due to COVID-related travel constraints. We opened our Jurassic World-themed roller coaster, the VelociCoaster, on June 10 with some of the highest guest satisfaction scores we've had. 
Hollywood has been operating without capacity restriction since mid-June and has experienced strong demand, aided by the opening of our Secret Life of Pets attraction in April. We're optimistic that our domestic parks are on a path to return to historic levels of profitability, but we need international visitation to resume, which remains dependent on COVID-related travel restrictions being lifted.
At our Japan park, results continue to be challenging. After closing in late April, we reopened on June 1 with capacity restrictions that are likely to remain in place through the summer. Last, as we prepare to open our newest park, Universal Beijing, we expect overall results will be negatively impacted by up to $250 million in the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I will speak to on a constant currency basis. For the second quarter, Sky revenue increased 15% to $5.2 billion, largely reflecting strong growth in our U.K. business. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 7.7%, primarily reflecting higher average revenue per customer relationship. Results in the U.K. drove the bulk of the growth and benefited from the comparison to last year when sports subscriptions were paused as well as a rate increase, higher mobile device sales and improving hospitality revenue as pubs and clubs reopen. 
While customer relationships grew in the U.K., overall customer relationships declined 248,000, primarily driven by customer losses in Italy and Germany to the end of the football season. As we have previously said, we have reset our football rights in Germany and Italy. As a result, we anticipate lower programming and production expense, along with continued customer losses in the third and fourth quarters. We believe this disciplined approach to sports-related cost is the right long-term financial decision for the business. 
Advertising revenue increased 79% with results in the U.K. driving the growth and reflecting the overall market recovery from COVID-19 as well as an increase in the number of sporting events compared to last year when sports were paused. Sky generated $560 million in EBITDA, a 32% decline compared to last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting higher sports rights amortization related to more events in the current quarter. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower entertainment costs due to production delays.
I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. The Free cash flow was $4.8 billion in the quarter, a decrease of 20% year-over-year, largely due to the timing of last year's federal tax payments, which were deferred to the third quarter. While net working capital was a positive contribution to free cash flow in the quarter, we continue to expect it will be a negative drag on our full year results and higher compared to 2019 levels due to an increase in content investments and our broadcast of the Olympics. 
Consolidated total capital, which includes capital expenditures as well as software and intangibles, increased 5.2% in the second quarter to $2.8 billion, reflecting an increase at Cable, which was partially offset by a decline at NBCU. For the full year, we now expect capital to be slightly above 2020 levels, reflecting our plan, as I've previously mentioned, to accelerate enhancements to our network. 
In the second quarter, our return of capital to shareholders included dividend payments totaling $1.2 billion, up 9.5% year-over-year. We also resumed our share repurchase activity late in the second quarter, totaling $500 million as of June 30. As previously communicated, we intend to stay at historical buyback levels until we reach our intended target leverage levels, which we currently expect to reach sometime in 2022. With our return to share repurchase in the quarter, we are happy to get back to our long-standing balanced approach to capital allocation, which consists of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for profitable growth and returning capital to shareholders. 
Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call."

How do we think -- I know you gave the 3Q sort of onetime item for Beijing. As we get to 4Q, are the Beijing losses done? Is it an easy comp next year? How should we think about profitability overall? 
Dave, can you unpack the margin expansion for us in the quarter? It looks like advertising and wireless probably drove all of the margin expansion. When I think about the last few years, you've got a lot of margin expansion from leveraging nonprogramming costs. Was there just unusual year-over-year comps within the Cable business relative to 2Q of last year that expires over the next couple of quarters, and you get back to sort of normal margin expansion on nonprogramming line? Or is there other investments you're making that we should consider?"

So on the parks, we're very -- first of all, I would start by saying we're very pleased with not just the quarter, but the trajectory of how we're opening. As Mike went through, Orlando is, on attendance standpoint, pretty close to back where we were in 2019 even though we don't have any international visitors. And you would expect those international visitors to pick up over time in Hollywood. We've only been open a couple of months, and we're already approaching our capacity. And we're excited about the next couple of months and Halloween Horror Nights.
So the domestic parks, obviously, with COVID, you just don't know. It's -- things could be lumpy. Things could be nonlinear. But so far, the trajectory is really good, and we expect that to continue. And I would say the thing we're most pleased with is the protocols have worked, and we've been able to keep people safe and keep our workers safe and keep our guests safe. And that, I think, is driving the confidence in coming to our parks. 
Internationally, Brian and I actually were in Japan. And even though that country is a little bit behind as far as COVID, we've been able to get our park back open. We're open again with some capacity constraints. We have a great attraction there that we were able to see, Nintendo, which is one of our best attractions that we've ever built anywhere in the world that rivals Harry Potter. And I'm very excited for that, not only in Japan, but for Epic Universe down the road and our other parks eventually. So Japan is behind, but feels like it's heading in the right direction. And so that's going to be great. 
And then lastly, with Beijing, we're ready to go in Beijing. The park's ready. It's awesome. It's our most technologically advanced park. And we expect -- right now, what we're doing is going through the final approvals of rides and the process you have to go through. And that is somewhat indeterminate, but we expect that park to open in the next couple of months. And when it does open, as you mentioned, those pre-operating costs go away, and we start getting attendance in. So Beijing should be a good contributor to us remainder of the year when it opens and then on to next year. So overall, our Parks are on a good trajectory, and it's hard to see what happens with COVID, but we're pretty pleased. Dave?"

So we'd walked through a couple of things on margin in the quarter and looking forward. It's -- we feel very good about our position on the progress that we continue to make on margin improvement, real focus around the fundamentals. And so while there'll be some things within a quarter that move a little bit, the fundamentals are the things that we stay extremely focused on. And starts with broadband. And both residential and commercial, both are -- just drive higher revenue. Both are margin accretive and just help us deploy digital solutions, in particular, in residential at a higher rate. So those fundamentals are -- continue to bring us to where we're at. 
As we scale mobile, as you said, there are improvements there, advertising as well with advanced advertising providing support. But it's primarily the focus around connectivity and just driving more customer relationships there in that space, connected with the digital customer experience improvements, is such a win-win for the customer and for us. 
Just to provide perspective in the quarter, our total agent calls decreased by 10% with total interactions lower at 7%, and we saw a 22% reduction in truck rolls. And this is despite an overall 5% increase in the customer base. So if you go back over time, this is just a continuation. Over the past 5 years, we've constantly made progress, taking 37% or almost 100 million calls out of the run rate and reduced truck rolls by 25%. 
So Doug, it's been -- this is a real focus for us. And while I don't think we'll grow the second half of the year margins at the same rate that we did the first half, we're in a really good place. And we're doing it in a healthy and sustainable way. And so I like the road map that we have around digital tools and the experience. I like the run rate around connectivity. And while we'll invest in areas like business services, in mobile, sales and marketing, the things that are just going to help us grow, we're going to continue to stay extremely focused on margin."

And I think like it continues to be a tailwind year-on-year. Do you have a sense of what sort of normal looks like as you think about OpEx? I mean you guys just sounded quite bullish on margins going forward. But there is some concern that as activity normalizes, that some costs come back in the business. I'm wondering if you could just tackle that. 
And the same thing for you, Dave. I mean churn, it sounds like it keeps coming down. Do we go back to normal churn from pre-COVID or not? I don't know if you have any sense of that when you look at different geographies in your footprint, if you can glean anything there. 
And then, Brian, I'm sure you know there's been lots of press articles on Comcast buying lots of different businesses. And I'm wondering, now that you've laid out at least some of your Peacock international strategy, all these articles seem to assume that you don't have enough scale in NBC to achieve your strategic goals around streaming. And I know you can't talk about M&A, but I wonder if you could just talk about whether you believe NBC has what it needs to do, what the company wanted to do on the streaming front globally."

I think giving a feel for what the second half looks like is the best I'll do at this stage. I think we are -- continue to do all of the things in the underlying business, move the business towards more digital sort of cleaner operations that are low cost. The move to the higher-margin products in broadband, business services, all the things Dave described are things we'll work on that will benefit us regardless, I think, of what the operating environment normalizes at. But I think that's the best sense for the second half of the year. 
And I'll let Dave comment on churn, but it's a little bit of the same message, which is we'll see what normal looks like. But I think the investments in products, the investment in network, the investments in Flex, wireless, you name it, all the things that we're doing I think are -- there is at least some element of sustained benefit to churn versus historical levels, at least in my mind.

Yes, so we expect, over time, to have a little bit more normalization as you go into quarters like Q2, like Q3 with student activity, move activity, seasonality that could impact the churn. But we're reaching a level that we expected in terms of overall broadband churn performance. And this is -- it's the redefinition of great broadband, I think, that's helping deliver this -- some of this churn improvement. 
We have a fantastic network. We talked about it. Brian and Mike mentioned it. Continuing to invest in the network. We're going to stay ahead of the curve in terms of capacity, in usage. So a lot of focus around the network. 
And then just to complement not just speed, but our devices, the pods, the ability to provide great Wi-Fi coverage inside the home is just so critical. And staying ahead of that curve is key. And then adding value extensions to broadband, like Mobile, like Flex that impact churn. And so these are early days for us in terms of as we -- both of those categories are exciting for us, but they're impacting broadband in a positive way. 
So can't give specific guidance in terms of where churn would go. But the fundamentals of -- and the focus around attracting healthy and keeping healthy customer relationships and connectivity is so key. So we're very excited about the prospects of Mobile and Flex impacting that over time."

It's an exceptional quarter. And I believe we have much more organic growth ahead. And we have a very special, unique company, across distribution and content, working so well together. And you see that with Peacock and Sky and Peacock and Xfinity and even in our Olympics advertising. And we like -- and we are investing behind the businesses. So I don't think -- I think Mike Cavanagh has been very blunt that we don't need M&A. We have a majority broadband-centric company, and we like the mix. 
So what might that drive us to consider at least, which is any kind of partnership where we have unique special capabilities that could lead in -- globally or internationally to enhancing our streaming position. That's something you might talk to others and consider. 
But as to your scale question, I really think it would -- we have all the parts. And Jeff, why don't you comment on that in just a second and maybe with some more specifics. But if you look at the results of Peacock this quarter, again, we're probably -- we're the fastest-growing streaming service, 50% in 90 days. We have a brand that's only a year old, and it's either the #1 or #2 new brand in America that's been created. So I really think our corporate focus is, as we've said many times, was to get back in balance on capital returns.
I'm probably most pleased this quarter that we were able to get to that place, buy back stock, as Mike just talked about. So I do think we have the scale. I think we have an amazing company, and I feel fortunate with our position. 
Jeff, why don't you talk a little more about the scale?"
173341,1671479226,2355809,"Comcast Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Brian.

Ben, when you talk about scale with respect to streaming and Peacock, just to get more granular for a second, there really are 3 elements of the scale. One is the scale of the platform technologically. And as Brian just mentioned, we launched on the back of the Sky platform. And we've leveraged our Xfinity and Dave's team significantly. So I think we have proved that we would have never launched -- this success technologically with a platform that looks great and works without the scale that we have already at the company. There is scale with respect to the brand, and that's why I'm thrilled with today's announcement that Peacock is going to be in 20 million Sky homes, and eventually, we'll roll it out across the globe. 
Then the most important by far element of scale as far as streaming is content. And we are really at the beginning of our content rollout on Peacock. That's why this quarter's growth is really extraordinary. Because this quarter, as Brian went through, we had a pretty good movie with Boss Baby 2. We had our first real good drama with Dr. Death. And we had -- and we have obviously rolled into the Olympics here where we're halfway through the first week of the Olympics.
Looking forward, we -- as part of our plan, we have another Olympics. We have lots of original programming, which Mike mentioned. We're ramping our production right now on. And we'll be rolling out over the next year. Brian mentioned our movies. We have the -- what I think is one of the top studios in Hollywood, and we have lots of movies coming directly to Peacock. And eventually, we're going to have the Hulu content coming back. 
So we have plenty of content coming. And this quarter showed that when you put that content on a service that's good, you can actually get pretty good growth in the streaming world. And so personally, I don't think we've ever lacked for the capital to do what we needed to do to grow our business. 
And what I'll end with is a perfect example that happened in the last week was we, at Universal, acquired the rights to the next 3 Exorcist movies in a pretty unique deal that was done in tandem with Peacock. We wouldn't have been able to do it if we didn't have a streaming service. Where we basically got the rights on the back of the strength of our studio where we have Jason Blum and a horror pedigree that's unmatched and Donna Langley and her team's ability to market movies. But because we did it with Peacock, we have full optionality going forward. Do we put the second and third movies direct on Peacock? Do we do something hybrid? We can really kind of adapt and be flexible based on how the market works. 
So we have the scale across our company to do things like that. And I don't think we're lacking for scale personally. I think we can achieve our success at Peacock without anything additional, and I think this quarter proved it."

So sitting here today, what do you think the biggest ongoing benefits will be from all the changes that have been implemented? And then what are your key longer-term goals from here? You've talked about the near-term goals. 
And then Jeff, I don't even know where to start because there's so much going on at NBCU. But can you give us a little more color on the upfront and the cost platform benefits? And maybe to drill down a little bit into Peacock, what should we be -- expect in the next year or so in terms of incremental cost for the international rollout as well as increased content? And then finally, you said in the past that you expect this Olympics to be the most profitable, but you've been hit with a little bit of bad luck, I mean, in terms of COVID getting a little bit worse and stuff going on with the athletes. Do you still have that view? Like how do you think about this Olympics or the next one in terms of profitability?"

It's been an extraordinary year. I'm really proud of the company, first of all, on some of our initiatives, our commitment of $1 billion over 10 years to close the digital divide and have broadband be accessible and affordable for many more people. And so I guess I'd start by saying the momentum, it's on us to keep this fabulous execution. Dave talked a lot about that focus. 
I think what kind of gets lost perhaps a little bit in broadband is not just the consumer broadband, which clearly, record second quarter. Now saying again that this year, we expect mid-teens growth from 2019. I did not expect that 6 months ago. 
So how do we keep that momentum and build on it, that comes down to great products and the network and a team and a management team. We've made a lot of changes. We've had some retirements and other things and the backfilling and moving executives, promoting executives. All that has put our team in an excellent place. We've learned how to work in a hybrid manner. And whatever comes next, I don't think this team will miss a beat. And so I thank them for their focus. 
But as I think about broadband, we really don't talk about business services enough to have a $9 billion business from 0, built literally with 0 market share and growing only 1 direction and keep expanding the definition of that market from small, to medium, to now really enterprise. And every couple of weeks, I get an e-mail that talks about some major account that we've just won for the first time, and it could lead to way more volume over time. So Bill Stemper, who has run that business really since inception and has done an exceptional job. And we're trying to do that now at Sky and expand that market. 
And then, we've talked a little bit about wireless and mobile. And we've really pivoted to being a strategic opportunity with fantastic customer satisfaction ratings, a great relationship with Verizon that enables us now to compete and compete well and to innovate and so on and on. I think keeping our focus there. 
So in the longer term, I think we have an opportunity to see the vital trend of direct-to-consumer, digitization, computing power evolving our -- the way we live, how relevant will our company remain and be and help lead that change. And I look at the tech company results, and you just see this trend accelerating. 
So what are some of the takeaways? Well, first of all, being an enabler and a critical opportunity to innovate our network to help be as relevant in the future as we are today is job one. I think digital advertising. We saw some of the results from the tech companies, and we look at our own, creating more inventory. So the strategy for Peacock for me feels really smart. We're creating more digital inventory. That's the Holy Grail of ads. That's why we're able to get a premium, and Jeff can talk about Olympics a bit. But in the big picture, we're reimagining how people consume. And that consumption is enabled by broadband and now enabled by Peacock and hope to do that in a more significant way. 
And then retaining talent and being a company where people want to work, but at all levels of the company. And that's being reimagined in our society. And we read about it every day, how people have more choices and more balance in their life. 
Figuring that out, we have a talented team that is leading us and that I really want to thank here and at this quarter and this first half of the year. And coming through the pandemic, it feels like, hopefully, there's an opportunity to be a real light even if we have a few more moments. This company is well positioned, and I just really feel that way. So thanks for giving us a chance to ask that question. Pass it to you, Jeff?"

So on the upfront, I think we've been -- I think we've talked about that in the past. It's, as Brian just mentioned, the strength of our platform, combined with Linda's -- Linda Yaccarino and her team's approach, one platform approach was the perfect way to approach this red-hot upfront. And as Brian said and Mike said, double-digit increases in both volume and pricing, and we'll see those results in the years ahead. And particularly happy with both the volume on Peacock and the CPMs on Peacock. So that, we could not have been more pleased with how we did in the upfront. 
As far as Peacock, I should mention that one of the things I didn't talk about is we concluded our Amazon and Samsung deals this quarter 2. There is a lot going on at NBC. We're now fully distributed for Peacock, and that's going to have benefits as we roll out all our additional content.
I would say that we look at where we are today, and being much further ahead than we expected to be at this point, we'll probably ramp up our investment modestly over what we've done in the past. But as I mentioned, we have so much content coming to Peacock that it doesn't have to be significant. 
I will say with Peacock and then segue to the Olympics, we're learning a lot as consumption happens on the Olympics here at day 6. And not to ruin anybody tuning in, but we have a big upset just happened in the last hour. And you should tune in and watch tonight on NBC to see that, but exciting U.S. team. And we're not -- we've had some bad luck. But if you look at the product, it's fantastic. And it really is impossible. And so what I would say is on Peacock, what we will learn in this Olympics, we will take to Beijing and change the product, change the offering in each Olympic out forward, and we're really excited about that. 
It's impossible to understate the importance of the Olympics to NBCUniversal. It's not really financially. It's more operationally across the company. We have 4,000 people literally working on it. Brian and I were in Tokyo. I came back and saw our team in Connecticut. You have people, this is their life work. You go from room to room. You have experts on surfing and volleyball and gymnastics. And it's a -- it is an operation that would be very difficult to replicate the talent and the experience that our team brings to it, and they show it every night in NBC. And then of course, the Olympics are the perfect property to show the strength of our platform across not only NBCUniversal, but Comcast and Xfinity and Sky.
So the Olympics, obviously, as you said, Jessica, we had a little bit of bad luck. There was a drumbeat of negativity. We got moved a year and no spectators. And that has resulted a little bit in linear ratings being probably less than we expected. But the flip side of that is the digital strength has kind of offset that. So when you look at what's happening with Peacock, that's directly related to the Olympics. 
So net-net, with all this bad luck, we're going to be profitable on the Olympics, which we're very happy with, and we're very happy with the product. And then if you watch every night, you'll see we use this as a firehouse to promote everything else we're doing at the company, not just across NBCUniversal but also Comcast. So the Olympics, I think we're very pleased with the Olympics and very proud of our team and got a ways to go here."

So they were generating about $2 of incremental revenue just on the pay per view, the rev share side of things. And advertising opportunities will be above that.
So today, in terms of what we're doing within footprint, there are parts of what you mentioned. We absolutely include it as part of the broadband subscription. It's a key part now that with broadband, you get this great streaming platform. So we're doing that. 
We have -- if you're a traditional video customer, we have devices that enable full home, the X1 experience throughout. So we have that. But we are not bashful about letting our customers -- broadband customers, in particular, that really important streaming segment, know that this is included. 
Outside of footprint, we are -- we have syndication partners that we're working with, Cox, the Canadian companies. And we continue to explore ways of doing that. And we think that it's a terrific long-term platform to tie together uniquely. The way that we do with the voice remote, it gives full capability. We've been investing in X1. We can leverage that platform. 
So we do qualify. We ask the customer if they want it. And then we -- but we stay right on it and deliver a great service. And the feedback that we're getting and engagement is very strong.

Retail's back and -- but in addition to that, extremely focused on our call centers, the digital tools that optimize buy flows for mobile and how we go to market. It's -- that has been a huge change, just the fact that we lead with mobile is so key and mobile and broadband being a package. 
So those fundamentals have emerged and really an important part of our go-to-market strategy. We've invested in tools, not only for the customer but for our agents and how they sell mobile, just improving the experience for customers is really key. So -- and a lot of marketing investment around the mobile message. If you live in our footprint and you're watching this great Olympics coverage that Jeff and the team are doing, you can't miss the fact that we are really, really focused around the mobile business. So -- but I think that natural combination of broadband plus mobile will continue.
So the other big addition recently is clearly the Unlimited packages that we've rolled out, and that is adding to it. We've seen a nice shift in mix, and we continue to have By the Gig. But adding on Unlimited really closed and filled the gap that we had in our competitive portfolio. So now with great Unlimited pricing for multiline kind of families, and you can mix and match still between By the Gig and Unlimited, we're in a unique position in our footprint.

But it would seem like there's a lot of optionality there and room for a pretty significant increase in cash returns to shareholders."

We're happy that we're back in balance, starting to get the buyback going again. I think the way we'll look at it over time is not in terms of is there a dollar number. We're going to think about it in terms of we want to keep a strong balance sheet. So I think, think of us as wanting to be comfortably in the range of ratios that would support the single A rating. We want to make sure we're investing behind our businesses, primarily organically, but occasionally, tuck-in acquisitions or all that. You see that in the normal course all the time in our business. 
And then capital return is the other leg of the stool. We've been -- this company has historically been very strong, and an important part of the priorities is to return capital. We've increased the dividend for 13-plus years running and 1 of the few companies that have had as strong a level of consistent dividend increase. And you look back between the time of the NBC deal and the Sky deal, the level of free cash flow that was returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends combined was incredibly strong. So I think we would continue to execute against that. 
The first half of the year -- I guess, the remainder of this year, think of us as continuing to be at the historical levels for now. We've got a level of working capital this year that we continue to expect will be higher than it was in 2019. That's mostly going to be hitting us in the second half of this year with Olympics and the ramping of content spend. But the dynamics of EBITDA growth and future prospects is as you described. So we'll take it a quarter at a time as -- and we'll talk more probably at the end of the year."

We had a wonderful third quarter across the entire company with 18% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 34% growth in adjusted EPS, and we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow. 
One of our goals in the past several years has been to return to a position of offensively investing in our existing businesses, paying a growing dividend and also buying back meaningful amounts of stock. So I'm pleased to report that we have now achieved all of that in this quarter, and we are back to our desired leverage ratios. 
Our Cable division continues to be a standout, delivering over 7% revenue growth and the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit EBITDA growth of 10% fueled by our broadband business, which generated 300,000 net additions and contributed to a very healthy 255,000 net new customer relationships. Business services has emerged from the pandemic and was also a key driver of our results. And we believe this momentum will continue. 
Our success comes from our network advantage, innovative products and world-class operational capabilities, which enable us to provide an unparalleled experience. Just like in residential, we are proactively responding to the needs of our commercial customers and offering personalized solutions. 
While small business has led our growth for the last decade, we are still significantly underpenetrated in the mid-market and enterprise segments. We see a lot of potential to take share in our large addressable market, which just got even bigger post our recent acquisition of Masergy, which builds on our strong offering of technology solutions. Masergy has become a leading provider to companies worldwide and unlocks a customer segment that we don't have today, particularly U.S.-based organizations with multi-site global operations. 
Xfinity Mobile exceeded its prior record, adding 285,000 lines, the most in any quarter since launch. And we continue to evaluate ways we can accelerate this business even further as wireline and wireless connectivity services continue to converge. 
We are looking at new exciting products and packaging that highlight how we're able to provide our customers with the best and most reliable broadband wherever they are or wherever they go and help them save money at the same time. And with only 6% penetration of our 32 million broadband customers, we have a long runway. 
Taking all of this together, we have an incredibly robust broadband business, and we've been adding over 1 million broadband customers each year for the past 20-plus years. And we continue to deepen these relationships by offering a fantastic and differentiated in-home experience with the fastest modem and gateway and the greatest WiFi coverage. We plan to continue our relentless focus on aggressively developing and improving our suite of products around connectivity. 
The foundation of all of this is our network. And we are currently in the process of deploying new technology, updating key infrastructure and accelerating virtualization across our footprint so that we can deliver even further enhancements fast and at scale to millions of customers. And we will continue to evaluate every opportunity we have to expand our passings, which will bring our amazing suite of products and services to many new homes and businesses. 
All of Dave Watson and his team's superb execution is around decades of investment that has led to constant new product innovation, including this month's launch of XClass TV, an extension of our leadership in video aggregation. XClass is an innovative smart television powered by our global technology platform that brings the best of our company's entertainment operating system to consumers nationwide together with the option to use either Xfinity, Charter or other entertainment apps. 
At NBCUniversal, we continue to see great progress in each of our businesses, but I'd like to highlight our theme parks, especially Orlando, which just reported the most profitable quarter in its history despite having virtually no international guests due to COVID-related travel restraints. 
In Hollywood, we continue to see recovery, and we had a very successful and exciting opening of Universal Beijing Resort on September 20. I also look forward to COVID-related restrictions easing in Osaka, which could happen soon. 
Our Media business is also doing very well. We're benefiting from the many changes Jeff Shell and his team implemented starting in 2020 with new hires, different roles, fresh content and a more efficient operating structure. We're seeing the financial success in both our linear networks as well as Peacock, which has maintained its momentum. We have a new breakout hit with La Brea, which has been a contributor to NBC's overall audience lead this primetime season as well as the best-performing new show on Peacock. 
Sunday Night Football has returned with great momentum, which we're seeing across our platforms. And we're thrilled with the performance of our second Halloween installment, which generated more revenue in its opening weekend at the domestic box office than any other film this year with a day and date streaming release and is the one nonlive event premier in Peacock's history. 
We're also looking forward to extending our streaming platforms outside of the U.S. with Peacock launching on Sky next month and Sky Showtime in the works for mid-2022. At Sky, I want to reemphasize how well we're performing in the U.K., which continues its growth trajectory and customer relationships led by record low churn. 
We're also seeing great momentum in our broadband and mobile businesses. Earlier this month, Dana Strong and her team introduced Sky Glass in London, a premium all-in-one streaming television and multichannel subscription package that is so much more than just a stunning TV with amazing sound. It's an innovation platform that opens up a whole new world of entertainment for our customers and simplifies the experience so they can stream every channel, every show and every app in one easy-to-use interface. And already, the customer response has very much exceeded our initial expectations. 
We're also incredibly proud that Sky Glass is the first TV to be certified carbon neutral. Sky has been leading all of Comcast with its sustainability goals and is the first media company in the U.K. to commit to being net carbon zero by 2030. 
While Glass and XClass are distinct products with different monetization and distribution strategies, they extend our customer base beyond our previous capabilities. And they run off the same global technology platform. This allows us to quickly bring the best features to consumers across territories, segments and brands and on Comcast hardware and through our syndication partners. 
I'm pleased to also announce today that Apple will bring Apple TV+ and the Apple TV app to our Xfinity and Sky customers on X1, Flex, XClass, Sky Glass and Sky Q devices. And Comcast is bringing the Xfinity Stream and Sky Go apps to Apple TV devices. We're working together with our partners to deliver the best apps and experiences on our platforms. And our teams are sharing capabilities and collaborating across the company, collectively drawing on our scale and leadership in broadband, aggregation and streaming to innovate and profitably serve new and existing customers. 
Looking ahead, I am excited about the opportunities we have to both invest in our business and return capital through buybacks and dividends all while maintaining leverage around current levels. And I believe we are extremely well positioned to continue our track record of building long-term shareholder value. 
So I'm pleased to now hand it over to Mike for more detail on this strong quarter."
173341,1681761315,2415524,"Comcast Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our third quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 19% to $30.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 34% to $0.87 per share. And fina",1789,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our third quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 19% to $30.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 34% to $0.87 per share. And finally, we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow. 
Now let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable revenue increased 7.4% to $16.1 billion. EBITDA increased 10% to $7.1 billion, and net cash flow grew 16% to $5 billion. 
As a reminder, comparisons to last year were impacted by adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees. Excluding these adjustments, Cable Communications revenue increased 6.3% with no corresponding impact to EBITDA. 
We added 255,000 net new customer relationships in the quarter once again driven by broadband, where we added 300,000 net new residential and business customers. We continue to benefit from high levels of customer retention with broadband churn improving to the lowest rate for any third quarter on record. 
The strong level of net customer additions over the past year, including this third quarter, coupled with higher average revenue per customer, drove broadband revenue growth of 12%. This growth was about 1 point lower, excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's results. 
Wireless and business services also drove our strong Cable revenue growth. Wireless revenue grew 51% driven by growth in customer lines and higher device sales. Overall, we added 285,000 lines in the quarter, the best result since launching this business in 2017, bringing total mobile lines to 3.7 million. 
Business services revenue increased 8.7%, reflecting an increase in rates and customers primarily driven by the continued improvement in small businesses. We added 18,000 net new customers in the quarter and 72,000 over the past year. We recently closed on our acquisition of Masergy, which enables us to offer a broader range of products and solutions to mid-market and enterprise customers and expands our market opportunity to customers with a global presence. 
Moving to video. Revenue increased 1.4% and was flat excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's third quarter driven by a residential rate increase at the beginning of the year, mostly offset by video subscriber net losses totaling 408,000 this quarter. 
Last, advertising revenue increased 4.6%, reflecting a strong overall market recovery compared to last year's third quarter, which was impacted by COVID, partially offset by lower political advertising. As a reminder, the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison will be impacted by record levels of political advertising last year. 
Turning to expenses. Cable Communications third quarter expenses increased 5.3%. Programming expenses increased 7.6% mainly reflecting the comparison to last year, which benefited from RSN adjustments. Excluding these, programming expenses were up 2.8% as we begin to lap the large number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020. 
Nonprogramming expenses increased 3.9% and decreased 0.8% on a per relationship basis, reflecting our investment to drive growth in our core businesses, broadband, wireless and business services. This resulted in higher technical and product support and advertising, marketing and promotion expenses, which were partially offset by lower bad debt and customer service expense. 
Cable Communications EBITDA increased 10% to $7.1 billion, including a contribution of $51 million from our wireless business. Cable EBITDA margin reached 43.9%, reflecting 120 basis points of year-over-year improvement. 
While the RSN fee adjustments had no impact on EBITDA, they did impact margins last year. Excluding the RSN adjustment impact, our margin expanded 160 basis points year-over-year. Cable capital expenditures decreased 5.4%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 10.4%. But there is typically some choppiness in Cable CapEx from quarter-to-quarter mainly due to timing. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, revenue increased 58% to $10 billion, and EBITDA increased 48% to $1.35 billion. Media revenue increased 48% to $6.8 billion, including $1.8 billion associated with the Tokyo Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue increased 9.2% driven by higher distribution and advertising revenue. 
Distribution revenue increased over 12%, reflecting higher rates post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020 and a growing contribution from Peacock, partially offset by subscriber declines, which have been stable for the past few quarters. Advertising revenue increased 7.2%, reflecting an overall market recovery compared to last year, very strong demand and pricing for our ad inventory, a higher contribution from Peacock and a solid start to the new fall season, including strong NFL ratings, partially offset by the timing of sporting events compared to last year when several events had shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter. 
Media EBITDA increased 1.2% to $997 million, including results of Tokyo Olympics, the favorable comparison on the timing of other sporting events and Peacock losses that were impacted by higher costs associated with the day and date release of The Boss Baby: Family Business. As a reminder, our fourth quarter results will face a difficult comparison to last year due to higher costs associated with the timing of more sporting events at our regional sports network, an increase in our original entertainment as we continue to launch our fall season and the inclusion of our latest studio release Halloween Kills on Peacock. 
Studios revenue increased 27% driven fairly equally by growth in theatrical and content licensing revenue. The increase in theatrical revenue reflected the continued success of F9 as well as several new releases, including The Boss Baby: Family Business, which was in theaters and on Peacock. In addition, content licensing revenue growth benefited from the delivery of content to our networks, Peacock and third parties. Studio EBITDA declined 47% to $179 million driven by higher amortization of television and film production costs as we return to pre-COVID levels of production and investment in marketing and promotion to launch our new films. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, EBITDA comparisons to last year will remain challenging in the short term as we launch new theatrical releases and ramp our TV productions, which have been impacted by the pandemic. 
Moving to Theme Parks. Revenue increased by $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion. And we generated EBITDA of $434 million, which included about $130 million of Universal Beijing preopening costs. This was our most profitable quarter since the pandemic began in the first quarter of 2020 driven by improved operating results at our U.S. parks, including strong domestic attendance and per caps that were above prepandemic levels. 
In fact, as Brian noted, Universal Orlando delivered its highest EBITDA for any quarter in its history. At Universal Studios Japan, results were challenging as we continue to operate under government capacity restrictions, keeping attendance below 2019 levels. 
Last, we opened Universal Beijing on September 20, where the initial demand has been positive. While our parks offer a great experience year round, we expect some seasonality given Beijing's weather conditions with lower attendance in the fall and winter and more in spring and summer. So overall, on parks, we are encouraged by the continued recovery, but getting back to and then exceeding pre-pandemic levels of EBITDA will likely require an improvement in international visitation. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I'll speak to on a constant currency basis. For the third quarter, Sky revenue was $5 billion and relatively consistent compared to last year. Direct-to-consumer revenue was also consistent with last year's results, primarily reflecting strong growth in the U.K. driven by continued growth in customer relationships and higher ARPU due to the positive impact of a rate increase earlier this year, higher mobile device sales and the continued turnaround in hospitality revenue as pubs and clubs come back. This was offset by a decrease in customer relationships and ARPU in Italy mainly due to a negative impact from the reduction in broadcast rates to Serie A. 
Sky's overall customer relationships declined 233,000 entirely driven by customer losses in Italy. Advertising revenue increased 16% with the results in the U.K. driving the bulk of the growth and reflecting the overall market recovery from COVID-19. This increase was offset by a 26% decline in content revenue driven by the change in sports licensing agreements in Italy and Germany as well as the timing of sports events compared to last year when several events had shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter due to COVID-19. 
Turning to our EBITDA results. During the quarter, there was a change in the way we amortize sports rights. This cost is now aligned more directly to when games are played, including when seasons begin and end. This resulted in a $130 million benefit in the third quarter, which will reverse in the fourth quarter. Going forward, this change will continue to impact the quarterly pattern of recognizing sports rights amortization costs with expense higher in the first and fourth quarters and lower in the second and third quarters, but it should not impact our full year results. Overall, Sky's EBITDA increased 76%, reflecting this benefit as well as lower sports programming costs due to resets in our sports rights and the favorable comparison on the timing of sporting events. 
Before I comment on capital returns and balance sheet, let me make a comment on our Corporate and Other segment. As we've done in the past with other start-up activities, launch costs related to Sky Glass and XClass were reported in our Corporate segment, which could become more meaningful beginning with this fourth quarter. 
Now I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. We generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow this quarter, including a $670 million benefit related to the tax impact of the bond exchange we completed in August. 
Consolidated total capital was $2.9 billion for the quarter. And as expected, net working capital increased, reflecting our broadcast of the Olympics as well as the continued post-COVID ramp of investment in studio content. Return of capital totaled $2.7 billion, including $1.2 billion of dividend payments and $1.5 billion of share repurchase activity. 
Our net leverage at quarter end was 2.4x, which means we are now back at a level that is consistent with our existing ratings and reflects substantial progress in both debt reduction and a strong rebound in our businesses post the pandemic. From here, my expectation is that we keep our leverage ratio around where we currently are and continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities, which consists of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for profitable growth and returning capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, our buyback will be a function of that balance and excess free cash flow available for capital returns. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call."

The Sky Glass, the move towards the smart TV seems like a really interesting evolution of your product set, taking the business beyond your footprint, as you noted, in multiple markets. Can you just talk about some of the long-term vision of what that turns into for the company? Because it seems like it's a pretty significant opportunity as you've been limited essentially geographically in the past. 
And then, I guess, I have to come back, Mike, to your last comment there about leverage, just doing some quick math. I mean, you guys are run rating I guess, what, $5 billion of buybacks a year, looking at the second half. You've got a $4 billion or so dividend. You generate a lot more free cash flow than those 2 numbers. So to stay levered here, there's a lot of excess cash flow, which is obviously a nice problem to have. Anything else you would add in terms of how you stay at 2.5x just given the strong free cash flow dynamics of the business would be greatly appreciated."

Let me start that if you look at where we are today, we -- the global technology platform, we do about 5 billion entertainment streams a week on 75 million devices. So we have a huge global scale. 
And one of the great things that we've been working on with Dana and Dave is having a global technology platform and working together on product innovation. So to specifically talk about the connected TV streaming TV, which is what Sky Glass and XClass are really all about, I think it's a natural evolution. So I think it's a beginning of a logical extension. 
And so I was in London for the launch of Sky Glass, and we've been working on it since the day we bought Sky, taken about 3 years to see it come to fruition. It's a really exciting product, just simplifies for the consumer so much. Dana can talk in a moment a little bit about it. It is a really breakthrough idea, I think, on how people buy it and pay for it. 
But mostly, it's an embodiment of what we do well, which is aggregation and that we're going to find a way for consumers to get to what they want faster, personalize it and have fun along the way. And then it's a platform for innovation on a go-forward basis for where we think television may evolve and whether it's gaming, whether it's fitness, health care, education. And so having that be part of your relationship with our company, I think, is novel territory for us to do R&D off of in the U.S., and finally, it allows us to take it all over Europe potentially, as you say, in and out of footprint. 
So we're starting in the U.K., but we have ambitions to expand quickly to other countries. And it's great for streamers and streaming services. So our importance to the streaming universe will continue to grow. And our relationship and certainly the Apple announcement today is the latest iteration of that. 
In the U.S., pretty much locked in sync with our Sky team is the XClass, and Dave can talk a little bit about that. But we look at the markets, there's different opportunities, different realities with our partnership with Hisense and with Walmart, where many Americans get their televisions. 
And so we're excited to begin. And I think -- so different ends of the market perhaps. We'll look at this as learnings across the globe. And it follows right on the heels of X1, Q, Flex and the progress we've made on innovation. So I'm really excited by it, and I think it also shows the one company working well together. 
Let me start with Dana. Why don't you add a few thoughts on Sky Glass? And then, Dave, over to you, and then we'll get to the question on leverage with Mike."
173341,1681761315,2415524,"Comcast Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks so much, Brian. I appreciate it.

And as it was touched on, this eliminates the need for a dish in a set-top box, which is really, really important in the go-forward. And we believe it's the smartest TV in the market. 
I can say based on our experience of product launches, the consumer reaction here has been fantastic. And I think that really starts with the product itself, which is quite innovative. We've changed the commercial model of the product to follow the approach of the mobile handset sales. So we've converted a large upfront payment to an affordable monthly payment with ownership, of course. 
It establishes a long-term relationship with the customer as a result. And it really improves -- the product really improves our acquisition economics because it allows for self-installation, and there's no longer a need for a dish in a set-top box. 
I think another big part of the product innovation has been reducing the complexity of the purchase decision itself. So everything is inside, all of the highest specs. And the customer really only needs to choose the size inclusive of the audio, which is truly fantastic all built in. 
And then the breakthrough in the experience, and that's where Sky really does shine is in the fully integrated product. So that interplay between linear, on-demand and app content, which can really enhance people's time spent viewing. So you're not coming in and out of apps, but the content is lifted up and able to toggle across content more easily, this is what kind of makes the product such as standout and I think is driving some of the consumer reaction that we've seen. 
As Brian touched on, we think Sky Glass gives us some interesting headroom. It opens up customers we haven't been able to reach before if they've been prohibited from having satellite dishes or didn't want them. It opens up customers who are more interested in streaming content. It opened up syndication opportunities for us. 
And importantly, as Brian touched on, it opens up a lot of opportunity for both stickiness and potentially new revenue areas when we think about things like watch together or fitness and health long, long term. We think that this is a platform for innovation and really, really just the beginning. 
And I think the compelling part about this is that all of the guts of this are exactly the same as all of the Comcast technology. So this is all built through the collaboration and enablement of Comcast. And so the synergies between this and some of the smart TV developments in the U.S. are huge synergies where the hardware, the software, the cloud services are almost entirely the same."

But it is -- clearly, the smart TV is a really important device to get to. So we're able to take our software stack, working across the board and focus on the right segment that wants very little friction. It just wants the smart TV to work, and we're able to do 2 things: one, deliver the world-class UI. So great voice, great data integration, able to add things like the Charter app, our app on top of it. So we can -- there's a lot of flexibility that we have and the business model that we have. We can go to market with the TV manufacturers, the retailers in mind and pull it all together in a unique way because we're coming in a little bit later. 
So it's a great product. We're very excited about it, within our footprint, outside. And we're able to position Peacock as a key part of the offering in a great way and within the UI. And so overall, very excited, early, but this is clearly a focus of ours."

And then, of course, 3Q came in below 3Q '19. 
And I think, Dave, a couple of questions. One is, what's the right baseline for growth in broadband net additions that investors should think about? I think during the pandemic, as we moved through a lot of us look at 2019 as a normal year pre-pandemic. It was a good year for you and the industry for broadband growth. So one, when you look forward, like what's the right baseline for growth that you measure your businesses on? And then secondarily, any thoughts on how momentum looks in 4Q and how you feel about competitive threats would be helpful."

So we haven't changed our feeling on th",670,"You got it, Doug. So first off, as you said, we're still clearly in a fluid environment. To be clear though, the fundamentals of the business are very strong, and there's a really long runway of growth in broadband. So we haven't changed our feeling on that at all. 
We have a terrific network. It's scaled, it's ubiquitous, and it continues to perform exceptionally well. And we're in a good position for the future. So we haven't changed our view on the long-term trajectory of the connectivity business. I'm just as confident and optimistic in the prospects for this business as I've ever been. 
So when you look at the whole year, I think it underscores the strength of broadband. Year-to-date, we've added over 1.1 million net additions, and we've been adding over 1 million broadband subscribers each year for the past 20 years. 
And as you said, while the pace in Q3 was slower than we saw earlier in the year during the height of the pandemic, our broadband net adds are still very healthy, and our churn remains at record lows, certainly for Q3. I think it's important to look at the current environment. And I think that points a little bit, Doug, to what you're talking about. 
And kind of just a couple of drivers to call out. One, when you look at the slowdown and Mike talked about this earlier, there have been a slowdown in connects across our footprint. And we look very closely at the move activity. There's more activity earlier in the year around moves, slower now. And certainly, the last couple of months below 2019 levels in terms of moves. So a little bit less college student activity, not alarmingly so, but just a little bit less and just a little bit less switching activity overall. 
I think if you look at other operators, everyone's churn is down. So that means just some less jump balls where we do well. 
I think the other thing to call out in terms of drivers, we're seeing less growth from the lower income segment. We're still adding customers in this segment, but not at the same rate as earlier. There are new government programs like EBB. We're seeing traditional wireless, not fixed wireless, but traditional wireless participate be very active in this program. 
And last point on competition, look, we take it all very seriously. And we've been in a very competitive situation for some time. Our focus has not wavered. We innovate. We deliver the best product for each segment. We break the market down in terms of segments, and we compete at a very local level. We have our granular view literally at the block level geographically and by each segment from HSV only to multiple product households. 
So you add it all up, our churn remains at record lows, whether it's fiber, whether -- or not. And we look at our competitors' performance overall to ours historically and now, and I think this says it all. 
So as for expectations for full year results, while current visibility and overall activity creates a little bit of modest risk, we still believe full year net adds will be around 2019 levels. So overall, when you look at this year, and you go back to 2019, 2019 was the second best year that we've had in well over a decade. It's just a terrific year. And so for us to be at that level and the consistency that we've had has been so strong, and you point to the fundamentals. 
There are some things that we're on, but like always, you attack them, and you break them down. But I really like the fundamentals and the momentum that we have. So I think the runway is absolutely still there. 
And the last point is business services, a very important part of the connectivity story. And there, I love their momentum as well. So you add it all up, I like where we're at with connectivity."

I think that, that last point I just want to underscore, which is we're -- the record low churn suggests, to me anyway, a very stable business. That's what's so great about the 32 million broadband customers that we have. We have a recurring business. So while maybe there was a pull forward, maybe there's a slowdown, time will tell as your question suggests. 
We're looking at how do we grow EBITDA, how do we grow margins, how do we maintain and offer more product connectivity, kind of the very first thing we talked about, what else can you do with broadband, what will broadband evolve to over the next 5, 10 years. So we're super focused on minute to minute, but we're also, I think Dave put in context just how good we feel and it's certainly business services the same kind of innovation that we've been doing in residential we're doing in business services. 
And so it's not some change in market conditions that really we've all been reading about. While there may be coming and maybe there's some of that, I actually think it's personally the disruption from the pandemic, coupled with a large percentage of Americans have broadband.

And we have products and different prices that allow customers to come to our company. 
We're getting close to nearly 60 million customer relationships, I think, 57 million or 58 million global relationships. And these are $100 a month plus type relationships.

So everything on Peacock is heading in the right direction, and there's really nothing from a trajectory perspective that's any different than it was last quarter or the quarter before. 
All metrics are pointed up. Our usage continues to be great. Our mix of users continues to be great. We added a few million more subs, more MAAs, everything. Advertising, we -- in this quarter, we just at the tail end of the quarter, we started selling advertising beyond sponsorship of which in the fourth quarter, it's all beyond sponsorship. And that is going spectacularly well. 
So we're really pleased with Peacock. It's way ahead of where we expected to be at this point. And every month, every quarter, it gets further ahead. And as you were talking about the business overall for next year, I was getting excited because we're very excited about next year with everything that we've got coming across NBCUniversal from the Olympics to the Super Bowl to a spectacular movie slate to a very strong advertising business, ratings or linear networks improving. 
And I think Peacock, I would add to that, that Peacock is doing really well right now without most of its programming strength. So if you look at the future, and you look at where we're headed with Peacock, we have -- because of the pandemic, we were behind on our original production. So we're going to start to see a ramp-up in originals on Peacock, which is very necessary to continue to grow to have successful and robust original programming. And we're excited about a lot of the things that we're making for the service. 
We decided to buy our first window as we talked about last call of our movies. So our Pay-One rights, so to speak. And the first movie in our Pay-One rights will hit Peacock in the first quarter, and then we'll have a steady supply of movies. We've seen across all streaming platforms that movies move the dial. They moved the dial for Peacock in this quarter with Boss Baby, recently with Halloween Kills, which, by the way, was a huge hit on Peacock and a huge hit at the box office. So it shows that you can kind of play in 2 different markets. 
So we have all of our movies coming to Peacock, and we couldn't be more excited about where Peacock is. And we'll continue to invest behind that success. 
I think it's important to remember, too, that we launched just over a year ago. We launched in July of last year. So we've been a business for just over a year. We're already more than 1/3 of where Hulu is now, which is a service has been more than decades in the making.

I guess, first, the way I would question sort of we've seen some data that suggests that your WiFi is offloading a lot more traffic than we would have expected from the contract. So the gross margins of that business may be much more -- much higher than we had previously believed. 
It makes me wonder, what's the strategic goal for that business? Is it really to drive the business into being the largest, most profitable business it can be? Or is it still largely to reduce churn on broadband and think of it as more of a defensive product for protecting your existing business? 
And then if I could just squeeze in a second unrelated question. Can you just update us on your thoughts of Hulu, which, I guess, doesn't necessarily come up until 2024? But is there any opportunity that you might do something with Hulu sooner?"

So I don't think -- we really haven't changed our strategic imperative behind mobile. But most certainly, things have accelerated and that we are very focused on how we leverage mobile to support broadband. 
Once we were successfully worked on the Verizon relationship and improved the MVNO relationship. We're able to go to market with and launching the new unlimited plans, combining that with By the Gig just puts us in a unique position. So I think our goal is what we said earlier is to go faster and leverage mobile completely and everything that we do and how we surround broadband with a terrific product. I think it is profitable. It'll continue to be. I feel confident of that. 
But the main focus is to drive broadband. And there are a couple of key things. One, it is -- it continues to support the broadband churn and pointing towards record low broadband overall churns. Mobile is just one piece of that. 
But it also drives consideration on the front end. So when things -- some -- the activity overall begins to tick back up, I think retail and mobile play a huge role. As you pointed out, I think the other key point is how do we leverage product integration with WiFi. We already do a great job, thus the -- every mobile device we contribute just a ton of broadband traffic through these mobile devices over our WiFi network, and it's part of our network. 
So over time, we want to work hard on how do we integrate the experience and just do more so I think in the home and we'll be opportunistic outside the home. So I think it's -- we're accelerating mobile every single sales channel, every marketing plan. And we'll continue to package mobile with broadband in unique ways going forward."

Your point, our approach is to consistently focus on value and whether it's fiber or not. Our goal is to constantly innovate, position the greatest network, I think, for today and tomorrow.

And so it is -- we go, and we consult with the prospects upfront and customers all the time what's best for them. And we put them in packages that work and that gives an opportunity to drive ARPU when you do it that way. 
So overall, the fundamentals, again, I talked about. And you look at the long-term runway of broadband and the consistency of how we performed. And to me, that's, I think, points towards the future. So Brian?"

Well, I think it's a perfect way to end the call, Phil, with your question. Let me again state that I think it was a great quarter. And one of the highlights of the quarter was returning after several years to what we have our target leverage ratio, which Mike talked about. 
And so we sort of separate, at least I do in my mind, the borrowing from the buybacks. They're not linked the way you described. It may appear that way. And I just want to give a compliment to our treasury team, Jason Armstrong and team. During the last 18 months, our balance sheet has now never been in a stronger position. 
We've done some long-term rollovers and extensions at historically low rates. And so you put all that together with this operating performance, and it does get us back to where we wanted to be, which will then allow us to more aggressively take advantage of what a number of us believe is a great company. And therefore, you can put your own value on it as shareholders. 
But we certainly are looking forward to buying back stock. And I think Mike described the logic well in the ratios. And all in all, a really great quarter. So thank you, team, and thanks for your support on the call to the shareholders. Marci, over to you."

We had a wonderful third quarter across the entire company with 18% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 34% growth in adjusted EPS, and we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow. One of our goals in the past severa",1241,"Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. We had a wonderful third quarter across the entire company with 18% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 34% growth in adjusted EPS, and we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow. 
One of our goals in the past several years has been to return to a position of offensively investing in our existing businesses, paying a growing dividend and also buying back meaningful amounts of stock. So I'm pleased to report that we have now achieved all of that in this quarter, and we are back to our desired leverage ratios. 
Our Cable division continues to be a standout, delivering over 7% revenue growth and the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit EBITDA growth of 10% fueled by our broadband business, which generated 300,000 net additions and contributed to a very healthy 255,000 net new customer relationships. Business services has emerged from the pandemic and was also a key driver of our results. And we believe this momentum will continue. 
Our success comes from our network advantage, innovative products and world-class operational capabilities, which enable us to provide an unparalleled experience. Just like in residential, we are proactively responding to the needs of our commercial customers and offering personalized solutions. 
While small business has led our growth for the last decade, we are still significantly underpenetrated in the mid-market and enterprise segments. We see a lot of potential to take share in our large addressable market, which just got even bigger post our recent acquisition of Masergy, which builds on our strong offering of technology solutions. Masergy has become a leading provider to companies worldwide and unlocks a customer segment that we don't have today, particularly U.S.-based organizations with multi-site global operations. 
Xfinity Mobile exceeded its prior record, adding 285,000 lines, the most in any quarter since launch. And we continue to evaluate ways we can accelerate this business even further as wireline and wireless connectivity services continue to converge. 
We are looking at new exciting products and packaging that highlight how we're able to provide our customers with the best and most reliable broadband wherever they are or wherever they go and help them save money at the same time. And with only 6% penetration of our 32 million broadband customers, we have a long runway. 
Taking all of this together, we have an incredibly robust broadband business, and we've been adding over 1 million broadband customers each year for the past 20-plus years. And we continue to deepen these relationships by offering a fantastic and differentiated in-home experience with the fastest modem and gateway and the greatest WiFi coverage. We plan to continue our relentless focus on aggressively developing and improving our suite of products around connectivity. 
The foundation of all of this is our network. And we are currently in the process of deploying new technology, updating key infrastructure and accelerating virtualization across our footprint so that we can deliver even further enhancements fast and at scale to millions of customers. And we will continue to evaluate every opportunity we have to expand our passings, which will bring our amazing suite of products and services to many new homes and businesses. 
All of Dave Watson and his team's superb execution is around decades of investment that has led to constant new product innovation, including this month's launch of XClass TV, an extension of our leadership in video aggregation. XClass is an innovative smart television powered by our global technology platform that brings the best of our company's entertainment operating system to consumers nationwide together with the option to use either Xfinity, Charter or other entertainment apps. 
At NBCUniversal, we continue to see great progress in each of our businesses, but I'd like to highlight our theme parks, especially Orlando, which just reported the most profitable quarter in its history despite having virtually no international guests due to COVID-related travel restraints. 
In Hollywood, we continue to see recovery, and we had a very successful and exciting opening of Universal Beijing Resort on September 20. I also look forward to COVID-related restrictions easing in Osaka, which could happen soon. 
Our Media business is also doing very well. We're benefiting from the many changes Jeff Shell and his team implemented starting in 2020 with new hires, different roles, fresh content and a more efficient operating structure. We're seeing the financial success in both our linear networks as well as Peacock, which has maintained its momentum. We have a new breakout hit with La Brea, which has been a contributor to NBC's overall audience lead this primetime season as well as the best-performing new show on Peacock. 
Sunday Night Football has returned with great momentum, which we're seeing across our platforms. And we're thrilled with the performance of our second Halloween installment, which generated more revenue in its opening weekend at the domestic box office than any other film this year with a day and date streaming release and is the one nonlive event premier in Peacock's history. 
We're also looking forward to extending our streaming platforms outside of the U.S. with Peacock launching on Sky next month and Sky Showtime in the works for mid-2022. At Sky, I want to reemphasize how well we're performing in the U.K., which continues its growth trajectory and customer relationships led by record low churn. 
We're also seeing great momentum in our broadband and mobile businesses. Earlier this month, Dana Strong and her team introduced Sky Glass in London, a premium all-in-one streaming television and multichannel subscription package that is so much more than just a stunning TV with amazing sound. It's an innovation platform that opens up a whole new world of entertainment for our customers and simplifies the experience so they can stream every channel, every show and every app in one easy-to-use interface. And already, the customer response has very much exceeded our initial expectations. 
We're also incredibly proud that Sky Glass is the first TV to be certified carbon neutral. Sky has been leading all of Comcast with its sustainability goals and is the first media company in the U.K. to commit to being net carbon zero by 2030. 
While Glass and XClass are distinct products with different monetization and distribution strategies, they extend our customer base beyond our previous capabilities. And they run off the same global technology platform. This allows us to quickly bring the best features to consumers across territories, segments and brands and on Comcast hardware and through our syndication partners. 
I'm pleased to also announce today that Apple will bring Apple TV+ and the Apple TV app to our Xfinity and Sky customers on X1, Flex, XClass, Sky Glass and Sky Q devices. And Comcast is bringing the Xfinity Stream and Sky Go apps to Apple TV devices. We're working together with our partners to deliver the best apps and experiences on our platforms. And our teams are sharing capabilities and collaborating across the company, collectively drawing on our scale and leadership in broadband, aggregation and streaming to innovate and profitably serve new and existing customers. 
Looking ahead, I am excited about the opportunities we have to both invest in our business and return capital through buybacks and dividends all while maintaining leverage around current levels. And I believe we are extremely well positioned to continue our track record of building long-term shareholder value. 
So I'm pleased to now hand it over to Mike for more detail on this strong quarter."

I'll begin on Slide 4 with our third quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 19% to $30.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 34% to $0.87 per share. And fina",1789,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our third quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 19% to $30.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 34% to $0.87 per share. And finally, we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow. 
Now let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable revenue increased 7.4% to $16.1 billion. EBITDA increased 10% to $7.1 billion, and net cash flow grew 16% to $5 billion. 
As a reminder, comparisons to last year were impacted by adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees. Excluding these adjustments, Cable Communications revenue increased 6.3% with no corresponding impact to EBITDA. 
We added 255,000 net new customer relationships in the quarter once again driven by broadband, where we added 300,000 net new residential and business customers. We continue to benefit from high levels of customer retention with broadband churn improving to the lowest rate for any third quarter on record. 
The strong level of net customer additions over the past year, including this third quarter, coupled with higher average revenue per customer, drove broadband revenue growth of 12%. This growth was about 1 point lower, excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's results. 
Wireless and business services also drove our strong Cable revenue growth. Wireless revenue grew 51% driven by growth in customer lines and higher device sales. Overall, we added 285,000 lines in the quarter, the best result since launching this business in 2017, bringing total mobile lines to 3.7 million. 
Business services revenue increased 8.7%, reflecting an increase in rates and customers primarily driven by the continued improvement in small businesses. We added 18,000 net new customers in the quarter and 72,000 over the past year. We recently closed on our acquisition of Masergy, which enables us to offer a broader range of products and solutions to mid-market and enterprise customers and expands our market opportunity to customers with a global presence. 
Moving to video. Revenue increased 1.4% and was flat excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's third quarter driven by a residential rate increase at the beginning of the year, mostly offset by video subscriber net losses totaling 408,000 this quarter. 
Last, advertising revenue increased 4.6%, reflecting a strong overall market recovery compared to last year's third quarter, which was impacted by COVID, partially offset by lower political advertising. As a reminder, the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison will be impacted by record levels of political advertising last year. 
Turning to expenses. Cable Communications third quarter expenses increased 5.3%. Programming expenses increased 7.6% mainly reflecting the comparison to last year, which benefited from RSN adjustments. Excluding these, programming expenses were up 2.8% as we begin to lap the large number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020. 
Nonprogramming expenses increased 3.9% and decreased 0.8% on a per relationship basis, reflecting our investment to drive growth in our core businesses, broadband, wireless and business services. This resulted in higher technical and product support and advertising, marketing and promotion expenses, which were partially offset by lower bad debt and customer service expense. 
Cable Communications EBITDA increased 10% to $7.1 billion, including a contribution of $51 million from our wireless business. Cable EBITDA margin reached 43.9%, reflecting 120 basis points of year-over-year improvement. 
While the RSN fee adjustments had no impact on EBITDA, they did impact margins last year. Excluding the RSN adjustment impact, our margin expanded 160 basis points year-over-year. Cable capital expenditures decreased 5.4%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 10.4%. But there is typically some choppiness in Cable CapEx from quarter-to-quarter mainly due to timing. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, revenue increased 58% to $10 billion, and EBITDA increased 48% to $1.35 billion. Media revenue increased 48% to $6.8 billion, including $1.8 billion associated with the Tokyo Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue increased 9.2% driven by higher distribution and advertising revenue. 
Distribution revenue increased over 12%, reflecting higher rates post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020 and a growing contribution from Peacock, partially offset by subscriber declines, which have been stable for the past few quarters. Advertising revenue increased 7.2%, reflecting an overall market recovery compared to last year, very strong demand and pricing for our ad inventory, a higher contribution from Peacock and a solid start to the new fall season, including strong NFL ratings, partially offset by the timing of sporting events compared to last year when several events had shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter. 
Media EBITDA increased 1.2% to $997 million, including results of Tokyo Olympics, the favorable comparison on the timing of other sporting events and Peacock losses that were impacted by higher costs associated with the day and date release of The Boss Baby: Family Business. As a reminder, our fourth quarter results will face a difficult comparison to last year due to higher costs associated with the timing of more sporting events at our regional sports network, an increase in our original entertainment as we continue to launch our fall season and the inclusion of our latest studio release Halloween Kills on Peacock. 
Studios revenue increased 27% driven fairly equally by growth in theatrical and content licensing revenue. The increase in theatrical revenue reflected the continued success of F9 as well as several new releases, including The Boss Baby: Family Business, which was in theaters and on Peacock. In addition, content licensing revenue growth benefited from the delivery of content to our networks, Peacock and third parties. Studio EBITDA declined 47% to $179 million, driven by higher amortization of television and film production costs as we return to pre-COVID levels of production and investment in marketing and promotion to launch our new films. 
Looking to the fourth quarter. EBITDA comparisons to last year will remain challenging in the short term as we launch new theatrical releases and ramp our TV productions, which have been impacted by the pandemic. Moving to Theme Parks. Revenue increased by $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion. And we generated EBITDA of $434 million, which included about $130 million of Universal Beijing preopening costs. This was our most profitable quarter since the pandemic began in the first quarter of 2020 driven by improved operating results at our U.S. parks, including strong domestic attendance and per caps that were above prepandemic levels. 
In fact, as Brian noted, Universal Orlando delivered its highest EBITDA for any quarter in its history. At Universal Studios Japan, results were challenging as we continue to operate under government capacity restrictions, keeping attendance below 2019 levels. Last, we opened Universal Beijing on September 20, where the initial demand has been positive. While our parks offer a great experience year round, we expect some seasonality given Beijing's weather conditions with lower attendance in the fall and winter and more in spring and summer. So overall, on parks, we are encouraged by the continued recovery, but getting back to and then exceeding pre-pandemic levels of EBITDA will likely require an improvement in international visitation. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I'll speak to on a constant currency basis. For the third quarter, Sky revenue was $5 billion and relatively consistent compared to last year. Direct-to-consumer revenue was also consistent with last year's results, primarily reflecting strong growth in the U.K. driven by continued growth in customer relationships and higher ARPU due to the positive impact of a rate increase earlier this year, higher mobile device sales and the continued turnaround in hospitality revenue as pubs and clubs come back. This was offset by a decrease in customer relationships and ARPU in Italy, mainly due to a negative impact from the reduction in broadcast rates to Serie A. 
Sky's overall customer relationships declined 233,000 entirely driven by customer losses in Italy. Advertising revenue increased 16% with the results in the U.K. driving the bulk of the growth and reflecting the overall market recovery from COVID-19. This increase was offset by a 26% decline in content revenue driven by the change in sports licensing agreements in Italy and Germany as well as the timing of sports events compared to last year when several events had shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter due to COVID-19. 
Turning to our EBITDA results. During the quarter, there was a change in the way we amortize sports rights. This cost is now aligned more directly to when games are played, including when seasons begin and end. This resulted in a $130 million benefit in the third quarter, which will reverse in the fourth quarter. Going forward, this change will continue to impact the quarterly pattern of recognizing sports rights amortization costs, with expense higher in the first and fourth quarters and lower in the second and third quarters, but it should not impact our full year results. Overall, Sky's EBITDA increased 76%, reflecting this benefit as well as lower sports programming costs due to resets in our sports rights and the favorable comparison on the timing of sporting events. 
Before I comment on capital returns and balance sheet, let me make a comment on our Corporate and Other segment. As we've done in the past with other start-up activities, launch costs related to Sky Glass and XClass were reported in our Corporate segment, which could become more meaningful beginning with this fourth quarter. 
Now I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. We generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow this quarter, including a $670 million benefit related to the tax impact of the bond exchange we completed in August. Consolidated total capital was $2.9 billion for the quarter. And as expected, net working capital increased, reflecting our broadcast to the Olympics as well as the continued post-COVID ramp of investment in studio content. Return of capital totaled $2.7 billion, including $1.2 billion of dividend payments and $1.5 billion of share repurchase activity. 
Our net leverage at quarter end was 2.4x, which means we are now back at a level that is consistent with our existing ratings and reflects substantial progress in both debt reduction and a strong rebound in our businesses post the pandemic. From here, my expectation is that we keep our leverage ratio around where we currently are and continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities, which consists of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing organically for profitable growth and returning capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, our buyback will be a function of that balance and excess free cash flow available for capital returns. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call."

The Sky Glass, the move towards the Smart TV seems like a really interesting evolution of your product set, taking the business beyond your footprint, as you noted, in multiple markets. Can you just talk about some of the long-term vision of what that turns into for the company? Because it seems like it's a pretty significant opportunity as you've been limited essentially geographically in the past. 
And then, I guess, I have to come back, Mike, to your last comment there about leverage, just doing some quick math. I mean, you guys are run rating I guess, what, $5 billion of buybacks a year, looking at the second half. You've got a $4 billion or so dividend. You generate a lot more free cash flow than those 2 numbers. So to stay levered here, there's a lot of excess cash flow, which is obviously a nice problem to have. Anything else you would add in terms of how you stay at 2.5x, just given the strong free cash flow dynamics of the business, would be greatly appreciated."

Let me start that if you look at where we are today, we -- the global technology platform, we do about 5 billion entertainment streams a week on 75 million devices. So we have a huge global scale. And one of the great things that we've been working on with Dana and Dave is having a global technology platform and working together on product innovation. So to specifically talk about the connected TV, streaming TV, which is what Sky Glass and XClass are really all about, I think it's a natural evolution. So I think it's a beginning of a logical extension. 
And so I was in London for the launch of Sky Glass, and we've been working on it since the day we bought Sky, taken about 3 years to see it come to fruition. It's a really exciting product, just simplifies for the consumer so much. Dana can talk in a moment a little bit about it. It is a really breakthrough idea, I think, on how people buy it and pay for it. 
But mostly, it's an embodiment of what we do well, which is aggregation, and that we're going to find a way for consumers to get to what they want faster, personalize it and have fun along the way. And then it's a platform for innovation on a go-forward basis for where we think television may evolve. And whether it's gaming, whether it's fitness, health care, education. And so having that be a part of your relationship with our company, I think, is novel territory for us to do R&D off of in the U.S. And finally, it allows us to take it all over Europe potentially, as you say, in and out of footprint. 
So we're starting in the U.K., but we have ambitions to expand quickly to other countries. And it's great for streamers and streaming services. So our importance to the streaming universe will continue to grow. And our relationship and certainly the Apple announcement today is the latest iteration of that. In the U.S., pretty much locked in sync with our Sky team is the XClass, and Dave can talk a little bit about that. But we look at the markets, there's different opportunities, different realities with our partnership with Hisense and with Walmart, where many Americans get their televisions. 
And so we're excited to begin. And I think -- so different ends of the market perhaps. We'll look at this as learnings across the globe. And it follows right on the heels of X1, Q, Flex and the progress we've made on innovation. So I'm really excited by it, and I think it also shows the one company working well together. Let me start with Dana. Why don't you add a few thoughts on Sky Glass? And then, Dave, over to you, and then we'll get to the question on leverage with Mike."
173341,1681761315,2416199,"Comcast Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks so much, Brian. I appreciate it. Sky Glass is our latest innovation for new streaming TV. And as it was touched on, this eliminates the need for a dish in a set-top box, which is really, really important in the go-forward.

And as it was touched on, this eliminates the need for a dish in a set-top box, which is really, really important in the go-forward. And we believe it's the smartest TV in the market. 
I can say based on our experience of product launches, the consumer reaction here has been fantastic. And I think that really starts with the product itself, which is quite innovative. We've changed the commercial model of the product to follow the approach of the mobile handset sales. So we've converted a large upfront payment to an affordable monthly payment with ownership, of course. 
It establishes a long-term relationship with the customer, as a result. And it really improves -- the product really improves our acquisition economics because it allows for self-installation, and there's no longer a need for a dish and a set-top box. 
I think another big part of the product innovation has been reducing the complexity of the purchase decision itself. So everything is inside, all of the highest specs. And the customer really only needs to choose the size, inclusive of the audio, which is truly fantastic all built in. 
And then the breakthrough in the experience, and that's where Sky really does shine is in the fully integrated product. So that interplay between linear, on-demand and app content, which can really enhance people's time spent viewing. So you're not coming in and out of apps, but the content is lifted up and able to toggle across content more easily, this is what kind of makes the product such as standout and I think is driving some of the consumer reaction that we've seen. 
As Brian touched on, we think Sky Glass gives us some interesting headroom. It opens up customers we haven't been able to reach before if they've been prohibited from having satellite dishes or didn't want them. It opens up customers who are more interested in streaming content. It opened up syndication opportunities for us. 
And importantly, as Brian touched on, it opens up a lot of opportunity for both stickiness and potentially, new revenue areas when we think about things like watch together or fitness and health long, long term. We think that this is a platform for innovation and really, really just the beginning. 
And I think the compelling part about this is that all of the guts of this are exactly the same as all of the Comcast technology. So this is all built through the collaboration and enablement of Comcast. And so the synergies between this and some of the smart TV developments in the U.S. are huge synergies where the hardware, the software, the cloud services are almost entirely the same."

But it is -- clearly, the smart TV is a really important device to get to. So we're able to take our software stack, working across the board and focus on the right segment that wants very little friction. It just wants the smart TV to work, and we're able to do 2 things: one, deliver the world-class UI. So great voice, great data integration, able to add things like the Charter app, our app on top of it. So we can -- there's a lot of flexibility that we have and the business model that we have. We can go to market with the TV manufacturers, the retailers in mind and pull it all together in a unique way because we're coming in a little bit later. 
So it's a great product. We're very excited about it, within our footprint, outside. And we're able to position Peacock as a key part of the offering in a great way and within the UI. And so overall, very excited, early, but this is clearly a focus of ours."

And then, of course, 3Q came in below 3Q '19. 
And I think, Dave, a couple of questions. One is, what's the right baseline for growth in broadband net additions that investors should think about? I think during the pandemic, as we moved through a lot of us look at 2019 as a normal year pre-pandemic. It was a good year for you and the industry for broadband growth. So one, when you look forward, like what's the right baseline for growth that you measure your businesses on? And then secondarily, any thoughts on how momentum looks in 4Q and how you feel about competitive threats would be helpful."

So we haven't changed our feeling on th",670,"You got it, Doug. So first off, as you said, we're still clearly in a fluid environment. To be clear though, the fundamentals of the business are very strong, and there's a really long runway of growth in broadband. So we haven't changed our feeling on that at all. 
We have a terrific network. It's scaled, it's ubiquitous, and it continues to perform exceptionally well. And we're in a good position for the future. So we haven't changed our view on the long-term trajectory of the connectivity business. I'm just as confident and optimistic in the prospects for this business as I've ever been. 
So when you look at the whole year, I think it underscores the strength of broadband. Year-to-date, we've added over 1.1 million net additions, and we've been adding over 1 million broadband subscribers each year for the past 20 years. 
And as you said, while the pace in Q3 was slower than we saw earlier in the year during the height of the pandemic, our broadband net adds are still very healthy, and our churn remains at record lows, certainly for Q3. I think it's important to look at the current environment. And I think that points a little bit, Doug, to what you're talking about. 
And kind of just a couple of drivers to call out. One, when you look at the slowdown and Mike talked about this earlier, there have been a slowdown in connects across our footprint. And we look very closely at the move activity. There's more activity earlier in the year around moves, slower now. And certainly, the last couple of months below 2019 levels, in terms of moves. So a little bit less college student activity, not alarmingly so, but just a little bit less and just a little bit less switching activity overall. 
I think if you look at other operators, everyone's churn is down. So that means just some less jump balls where we do well. I think the other thing to call out in terms of drivers, we're seeing less growth from the lower income segment. We're still adding customers in this segment, but not at the same rate as earlier. There are new government programs like EBB. We're seeing traditional wireless, not fixed wireless, but traditional wireless participate, be very active in this program. 
And last point on competition. Look, we take it all very seriously. And we've been in a very competitive situation for some time. Our focus has not wavered. We innovate. We deliver the best product for each segment. We break the market down in terms of segments, and we compete at a very local level. We have our granular view literally at the block level geographically and by each segment from HSV only to multiple product households. 
So you add it all up, our churn remains at record lows, whether it's fiber, whether -- or not. And we look at our competitors' performance overall to ours historically and now, and I think this says it all. 
So as for expectations for full year results, while current visibility and overall activity creates a little bit of modest risk, we still believe full year net adds will be around 2019 levels. So overall, when you look at this year, and you go back to 2019, 2019 was the second best year that we've had in well over a decade. It's just a terrific year. And so for us to be at that level and the consistency that we've had has been so strong, and you point to the fundamentals. 
There are some things that we're on, but like always, you attack them, and you break them down. But I really like the fundamentals and the momentum that we have. So I think the runway is absolutely still there. And the last point is business services, a very important part of the connectivity story. And there, I love their momentum as well. So you add it all up, I like where we're at with connectivity."

That's what's so great about the 32 million broadband customers that we have. We have a recurring business. So while maybe there was a pull forward, maybe there's a slowdown, time will tell as your question suggests. 
We're looking at how do we grow EBITDA, how do we grow margins, how do we maintain and offer more product connectivity, kind of the very first thing we talked about, what else can you do with broadband, what will broadband evolve to over the next 5, 10 years. So we're super focused on minute to minute, but we're also, I think Dave put in context just how good we feel and it's certainly business services, the same kind of innovation that we've been doing in residential we're doing in business services. 
And so it's not some change in market conditions that really we've all been reading about. While there may be coming and maybe there's some of that, I actually think it's personally the disruption from the pandemic, coupled with a large percentage of Americans have broadband.

And we have products and different prices that allow customers to come to our company. 
We're getting close to nearly 60 million customer relationships, I think, 57 million or 58 million global relationships. And these are $100 a month plus type relationships.

So everything on Peacock is heading in the right direction, and there's really nothing from a trajectory perspective that's any different than it was last quarter or the quarter before. All metrics are pointed up. Our usage continues to be great. Our mix of users continues to be great. We added a few million more subs, more MAAs, everything. Advertising, we -- in this quarter, we just at the tail end of the quarter, we started selling advertising beyond sponsorship of which in the fourth quarter, it's all beyond sponsorship. And that is going spectacularly well. So we're really pleased with Peacock. It's way ahead of where we expected to be at this point. And every month, every quarter, it gets further ahead. And as you were talking about the business overall for next year, I was getting excited because we're very excited about next year with everything that we've got coming across NBCUniversal from the Olympics to the Super Bowl to a spectacular movie slate to a very strong advertising business, ratings, our linear networks improving. 
And I think Peacock -- I would add to that, that Peacock is doing really well right now without most of its programming strength. So if you look at the future, and you look at where we're headed with Peacock, we have -- because of the pandemic, we were behind on our original production. So we're going to start to see a ramp-up in originals on Peacock, which is very necessary to continue to grow to have successful and robust original programming. And we're excited about a lot of the things that we're making for the service. 
We decided to buy our first window as we talked about last call of our movies. So our Pay-One rights, so to speak. And the first movie in our Pay-One rights will hit Peacock in the first quarter, and then we'll have a steady supply of movies. We've seen across all streaming platforms that movies move the dial. They moved the dial for Peacock in this quarter with Boss Baby, recently with Halloween Kills, which, by the way, was a huge hit on the Peacock and a huge hit at the box office. So it shows that you can kind of play in 2 different markets. 
So we have all of our movies coming to Peacock, and we couldn't be more excited about where Peacock is. And we'll continue to invest behind that success. I think it's important to remember, too, that we launched just over a year ago. We launched in July of last year. So we've been a business for just over a year. We're already more than 1/3 of where Hulu is now, which is a service has been more than decades in the making.

I guess, first, the way I would question sort of we've seen some data that suggests that your WiFi is offloading a lot more traffic than we would have expected from the contract. So that the gross margins of that business may be much more -- much higher than we had previously believed. 
It makes me wonder, what's the strategic goal for that business? Is it really to drive the business into being the largest, most profitable business it can be? Or is it still largely to reduce churn on broadband and think of it as more of a defensive product for protecting your existing business? 
And then if I could just squeeze in a second unrelated question. Can you just update us on your thoughts of Hulu, which, I guess, doesn't necessarily come up until 2024? But is there any opportunity that you might do something with Hulu sooner?"

So I don't think -- we really haven't changed our strategic imperative behind mobile. But most certainly, things have accelerated and that we are very focused on how we leverage mobile to support broadband. 
Once we were successfully worked on the Verizon relationship and improved the MVNO relationship, we're able to go to market with and launching the new unlimited plans, combining that with By the Gig, just puts us in a unique position. So I think our goal is what we said earlier is to go faster and leverage mobile completely and everything that we do and how we surround broadband with a terrific product. I think it is profitable. It'll continue to be. I feel confident of that. 
But the main focus is to drive broadband. And there are a couple of key things. One, it is -- it continues to support the broadband churn and pointing towards record low broadband overall churns. Mobile is just one piece of that. But it also drives consideration on the front end. So when things -- some -- the activity overall begins to tick back up, I think retail and mobile play a huge role. As you pointed out, I think the other key point is how do we leverage product integration with WiFi. We already do a great job, thus the -- every mobile device we contribute just a ton of broadband traffic through these mobile devices over our WiFi network, and it's part of our network. 
So over time, we want to work hard on how do we integrate the experience and just do more so I think in the home and we'll be opportunistic outside the home. So I think it's -- we're accelerating mobile every single sales channel, every marketing plan. And we'll continue to package mobile with broadband in unique ways going forward."

And we're constantly adding speeds. We've improved coverage, great devices, the gateways, the pods, control improvements that we've had, streaming with the Flex, now XClass and mobile. We're surrounding broadband with products that uses some of the pressure around pricing when you can package with so many alternatives.

And so it is -- we go, and we consult with the prospects upfront and customers all the time what's best for them. And we put them in packages that work and that gives an opportunity to drive ARPU when you do it that way. So overall, the fundamentals, again, I talked about.

Well, I think it's a perfect way to end the call, Phil, with your question. Let me again state that I think it was a great quarter. And one of the highlights of the quarter was returning after several years to what we have, our target leverage ratio, which Mike talked about. 
And so we sort of separate, at least I do in my mind, the borrowing from the buybacks. They're not linked the way you described. It may appear that way. And I just want to give a compliment to our treasury team, Jason Armstrong and the team. During the last 18 months, our balance sheet has now never been in a stronger position. 
We've done some long-term rollovers and extensions at historically low rates. And so you put all that together with this operating performance, and it does get us back to where we wanted to be, which will then allow us to more aggressively take advantage of what a number of us believe is a great company. And therefore, you can put your own value on it as shareholders. 
But we certainly are looking forward to buying back stock. And I think Mike described the logic well in the ratios. And all in all, a really great quarter. So thank you, team, and thanks for your support on the call to the shareholders. Marci, over to you."
