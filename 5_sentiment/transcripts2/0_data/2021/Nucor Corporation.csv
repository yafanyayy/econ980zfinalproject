We hope everyone on the call is having a good start to the year and staying safe and healthy.

We hope everyone on the call is having a good start to the year and staying safe and healthy. The last 12 months have been incredibly challenging on so many different levels. The pandemic has impacted businesses, end markets and taken a tremendous toll on so many that have cared for and lost loved ones during this time. The distractions we have faced as a nation and as a company are significant, yet, the Nucor team has never lost its way in delivering the safest year in our history. Let me repeat that again. 2020 was the safest year in the history of our company. I'm extremely grateful for the hard work, dedication, ownership of our nearly 27,000 team members who made this result possible. While there still is a great deal of work ahead of us in our journey to become the world's safest steel company, I am more convinced than ever that this team will accomplish our goal. To our Nucor teammates, thank you. I am proud for you all. Well done. Now let's make 2021, our safest year ever. 
Joining me today on the call are the members of Nucor's executive team, including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sumoski, Chief Operating Officer; Al Behr, responsible for Plate and Structural Products; Craig Feldman, responsible for Raw Materials; Doug Jellison, responsible for DJJ and Logistics; Greg Murphy, responsible for business services and our General Counsel; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products; Rex, responsible for Sheet and Tubular Products; MaryEmily Slate, responsible for our commercial strategy; Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction Products; and Dan Needham, who will be joining our Charlotte team on February 1 and be responsible for Bar Products. 
At the end of the year, we announced several changes to our executive team. Dave Sumoski was promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Dave has been with Nucor since 1995 and has led multiple steel product groups and strategic initiatives, most recently, combining our domestic rebar steel mill and fabrication businesses. Dave is uniquely positioned to help Nucor continue to build lasting partnerships while executing our enterprise-wide strategy. 
MaryEmily Slate has taken on a new role as Executive Vice President for Commercial. This is the first time we have had an EVP level leader in this role at Nucor. The purpose is to enhance our ability to focus on our key markets and to better connect with our customers. Meeting the future needs of our customers while maintaining and maximizing the benefits of the broad and diversified offering of Nucor will be a vital function of MaryEmily's team as we move forward. 
I'd also like to welcome 4 new team members to our executive team, Rex, Doug Jellison, Greg Murphy and Dan Needham. Each of these executive management team promotions will enhance our ability to serve our customers and our shareholders. 
Business conditions remained strong in the fourth quarter with improving pricing and healthy volumes across our diverse product portfolio. Of particular note, utilization rates at our sheet mills and plate mills continue their sharp upturn in the fourth quarter. While we were pleased with our operating performance and cash flow for the period, our earnings were impacted by noncash charges, which were more than offset by tax benefits recognized in the quarter. The most substantial of these were related to our agreement to exit from the Duferdofin-Nucor joint venture and the impairment charge writing down the value of our Castrip operations, both of which impacted our steel mill segment earnings. 
The capabilities of our new state-of-the-art cold mill and the generation 3 galvanizing line, we have under construction at Nucor Arkansas have diminished our utilization of Castrip. We do plan on continuing to fully support existing customers as well as the technology to further improve Castrip's product offerings for Castrip licensees. 
The noncash charge that we recorded upon exiting the Duferdofin-Nucor joint venture was actually more than offset by a tax benefit related to our investment. So it did not hurt our net income for the quarter. Jim Frias will elaborate more in his opening remarks. 
Turning now to comment on 2020 as a whole. The year ended up much stronger than anyone would have anticipated when the pandemic first took hold of our global economy in March of last year. Our team and our business model proved to be incredibly resilient, and we were able to take advantage of the stronger-than-expected recovery because of the Nucor team doing an excellent job keeping our mills running reliably and safely throughout the volatility that characterized 2020. This allowed us to reliably fulfill our customers' requirements. Our focus remains on continuing to deliver a differentiated value proposition to meet and exceed our customers' needs. 
Looking at specific end-use markets, construction remains strong throughout the pandemic and automotive was quick to recover in the second half of the year after shutting down in the second quarter. Together, these 2 markets account for nearly 2/3 of steel consumption. We are aware of certain leading indicators signaling a downturn in nonres construction activity. But so far, we don't see much evidence of that. Our company is well positioned in attractive subsegments of the nonres construction market. There are areas of strength, most notably, warehouses and data centers, that may not be fully reflected in the ABI and other indicators. We have worked to build relationships in these subsegments that are bright spots, ensuring that we are providing the best solutions across steelmaking and steel products to serve those customers. 
We are cautiously optimistic that a significant infrastructure spending bill will be passed by Congress and signed by the new President this year. After years of talk, this must get done. We are still driving on roads and bridges designed and built during the Eisenhower administration. This is not sustainable. We would not be surprised if a funding bill focused in part on green infrastructure spending, including renewable power generation and transmission. Nucor is well positioned to meet our country's needs of environmentally friendly steel and steel products. With roughly 50% of our steel used in the construction sector, there is arguably no company more poised and ready to meet the needs of rebuilding our country than Nucor. 
In the automotive market, we believe demand should continue its rebound. We think 2021 light vehicle production in North America will be around 16 million vehicles. Having wrapped up the fall contract season, we feel good about our prospects for continuing share gains in the automotive market. 
The investments we have made at our sheet mills in Arkansas and in Kentucky to expand our production of value-added products are paying off. Demand from the oil and gas sector continues to be weak even as oil prices have been rising along with many other commodities. I think that significant continued improvement in that market is going to depend on how quickly vaccines can get out to a large number of people and how long it takes for commuting and travel patterns to approach pre-pandemic levels. 
Strong demand growth from the renewable energy sector has partially offset the weakness in oil. Our sales to the renewable power sector have been very strong this year with steelmaking segment orders related to these markets growing by double digits compared to the 2019 total. The renewable power market is one Nucor is targeting, and many of our steel and steel products are essential to its continued buildout. We rely primarily on recycled steel to make these products, and they themselves are 100% recyclable. This fact positions us well as a supplier of choice here as we see sustainability and product transparency becoming a more important factor in product sourcing decisions in the renewable power sector and in most other end-use markets. We are also seeing signs that other end-use markets will rebound from this past year's depressed levels, including heavy-duty trucks, heavy equipment and agriculture. 
Turning to our strategic growth projects. We continue to make excellent progress on them during the fourth quarter. Our new rebar micro mill in Frostproof, Florida started up operations on schedule in December. Congratulations to the entire Nucor Steel Florida team, for getting this new steel mill up and running on time and for doing it safely. 
This past October, we celebrated the groundbreaking of our new steel plate mill in Kentucky. Our Nucor Steel Brandenburg team has done a great job keeping the project on schedule throughout this year, and we are moving at full speed to bring the state-of-the-art plate mill to market during the fourth quarter of 2022. 
We're also making great progress on our expansion project at our Gallatin sheet mill. The expansion project is expected to start up in the second half of this year. With regard to some of our facilities that are in operation, I'm pleased to report the new pickle galvanizing line at Gallatin had an excellent first full year of operation, despite the pandemic, shipping 39% more tons than we projected when we approved the project. Year 1 profitability was also ahead of plan. Gallatin's entry into the value-added coated sheet market has proven very timely with the strong flat-rolled market conditions that emerged in the second half of 2020 and are continuing into Q1 2021. We have experienced very strong customer acceptance of Gallatin's coated product as we further develop target markets that include automotive, solar, tubing, roll forming, grain storage, culvert and cooling towers. 
Also, the new cold mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas has gotten off to a strong start with shipments almost 30% ahead of our initial plan for the mill. Strong customer acceptance rates following trials were conducted throughout 2020 mean that the new mill is now booked out for this year at 85% of its nameplate capacity for contract customers. We are looking forward to running our first prime coil off our new Gen 3 galv line at Arkansas this year. This is slightly behind our original schedule due primarily to the slowdown in capital expenditures we instituted around the beginning of the pandemic. 
Our new rebar micro mill in Sedalia has also exceeded our expectations. The team there generated a solid operating profit during the most recent quarter, and its spooled rebar product continues to be well received by our customers. At our galvanizing line joint venture with JFE in Mexico, we were back up running after government-mandated shutdown and beginning to ship coils to automotive customers. Congratulations to the team there. 
Our Kankakee, Illinois bar mill completed commissioning of its new MBQ rolling mill in December. While the time line of this project was slightly extended due to COVID-related disruptions, customer acceptance of the new products has been extremely strong. We expect to achieve positive cash flow from this investment in Q1. Construction on upgrades to Kankakee's meltshop, including a new caster station will begin in earnest in February with final commissioning of this equipment expected in Q4 of this year. This investment will significantly improve the energy efficiency of the Kankakee mill. 
Before I turn the call over to Jim, let me give a shout out to our teammates at Louisiana DRI operations. As many of you are aware, we took some downtime at Louisiana in 2019 and have invested approximately $200 million to enhance operational reliability there. It has really paid off. In 2020, the Nucor Steel Louisiana team set new records for production, shipping and operating hours. Most importantly, our team there accomplished all of this while operating safely for more than 450 consecutive days. Later this quarter, we will finish our work improving Louisiana's ore yard. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jim to provide more details about our financial performance and outlook for the first part of 2021. Jim?"
184945,700518326,2184404,"Nucor Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Leon.

Fourth quarter earnings of $1.30 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $1.15 to $1.20 per diluted share. As detailed in our news release, results for the just completed quarter included a number of nonoperational items that were not included in our guidance. After-tax effects, again, for the items not included in our guidance, the total impact was produced net income by just under $34 million or approximately $0.11 per diluted share. Earnings significantly exceeded our guidance as the pace of margin expansion at our steel mills surpassed our expectations. Conditions improved for many of our businesses throughout the quarter and now are the strongest they've been in some years. As Leon mentioned, and as detailed in our news release, we were able to claim tax deductions related to our investment in Duferdofin-Nucor joint venture that more than offset the related loss on assets we recorded in the fourth quarter. 
Cash provided by operating activities for full year 2020 was $2.7 billion. Nucor's free cash flow or cash provided by operations minus capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2020, comfortably exceeding cash dividends paid to stockholders of $492 million. Over the last 3 years, Nucor has generated $3.9 billion of free cash flow, even as we reinvested $4 billion in our businesses. 
As mentioned on previous calls, we have intensified our focus on maintaining appropriate working capital levels and reducing the asset base we require to generate strong profitability. I am happy to report that even as steel market demand and pricing has rebounded strongly in recent months, our tons of raw material inventory are actually down by more than 6% from the prior year-end. 
At the close of the fourth quarter, our cash, short-term investments and restricted cash holdings totaled just under $3.2 billion. Nucor's liquidity also includes our undrawn $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which matures in April of 2023. Total long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5.3 billion. Gross debt as a percent of total capital was 32%, while net debt represented 13% of total capital. 
The flexibility provided by Nucor's low-cost operating model and financial strength continues to be a critical underpinning to our company's ability to grow long-term earnings power and return capital to our shareholders. Dividends and share repurchases totaled $531 million or 74% of net income during 2020. And with the dividend increase announced in December, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 48 consecutive years every year since we first began paying dividends in 1973. 
Speaking of growing long-term earnings power, let me take a moment to provide a brief rundown on where we stand on some of our organic growth projects. Three projects started operations in 2019: a new specialty cold rolling mill at our Arkansas sheet mill; a rolling mill modernization at our Ohio rebar mill; and a hot band galvanizing line at our Kentucky sheet mill. Another 4 projects started production during 2020: our rebar micro mill in Missouri; our Illinois merchant bar rolling mill; our joint venture sheet steel galvanizing line in Mexico; and our Florida rebar micro mill. The remaining 3 projects are: the expansion and modernization of our Kentucky sheet mill; our generation 3 flexible galvanizing line at our Arkansas sheet mill; and our Kentucky plate mill. At the close of 2020, remaining capital expenditures for these 3 are approximately $1.9 billion with the Kentucky plate mill project representing about 3/4 of that total. We expect that Nucor's total capital spending for 2021 will be in the area of $2 billion. Approximately 80% of the 2021 spending is to improve product capabilities and reduce costs. 
Turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2021. As Leon indicated, we are encouraged by a number of positive factors impacting our markets. We expect earnings in the first quarter of 2021 to be significantly higher than our reported results for the fourth quarter of 2020. The expected performance of the Steel Mill segment in the first quarter of 2021 is the primary driver for this increase as our sheet, plate, bar and structural mills are all forecasting increased profitability. Our downstream steel product segment's performance in the first quarter is expected to decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to typical seasonal patterns and some margin compression due to a lag between rising steel input costs and increased selling prices. The Raw Materials segment's performance in the first quarter is expected to be significantly improved due to higher raw materials selling prices. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. Leon?"

Our crystal ball probably isn't significantly better than yours. So let me just share a few thoughts with you, though. We certainly do anticipate a near-term correction in the month of February, which, I guess, is not all that surprising given the nearly $200 increase that we've seen in the last 90 days or so. In fact, we've already seen some international scrap prices, notably Turkey falling here just really in the recent days. So we certainly see some moderate corrections from the January levels especially on obsolete grades, which are highly elastic and where flows have really been pretty good recently. Prime scrap grades are also likely to moderate a bit but we don't believe it will fall as much as the obsolete grades. February pricing would likely be down $30 to $50 a ton depending on both the grade and the region. But we'd certainly characterize that as, I would say, a fairly normal correction given the size of the recent run-up in prices. 
And just a couple of other things, and Leon alluded to this in his opening remarks, but there's some other factors that work here, too. The overall commodity price environment is pretty darn solid. And I don't think Leon mentioned this, but a relatively weak dollar really could help put a floor under that and really sustain the general commodity environment. 
The other thing I would point to, there are some seasonal factors. The month of February, is typically a pretty weak month for scrap pricing overall. And meanwhile, March typically sees higher prices. So -- and we track this pretty closely with some heat maps, as you might imagine, Seth. Historically, scrap prices in the calendar month of February are either flat or down around 70% of the time, and we're going back to the last 20 years or so. And March is the exact opposite of that with prices rising or flat around 70% of the time. So we certainly could see some exceptions to those trends, but we really believe that, this year, we'll follow that more typical seasonal pattern, if you will. So bottom line, our near-term view on scrap pricing has some downward pressure and is likely to stabilize after that. 
And if I may, one final comment on this. Just an observation with regard to scrap and steel pricing and this may not be fully apparent or intuitive to most folks. But scrap prices follow steel pricing and not the other way around. Again, steel demand and steel pricing lead scrap demand and scrap pricing. And as Jim and Leon alluded to in their opening remarks, our view is pretty darn optimistic right now. So hopefully, that gives you some color."

Roughly $250 million of this is going to be on Gallatin and roughly another $100 billion is going be on completing the galvanizing line in Arkansas. And we have about $1.9 billion overall on those 3 projects going forward.

And as we've talked before, there is a lag in contract pricing. It's usually done on a monthly or quarterly basis, and we're really well positioned. You saw that increase in fourth quarter, but we're really well positioned going into 2021 with a healthy contract versus spot mix. And I think one area to note is that almost 20% of our sheet capacity is dedicated to internal downstream customers, including full craft building systems and Nucor tubular. And each of these businesses are growing, doing very well, projecting very good years. And our backlog right now is close to historic high, and it's about 50% better than this time last year. And so as I stated, that 20% is for internal downstream customers, and then we also have about 50% to 55% of our capacity locked up with external customer contracts. The pricing follows the market on a monthly or quarterly basis. Does that answer your question?"

And I understand that you have contract business, and I don't expect you to detail it and to all your customers on the line and all that. But if you only achieved 1/3 of the spot price increase in the last quarter, then that would suggest that you have contract tons that are absorbing more than half of your quarter-over-quarter move just back in the envelope. So I'm just wondering do we expect like the similar contract percentages of fixed versus variable or lag variable into the future? Has anything changed in your contact structure? And is it possible to regain the volumes you did in the first quarter? Or is the fourth quarter a better run rate?"

So again, that exact breakdown, as you described on the back of the end, we're not going to give out on this call. But at the end of the day, there's a lag effect on the way up and as well on the way down. And so our expectation, as we move forward, yes, there is obviously more opportunity because the price increases that we've had and, certainly, the movements that you've seen in the indices like CRU, we think, are going to move forward and stay strong. 
In terms of the volume, our sheet mills are operating at an incredibly high utilization rate at their capacity. And so that, we see continuing. And again, I think their production levels will stay very high."

Now the reason the shipments are so different compared to the first quarter, we may have had some extra inventory at the end of 2019 that helped us boost our shipments. We do have more downstream processing now with more galvanizing lines. So the WIP inventory in our system is probably a little higher when we think about the WIP that's sitting at Gallatin that would have just gone straight to -- shipped in the past. So there's other factors that come into play in terms of the timing of shipment versus production, but we would expect to have a strong shipping month in the first quarter as well as a strong production month."

And look, as we look out to the long term, as the mix continues to shift from integrated mills to EAFs and, again, we're about 70% of the steel-making capacity today in the United States, the EAF sector is -- the demand on prime scrap is going to stay very tight. That's going to increase. And as we've pointed out on previous calls, because we need more prime, the automakers aren't going to make more units because the steel mills meet that scrap. So the high metallics, the quality metallics side of things and controlling our own downstream input to that for us is really very strategic. And so I don't think we're at the point where we're going to increase that. But the things that we're doing every day to continue to maximize that, the investments in Louisiana and continuing some of those investments in the ore yard to increase the efficiency and increase the yield and throughputs, there will be areas of that. But again, as we move forward, I do see as more EAF-based mills come online and the demand as we move up the value chain even for ourselves in automotive is going to put continued pressure on the prime market. Craig, anything you'd like to add to that?"

There is a lot of dialogue around this topic, and it's something that we've been thinking about for -- frankly, for years. And we do agree with the assertion that high-quality metallics, as Leon just said, will become tighter going forward. Even obsolete grades, we do envision that getting tighter with the conversion from integrated to EAF. And maybe what I'd like to talk about more is what we've been doing and preparing for in that regard and how -- what we've been doing with our overall raw material strategy, if I could. And I guess, the key to that strategy really is around our flexibility and optionality, and it's really around 3 key components that give us access to, and influence over, our total raw material needs. And first of all, and we talk about this a lot with regard to the DRI plants, but our capability there is roughly 4 million tons of high-quality material. And those plants, the 2 DRI plants, really can reach all of our DRI consuming mills on the river or the East Coast in a very economical or freight logical way. And as Leon alluded to, the Louisiana team really has made tremendous progress to improve the production and the reliability. And meanwhile, and sometimes it gets overlooked as the new team in Trinidad just keeps chugging along and they've got a long history of low-cost production and really world-class quality and reliability in the way they produce DRI. 
And the second leg of this is really the David Joseph company, or DJJ's, recycling operations with 4 million to 5 million tons a year of ferrous processing capacity, and they're just really well positioned to supply our own mills. Most of these DJJ locations, and there's about 65 sites in total, are focused on producing scrap again within the freight logical range of our own mills. And we continue to, I would say, opportunistically add capacity to the DJJ processing platform as we did in the last 18 months or so with a handful of tuck-in acquisitions, including a couple of shredders. 
And finally, the third leg of the overall strategy is, again, the DJJ brokerage and trading team really gives excellent coverage of both the domestic and international markets on a third-party supply basis, which we think is a big advantage. And I know the DJJ brokerage team prides itself on knowing its supply base extremely well and has access to scrap substitutes not only in the U.S. but globally. And for example, the team did a really nice job here recently with the tightness in supply, which I do believe, Timna, back to your question, is symptomatic of what we're going to see in the future, but they've been able to capitalize on both some, I would say, long-standing relationships with key supply partners but also went to some areas of the world that we haven't been to in a long time, and they've done a really good job with that to secure all the material we need despite those supply constraints. 
So to sum it up, yes, we certainly envision that the metallics market could and probably will tighten up, but the flexibility and the options that we have from our own DRI scrap processing assets of around 8 million or 9 million tons a year in total, along with the third-party relationships, that gives us the access and influence just on the material that we have our own assets dedicated to give us about 1/3 of our total metallics demand covered. So that 8 million to 9 million tons really represents about 1/3. 
So yes, I feel very confident, very comfortable on our ability to economically and efficiently secure metallic needs going forward. Will there be the normal market gyrations? Of course. But I feel like our strategy is well established, and we're in a good spot to navigate it well. Hopefully, it gives you a little extra color, Timna."

But at the end of the day, 2020 was, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, certainly a very challenging year. And at the same time, Carlos, Nucor, in our downstream businesses, we had 3 product groups that set record for profitability. And so we ended up in a very, very strong position. And again, as we move forward, look at order entry rates and backlogs were at or near historic highs. And so while we expect to see some compression there, the recent price increases, our metal margins are actually going to continue to grow in most businesses. Again, certainly, the downstream side will face a little bit of compression. But again, it's coming off, again, in most of our downstream near record profitability standpoint. So again, we do see it staying very strong as we move forward. 
To your point around working capital, that's something that we, as a team, I'm really proud of our executive leadership team. At the onset of this pandemic in February of last year, we met, and we put some things in place with our leadership across all of the mills and operations to be incredibly disciplined and to have very, very deliberate steps to manage our working inventory and scrap within finished goods. And that discipline. And well, that discipline is going to continue, and it has continued, and so we're not long. As we think about the product groups. We're not long in scrap, we're not long in with and we're not long in the steel mills providing to our downstream product group. So we feel very good about the true cycle profitability of all of our businesses. Chad, any comments you'd like to add on the product segment?"

I want to echo what was said by Leon and Jim about the forward look that we see in nonres construction and for most of our downstream businesses, and we are very excited as we enter 2021. And I know there are some sources out there that are indicating nonres may not be as strong as perhaps we say it is or even looking into the future. But we derive our business outlook from numerous sources but we do put a heavy emphasis on our customer input and our internal order entry data points. And we're excited, as many of our downstream businesses have very strong backlogs and as, in some cases, we have a record backlog, all-time record backlogs as we head into 2021. And also, we monitor our recent quoting activity. And I can tell you, in a lot of our businesses, over the last 4, 5, 6, 7 weeks, we've seen activity rise. 
I want to repeat something Jim Frias said in his opening comments. And while we respect and do monitor the industry trade group data, we offer that some of the rising nonres construction arenas may not be fully reflected in that architectural data. So our strong relationships with key customers, our breadth of product that we offer to the market, I guess I would just summarize by saying we're excited as we head into 2021. There will be some compression in some of our downstream businesses with rising steel costs, but those prices are being passed on in the marketplace, are being accepted, and we look forward to the coming months. Thanks, Leon"

Leon touched on how the team got together and was very thoughtful about managing working capital as a result of the crisis. We also were very thoughtful about the volatility downward in pricing that we were seeing last summer and not getting caught up in that and taking too much business on our books at below market pricing. And so that discipline has positioned us well as we go into 2021 to not have a lot of low-priced backlog to work through. And so yes, with the extreme movement in steel pricing we've seen in the last 90 days, there is some minor compression in downstream business, but it's going to be minor. So that's the first point. 
And then back to your question on working capital. We think volumes of working capital, if you think about it on a tons basis, will be similar. Scrap prices will be relatively flat. So we think inventory values will be relatively flat, but receivables values will go up because steel mill pricing on average selling prices will be higher in Q1 than they were in Q4. So we'll let you estimate what you think average prices are going up, but take that times the amount of tons we ship, and that should be the build of working capital for 1 month because we basically collect receivables in about 30 days. And I guess that's pretty much it. So thank you for the question."

And then there's another project that is being worked on that our team has asked us to keep silent on because they're still negotiating some things. But it's in the mid-$100 million range, a $150 million range kind of a project. We'll talk more about that in the future once some things are finalized in terms of negotiations."

And then secondly, just following up on Timna's question around metallic. If we go back 12, 18 months ago, there was quite a bit of chat in the marketplace that some of the North American integrated mills might be interested in selling pig iron. Haven't really heard much about that recently. And obviously, some of the structure there has changed on the integrated side. From where you sit, is that something that seems like it could be possible at some point? And would that help ease up some of the potential tightness in prime scrap?"

And so if those integrators can come back on and produce pig iron at a competitive price, we will absolutely be lining up and purchasing our pig iron domestically. But again, that certainly is a challenge. We'll see what happens. And to your point, several of our competitors have talked about restarts in doing just that. And we'll see how that unfolds and as we move forward. But that's -- I'm certainly not going to speak to their strategies and executing. But again, it's got to be at a price competitive standpoint.

We'll be in that range when we do our tax return in August as a result of the great work our tax team did this year. And I will do a shout-out to a few folks. Bev Douglas is our international tax manager. She's the one who figured out the opportunity to take advantage of the work the stock deduction that allowed us to capture so much value after we made the decision to exit the DN. And then, of course, the overall tax team, including all the managers, John Taylor, [ Amy Catel ] and the others just did a great job of doing all the year-end work that's necessary for us to come up with those figures. But we're going to have cash benefits beyond this year because of the accelerated depreciation on our big projects. And we think that, over the 3-year period, it's $575 million. If you give me a minute to look, I think next year's cash benefit is going to be in the neighborhood of $240 million and the year after that, when we finalize Gallatin because that's going to be the -- or excuse me, Brandenberg, that's going to be the biggest impactor, it's going to be north of $330 million cash benefit. But our book rate should be in a normalized range of that 24%, which includes the federal and state rate, assuming there's no tax increase during that time period."

We hope everyone on the call is having a good start to the year and staying safe and healthy. The last 12 months have been incredibly challenging on so many different levels. The pandemic has impacted businesses and markets and taken a tremendous toll on so many that have cared for and lost loved ones during this time. The distractions we have faced as a nation and as a company are significant, yet the Nucor team has never lost its way in delivering the safest year in our history. Let me repeat that again. 2020 was the safest year in the history of our company. I'm extremely grateful for the hard work, dedication, ownership of our nearly 27,000 team members who made this result possible. While there still is a great deal of work ahead of us in our journey to become the world's safest steel company, I am more convinced than ever that this team will accomplish our goal. To our Nucor teammates, thank you. I am proud for you all. Well done. Now let's make 2021 our safest year ever.
Joining me today on the call are the members of Nucor's executive team, including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sumoski, Chief Operating Officer; Al Behr, responsible for Plate and Structural Products; Craig Feldman, responsible for Raw Materials; Doug Jellison, responsible for DJJ and Logistics; Greg Murphy, responsible for Business Services, and our General Counsel; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products; Rex Query, responsible for Sheet and Tubular Products; MaryEmily Slate, responsible for our Commercial Strategy; Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction Products; and Dan Needham, who will be joining our Charlotte team on February 1 and be responsible for Bar Products.
At the end of the year, we announced several changes to our executive team. Dave Sumoski was promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Dave has been with Nucor since 1995 and has led multiple steel product groups and strategic initiatives, most recently combining our domestic rebar, steel mill and fabrication businesses. Dave is uniquely positioned to help Nucor continue to build lasting partnerships while executing our enterprise-wide strategy.
MaryEmily Slate has taken on a new role as Executive Vice President for Commercial. This is the first time we have had an EVP-level leader in this role at Nucor. The purpose is to enhance our ability to focus on our key markets and to better connect with our customers. Meeting the future needs of our customers while maintaining and maximizing the benefits of the broad and diversified offering of Nucor will be a vital function of MaryEmily's team as we move forward.
I would also like to welcome 4 new team members to our executive team, Rex Query, Doug Jellison, Greg Murphy and Dan Needham. Each of these executive management team promotions will enhance our ability to serve our customers and our shareholders.
Business conditions remained strong in the fourth quarter, with improving pricing and healthy volumes across our diverse product portfolio. Of particular note, utilization rates at our sheet mills and plate mills continue their sharp upturn in the fourth quarter. While we were pleased with our operating performance and cash flow for the period, our earnings were impacted by noncash charges, which were more than offset by tax benefits recognized in the quarter. The most substantial of these were related to our agreement to exit from the Duferdofin-Nucor joint venture and the impairment charge writing down the value of our Castrip operations, both of which impacted our steel mills segment earnings.
The capabilities of our new state-of-the-art cold mill and the Generation 3 galvanizing line we have under construction at Nucor Arkansas have diminished our utilization of Castrip. We do plan on continuing to fully support existing customers as well as the technology to further improve Castrip's product offerings for Castrip licensees.
The noncash charge that we recorded upon exiting the Duferdofin-Nucor joint venture was actually more than offset by a tax benefit related to our investment, so it did not hurt our net income for the quarter. Jim Frias will elaborate more in his opening remarks.
Turning now to comment on 2020 as a whole. The year ended up much stronger than anyone would have anticipated when the pandemic first took hold of our global economy in March of last year. Our team and our business model proved to be incredibly resilient, and we were able to take advantage of the stronger-than-expected recovery because of the Nucor team doing an excellent job keeping our mills running reliably and safely throughout the volatility that characterized 2020. This allowed us to reliably fulfill our customers' requirements. Our focus remains on continuing to deliver a differentiated value proposition to meet and exceed our customers' needs.
Looking at specific end-use markets, construction remains strong throughout the pandemic, and automotive was quick to recover in the second half of the year after shutting down in the second quarter. Together, these 2 markets account for nearly 2/3 of steel consumption. We are aware of certain leading indicators signaling a downturn in nonres construction activity, but so far, we don't see much evidence of that. Our company is well positioned in attractive subsegments of the nonres construction market. There are areas of strength, most notably warehouses and data centers, that may not be fully reflected in the ABI and other indicators. We have worked to build relationships in these subsegments that are bright spots, ensuring that we are providing the best solutions across steelmaking and steel products to serve those customers.
We are cautiously optimistic that a significant infrastructure spending bill will be passed by Congress and signed by the new President this year. After years of talk, this must get done. We are still driving on roads and bridges designed and built during the Eisenhower administration. This is not sustainable. We would not be surprised if a funding bill focused in part on green infrastructure spending, including renewable power generation and transmission. Nucor is well positioned to meet our country's needs of environmentally friendly steel and steel products. With roughly 50% of our steel used in the construction sector, there is arguably no company more poised and ready to meet the needs of rebuilding our country than Nucor.
In the automotive market, we believe demand should continue its rebound. We think 2021 light vehicle production in North America will be around 16 million vehicles. Having wrapped up the fall contract season, we feel good about our prospects for continuing share gains in the automotive market.
The investments we have made at our sheet mills in Arkansas and in Kentucky to expand our production of value-added products are paying off. Demand from the oil and gas sector continues to be weak even as oil prices have been rising along with many other commodities. I think that significant continued improvement in that market is going to depend on how quickly vaccines can get out to a large number of people and how long it takes for commuting and travel patterns to approach pre-pandemic levels.
Strong demand growth from the renewable energy sector has partially offset the weakness in oil. Our sales to the renewable power sector have been very strong this year, with steelmaking segment orders related to these markets growing by double digits compared to the 2019 total. The renewable power market is what Nucor is targeting, and many of our steel and steel products are essential to its continued buildout. We rely primarily on recycled steel to make these products, and they themselves are 100% recyclable. This fact positions us well as the supplier of choice here as we see sustainability and product transparency becoming a more important factor in product sourcing decisions in the renewable power sector and in most other end-use markets. We are also seeing signs that other end-use markets will rebound from this past year's depressed levels, including heavy-duty trucks, heavy equipment and agriculture.
Turning to our strategic growth projects. We continue to make excellent progress on them during the fourth quarter. Our new rebar micromill in Frostproof, Florida started up operations on schedule in December. Congratulations to the entire Nucor Steel Florida team for getting this new steel mill up and running on time and for doing it safely.
This past October, we celebrated the groundbreaking of our new steel plate mill in Kentucky. Our Nucor Steel Brandenburg team has done a great job keeping the project on schedule throughout this year, and we are moving at full speed to bring the state-of-the-art plate mill to market during the fourth quarter of 2022.
We're also making great progress on our expansion project at our Gallatin sheet mill. The expansion project is expected to start up in the second half of this year. With regard to some of our facilities that are in operation, I'm pleased to report the new pickle galvanizing line at Gallatin had an excellent first full year of operation despite the pandemic, shipping 39% more tons than we projected when we approved the project. Year 1 profitability was also ahead of plan. Gallatin's entry into the value-added coated sheet market has proven very timely, with the strong flat-rolled market conditions that emerged in the second half of 2020 and are continuing into Q1 2021. We have experienced very strong customer acceptance of Gallatin's coated product as we further develop target markets that include automotive, solar, tubing, roll-forming, grain storage, culvert and cooling towers.
Also, the new cold mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas has gotten off to a strong start, with shipments almost 30% ahead of our initial plan for the mill. Strong customer acceptance rates following trials were conducted throughout 2020, mean that the new mill is now booked out for this year at 85% of its nameplate capacity for contract customers. We are looking forward to running our first prime coil off our new Gen 3 galv line at Arkansas later this year. This is slightly behind our original schedule due primarily to the slowdown in capital expenditures we instituted around the beginning of the pandemic.
Our new rebar micromill in Sedalia has also exceeded our expectations. The team there generated a solid operating profit during the most recent quarter, and its spooled rebar product continues to be well received by our customers. At our galvanizing line joint venture with JFE in Mexico, we were back up running after a government-mandated shutdown and beginning to ship coils to automotive customers. Congratulations to the team there.
Our Kankakee, Illinois bar mill completed commissioning of its new MBQ rolling mill in December. While the time line of this project was slightly extended due to COVID-related disruptions, customer acceptance of the new products has been extremely strong. We expect to achieve positive cash flow from this investment in Q1. Construction on upgrades to Kankakee's melt shop, including a new caster ladle stir station, will begin in earnest in February, with final commissioning of this equipment expected in Q4 of this year. This investment will significantly improve the energy efficiency of the Kankakee mill.
Before I turn the call over to Jim, let me give a shout out to our teammates at Louisiana DRI operations. As many of you are aware, we took some downtime at Louisiana in 2019 and have invested approximately $200 million to enhance operational reliability there. It has really paid off. In 2020, the Nucor Steel Louisiana team set new records for production, shipping and operating hours. Most importantly, our team there accomplished all of this while operating safely for more than 450 consecutive days. Later this quarter, we will finish our work improving Louisiana's ore yard.
With that, let me turn the call over to Jim to provide more details about our financial performance and outlook for the first part of 2021. Jim?"

As detailed in our news release, results for the just-completed quarter included a number of nonoperational items that were n",758,"Thanks, Leon. Fourth quarter earnings of $1.30 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $1.15 to $1.20 per diluted share. As detailed in our news release, results for the just-completed quarter included a number of nonoperational items that were not included in our guidance. After-tax effects, again for the items not included in our guidance, the total impact was produced net income by just under $34 million or approximately $0.11 per diluted share. Earnings significantly exceeded our guidance as the pace of margin expansion at our steel mills surpassed our expectations. Conditions improved for many of our businesses throughout the quarter and now are the strongest they have been in some years.
As Leon mentioned, and as detailed in our news release, we were able to claim tax deductions related to our investment in Duferdofin-Nucor joint venture that more than offset the related loss on assets we recorded in the fourth quarter.
Cash provided by operating activities for full year 2020 was $2.7 billion. Nucor's free cash flow or cash provided by operations minus capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2020, comfortably exceeding cash dividends paid to stockholders of $492 million. Over the last 3 years, Nucor has generated $3.9 billion of free cash flow, even as we reinvested $4 billion in our businesses.
As mentioned on previous calls, we have intensified our focus on maintaining appropriate working capital levels and reducing the asset base we require to generate strong profitability. I am happy to report that even as steel market demand and pricing has rebounded strongly in recent months, our tons of raw material inventory are actually down by more than 6% from the prior year-end.
At the close of the fourth quarter, our cash, short-term investments and restricted cash holdings totaled just under $3.2 billion. Nucor's liquidity also includes our undrawn $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which matures in April of 2023. Total long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5.3 billion. Gross debt as a percent of total capital was 32%, while net debt represented 13% of total capital.
The flexibility provided by Nucor's low-cost operating model and financial strength continues to be a critical underpinning to our company's ability to grow long-term earnings power and return capital to our shareholders. Dividends and share repurchases totaled $531 million or 74% of net income during 2020. And with the dividend increase announced in December, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 48 consecutive years, every year since we first began paying dividends in 1973.
Speaking of growing long-term earnings power, let me take a moment to provide a brief rundown on where we stand on some of our organic growth projects. 3 projects started operations in 2019: a new specialty cold-rolling mill at our Arkansas sheet mill; a rolling mill modernization at our Ohio rebar mill; and a hot band galvanizing line at our Kentucky sheet mill. Another 4 projects started production during 2020: our rebar micromill in Missouri; our Illinois merchant bar rolling mill; our joint venture sheet steel galvanizing line in Mexico; and our Florida rebar micromill. The remaining 3 projects are: the expansion and modernization of our Kentucky sheet mill; our Generation 3 flexible galvanizing line at our Arkansas sheet mill; and our Kentucky plate mill. At the close of 2020, remaining capital expenditures for these 3 are approximately $1.9 billion, with the Kentucky plate mill project representing about 3/4 of that total. We expect that Nucor's total capital spending for 2021 will be in the area of $2 billion. Approximately 80% of the 2021 spending is to improve product capabilities and reduce costs.
Turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2021. As Leon indicated, we are encouraged by a number of positive factors impacting our markets. We expect earnings in the first quarter of 2021 to be significantly higher than our reported results for the fourth quarter of 2020. The expected performance of the steel mills segment in the first quarter of 2021 is the primary driver for this increase as our sheet, plate, bar and structural mills are all forecasting increased profitability. Our downstream steel product segment's performance in the first quarter is expected to decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to typical seasonal patterns and some margin compression due to a lag between rising steel input costs and increased selling prices. The raw materials segment's performance in the first quarter is expected to be significantly improved due to higher raw materials selling prices.
Thank you for your interest in our company. Leon?"

Our crystal ball probably isn't significantly better than yours. So let me just share a few thoughts with you though. We certainly do anticipate a near-term correction in the month of February, which, I guess, is not all that surprising given the nearly $200 increase that we've seen in the last 90 days or so. In fact, we've already seen some international scrap prices, notably Turkey, fall here just really in the recent days. So we certainly see some moderate corrections from the January levels, especially on obsolete grades, which are highly elastic and where flows have really been pretty good recently.
Prime scrap grades are also likely to moderate a bit, but we don't believe it will fall as much as the obsolete grades. February pricing would likely be down $30 to $50 a ton depending on both the grade and the region. But we would certainly characterize that as, I would say, a fairly normal correction given the size of the recent run-up in prices.
And just a couple of other things, and Leon alluded to this in his opening remarks, but there are some other factors that work here, too. The overall commodity price environment is pretty darn solid. And I don't think Leon mentioned this, but a relatively weak dollar really could put -- help put a floor under that and really sustain the general commodity environment.
The other thing I would point to, there are some seasonal factors. The month of February is typically a pretty weak month for scrap pricing overall. And meanwhile, March typically sees higher prices. So -- and we track this pretty closely on -- with some heat maps, as you might imagine, Seth. Historically, scrap prices in the calendar month of February are either flat or down around 70% of the time, and we're going back to the last 20 years or so. And March is the exact opposite of that, with prices rising or flat around 70% of the time. So we certainly could see some exceptions to those trends, but we really believe that, this year, we'll follow that more typical seasonal pattern, if you will. So bottom line, our near-term view on scrap pricing has some downward pressure and is likely to stabilize after that.
And if I may, one final comment on this. Just an observation with regard to scrap and steel pricing, and this may not be fully apparent or intuitive to most folks, but scrap prices follow steel pricing and not the other way around. Again, steel demand and steel pricing lead scrap demand and scrap pricing. And as Jim and Leon alluded to in their opening remarks, our view is pretty darn optimistic right now. So hopefully, that gives you some color."

And I think one area of -- to note is that almost 20% of our sheet capacity is dedicated to internal downstream customers, including Vulcraft, Building System and Nucor Tubular. And each of these businesses are growing, doing very well, projecting very good years. And our backlog right now is at -- close to historic high, and it's about 50% better than this time last year.

Now the reason the shipments are so different compared to the first quarter, we may have had some extra inventory at the end of 2019 that helped us boost our shipments. We do have more downstream processing now with more galvanizing lines. So the WIP inventory in our system is probably a little higher when we think about the WIP that's sitting at Gallatin that would have just gone straight to us and shipped in the past. So there's other factors that come into play in terms of the timing of shipment versus production, but we would expect to have a strong shipping month in the first quarter as well as a strong production month."

And look, as we look out to the long term, as the mix continues to shift from integrated mills, to EAFs, and again, we're about 70% of the steelmaking capacity today in the United States, the EAF sector is, the demand on prime scrap is going to stay very tight, and that's going to now increase. And as we've pointed out on previous calls, because we need more prime, the automakers aren't going to make more units because the steel mills need that scrap. So the high metallics, the quality metallics side of things, and controlling our own downstream input to that, for us, is really very strategic.
And so I don't think we're at the point where we're going to increase that. But the things that we're doing everyday to continue to maximize that, the investments in Louisiana, and continuing some of those investments in the ore yard to increase the efficiency and increase the yield and throughputs there will be areas of that. But again, as we move forward, I do see as more EAF-based mills come online and the demand as we move up the value chain even for ourselves in automotive is going to put continued pressure on the prime market. Craig, anything you would like to add to that?"

There is a lot of dialogue around this topic, and it's something that we've been thinking about for, frankly, for years. And we do agree with the assertion that high-quality metallics, as Leon just said, will become tighter going forward. Even obsolete grades, we do envision that getting tighter with the conversion from integrated to EAF.
And maybe what I would like to talk about more is what we've been doing and preparing for in that regard and how -- what we've been doing with our overall raw materials strategy, if I could. And I guess, the key to that strategy really is around our flexibility and optionality, and it's really around 3 key components that give us access to and influence over our total raw material needs. And first of all, and we talk about this a lot with regard to the DRI plants, but our capability there is roughly 4 million tons of high-quality material. And those plants, the 2 DRI plants, really can reach all of our DRI-consuming mills on the River or the East Coast in a very economical or freight-logical way.
And as Leon alluded to, the Louisiana team really has made tremendous progress to improve the production and the reliability. And meanwhile, and sometimes this gets overlooked, is the Nu-Iron team in Trinidad just keeps chugging along, and they've got a long history of low-cost production and really world-class quality and reliability in the way they produce DRI.
And the second leg of this is really the David Joseph Company or DJJ's recycling operations, with 4 million to 5 million tons a year of ferrous processing capacity. And they're just really well-positioned to supply our own mills. Most of these DJJ locations, and there's about 65 sites in total, are focused on producing scrap, again, within the freight-logical range of our own mills. And we continue to, I would say, opportunistically add capacity to the DJJ processing platform as we did in the last 18 months or so with a handful of tuck-in acquisitions, including a couple of shredders.
And finally, the third leg of the overall strategy is, again, the DJJ brokerage and trading team really gives excellent coverage of both the domestic and international markets from a -- on a third-party supply basis, which we think is a big advantage. And I know the DJJ brokerage team prides itself on knowing its supply base extremely well and has access to scrap substitutes, not only in the U.S., but globally. And for example, the team did a really nice job here recently with the tightness in supply, which I do believe, Timna, back to your question, is symptomatic of what we're going to see in the future. But they've been able to capitalize on both, some, I would say, long-standing relationships with key supply partners, but also went to some areas of the world that we haven't been to in a long time. And they've done a really good job with that, to secure all the material we need despite those supply constraints.
So to sum it up, yes, we certainly envision that the metallics market could and probably will tighten up, but the flexibility and the options that we have from our own DRI scrap processing assets of around 8 million or 9 million tons a year in total, along with the third-party relationships, that gives us the access and influence just on the material that we have, our own assets, dedicated to give us about 1/3 of our total metallics demand covered. So that 8 million to 9 million tons really represents about 1/3.
So yes, I feel very confident, very comfortable on our ability to economically and efficiently secure our metallic needs going forward. Will it be -- will there be the normal market gyrations? Of course. But I feel like our strategy is well established, and we're in a good spot to navigate it well. Hopefully, that gives you a little extra color, Timna."

And at the same time, Carlos, Nucor, in our downstream businesses, we had 3 product groups that set records for profitability. And so we ended up in a very, very strong position and again, as we move forward, look at order entry rates and backlogs, were at or near historic highs.
And so while we expect to see some compression there, the recent price increases, our metal margins, are actually going to continue to grow in most businesses. Again, certainly, the downstream side will face a little bit of compression. But again, it's coming off, again, in most of our downstream near-record profitability standpoint. So again, we do see it staying very strong as we move forward.
To your point around working capital, that's something that we, as a team, I'm really proud of our executive leadership team. At the onset of this pandemic in February of last year, we met, and we put some things in place with our leadership across all of the mills and operations to be incredibly disciplined and took very, very deliberate steps to manage our working inventory in scrap, WIP and finished goods. And that discipline and that -- well, that discipline is going to continue and it has continued. And so we're not long as we think about the product groups.

And we're excited as many of our downstream businesses have very strong backlogs and as, in some cases, we have record backlogs, all-time record backlogs as we head into 2021. And also, we monitor our recent quoting activity. And I can tell you, in a lot of our businesses, over the last 4, 5, 6, 7 weeks, we've seen activity rise.
I want to repeat something Jim Frias said in his opening comments. And while we respect and do monitor the industry trade group data, we offer that some of the rising nonres construction arenas may not be fully reflected in that architectural data. So our strong relationships with key customers, our breadth of product that we offer to the market, I guess I would just summarize by saying we're excited as we head into 2021. There will be some compression in some of our downstream businesses with rising steel costs, but those prices are being passed on in the marketplace, are being accepted. And we look forward to the coming months. Thanks, Leon."

Leon touched on how the team got together and was very thoughtful about managing working capital as a result of the crisis. We also were very thoughtful about the volatility downward in pricing that we were seeing last summer and not getting caught up in that and taking too much business on our books at below market pricing. And so that discipline has positioned us well as we go into 2021, to not have a lot of low-priced backlog to work through. And so yes, with the extreme movement in steel pricing we've seen in the last 90 days, there is some minor compression in the downstream business, but it's going to be minor. So that's the first point.
And then back to your question on working capital. We think volumes of working capital, if you think about it on a tons basis, will be similar. Scrap prices will be relatively flat. So we think inventory values will be relatively flat. But receivables values will go up because steel mill pricing, on average selling prices, will be higher in Q1 than they were in Q4. So we'll let you estimate what you think average prices are going up, but take that times the amount of tons we ship and that should be the build of working capital for 1 month because we basically collect receivables in about 30 days. And I guess that's pretty much it. So thank you for the question."

And then secondly, just following up on Timna's question around metallics, if we go back 12, 18 months ago, there was quite a bit of chat in the marketplace that some of the North American integrated mills might be interested in selling pig iron. Haven't really heard much about that recently. And obviously, some of the structure there has changed on the integrated side. But from where you sit, is that something that seems like it could be possible at some point? And would that help ease up some of the potential tightness in prime scrap?"

And so if those integrateds can come back on and produce pig iron at a competitive price, we will absolutely be lining up and purchasing our pig iron domestically. But again, that certainly is a challenge. We'll see what happens.
And to your point, several of our competitors have talked about restarts and doing just that. And we'll see how that unfolds and as we move forward. But that's -- I'm certainly not going to speak to their strategies in executing. But again, it's got to be at a price competitive standpoint.

Deb Douglas is our International Tax Manager, and she's the one who figured out the opportunity to take advantage of the work, the stock deduction that allowed us to capture so much value after we made the decision to exit the [ DN ]. And then, of course, the overall tax team, including all the managers, [ John Taylor ], [ Amy Cattel ] and the others, just did a great job of doing all the year-end work that's necessary for us to come up with those figures.

If you give me a minute to look, I think next year's cash benefit is going to be in the neighborhood of $240 million, and the year after that, when we finalize Gallatin because that's going to be the -- or excuse me, Brandenburg, that's going to be the biggest impactor, it's going to be north of a $330 million cash benefit.

While there still is a great deal of work ahead of us in our journey to become the world's safest steel company, I am more convinced than ever that this team will accomplish our goal. To our Nucor teammates, thank you. I am proud for you all. Well done. Now let's make 2021 our safest year ever.
Joining me today on the call are the members of Nucor's executive team, including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sumoski, Chief Operating Officer; Al Behr, responsible for Plate and Structural Products; Craig Feldman, responsible for Raw Materials; Doug Jellison, responsible for DJJ and Logistics; Greg Murphy, responsible for Business Services, and our General Counsel; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products; Rex Query, responsible for Sheet and Tubular Products; MaryEmily Slate, responsible for our Commercial Strategy; Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction Products; and Dan Needham, who will be joining our Charlotte team on February 1 and be responsible for Bar Products.
At the end of the year, we announced several changes to our executive team. Dave Sumoski was promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Dave has been with Nucor since 1995 and has led multiple steel product groups and strategic initiatives, most recently combining our domestic rebar, steel mill and fabrication businesses. Dave is uniquely positioned to help Nucor continue to build lasting partnerships while executing our enterprise-wide strategy.
MaryEmily Slate has taken on a new role as Executive Vice President for Commercial. This is the first time we have had an EVP-level leader in this role at Nucor. The purpose is to enhance our ability to focus on our key markets and to better connect with our customers. Meeting the future needs of our customers while maintaining and maximizing the benefits of the broad and diversified offering of Nucor will be a vital function of MaryEmily's team as we move forward.
I would also like to welcome 4 new team members to our executive team, Rex Query, Doug Jellison, Greg Murphy and Dan Needham. Each of these executive management team promotions will enhance our ability to serve our customers and our shareholders.
Business conditions remained strong in the fourth quarter, with improving pricing and healthy volumes across our diverse product portfolio. Of particular note, utilization rates at our sheet mills and plate mills continue their sharp upturn in the fourth quarter. While we were pleased with our operating performance and cash flow for the period, our earnings were impacted by noncash charges, which were more than offset by tax benefits recognized in the quarter. The most substantial of these were related to our agreement to exit from the Duferdofin-Nucor joint venture and the impairment charge writing down the value of our Castrip operations, both of which impacted our steel mills segment earnings.
The capabilities of our new state-of-the-art cold mill and the Generation 3 galvanizing line we have under construction at Nucor Arkansas have diminished our utilization of Castrip. We do plan on continuing to fully support existing customers as well as the technology to further improve Castrip's product offerings for Castrip licensees.
The noncash charge that we recorded upon exiting the Duferdofin-Nucor joint venture was actually more than offset by a tax benefit related to our investment, so it did not hurt our net income for the quarter. Jim Frias will elaborate more in his opening remarks.
Turning now to comment on 2020 as a whole. The year ended up much stronger than anyone would have anticipated when the pandemic first took hold of our global economy in March of last year. Our team and our business model proved to be incredibly resilient, and we were able to take advantage of the stronger-than-expected recovery because of the Nucor team doing an excellent job keeping our mills running reliably and safely throughout the volatility that characterized 2020. This allowed us to reliably fulfill our customers' requirements. Our focus remains on continuing to deliver a differentiated value proposition to meet and exceed our customers' needs.
Looking at specific end-use markets, construction remains strong throughout the pandemic, and automotive was quick to recover in the second half of the year after shutting down in the second quarter. Together, these 2 markets account for nearly 2/3 of steel consumption. We are aware of certain leading indicators signaling a downturn in nonres construction activity, but so far, we don't see much evidence of that. Our company is well positioned in attractive subsegments of the nonres construction market. There are areas of strength, most notably warehouses and data centers, that may not be fully reflected in the ABI and other indicators. We have worked to build relationships in these subsegments that are bright spots, ensuring that we are providing the best solutions across steelmaking and steel products to serve those customers.
We are cautiously optimistic that a significant infrastructure spending bill will be passed by Congress and signed by the new President this year. After years of talk, this must get done. We are still driving on roads and bridges designed and built during the Eisenhower administration. This is not sustainable. We would not be surprised if a funding bill focused in part on green infrastructure spending, including renewable power generation and transmission. Nucor is well positioned to meet our country's needs of environmentally friendly steel and steel products. With roughly 50% of our steel used in the construction sector, there is arguably no company more poised and ready to meet the needs of rebuilding our country than Nucor.
In the automotive market, we believe demand should continue its rebound. We think 2021 light vehicle production in North America will be around 16 million vehicles. Having wrapped up the fall contract season, we feel good about our prospects for continuing share gains in the automotive market.
The investments we have made at our sheet mills in Arkansas and in Kentucky to expand our production of value-added products are paying off. Demand from the oil and gas sector continues to be weak even as oil prices have been rising along with many other commodities. I think that significant continued improvement in that market is going to depend on how quickly vaccines can get out to a large number of people and how long it takes for commuting and travel patterns to approach pre-pandemic levels.
Strong demand growth from the renewable energy sector has partially offset the weakness in oil. Our sales to the renewable power sector have been very strong this year, with steelmaking segment orders related to these markets growing by double digits compared to the 2019 total. The renewable power market is what Nucor is targeting, and many of our steel and steel products are essential to its continued buildout. We rely primarily on recycled steel to make these products, and they themselves are 100% recyclable. This fact positions us well as the supplier of choice here as we see sustainability and product transparency becoming a more important factor in product sourcing decisions in the renewable power sector and in most other end-use markets. We are also seeing signs that other end-use markets will rebound from this past year's depressed levels, including heavy-duty trucks, heavy equipment and agriculture.
Turning to our strategic growth projects. We continue to make excellent progress on them during the fourth quarter. Our new rebar micromill in Frostproof, Florida started up operations on schedule in December. Congratulations to the entire Nucor Steel Florida team for getting this new steel mill up and running on time and for doing it safely.
This past October, we celebrated the groundbreaking of our new steel plate mill in Kentucky. Our Nucor Steel Brandenburg team has done a great job keeping the project on schedule throughout this year, and we are moving at full speed to bring the state-of-the-art plate mill to market during the fourth quarter of 2022.
We're also making great progress on our expansion project at our Gallatin sheet mill. The expansion project is expected to start up in the second half of this year. With regard to some of our facilities that are in operation, I'm pleased to report the new pickle galvanizing line at Gallatin had an excellent first full year of operation despite the pandemic, shipping 39% more tons than we projected when we approved the project. Year 1 profitability was also ahead of plan. Gallatin's entry into the value-added coated sheet market has proven very timely, with the strong flat-rolled market conditions that emerged in the second half of 2020 and are continuing into Q1 2021. We have experienced very strong customer acceptance of Gallatin's coated product as we further develop target markets that include automotive, solar, tubing, roll-forming, grain storage, culvert and cooling towers.
Also, the new cold mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas has gotten off to a strong start, with shipments almost 30% ahead of our initial plan for the mill. Strong customer acceptance rates following trials were conducted throughout 2020, mean that the new mill is now booked out for this year at 85% of its nameplate capacity for contract customers. We are looking forward to running our first prime coil off our new Gen 3 galv line at Arkansas later this year. This is slightly behind our original schedule due primarily to the slowdown in capital expenditures we instituted around the beginning of the pandemic.
Our new rebar micromill in Sedalia has also exceeded our expectations. The team there generated a solid operating profit during the most recent quarter, and its spooled rebar product continues to be well received by our customers. At our galvanizing line joint venture with JFE in Mexico, we were back up running after a government-mandated shutdown and beginning to ship coils to automotive customers. Congratulations to the team there.
Our Kankakee, Illinois bar mill completed commissioning of its new MBQ rolling mill in December. While the time line of this project was slightly extended due to COVID-related disruptions, customer acceptance of the new products has been extremely strong. We expect to achieve positive cash flow from this investment in Q1. Construction on upgrades to Kankakee's melt shop, including a new caster ladle stir station, will begin in earnest in February, with final commissioning of this equipment expected in Q4 of this year. This investment will significantly improve the energy efficiency of the Kankakee mill.
Before I turn the call over to Jim, let me give a shout out to our teammates at Louisiana DRI operations. As many of you are aware, we took some downtime at Louisiana in 2019 and have invested approximately $200 million to enhance operational reliability there. It has really paid off. In 2020, the Nucor Steel Louisiana team set new records for production, shipping and operating hours. Most importantly, our team there accomplished all of this while operating safely for more than 450 consecutive days. Later this quarter, we will finish our work improving Louisiana's ore yard.
With that, let me turn the call over to Jim to provide more details about our financial performance and outlook for the first part of 2021. Jim?"
184945,700518326,2185067,"Nucor Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Leon.

As detailed in our news release, results for the just-completed quarter included a number of nonoperational items that were n",758,"Thanks, Leon. Fourth quarter earnings of $1.30 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $1.15 to $1.20 per diluted share. As detailed in our news release, results for the just-completed quarter included a number of nonoperational items that were not included in our guidance. After-tax effects, again for the items not included in our guidance, the total impact was produced net income by just under $34 million or approximately $0.11 per diluted share. Earnings significantly exceeded our guidance as the pace of margin expansion at our steel mills surpassed our expectations. Conditions improved for many of our businesses throughout the quarter and now are the strongest they have been in some years.
As Leon mentioned, and as detailed in our news release, we were able to claim tax deductions related to our investment in Duferdofin-Nucor joint venture that more than offset the related loss on assets we recorded in the fourth quarter.
Cash provided by operating activities for full year 2020 was $2.7 billion. Nucor's free cash flow or cash provided by operations minus capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2020, comfortably exceeding cash dividends paid to stockholders of $492 million. Over the last 3 years, Nucor has generated $3.9 billion of free cash flow, even as we reinvested $4 billion in our businesses.
As mentioned on previous calls, we have intensified our focus on maintaining appropriate working capital levels and reducing the asset base we require to generate strong profitability. I am happy to report that even as steel market demand and pricing has rebounded strongly in recent months, our tons of raw material inventory are actually down by more than 6% from the prior year-end.
At the close of the fourth quarter, our cash, short-term investments and restricted cash holdings totaled just under $3.2 billion. Nucor's liquidity also includes our undrawn $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which matures in April of 2023. Total long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5.3 billion. Gross debt as a percent of total capital was 32%, while net debt represented 13% of total capital.
The flexibility provided by Nucor's low-cost operating model and financial strength continues to be a critical underpinning to our company's ability to grow long-term earnings power and return capital to our shareholders. Dividends and share repurchases totaled $531 million or 74% of net income during 2020. And with the dividend increase announced in December, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 48 consecutive years, every year since we first began paying dividends in 1973.
Speaking of growing long-term earnings power, let me take a moment to provide a brief rundown on where we stand on some of our organic growth projects. 3 projects started operations in 2019: a new specialty cold-rolling mill at our Arkansas sheet mill; a rolling mill modernization at our Ohio rebar mill; and a hot band galvanizing line at our Kentucky sheet mill. Another 4 projects started production during 2020: our rebar micromill in Missouri; our Illinois merchant bar rolling mill; our joint venture sheet steel galvanizing line in Mexico; and our Florida rebar micromill. The remaining 3 projects are: the expansion and modernization of our Kentucky sheet mill; our Generation 3 flexible galvanizing line at our Arkansas sheet mill; and our Kentucky plate mill. At the close of 2020, remaining capital expenditures for these 3 are approximately $1.9 billion, with the Kentucky plate mill project representing about 3/4 of that total. We expect that Nucor's total capital spending for 2021 will be in the area of $2 billion. Approximately 80% of the 2021 spending is to improve product capabilities and reduce costs.
Turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2021. As Leon indicated, we are encouraged by a number of positive factors impacting our markets. We expect earnings in the first quarter of 2021 to be significantly higher than our reported results for the fourth quarter of 2020. The expected performance of the steel mills segment in the first quarter of 2021 is the primary driver for this increase as our sheet, plate, bar and structural mills are all forecasting increased profitability. Our downstream steel product segment's performance in the first quarter is expected to decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to typical seasonal patterns and some margin compression due to a lag between rising steel input costs and increased selling prices. The raw materials segment's performance in the first quarter is expected to be significantly improved due to higher raw materials selling prices.
Thank you for your interest in our company. Leon?"

Our crystal ball probably isn't significantly better than yours. So let me just share a few thoughts with you though. We certainly do anticipate a near-term correction in the month of February, which, I guess, is not all that surprising given the nearly $200 increase that we've seen in the last 90 days or so. In fact, we've already seen some international scrap prices, notably Turkey, fall here just really in the recent days. So we certainly see some moderate corrections from the January levels, especially on obsolete grades, which are highly elastic and where flows have really been pretty good recently.
Prime scrap grades are also likely to moderate a bit, but we don't believe it will fall as much as the obsolete grades. February pricing would likely be down $30 to $50 a ton depending on both the grade and the region. But we would certainly characterize that as, I would say, a fairly normal correction given the size of the recent run-up in prices.
And just a couple of other things, and Leon alluded to this in his opening remarks, but there are some other factors that work here, too. The overall commodity price environment is pretty darn solid. And I don't think Leon mentioned this, but a relatively weak dollar really could put -- help put a floor under that and really sustain the general commodity environment.
The other thing I would point to, there are some seasonal factors. The month of February is typically a pretty weak month for scrap pricing overall. And meanwhile, March typically sees higher prices. So -- and we track this pretty closely on -- with some heat maps, as you might imagine, Seth. Historically, scrap prices in the calendar month of February are either flat or down around 70% of the time, and we're going back to the last 20 years or so. And March is the exact opposite of that, with prices rising or flat around 70% of the time. So we certainly could see some exceptions to those trends, but we really believe that, this year, we'll follow that more typical seasonal pattern, if you will. So bottom line, our near-term view on scrap pricing has some downward pressure and is likely to stabilize after that.
And if I may, one final comment on this. Just an observation with regard to scrap and steel pricing, and this may not be fully apparent or intuitive to most folks, but scrap prices follow steel pricing and not the other way around. Again, steel demand and steel pricing lead scrap demand and scrap pricing. And as Jim and Leon alluded to in their opening remarks, our view is pretty darn optimistic right now. So hopefully, that gives you some color."

So you can then extrapolate off of that what's left beyond 2021 in those projects. Like $1.9 billion minus the $900 million and $250 million and the $100 million, and that tells you what's going to carry over roughly into 2022.

First off, I think it's important to remember, these contracts are now fixed-price contracts. Like there are things that floated in. So again, that exact breakdown, as you described on the back of the envelope, we're not giving out on this call. But at the end of the day, there's a lag effect on the way up and as well on the way down. And so our expectation, as we move forward, yes, there is obviously more opportunity because the price increases that we've passed and certainly, the movements that you've seen in the indices like CRU, we think, are going to move forward and stay strong.
In terms of the volume, our sheet mills are operating at an incredibly high utilization rate at -- while they're at capacity. And so that, we see continuing. And again, I think their production levels will stay very high."

We marked our capacity at 2,942,000 tons for the fourth quarter, and we actually produced 2,902,000 tons. So we computed 98.65% utilization rates. Now the reason the shipments are so different compared to the first quarter, we may have had some extra inventory at the end of 2019 that helped us boost our shipments. We do have more downstream processing now with more galvanizing lines. So the WIP inventory in our system is probably a little higher when we think about the WIP that's sitting at Gallatin that would have just gone straight to us and shipped in the past. So there's other factors that come into play in terms of the timing of shipment versus production, but we would expect to have a strong shipping month in the first quarter as well as a strong production month."

So I know we talked about the near-term dynamic, which makes a lot of sense. But if you listen to Steel Dynamics' call, they sounded pretty relaxed about scrap availability even with all the new capacity, consuming more scrap over the next couple of years. And if you listen to Cliffs', they will tell you that there's going to be a run on scrap.
So I kind of wanted to hear where Nucor stands in terms of your perspective. Clearly, you have the DRI capability that enables you to be more vertically integrated in the iron units. But do you think that it's going to be an issue? Do you think that it makes sense to expand your position? Just it would be great to get your thoughts."

And look, as we look out to the long term, as the mix continues to shift from integrated mills, to EAFs, and again, we're about 70% of the steelmaking capacity today",232,"Yes, maybe I'll kick this off, and Jim or Craig, jump in if you've got some other points. And look, as we look out to the long term, as the mix continues to shift from integrated mills, to EAFs, and again, we're about 70% of the steelmaking capacity today in the United States, the EAF sector is, the demand on prime scrap is going to stay very tight, and that's going to now increase. And as we've pointed out on previous calls, because we need more prime, the automakers aren't going to make more units because the steel mills need that scrap. So the high metallics, the quality metallics side of things, and controlling our own downstream input to that, for us, is really very strategic.
And so I don't think we're at the point where we're going to increase that. But the things that we're doing everyday to continue to maximize that, the investments in Louisiana, and continuing some of those investments in the ore yard to increase the efficiency and increase the yield and throughputs there will be areas of that. But again, as we move forward, I do see as more EAF-based mills come online and the demand as we move up the value chain even for ourselves in automotive is going to put continued pressure on the prime market. Craig, anything you would like to add to that?"
184945,700518326,2185067,"Nucor Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Yes. Actually, I do. And you touched on some of it. But Timna, you're right. There is a lot of dialogue around this topic, and it's something that we've been thinking about for, frankly, for years.

There is a lot of dialogue around this topic, and it's something that we've been thinking about for, frankly, for years. And we do agree with the assertion that high-quality metallics, as Leon just said, will become tighter going forward. Even obsolete grades, we do envision that getting tighter with the conversion from integrated to EAF.
And maybe what I would like to talk about more is what we've been doing and preparing for in that regard and how -- what we've been doing with our overall raw materials strategy, if I could. And I guess, the key to that strategy really is around our flexibility and optionality, and it's really around 3 key components that give us access to and influence over our total raw material needs. And first of all, and we talk about this a lot with regard to the DRI plants, but our capability there is roughly 4 million tons of high-quality material. And those plants, the 2 DRI plants, really can reach all of our DRI-consuming mills on the River or the East Coast in a very economical or freight-logical way.
And as Leon alluded to, the Louisiana team really has made tremendous progress to improve the production and the reliability. And meanwhile, and sometimes this gets overlooked, is the Nu-Iron team in Trinidad just keeps chugging along, and they've got a long history of low-cost production and really world-class quality and reliability in the way they produce DRI.
And the second leg of this is really the David Joseph Company or DJJ's recycling operations, with 4 million to 5 million tons a year of ferrous processing capacity. And they're just really well-positioned to supply our own mills. Most of these DJJ locations, and there's about 65 sites in total, are focused on producing scrap, again, within the freight-logical range of our own mills. And we continue to, I would say, opportunistically add capacity to the DJJ processing platform as we did in the last 18 months or so with a handful of tuck-in acquisitions, including a couple of shredders.
And finally, the third leg of the overall strategy is, again, the DJJ brokerage and trading team really gives excellent coverage of both the domestic and international markets from a -- on a third-party supply basis, which we think is a big advantage. And I know the DJJ brokerage team prides itself on knowing its supply base extremely well and has access to scrap substitutes, not only in the U.S., but globally. And for example, the team did a really nice job here recently with the tightness in supply, which I do believe, Timna, back to your question, is symptomatic of what we're going to see in the future. But they've been able to capitalize on both, some, I would say, long-standing relationships with key supply partners, but also went to some areas of the world that we haven't been to in a long time. And they've done a really good job with that, to secure all the material we need despite those supply constraints.
So to sum it up, yes, we certainly envision that the metallics market could and probably will tighten up, but the flexibility and the options that we have from our own DRI scrap processing assets of around 8 million or 9 million tons a year in total, along with the third-party relationships, that gives us the access and influence just on the material that we have, our own assets, dedicated to give us about 1/3 of our total metallics demand covered. So that 8 million to 9 million tons really represents about 1/3.
So yes, I feel very confident, very comfortable on our ability to economically and efficiently secure our metallic needs going forward. Will it be -- will there be the normal market gyrations? Of course. But I feel like our strategy is well established, and we're in a good spot to navigate it well. Hopefully, that gives you a little extra color, Timna."

And let me begin with the first one, and Chad Utermark, I might ask you to just chime in as well, if I don't cover all of this. But at the end of the day, 2020 was, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, certainly a very challenging year. And at the same time, Carlos, Nucor, in our downstream businesses, we had 3 product groups that set records for profitability. And so we ended up in a very, very strong position and again, as we move forward, look at order entry rates and backlogs, were at or near historic highs.
And so while we expect to see some compression there, the recent price increases, our metal margins, are actually going to continue to grow in most businesses. Again, certainly, the downstream side will face a little bit of compression. But again, it's coming off, again, in most of our downstream near-record profitability standpoint. So again, we do see it staying very strong as we move forward.
To your point around working capital, that's something that we, as a team, I'm really proud of our executive leadership team. At the onset of this pandemic in February of last year, we met, and we put some things in place with our leadership across all of the mills and operations to be incredibly disciplined and took very, very deliberate steps to manage our working inventory in scrap, WIP and finished goods. And that discipline and that -- well, that discipline is going to continue and it has continued. And so we're not long as we think about the product groups. We're not long in scrap, we're not long in WIP, and we're not long in the steel mills providing to our downstream product group. So we feel very good about the true cycle profitability of all of our businesses. Chad, any comments you would like to add on the products segment?"

Yes, I want to echo what was said by Leon and Jim about the forward look that we see in nonres construction and for most of our downstream businesses, and we are very excited as we enter 2021. And I know there are some sources out there that are indicating nonres may not be as strong as perhaps we say it is or even looking into the future. But we derive our business outlook from numerous sources, but we do put a heavy emphasis on our customer input and our internal order entry data points. And we're excited as many of our downstream businesses have very strong backlogs and as, in some cases, we have record backlogs, all-time record backlogs as we head into 2021. And also, we monitor our recent quoting activity. And I can tell you, in a lot of our businesses, over the last 4, 5, 6, 7 weeks, we've seen activity rise.
I want to repeat something Jim Frias said in his opening comments. And while we respect and do monitor the industry trade group data, we offer that some of the rising nonres construction arenas may not be fully reflected in that architectural data. So our strong relationships with key customers, our breadth of product that we offer to the market, I guess I would just summarize by saying we're excited as we head into 2021. There will be some compression in some of our downstream businesses with rising steel costs, but those prices are being passed on in the marketplace, are being accepted. And we look forward to the coming months. Thanks, Leon."

Leon touched on how the team got together and was very thoughtful about managing working capital as a result of the crisis. We also were very thoughtful about the volatility downward in pricing that we were seeing last summer and not getting caught up in that and taking too much business on our books at below market pricing. And so that discipline has positioned us well as we go into 2021, to not have a lot of low-priced backlog to work through. And so yes, with the extreme movement in steel pricing we've seen in the last 90 days, there is some minor compression in the downstream business, but it's going to be minor. So that's the first point.
And then back to your question on working capital. We think volumes of working capital, if you think about it on a tons basis, will be similar. Scrap prices will be relatively flat. So we think inventory values will be relatively flat. But receivables values will go up because steel mill pricing, on average selling prices, will be higher in Q1 than they were in Q4. So we'll let you estimate what you think average prices are going up, but take that times the amount of tons we ship and that should be the build of working capital for 1 month because we basically collect receivables in about 30 days. And I guess that's pretty much it. So thank you for the question."

I'll start with the back half of your question or the second question around metallics first and maybe ask Dave Sumoski to address the -- your opening question.

It could be in that range when we do our tax return in August as a result of the great work our tax team did this year. And I will do a shout out to a few folks. Deb Douglas is our International Tax Manager, and she's the one who figured out the opportunity to take advantage of the work, the stock deduction that allowed us to capture so much value after we made the decision to exit the [ DN ]. And then, of course, the overall tax team, including all the managers, [ John Taylor ], [ Amy Cattel ] and the others, just did a great job of doing all the year-end work that's necessary for us to come up with those figures. But we're going to have cash benefits beyond this year because of the accelerated depreciation in our big projects. And we think that over the 3-year period, it's $575 million.
If you give me a minute to look, I think next year's cash benefit is going to be in the neighborhood of $240 million, and the year after that, when we finalize Gallatin because that's going to be the -- or excuse me, Brandenburg, that's going to be the biggest impactor, it's going to be north of a $330 million cash benefit. But our book rate should be in a normalized range of that 24%, which includes the federal and state rate, assuming there's no tax increase during that time period."

We hope everyone on the call is having a good start to the year and staying safe and healthy. The last 12 months have been incredibly challenging on so many different levels. The pandemic has impacted businesses and markets and taken a tremendous toll on so many that have cared for and lost loved ones during this time. The distractions we have faced as a nation and as a company are significant, yet the Nucor team has never lost its way in delivering the safest year in our history. Let me repeat that again. 2020 was the safest year in the history of our company. I'm extremely grateful for the hard work, dedication, ownership of our nearly 27,000 team members who made this result possible. While there still is a great deal of work ahead of us in our journey to become the world's safest steel company, I am more convinced than ever that this team will accomplish our goal. To our Nucor teammates, thank you. I am proud for you all. Well done. Now let's make 2021 our safest year ever.
Joining me today on the call are the members of Nucor's executive team, including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sumoski, Chief Operating Officer; Al Behr, responsible for Plate and Structural Products; Craig Feldman, responsible for Raw Materials; Doug Jellison, responsible for DJJ and Logistics; Greg Murphy, responsible for Business Services, and our General Counsel; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products; Rex Query, responsible for Sheet and Tubular Products; MaryEmily Slate, responsible for our Commercial Strategy; Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction Products; and Dan Needham, who will be joining our Charlotte team on February 1 and be responsible for Bar Products.
At the end of the year, we announced several changes to our executive team. Dave Sumoski was promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Dave has been with Nucor since 1995 and has led multiple steel product groups and strategic initiatives, most recently combining our domestic rebar, steel mill and fabrication businesses. Dave is uniquely positioned to help Nucor continue to build lasting partnerships while executing our enterprise-wide strategy.
MaryEmily Slate has taken on a new role as Executive Vice President for Commercial. This is the first time we have had an EVP-level leader in this role at Nucor. The purpose is to enhance our ability to focus on our key markets and to better connect with our customers. Meeting the future needs of our customers while maintaining and maximizing the benefits of the broad and diversified offering of Nucor will be a vital function of MaryEmily's team as we move forward.
I would also like to welcome 4 new team members to our executive team, Rex Query, Doug Jellison, Greg Murphy and Dan Needham. Each of these executive management team promotions will enhance our ability to serve our customers and our shareholders.
Business conditions remained strong in the fourth quarter, with improving pricing and healthy volumes across our diverse product portfolio. Of particular note, utilization rates at our sheet mills and plate mills continue their sharp upturn in the fourth quarter. While we were pleased with our operating performance and cash flow for the period, our earnings were impacted by noncash charges, which were more than offset by tax benefits recognized in the quarter. The most substantial of these were related to our agreement to exit from the Duferdofin-Nucor joint venture and the impairment charge writing down the value of our Castrip operations, both of which impacted our steel mills segment earnings.
The capabilities of our new state-of-the-art cold mill and the Generation 3 galvanizing line we have under construction at Nucor Arkansas have diminished our utilization of Castrip. We do plan on continuing to fully support existing customers as well as the technology to further improve Castrip's product offerings for Castrip licensees.
The noncash charge that we recorded upon exiting the Duferdofin-Nucor joint venture was actually more than offset by a tax benefit related to our investment, so it did not hurt our net income for the quarter. Jim Frias will elaborate more in his opening remarks.
Turning now to comment on 2020 as a whole. The year ended up much stronger than anyone would have anticipated when the pandemic first took hold of our global economy in March of last year. Our team and our business model proved to be incredibly resilient, and we were able to take advantage of the stronger-than-expected recovery because of the Nucor team doing an excellent job keeping our mills running reliably and safely throughout the volatility that characterized 2020. This allowed us to reliably fulfill our customers' requirements. Our focus remains on continuing to deliver a differentiated value proposition to meet and exceed our customers' needs.
Looking at specific end-use markets, construction remains strong throughout the pandemic, and automotive was quick to recover in the second half of the year after shutting down in the second quarter. Together, these 2 markets account for nearly 2/3 of steel consumption. We are aware of certain leading indicators signaling a downturn in nonres construction activity, but so far, we don't see much evidence of that. Our company is well positioned in attractive subsegments of the nonres construction market. There are areas of strength, most notably warehouses and data centers, that may not be fully reflected in the ABI and other indicators. We have worked to build relationships in these subsegments that are bright spots, ensuring that we are providing the best solutions across steelmaking and steel products to serve those customers.
We are cautiously optimistic that a significant infrastructure spending bill will be passed by Congress and signed by the new President this year. After years of talk, this must get done. We are still driving on roads and bridges designed and built during the Eisenhower administration. This is not sustainable. We would not be surprised if a funding bill focused in part on green infrastructure spending, including renewable power generation and transmission. Nucor is well positioned to meet our country's needs of environmentally friendly steel and steel products. With roughly 50% of our steel used in the construction sector, there is arguably no company more poised and ready to meet the needs of rebuilding our country than Nucor.
In the automotive market, we believe demand should continue its rebound. We think 2021 light vehicle production in North America will be around 16 million vehicles. Having wrapped up the fall contract season, we feel good about our prospects for continuing share gains in the automotive market.
The investments we have made at our sheet mills in Arkansas and in Kentucky to expand our production of value-added products are paying off. Demand from the oil and gas sector continues to be weak even as oil prices have been rising along with many other commodities. I think that significant continued improvement in that market is going to depend on how quickly vaccines can get out to a large number of people and how long it takes for commuting and travel patterns to approach pre-pandemic levels.
Strong demand growth from the renewable energy sector has partially offset the weakness in oil. Our sales to the renewable power sector have been very strong this year, with steelmaking segment orders related to these markets growing by double digits compared to the 2019 total. The renewable power market is what Nucor is targeting, and many of our steel and steel products are essential to its continued buildout. We rely primarily on recycled steel to make these products, and they themselves are 100% recyclable. This fact positions us well as the supplier of choice here as we see sustainability and product transparency becoming a more important factor in product sourcing decisions in the renewable power sector and in most other end-use markets. We are also seeing signs that other end-use markets will rebound from this past year's depressed levels, including heavy-duty trucks, heavy equipment and agriculture.
Turning to our strategic growth projects. We continue to make excellent progress on them during the fourth quarter. Our new rebar micromill in Frostproof, Florida started up operations on schedule in December. Congratulations to the entire Nucor Steel Florida team for getting this new steel mill up and running on time and for doing it safely.
This past October, we celebrated the groundbreaking of our new steel plate mill in Kentucky. Our Nucor Steel Brandenburg team has done a great job keeping the project on schedule throughout this year, and we are moving at full speed to bring the state-of-the-art plate mill to market during the fourth quarter of 2022.
We're also making great progress on our expansion project at our Gallatin sheet mill. The expansion project is expected to start up in the second half of this year. With regard to some of our facilities that are in operation, I'm pleased to report the new pickle galvanizing line at Gallatin had an excellent first full year of operation despite the pandemic, shipping 39% more tons than we projected when we approved the project. Year 1 profitability was also ahead of plan. Gallatin's entry into the value-added coated sheet market has proven very timely, with the strong flat-rolled market conditions that emerged in the second half of 2020 and are continuing into Q1 2021. We have experienced very strong customer acceptance of Gallatin's coated product as we further develop target markets that include automotive, solar, tubing, roll-forming, grain storage, culvert and cooling towers.
Also, the new cold mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas has gotten off to a strong start, with shipments almost 30% ahead of our initial plan for the mill. Strong customer acceptance rates following trials were conducted throughout 2020, mean that the new mill is now booked out for this year at 85% of its nameplate capacity for contract customers. We are looking forward to running our first prime coil off our new Gen 3 galv line at Arkansas later this year. This is slightly behind our original schedule due primarily to the slowdown in capital expenditures we instituted around the beginning of the pandemic.
Our new rebar micromill in Sedalia has also exceeded our expectations. The team there generated a solid operating profit during the most recent quarter, and its spooled rebar product continues to be well received by our customers. At our galvanizing line joint venture with JFE in Mexico, we were back up running after a government-mandated shutdown and beginning to ship coils to automotive customers. Congratulations to the team there.
Our Kankakee, Illinois bar mill completed commissioning of its new MBQ rolling mill in December. While the time line of this project was slightly extended due to COVID-related disruptions, customer acceptance of the new products has been extremely strong. We expect to achieve positive cash flow from this investment in Q1. Construction on upgrades to Kankakee's melt shop, including a new caster ladle stir station, will begin in earnest in February, with final commissioning of this equipment expected in Q4 of this year. This investment will significantly improve the energy efficiency of the Kankakee mill.
Before I turn the call over to Jim, let me give a shout-out to our teammates at Louisiana DRI operations. As many of you are aware, we took some downtime at Louisiana in 2019 and have invested approximately $200 million to enhance operational reliability there. It has really paid off. In 2020, the Nucor Steel Louisiana team set new records for production, shipping and operating hours. Most importantly, our team there accomplished all of this while operating safely for more than 450 consecutive days. Later this quarter, we will finish our work improving Louisiana's ore yard.
With that, let me turn the call over to Jim to provide more details about our financial performance and outlook for the first part of 2021. Jim?"

Fourth quarter earnings of $1.30 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $1.15 to $1.20 per diluted share. As detailed in our news release, results for the just-completed quarter included a number of nonoperational items that were not included in our guidance. After-tax effects, again for the items not included in our guidance, the total impact was produced net income by just under $34 million or approximately $0.11 per diluted share. Earnings significantly exceeded our guidance as the pace of margin expansion at our steel mills surpassed our expectations. Conditions improved for many of our businesses throughout the quarter and now are the strongest they have been in some years.
As Leon mentioned, and as detailed in our news release, we were able to claim tax deductions related to our investment in Duferdofin-Nucor joint venture that more than offset the related loss on assets we recorded in the fourth quarter.
Cash provided by operating activities for full year 2020 was $2.7 billion. Nucor's free cash flow or cash provided by operations minus capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2020, comfortably exceeding cash dividends paid to stockholders of $492 million. Over the last 3 years, Nucor has generated $3.9 billion of free cash flow, even as we reinvested $4 billion in our businesses.
As mentioned on previous calls, we have intensified our focus on maintaining appropriate working capital levels and reducing the asset base we require to generate strong profitability. I am happy to report that even as steel market demand and pricing has rebounded strongly in recent months, our tons of raw material inventory are actually down by more than 6% from the prior year-end.
At the close of the fourth quarter, our cash, short-term investments and restricted cash holdings totaled just under $3.2 billion. Nucor's liquidity also includes our undrawn $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which matures in April of 2023. Total long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5.3 billion. Gross debt as a percent of total capital was 32%, while net debt represented 13% of total capital.
The flexibility provided by Nucor's low-cost operating model and financial strength continues to be a critical underpinning to our company's ability to grow long-term earnings power and return capital to our shareholders. Dividends and share repurchases totaled $531 million or 74% of net income during 2020. And with the dividend increase announced in December, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 48 consecutive years, every year since we first began paying dividends in 1973.
Speaking of growing long-term earnings power, let me take a moment to provide a brief rundown on where we stand on some of our organic growth projects. 3 projects started operations in 2019: a new specialty cold-rolling mill at our Arkansas sheet mill; a rolling mill modernization at our Ohio rebar mill; and a hot band galvanizing line at our Kentucky sheet mill. Another 4 projects started production during 2020: our rebar micromill in Missouri; our Illinois merchant bar rolling mill; our joint venture sheet steel galvanizing line in Mexico; and our Florida rebar micromill. The remaining 3 projects are: the expansion and modernization of our Kentucky sheet mill; our Generation 3 flexible galvanizing line at our Arkansas sheet mill; and our Kentucky plate mill. At the close of 2020, remaining capital expenditures for these 3 are approximately $1.9 billion, with the Kentucky plate mill project representing about 3/4 of that total. We expect that Nucor's total capital spending for 2021 will be in the area of $2 billion. Approximately 80% of the 2021 spending is to improve product capabilities and reduce costs.
Turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2021. As Leon indicated, we are encouraged by a number of positive factors impacting our markets. We expect earnings in the first quarter of 2021 to be significantly higher than our reported results for the fourth quarter of 2020. The expected performance of the steel mills segment in the first quarter of 2021 is the primary driver for this increase as our sheet, plate, bar and structural mills are all forecasting increased profitability. Our downstream steel product segment's performance in the first quarter is expected to decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to typical seasonal patterns and some margin compression due to a lag between rising steel input costs and increased selling prices. The raw materials segment's performance in the first quarter is expected to be significantly improved due to higher raw materials selling prices.
Thank you for your interest in our company. Leon?"

What I would like to do now is maybe invite Craig Feldman, Craig, to share just a little bit of a backdrop around scrap, what we're seeing, some of the metallic spread as well as how we think about prime scrap as we move forward. So Craig, why don't you jump in, and then I'll maybe close at the end?"

So let me just share a few thoughts with you though. We certainly do antic",479,"Sure, Leon. Thank you. And Seth, thanks for the question. You asked a question about the longer-term view on scrap. Our crystal ball probably isn't significantly better than yours. So let me just share a few thoughts with you though. We certainly do anticipate a near-term correction in the month of February, which, I guess, is not all that surprising given the nearly $200 increase that we've seen in the last 90 days or so. In fact, we've already seen some international scrap prices, notably Turkey, fall here just really in the recent days. So we certainly see some moderate corrections from the January levels, especially on obsolete grades, which are highly elastic and where flows have really been pretty good recently.
Prime scrap grades are also likely to moderate a bit, but we don't believe it will fall as much as the obsolete grades. February pricing would likely be down $30 to $50 a ton depending on both the grade and the region. But we would certainly characterize that as, I would say, a fairly normal correction given the size of the recent run-up in prices.
And just a couple of other things, and Leon alluded to this in his opening remarks, but there are some other factors that work here, too. The overall commodity price environment is pretty darn solid. And I don't think Leon mentioned this, but a relatively weak dollar really could put -- help put a floor under that and really sustain the general commodity environment.
The other thing I would point to, there are some seasonal factors. The month of February is typically a pretty weak month for scrap pricing overall. And meanwhile, March typically sees higher prices. So -- and we track this pretty closely on -- with some heat maps, as you might imagine, Seth. Historically, scrap prices in the calendar month of February are either flat or down around 70% of the time, and we're going back to the last 20 years or so. And March is the exact opposite of that, with prices rising or flat around 70% of the time. So we certainly could see some exceptions to those trends, but we really believe that, this year, we'll follow that more typical seasonal pattern, if you will. So bottom line, our near-term view on scrap pricing has some downward pressure and is likely to stabilize after that.
And if I may, one final comment on this. Just an observation with regard to scrap and steel pricing, and this may not be fully apparent or intuitive to most folks, but scrap prices follow steel pricing and not the other way around. Again, steel demand and steel pricing lead scrap demand and scrap pricing. And as Jim and Leon alluded to in their opening remarks, our view is pretty darn optimistic right now. So hopefully, that gives you some color."

You saw that increase in the fourth quarter, but we're really well-positioned going into 2021 with a healthy contract versus spot mix.
And I think one area of -- to note is that almost 20% of our sheet capacity is dedicated to internal downstream customers, including Vulcraft, Building System and Nucor Tubular. And each of these businesses are growing, doing very well, projecting very good years. And our backlog right now is at -- close to historic high, and it's about 50% better than this time last year. And so as I stated, that 20% is for internal downstream customers, and then we also have about 50% to 55% of our capacity locked up with external customer contracts.

Now the reason the shipments are so different compared to the first quarter, we may have had some extra inventory at the end of 2019 that helped us boost our shipments. We do have more downstream processing now with more galvanizing lines. So the WIP inventory in our system is probably a little higher when we think about the WIP that's sitting at Gallatin that would have just gone straight to us and shipped in the past. So there's other factors that come into play in terms of the timing of shipment versus production, but we would expect to have a strong shipping month in the first quarter as well as a strong production month."

And look, as we look out to the long term, as the mix continues to shift from integrated mills, to EAFs, and again, we're about 70% of the steelmaking capacity today in the United States, the EAF sector is, the demand on prime scrap is going to stay very tight, and that's going to now increase. And as we've pointed out on previous calls, because we need more prime, the automakers aren't going to make more units because the steel mills need that scrap. So the high metallics, the quality metallics side of things, and controlling our own downstream input to that, for us, is really very strategic.
And so I don't think we're at the point where we're going to increase that. But the things that we're doing everyday to continue to maximize that, the investments in Louisiana, and continuing some of those investments in the ore yard to increase the efficiency and increase the yield and throughputs there will be areas of that. But again, as we move forward, I do see as more EAF-based mills come online and the demand as we move up the value chain even for ourselves in automotive is going to put continued pressure on the prime market. Craig, anything you would like to add to that?"

There is a lot of dialogue around this topic, and it's something that we've been thinking about for, frankly, for years. And we do agree with the assertion that high-quality metallics, as Leon just said, will become tighter going forward. Even obsolete grades, we do envision that getting tighter with the conversion from integrated to EAF.
And maybe what I would like to talk about more is what we've been doing and preparing for in that regard and how -- what we've been doing with our overall raw materials strategy, if I could. And I guess, the key to that strategy really is around our flexibility and optionality, and it's really around 3 key components that give us access to and influence over our total raw material needs. And first of all, and we talk about this a lot with regard to the DRI plants, but our capability there is roughly 4 million tons of high-quality material. And those plants, the 2 DRI plants, really can reach all of our DRI-consuming mills on the River or the East Coast in a very economical or freight-logical way.
And as Leon alluded to, the Louisiana team really has made tremendous progress to improve the production and the reliability. And meanwhile, and sometimes this gets overlooked, is the Nu-Iron team in Trinidad just keeps chugging along, and they've got a long history of low-cost production and really world-class quality and reliability in the way they produce DRI.
And the second leg of this is really the David Joseph Company or DJJ's recycling operations, with 4 million to 5 million tons a year of ferrous processing capacity. And they're just really well-positioned to supply our own mills. Most of these DJJ locations, and there's about 65 sites in total, are focused on producing scrap, again, within the freight-logical range of our own mills. And we continue to, I would say, opportunistically add capacity to the DJJ processing platform as we did in the last 18 months or so with a handful of tuck-in acquisitions, including a couple of shredders.
And finally, the third leg of the overall strategy is, again, the DJJ brokerage and trading team really gives excellent coverage of both the domestic and international markets from a -- on a third-party supply basis, which we think is a big advantage. And I know the DJJ brokerage team prides itself on knowing its supply base extremely well and has access to scrap substitutes, not only in the U.S., but globally. And for example, the team did a really nice job here recently with the tightness in supply, which I do believe, Timna, back to your question, is symptomatic of what we're going to see in the future. But they've been able to capitalize on both, some, I would say, long-standing relationships with key supply partners, but also went to some areas of the world that we haven't been to in a long time. And they've done a really good job with that, to secure all the material we need despite those supply constraints.
So to sum it up, yes, we certainly envision that the metallics market could and probably will tighten up, but the flexibility and the options that we have from our own DRI scrap processing assets of around 8 million or 9 million tons a year in total, along with the third-party relationships, that gives us the access and influence just on the material that we have, our own assets, dedicated to give us about 1/3 of our total metallics demand covered. So that 8 million to 9 million tons really represents about 1/3.
So yes, I feel very confident, very comfortable on our ability to economically and efficiently secure our metallic needs going forward. Will it be -- will there be the normal market gyrations? Of course. But I feel like our strategy is well established, and we're in a good spot to navigate it well. Hopefully, that gives you a little extra color, Timna."

But at the end of the day, 2020 was, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, certainly a very challenging year. And at the same time, Carlos, Nucor, in our downstream businesses, we had 3 product groups that set records for profitability. And so we ended up in a very, very strong position and again, as we move forward, look at order entry rates and backlogs, were at or near historic highs.
And so while we expect to see some compression there, the recent price increases, our metal margins, are actually going to continue to grow in most businesses. Again, certainly, the downstream side will face a little bit of compression. But again, it's coming off, again, in most of our downstream near-record profitability standpoint. So again, we do see it staying very strong as we move forward.
To your point around working capital, that's something that we, as a team, I'm really proud of our executive leadership team. At the onset of this pandemic in February of last year, we met, and we put some things in place with our leadership across all of the mills and operations to be incredibly disciplined and took very, very deliberate steps to manage our working inventory in scrap, WIP and finished goods. And that discipline and that -- well, that discipline is going to continue and it has continued. And so we're not long as we think about the product groups. We're not long in scrap, we're not long in WIP, and we're not long in the steel mills providing to our downstream product group. So we feel very good about the true cycle profitability of all of our businesses. Chad, any comments you would like to add on the products segment?"

But we derive our business outlook from numerous sources, but we do put a heavy emphasis on our customer input and our internal order entry data points. And we're excited as many of our downstream businesses have very strong backlogs and as, in some cases, we have record backlogs, all-time record backlogs as we head into 2021. And also, we monitor our recent quoting activity. And I can tell you, in a lot of our businesses, over the last 4, 5, 6, 7 weeks, we've seen activity rise.
I want to repeat something Jim Frias said in his opening comments. And while we respect and do monitor the industry trade group data, we offer that some of the rising nonres construction arenas may not be fully reflected in that architectural data. So our strong relationships with key customers, our breadth of product that we offer to the market, I guess I would just summarize by saying we're excited as we head into 2021. There will be some compression in some of our downstream businesses with rising steel costs, but those prices are being passed on in the marketplace, are being accepted.

Leon touched on how the team got together and was very thoughtful about managing working capital as a result of the crisis. We also were very thoughtful about the volatility downward in pricing that we were seeing last summer and not getting caught up in that and taking too much business on our books at below-market pricing. And so that discipline has positioned us well as we go into 2021, to not have a lot of low-priced backlog to work through. And so yes, with the extreme movement in steel pricing we've seen in the last 90 days, there is some minor compression in the downstream business, but it's going to be minor. So that's the first point.
And then back to your question on working capital. We think volumes of working capital, if you think about it on a tons basis, will be similar. Scrap prices will be relatively flat. So we think inventory values will be relatively flat. But receivables values will go up because steel mill pricing, on average selling prices, will be higher in Q1 than they were in Q4. So we'll let you estimate what you think average prices are going up, but take that times the amount of tons we ship and that should be the build of working capital for 1 month because we basically collect receivables in about 30 days.

And then secondly, just following up on Timna's question around metallics, if we go back 12, 18 months ago, there was quite a bit of chat in the marketplace that some of the North American integrated mills might be interested in selling pig iron. Haven't really heard much about that recently. And obviously, some of the structure there has changed on the integrated side. But from where you sit, is that something that seems like it could be possible at some point? And would that help ease up some of the potential tightness in prime scrap?"

And so if those integrateds can come back on and produce pig iron at a competitive price, we will absolutely be lining up and purchasing our pig iron domestically. But again, that certainly is a challenge. We'll see what happens.
And to your point, several of our competitors have talked about restarts and doing just that. And we'll see how that unfolds and as we move forward.

Deb Douglas is our International Tax Manager, and she's the one who figured out the opportunity to take advantage of the work, the stock deduction that allowed us to capture so much value after we made the decision to exit the [ DN ]. And then, of course, the overall tax team, including all the managers, [ John Taylor ], [ Amy Cattel ] and the others, just did a great job of doing all the year-end work that's necessary for us to come up with those figures. But we're going to have cash benefits beyond this year because of the accelerated depreciation in our big projects. And we think that over the 3-year period, it's $575 million.
If you give me a minute to look, I think next year's cash benefit is going to be in the neighborhood of $240 million, and the year after that, when we finalize Gallatin because that's going to be the -- or excuse me, Brandenburg, that's going to be the biggest impactor, it's going to be north of a $330 million cash benefit.

We hope everyone on the call is having a good start to the year and staying safe and healthy. The last 12 months have been incredibly challenging on so many different levels. The pandemic has impacted businesses and markets and taken a tremendous toll on so many that have cared for and lost loved ones during this time. The distractions we have faced as a nation and as a company are significant, yet the Nucor team has never lost its way in delivering the safest year in our history. Let me repeat that again. 2020 was the safest year in the history of our company. I'm extremely grateful for the hard work, dedication, ownership of our nearly 27,000 team members who made this result possible. While there still is a great deal of work ahead of us in our journey to become the world's safest steel company, I am more convinced than ever that this team will accomplish our goal. To our Nucor teammates, thank you. I am proud for you all. Well done. Now let's make 2021 our safest year ever.
Joining me today on the call are the members of Nucor's executive team, including Jim Frias, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Sumoski, Chief Operating Officer; Al Behr, responsible for Plate and Structural Products; Craig Feldman, responsible for Raw Materials; Doug Jellison, responsible for DJJ and Logistics; Greg Murphy, responsible for Business Services, and our General Counsel; Ray Napolitan, responsible for Engineered Bar Products; Rex Query, responsible for Sheet and Tubular Products; MaryEmily Slate, responsible for our Commercial Strategy; Chad Utermark, responsible for Fabricated Construction Products; and Dan Needham, who will be joining our Charlotte team on February 1 and be responsible for Bar Products.
At the end of the year, we announced several changes to our executive team. Dave Sumoski was promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Dave has been with Nucor since 1995 and has led multiple steel product groups and strategic initiatives, most recently combining our domestic rebar, steel mill and fabrication businesses. Dave is uniquely positioned to help Nucor continue to build lasting partnerships while executing our enterprise-wide strategy.
MaryEmily Slate has taken on a new role as Executive Vice President for Commercial. This is the first time we have had an EVP-level leader in this role at Nucor. The purpose is to enhance our ability to focus on our key markets and to better connect with our customers. Meeting the future needs of our customers while maintaining and maximizing the benefits of the broad and diversified offering of Nucor will be a vital function of MaryEmily's team as we move forward.
I would also like to welcome 4 new team members to our executive team, Rex Query, Doug Jellison, Greg Murphy and Dan Needham. Each of these executive management team promotions will enhance our ability to serve our customers and our shareholders.
Business conditions remained strong in the fourth quarter, with improving pricing and healthy volumes across our diverse product portfolio. Of particular note, utilization rates at our sheet mills and plate mills continue their sharp upturn in the fourth quarter. While we were pleased with our operating performance and cash flow for the period, our earnings were impacted by noncash charges, which were more than offset by tax benefits recognized in the quarter. The most substantial of these were related to our agreement to exit from the Duferdofin-Nucor joint venture and the impairment charge writing down the value of our Castrip operations, both of which impacted our steel mills segment earnings.
The capabilities of our new state-of-the-art cold mill and the Generation 3 galvanizing line we have under construction at Nucor Arkansas have diminished our utilization of Castrip. We do plan on continuing to fully support existing customers as well as the technology to further improve Castrip's product offerings for Castrip licensees.
The noncash charge that we recorded upon exiting the Duferdofin-Nucor joint venture was actually more than offset by a tax benefit related to our investment, so it did not hurt our net income for the quarter. Jim Frias will elaborate more in his opening remarks.
Turning now to comment on 2020 as a whole. The year ended up much stronger than anyone would have anticipated when the pandemic first took hold of our global economy in March of last year. Our team and our business model proved to be incredibly resilient, and we were able to take advantage of the stronger-than-expected recovery because of the Nucor team doing an excellent job keeping our mills running reliably and safely throughout the volatility that characterized 2020. This allowed us to reliably fulfill our customers' requirements. Our focus remains on continuing to deliver a differentiated value proposition to meet and exceed our customers' needs.
Looking at specific end-use markets, construction remains strong throughout the pandemic, and automotive was quick to recover in the second half of the year after shutting down in the second quarter. Together, these 2 markets account for nearly 2/3 of steel consumption. We are aware of certain leading indicators signaling a downturn in nonres construction activity, but so far, we don't see much evidence of that. Our company is well positioned in attractive subsegments of the nonres construction market. There are areas of strength, most notably warehouses and data centers, that may not be fully reflected in the ABI and other indicators. We have worked to build relationships in these subsegments that are bright spots, ensuring that we are providing the best solutions across steelmaking and steel products to serve those customers.
We are cautiously optimistic that a significant infrastructure spending bill will be passed by Congress and signed by the new President this year. After years of talk, this must get done. We are still driving on roads and bridges designed and built during the Eisenhower administration. This is not sustainable. We would not be surprised if a funding bill focused in part on green infrastructure spending, including renewable power generation and transmission. Nucor is well positioned to meet our country's needs of environmentally friendly steel and steel products. With roughly 50% of our steel used in the construction sector, there is arguably no company more poised and ready to meet the needs of rebuilding our country than Nucor.
In the automotive market, we believe demand should continue its rebound. We think 2021 light vehicle production in North America will be around 16 million vehicles. Having wrapped up the fall contract season, we feel good about our prospects for continuing share gains in the automotive market.
The investments we have made at our sheet mills in Arkansas and in Kentucky to expand our production of value-added products are paying off. Demand from the oil and gas sector continues to be weak even as oil prices have been rising along with many other commodities. I think that significant continued improvement in that market is going to depend on how quickly vaccines can get out to a large number of people and how long it takes for commuting and travel patterns to approach pre-pandemic levels.
Strong demand growth from the renewable energy sector has partially offset the weakness in oil. Our sales to the renewable power sector have been very strong this year, with steelmaking segment orders related to these markets growing by double digits compared to the 2019 total. The renewable power market is what Nucor is targeting, and many of our steel and steel products are essential to its continued buildout. We rely primarily on recycled steel to make these products, and they themselves are 100% recyclable. This fact positions us well as the supplier of choice here as we see sustainability and product transparency becoming a more important factor in product sourcing decisions in the renewable power sector and in most other end-use markets. We are also seeing signs that other end-use markets will rebound from this past year's depressed levels, including heavy-duty trucks, heavy equipment and agriculture.
Turning to our strategic growth projects. We continue to make excellent progress on them during the fourth quarter. Our new rebar micromill in Frostproof, Florida started up operations on schedule in December. Congratulations to the entire Nucor Steel Florida team for getting this new steel mill up and running on time and for doing it safely.
This past October, we celebrated the groundbreaking of our new steel plate mill in Kentucky. Our Nucor Steel Brandenburg team has done a great job keeping the project on schedule throughout this year, and we are moving at full speed to bring the state-of-the-art plate mill to market during the fourth quarter of 2022.
We're also making great progress on our expansion project at our Gallatin sheet mill. The expansion project is expected to start up in the second half of this year. With regard to some of our facilities that are in operation, I'm pleased to report the new pickle galvanizing line at Gallatin had an excellent first full year of operation despite the pandemic, shipping 39% more tons than we projected when we approved the project. Year 1 profitability was also ahead of plan. Gallatin's entry into the value-added coated sheet market has proven very timely, with the strong flat-rolled market conditions that emerged in the second half of 2020 and are continuing into Q1 2021. We have experienced very strong customer acceptance of Gallatin's coated product as we further develop target markets that include automotive, solar, tubing, roll-forming, grain storage, culvert and cooling towers.
Also, the new cold mill at Nucor Steel Arkansas has gotten off to a strong start, with shipments almost 30% ahead of our initial plan for the mill. Strong customer acceptance rates following trials were conducted throughout 2020, mean that the new mill is now booked out for this year at 85% of its nameplate capacity for contract customers. We are looking forward to running our first prime coil off our new Gen 3 galv line at Arkansas later this year. This is slightly behind our original schedule due primarily to the slowdown in capital expenditures we instituted around the beginning of the pandemic.
Our new rebar micromill in Sedalia has also exceeded our expectations. The team there generated a solid operating profit during the most recent quarter, and its spooled rebar product continues to be well received by our customers. At our galvanizing line joint venture with JFE in Mexico, we were back up running after a government-mandated shutdown and beginning to ship coils to automotive customers. Congratulations to the team there.
Our Kankakee, Illinois bar mill completed commissioning of its new MBQ rolling mill in December. While the time line of this project was slightly extended due to COVID-related disruptions, customer acceptance of the new products has been extremely strong. We expect to achieve positive cash flow from this investment in Q1. Construction on upgrades to Kankakee's melt shop, including a new caster ladle stir station, will begin in earnest in February, with final commissioning of this equipment expected in Q4 of this year. This investment will significantly improve the energy efficiency of the Kankakee mill.
Before I turn the call over to Jim, let me give a shout-out to our teammates at Louisiana DRI operations. As many of you are aware, we took some downtime at Louisiana in 2019 and have invested approximately $200 million to enhance operational reliability there. It has really paid off. In 2020, the Nucor Steel Louisiana team set new records for production, shipping and operating hours. Most importantly, our team there accomplished all of this while operating safely for more than 450 consecutive days. Later this quarter, we will finish our work improving Louisiana's ore yard.
With that, let me turn the call over to Jim to provide more details about our financial performance and outlook for the first part of 2021. Jim?"

As detailed in our news release, results for the just-completed quarter included a number of nonoperational items that were n",758,"Thanks, Leon. Fourth quarter earnings of $1.30 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $1.15 to $1.20 per diluted share. As detailed in our news release, results for the just-completed quarter included a number of nonoperational items that were not included in our guidance. After-tax effects, again for the items not included in our guidance, the total impact was produced net income by just under $34 million or approximately $0.11 per diluted share. Earnings significantly exceeded our guidance as the pace of margin expansion at our steel mills surpassed our expectations. Conditions improved for many of our businesses throughout the quarter and now are the strongest they have been in some years.
As Leon mentioned, and as detailed in our news release, we were able to claim tax deductions related to our investment in Duferdofin-Nucor joint venture that more than offset the related loss on assets we recorded in the fourth quarter.
Cash provided by operating activities for full year 2020 was $2.7 billion. Nucor's free cash flow or cash provided by operations minus capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2020, comfortably exceeding cash dividends paid to stockholders of $492 million. Over the last 3 years, Nucor has generated $3.9 billion of free cash flow, even as we reinvested $4 billion in our businesses.
As mentioned on previous calls, we have intensified our focus on maintaining appropriate working capital levels and reducing the asset base we require to generate strong profitability. I am happy to report that even as steel market demand and pricing has rebounded strongly in recent months, our tons of raw material inventory are actually down by more than 6% from the prior year-end.
At the close of the fourth quarter, our cash, short-term investments and restricted cash holdings totaled just under $3.2 billion. Nucor's liquidity also includes our undrawn $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which matures in April of 2023. Total long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5.3 billion. Gross debt as a percent of total capital was 32%, while net debt represented 13% of total capital.
The flexibility provided by Nucor's low-cost operating model and financial strength continues to be a critical underpinning to our company's ability to grow long-term earnings power and return capital to our shareholders. Dividends and share repurchases totaled $531 million or 74% of net income during 2020. And with the dividend increase announced in December, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 48 consecutive years, every year since we first began paying dividends in 1973.
Speaking of growing long-term earnings power, let me take a moment to provide a brief rundown on where we stand on some of our organic growth projects. 3 projects started operations in 2019: a new specialty cold-rolling mill at our Arkansas sheet mill; a rolling mill modernization at our Ohio rebar mill; and a hot band galvanizing line at our Kentucky sheet mill. Another 4 projects started production during 2020: our rebar micromill in Missouri; our Illinois merchant bar rolling mill; our joint venture sheet steel galvanizing line in Mexico; and our Florida rebar micromill. The remaining 3 projects are: the expansion and modernization of our Kentucky sheet mill; our Generation 3 flexible galvanizing line at our Arkansas sheet mill; and our Kentucky plate mill. At the close of 2020, remaining capital expenditures for these 3 are approximately $1.9 billion, with the Kentucky plate mill project representing about 3/4 of that total. We expect that Nucor's total capital spending for 2021 will be in the area of $2 billion. Approximately 80% of the 2021 spending is to improve product capabilities and reduce costs.
Turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2021. As Leon indicated, we are encouraged by a number of positive factors impacting our markets. We expect earnings in the first quarter of 2021 to be significantly higher than our reported results for the fourth quarter of 2020. The expected performance of the steel mills segment in the first quarter of 2021 is the primary driver for this increase as our sheet, plate, bar and structural mills are all forecasting increased profitability. Our downstream steel product segment's performance in the first quarter is expected to decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 due to typical seasonal patterns and some margin compression due to a lag between rising steel input costs and increased selling prices. The raw materials segment's performance in the first quarter is expected to be significantly improved due to higher raw materials selling prices.
Thank you for your interest in our company. Leon?"

Our crystal ball probably isn't significantly better than yours. So let me just share a few thoughts with you though. We certainly do anticipate a near-term correction in the month of February, which, I guess, is not all that surprising given the nearly $200 increase that we've seen in the last 90 days or so. In fact, we've already seen some international scrap prices, notably Turkey, fall here just really in the recent days. So we certainly see some moderate corrections from the January levels, especially on obsolete grades, which are highly elastic and where flows have really been pretty good recently.
Prime scrap grades are also likely to moderate a bit, but we don't believe it will fall as much as the obsolete grades. February pricing would likely be down $30 to $50 a ton depending on both the grade and the region. But we would certainly characterize that as, I would say, a fairly normal correction given the size of the recent run-up in prices.
And just a couple of other things, and Leon alluded to this in his opening remarks, but there are some other factors that work here, too. The overall commodity price environment is pretty darn solid. And I don't think Leon mentioned this, but a relatively weak dollar really could put -- help put a floor under that and really sustain the general commodity environment.
The other thing I would point to, there are some seasonal factors. The month of February is typically a pretty weak month for scrap pricing overall. And meanwhile, March typically sees higher prices. So -- and we track this pretty closely on -- with some heat maps, as you might imagine, Seth. Historically, scrap prices in the calendar month of February are either flat or down around 70% of the time, and we're going back to the last 20 years or so. And March is the exact opposite of that, with prices rising or flat around 70% of the time. So we certainly could see some exceptions to those trends, but we really believe that, this year, we'll follow that more typical seasonal pattern, if you will. So bottom line, our near-term view on scrap pricing has some downward pressure and is likely to stabilize after that.
And if I may, one final comment on this. Just an observation with regard to scrap and steel pricing, and this may not be fully apparent or intuitive to most folks, but scrap prices follow steel pricing and not the other way around. Again, steel demand and steel pricing lead scrap demand and scrap pricing. And as Jim and Leon alluded to in their opening remarks, our view is pretty darn optimistic right now. So hopefully, that gives you some color."

So you can then extrapolate off of that what's left beyond 2021 in those projects.

We do have more downstream processing now with more galvanizing lines. So the WIP inventory in our system is probably a little higher when we think about the WIP that's sitting at Gallatin that would have just gone straight to us and shipped in the past. So there's other factors that come into play in terms of the timing of shipment versus production, but we would expect to have a strong shipping month in the first quarter as well as a strong production month."

So I know we talked about the near-term dynamic, which makes a lot of sense. But if you listen to Steel Dynamics' call, they sounded pretty relaxed about scrap availability even with all the new capacity, consuming more scrap over the next couple of years. And if you listen to Cliffs', they will tell you that there's going to be a run on scrap.
So I kind of wanted to hear where Nucor stands in terms of your perspective. Clearly, you have the DRI capability that enables you to be more vertically integrated in the iron units. But do you think that it's going to be an issue? Do you think that it makes sense to expand your position? Just it would be great to get your thoughts."

And look, as we look out to the long term, as the mix continues to shift from integrated mills, to EAFs, and again, we're about 70% of the steelmaking capacity today",232,"Yes, maybe I'll kick this off, and Jim or Craig, jump in if you've got some other points. And look, as we look out to the long term, as the mix continues to shift from integrated mills, to EAFs, and again, we're about 70% of the steelmaking capacity today in the United States, the EAF sector is, the demand on prime scrap is going to stay very tight, and that's going to now increase. And as we've pointed out on previous calls, because we need more prime, the automakers aren't going to make more units because the steel mills need that scrap. So the high metallics, the quality metallics side of things, and controlling our own downstream input to that, for us, is really very strategic.
And so I don't think we're at the point where we're going to increase that. But the things that we're doing everyday to continue to maximize that, the investments in Louisiana, and continuing some of those investments in the ore yard to increase the efficiency and increase the yield and throughputs there will be areas of that. But again, as we move forward, I do see as more EAF-based mills come online and the demand as we move up the value chain even for ourselves in automotive is going to put continued pressure on the prime market. Craig, anything you would like to add to that?"
184945,700518326,2252826,"Nucor Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Yes. Actually, I do. And you touched on some of it. But Timna, you're right. There is a lot of dialogue around this topic, and it's something that we've been thinking about for, frankly, for years. And we do agree with the assertion that high-quality meta",680,"Yes. Actually, I do. And you touched on some of it. But Timna, you're right. There is a lot of dialogue around this topic, and it's something that we've been thinking about for, frankly, for years. And we do agree with the assertion that high-quality metallics, as Leon just said, will become tighter going forward. Even obsolete grades, we do envision that getting tighter with the conversion from integrated to EAF.
And maybe what I would like to talk about more is what we've been doing and preparing for in that regard and how -- what we've been doing with our overall raw materials strategy, if I could. And I guess, the key to that strategy really is around our flexibility and optionality, and it's really around 3 key components that give us access to and influence over our total raw material needs. And first of all, and we talk about this a lot with regard to the DRI plants, but our capability there is roughly 4 million tons of high-quality material. And those plants, the 2 DRI plants, really can reach all of our DRI-consuming mills on the River or the East Coast in a very economical or freight-logical way.
And as Leon alluded to, the Louisiana team really has made tremendous progress to improve the production and the reliability. And meanwhile, and sometimes this gets overlooked, is the Nu-Iron team in Trinidad just keeps chugging along, and they've got a long history of low-cost production and really world-class quality and reliability in the way they produce DRI.
And the second leg of this is really the David Joseph Company or DJJ's recycling operations, with 4 million to 5 million tons a year of ferrous processing capacity. And they're just really well-positioned to supply our own mills. Most of these DJJ locations, and there's about 65 sites in total, are focused on producing scrap, again, within the freight-logical range of our own mills. And we continue to, I would say, opportunistically add capacity to the DJJ processing platform as we did in the last 18 months or so with a handful of tuck-in acquisitions, including a couple of shredders.
And finally, the third leg of the overall strategy is, again, the DJJ brokerage and trading team really gives excellent coverage of both the domestic and international markets from a -- on a third-party supply basis, which we think is a big advantage. And I know the DJJ brokerage team prides itself on knowing its supply base extremely well and has access to scrap substitutes, not only in the U.S., but globally. And for example, the team did a really nice job here recently with the tightness in supply, which I do believe, Timna, back to your question, is symptomatic of what we're going to see in the future. But they've been able to capitalize on both, some, I would say, long-standing relationships with key supply partners, but also went to some areas of the world that we haven't been to in a long time. And they've done a really good job with that, to secure all the material we need despite those supply constraints.
So to sum it up, yes, we certainly envision that the metallics market could and probably will tighten up, but the flexibility and the options that we have from our own DRI scrap processing assets of around 8 million or 9 million tons a year in total, along with the third-party relationships, that gives us the access and influence just on the material that we have, our own assets, dedicated to give us about 1/3 of our total metallics demand covered. So that 8 million to 9 million tons really represents about 1/3.
So yes, I feel very confident, very comfortable on our ability to economically and efficiently secure our metallic needs going forward. Will it be -- will there be the normal market gyrations? Of course. But I feel like our strategy is well established, and we're in a good spot to navigate it well. Hopefully, that gives you a little extra color, Timna."

But at the end of the day, 2020 was, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, certainly a very challenging year. And at the same time, Carlos, Nucor, in our downstream businesses, we had 3 product groups that set records for profitability. And so we ended up in a very, very strong position and again, as we move forward, look at order entry rates and backlogs, were at or near historic highs.
And so while we expect to see some compression there, the recent price increases, our metal margins, are actually going to continue to grow in most businesses. Again, certainly, the downstream side will face a little bit of compression. But again, it's coming off, again, in most of our downstream near-record profitability standpoint. So again, we do see it staying very strong as we move forward.
To your point around working capital, that's something that we, as a team, I'm really proud of our executive leadership team. At the onset of this pandemic in February of last year, we met, and we put some things in place with our leadership across all of the mills and operations to be incredibly disciplined and took very, very deliberate steps to manage our working inventory in scrap, WIP and finished goods. And that discipline and that -- well, that discipline is going to continue and it has continued. And so we're not long as we think about the product groups. We're not long in scrap, we're not long in WIP, and we're not long in the steel mills providing to our downstream product group. So we feel very good about the true cycle profitability of all of our businesses. Chad, any comments you would like to add on the products segment?"

And I know there are some sources out there that are indicating nonres may not be as strong as perhaps we say it is or even looking into the future. But we derive our business outlook from numerous sources, but we do put a heavy emphasis on our customer input and our internal order entry data points. And we're excited as many of our downstream businesses have very strong backlogs and as, in some cases, we have record backlogs, all-time record backlogs as we head into 2021. And also, we monitor our recent quoting activity. And I can tell you, in a lot of our businesses, over the last 4, 5, 6, 7 weeks, we've seen activity rise.
I want to repeat something Jim Frias said in his opening comments. And while we respect and do monitor the industry trade group data, we offer that some of the rising nonres construction arenas may not be fully reflected in that architectural data. So our strong relationships with key customers, our breadth of product that we offer to the market, I guess I would just summarize by saying we're excited as we head into 2021. There will be some compression in some of our downstream businesses with rising steel costs, but those prices are being passed on in the marketplace, are being accepted. And we look forward to the coming months. Thanks, Leon."

Leon touched on how the team got together and was very thoughtful about managing working capital as a result of the crisis. We also were very thoughtful about the volatility downward in pricing that we were seeing last summer and not getting caught up in that and taking too much business on our books at below-market pricing. And so that discipline has positioned us well as we go into 2021, to not have a lot of low-priced backlog to work through. And so yes, with the extreme movement in steel pricing we've seen in the last 90 days, there is some minor compression in the downstream business, but it's going to be minor. So that's the first point.
And then back to your question on working capital. We think volumes of working capital, if you think about it on a tons basis, will be similar. Scrap prices will be relatively flat. So we think inventory values will be relatively flat. But receivables values will go up because steel mill pricing, on average selling prices, will be higher in Q1 than they were in Q4. So we'll let you estimate what you think average prices are going up, but take that times the amount of tons we ship and that should be the build of working capital for 1 month because we basically collect receivables in about 30 days. And I guess that's pretty much it. So thank you for the question."

So it's hard to imagine that there will be any material tonnage coming out of Gallatin this year, but the start-up at the beginning of next year -- well, if the start-up at the end of this year will go smoothly, we'll be able to run that rate sometime in the first quarter."

It could be in that range when we do our tax return in August as a result of the great work our tax team did this year. And I will do a shout out to a few folks. Deb Douglas is our International Tax Manager, and she's the one who figured out the opportunity to take advantage of the work, the stock deduction that allowed us to capture so much value after we made the decision to exit the [ DN ]. And then, of course, the overall tax team, including all the managers, [ John Taylor ], [ Amy Cattel ] and the others, just did a great job of doing all the year-end work that's necessary for us to come up with those figures. But we're going to have cash benefits beyond this year because of the accelerated depreciation in our big projects. And we think that over the 3-year period, it's $575 million.
If you give me a minute to look, I think next year's cash benefit is going to be in the neighborhood of $240 million, and the year after that, when we finalize Gallatin because that's going to be the -- or excuse me, Brandenburg, that's going to be the biggest impactor, it's going to be north of a $330 million cash benefit. But our book rate should be in a normalized range of that 24%, which includes the federal and state rate, assuming there's no tax increase during that time period."

As we continue to work toward our goal of becoming the safest steel company in the world, we are maintaining our focus, especially as our operations have ramped up across the company in response to strong steel demand. Knowing where to focus our efforts can bring tremendous improvement in safety performance. 
Looking at our safety data. Approximately 40% to 50% of our recordable injuries are hand-related. To address this, we held a company-wide Hand Safety Week at the end of February. We are optimistic that our increased focus in this area will enable us to make meaningful progress toward our goal. I want to thank all of our teammates for your commitment to improve the most important value in our company, the safety, health and well-being of our entire Nucor family. This past quarter was our best quarter in Nucor's history. I'd like to thank our customers for the trust replace in us with each and every order. And I'd also like to thank our team who make extraordinary results like these possible. 
Net earnings per share of $3.10 far surpassed our previous quarterly record of $2.31 sent back in the third quarter of 2008. Robust cash flow from operations during the quarter allowed Nucor to return $425 million to our shareholders while maintaining our strong liquidity position. 
Demand for our products remains quite strong with healthy volumes and metal spreads across our diverse portfolio of products. Capacity utilization at our steel mills increased to 95% for the quarter from 87% in the fourth quarter of last year. Many of our product groups are running at or near full capacity. We have had some spare capacity in long products. We are adding shifts in many of our steel product facilities to meet robust market demand. It's gratifying to see such strong performance across all of Nucor. We are clearly reaping the rewards from our prior investments in the more strategic approaches we are taking with our key end-use markets. 
Most of the end-use markets we serve remain strong and inventories remain lean across supply chains. We have greater certainty today that the current favorable demand outlook will persist through the rest of 2021. We are benefiting from our strategy of intentionally targeting our product capabilities at attractive subsegments of our various markets. 
Our latest project announcements continue in this vein, namely the new tube mill we are building in Kentucky and the new insulated panel facility in Utah. We also see indications that the strength in nonres construction is broadening out beyond the warehouse, data center and cold storage subsectors. The ABI index turned positive in February after 11 consecutive months of contraction, and the Dodge Momentum Index recently registered 151.4, which I believe is the highest reading since 2018. 
Also, backlogs across our steel product segments are all very strong. Our fabricating partner customers are reporting strong demand and strong inquiry activity in the construction and fabrication markets. I'm particularly excited to see the business momentum being generated by our Construction Solutions team. We formed this group last year so we can develop deeper strategic relationships in the construction market and better leverage our diverse product offering. The team regularly interacts with a broad set of influencers, including owners, developers, architects and engineers. 
We also recently launched a trademark high-strength beam product called AOS, a grade A913 beam. AOS beams are produced efficiently from sustainable, recycled steel at our Nucor Yamato Steel plant and allow for faster and lighter construction. Nucor Yamato is the only producer of these grade A913 high-strength beams in North America. We are already realizing attractive orders from this effort and are optimistic that we will see many more opportunities as we leverage the unique capabilities of the Nucor portfolio, including AOS. 
We are also pleased that President Biden has put forward an ambitious infrastructure plan. We look forward to working with the administration and Congress and are confident our country can make a meaningful investment with sustainable funding to rebuild our nation's infrastructure. Action is long overdue as the recent grade of C minus by the American Society of Civil Engineers U.S. Infrastructure report card illustrates, in the last 5 years, Nucor alone has melted, poured and shipped over 130 million tons of steel rebar, plate, structural beams, sheet and countless other steel products. We are well positioned and ready to help our nation build back better. 
Turning to the automotive market. We expect the industry to produce approximately 16 million vehicles this year. The shortage of semiconductors, severe weather impacts and other issues have hurt recent production volumes in the auto market. We expect the difficulties to continue into the third quarter. Even with these disruptions, our mills have been running full out to satisfy customer requirements from the auto sector. It's also worth noting that light vehicle demand is very strong and inventories are quite low. We expect that sector will be running hard to get caught up with the demand for at least the rest of the year. 
We continue to see strong demand in the renewable energy market, and we believe that the steel needs of this sector will grow rapidly in the coming years. The Biden administration has set a goal of deploying 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind power by 2030. This could require as much as 8 million tons of steel. We look forward to supplying the requirements of the renewable power sector with steel and steel products that have much lower levels of embedded CO2 emissions than those of competitors and are a natural fit for the renewable energy applications. We have the right capabilities to provide steel products to this market and executing power purchase agreements like the ones we have concluded with Orsted and EDF helps us to develop constructive commercial relationships in this sector while lowering our overall CO2 intensity even further. 
In other markets, agriculture, trucks and other heavy equipments are all showing strength. The oil and gas market is improving, with rig counts climbing gradually from the depressed levels seen last year. The appliance market is benefiting from the economic rebound in direct payments people are receiving as part of the COVID relief passed by Congress. 
Now I'd like to give you a brief update on the progress of several of our strategic growth projects. Following a pandemic-related delay, commissioning resumed last fall at our galvanizing line JV with JFE in Mexico. The team there is busy trialing and qualifying product with automotive customers as well as shipping product for alternative end-use applications while this work proceeds. The commissioning of our new gen 3 galvanizing line at Nucor Steel Arkansas is expected to occur in the third quarter, with prime production off that line to follow soon after. We are excited about the advanced capabilities this project will give the mill, and I think it is fair to say that our customers are excited as well. 
The expansion and modernization project at Nucor Steel Gallatin in Kentucky is on track to produce steel by the end of the year. To prepare for commissioning, the Gallatin mill will be shut down for 3 weeks, sometime in the fourth quarter. We are anticipating a gradual ramp-up of the incremental capacity at Gallatin, expecting to achieve 1 million tons of incremental output from the upgraded facilities in 2022 and to achieve the full benefit of the added production capability of 1.4 million tons in 2023. 
We also remain on schedule with the construction of our new plate mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky. We see Brandenburg's commissioning time frame, which is scheduled for a start-up in late 2022, as ideally suited to serve the offshore wind market. Nucor Steel Brandenburg will be one of only a very few mills in the world capable of reliably supplying steel plate suited to offshore wind market applications and expectations. 
Now Jim Frias will provide more details about our record financial performance in the first quarter. Jim?"

First quarter earnings of $3.10 per diluted share were at the high end of our guidance range. Nucor's record quarterly earnings were driven by strong performances across our broad portfolio of steelmaking, downstream and raw materials businesses, and highlights the success of our 26,000 team members at building a stronger and more profitable Nucor. 
The performance of our Steel Products segment was perhaps the biggest surprise of the quarter as it delivered improved earnings over its very strong fourth quarter results, countering the normal seasonal trend and overcoming the impact of a temporary margin squeeze due to the quick run-up of steel prices. The just completed quarter included some initial returns from our multiyear growth investment projects. 
Our Hickman, Arkansas sheet mill's specialty cold rolling mill is rapidly expanding its portfolio of high-strength, lightweight products increasingly demanded by OEM customers. The mill ran at 111% of nameplate capacity in the first quarter, with cash flow and profit contribution well ahead of the project's capital authorization budget. 
Our new Gallatin, Kentucky hot band galvanizing line production rate in the first quarter was 116% of its design capacity, with cash flow and profit contribution substantially exceeding our capital budget projections. Our Gallatin teammates are building a strong portfolio of automotive and other customers in the underserved Midwest heavy gauge galvanized hot-band market. 
The Sedalia, Missouri rebar micro mill completed its first year of production in February with cash flow and profit contribution also significantly ahead of the project's budgeted performance. Sedalia's spooled rebar product continues to enjoy strong commercial success. 
Our second rebar micro mill located in Frostproof, Florida began production in December and achieved profitability for the month of March. We congratulate our Frostproof team for their incredibly fast ramp, achieving this significant milestone well ahead of schedule. 
Our Kankakee, Illinois merchant bar rolling mill completed equipment commissioning in December, product trials in February and achieved positive cash flow for the month of March. Further upgrades to Kankakee's melt shop are proceeding and on schedule for completion later this year. With its new capabilities, Nucor Steel Kankakee is well positioned in the heart of the Midwest MBQ market to serve our customers with a state-of-the-art mill and an unrivaled product portfolio. 
We are delighted with the successful ramp-up of these important new additions to Nucor's capabilities. We believe this validates both our strategies and the team's consistent focus on execution. We are confident in these projects prospects to continue generating attractive returns with reduced volatility throughout the economic cycle. 
We again generated strong operating cash flow during the first quarter, enabling us to fund our CapEx and to post free cash flow of about $217 million for the period. Financial strength continues to be a critical underpinning to our company's ability to grow long-term earnings power. At the close of the first quarter, our cash, short-term investments and restricted cash holdings totaled just under $3 billion. Total long-term debt was approximately $5.3 billion. Gross debt as a percent of total capital was 31%, while net debt represented only 13% of total capital. 
We generally seek to keep net debt to total capital within a range of 18% to 23%. We feel this is consistent with the strong investment-grade credit rating that Nucor has strategically maintained through economic cycles over the years. At present, of course, we are somewhat underleveraged. This reflects our conservative approach in early 2020 when the economic outlook was more uncertain. We will continue to manage to this target capitalization, and we'll adjust going forward by returning excess capital to our shareholders, just as we have in the past. 
We took some steps in that direction during the first quarter. Cash returned to shareholders was 45% of net income or $425 million, including the repurchase of 5.4 million shares at an average price slightly above $56 per share. And with the payment of our February quarterly dividend, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 48 consecutive years or every year since we first began paying dividends in 1973. 
Our highest capital allocation priority remains investing in our businesses to ensure our continued growth and long-term profitability. We continue to estimate total capital spending for 2021 of approximately $2 billion. Approximately 80% of the 2021 capital spending is for improved product capabilities and cost savings projects. About half of the anticipated total 2021 capital spending is for our 3 remaining major projects: the expansion and modernization of the Gallatin, Kentucky sheet mill; the Generation 3 flexible galvanizing line at the Hickman, Arkansas sheet mill; and the greenfield Brandenburg, Kentucky plate mill. 
Turning to the outlook for the second quarter of 2021. As Leon mentioned, we are optimistic. We see improving or stable market conditions for the vast majority of the end-use markets served by Nucor. At the same time, inventories throughout the supply chain remain lean. 
Earnings in the second quarter of 2021 are expected to again set a new record for the company. The primary driver for this increase is further margin expansion at our sheet and plate mills. Our first quarter record performance reinforces our confidence in the value being created by our strategic initiatives. The opportunities ahead for the Nucor team are exciting. We have great determination to deliver increasing long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you for your interest in our company. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A."

You mentioned the offshore wind market. That's obviously something we're watching very carefully and very excited about. As Leon mentioned, the positioning of Brandenburg within that market is truly ideal. There's many things about the capability of that mill that generate competitive advantage for us. One of them is the width. With the capability up to 14 feet, that's an advantage within the offshore market as well as many others. The exceptional quality capabilities out of that mill create advantage for that market as well as the grade and chemistry range. It's got an outstanding grade range, and it's really squarely aimed at the offshore wind market. So we are watching that very, very carefully.

That's what our interim projections say. Roughly $1 billion is going to be spent over the next 3 quarters on our 3 big projects that are coming near completion, different phases of completion: the gen 3 galvanizing line at Hickman, the Gallatin expansion and, of course, the Brandenburg plate mill. 
We've not made any comments about 2022, but with Gallatin essentially complete and the cold mill at Hickman complete, unless we come up with some new projects, it's probably going to be lower than the $2 billion that we're going to spend this year. But we've not actually put together a budget yet for the 2022 expansion. But we're a strong free cash flow company. And so we're going to have plenty of liquidity to invest in at least that much if we wanted to."

And so what I would tell you is approximately 46% of Nucor's products move into the construction sector. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're really excited about our launch of the Construction Solutions team. And what that team is doing is really positioning Nucor differently to better utilize the breadth and the capabilities of Nucor. 
We are not about getting bigger in capacity. We are about enhanced capabilities to serve our customers. And by launching the Construction Solutions arm and the branding of products like AOS, it truly differentiates us in the marketplace. And so that value capture now in helping architects, engineers, fabricators, designers to recognize how to fully utilize the complement of Nucor's offerings is really a unique strategic advantage. 
As you think about the backlog, the strength of the nonres construction market, all of those indicators that we track are very, very strong. But again, as we think about how we leverage the breadth of that market, it's something that we spend a great deal of time on.

As we look out forward, we believe nonres construction will remain solid through 2021 and into 2022. Our quoting activity has been and continues to be very robust. Furthermore, most of our businesses have very strong backlogs. And in some of our downstream businesses, we have all-time record backlogs. As we move through Q2 and into the second half of the year, we do expect to see significant earnings from these businesses. 
You asked about specific markets. And obviously, warehouses, distribution centers, data centers are driving this demand. But it's really across almost all sectors, we're seeing solid demand.

And so we would think next quarter, volumes will be close to the same. And so we're going to just have a price driver. We will see some increased pricing. So how much receivables go up will depend on how much pricing goes up. We generally collect receivables in about 30 days. So what's outstanding on our balance sheet is roughly 30 days of sales to our outside customers. 
Relative to inventory, our inventories went up in the neighborhood of 6%. Of course, the cost per ton went up a significant amount because of scrap and pig iron and derive prices were being up as well. And so inventories are, again, likely not to go up in volume next quarter. I think they're going to be relatively flat. And so we shouldn't see quite the same increase in inventories that we saw in the first quarter -- should be much smaller. And receivables will be less too, but maybe closer to the same just because we're going to have another big increase in pricing in Q2 compared to Q1."

What I do -- what we do believe is with the President signing an executive order commissioning 30,000 megawatts of offshore power, that's going to drive an awful lot more activity behind just these 2 projects.

We use most of the prime scrap and substitutes, which include pig iron, DRI, HBI. We use most of those products at the sheet mills. We can use some at the plate mills as well and some of the other mills, but it's primarily consumed at the sheet mills, and we're already using those products. And we think we've got the most flexible supply chain, probably because a lot of our larger mills are on deepwater ports where they can be a barge or other vessels, receive shipments not only from domestic suppliers, but from offshore suppliers very efficiently, again, because of our positioning of our locations being on the water soften times. But yes, we mix -- we changed the mix of feedstocks based on what's available and what the costs are on a fairly regular basis. And so that's a part of our strategic business plan. 
In terms of tightness in prime scrap markets long term, we saw this coming several years ago and that's why we started building DRI plants. So we've got 2 DRI plants that help give us an option in our supply chain. And when it makes sense to use more HBI -- we max out the usage of what we can use in HBI. The follow-on question we often get is should we build more -- I'm sorry, I said HBI, I meant DRI. A follow-up question we get is should we build more DRI plants. And our view right now is not today If we have so much DRI that we keep prime scrap prices depressed, we're helping our competitors with our capital investment. If the price for prime scrap is tight and we get an advantage that we can capture with profits at the DRI plant, then we have a competitive advantage against other mini mills that make sheet steel. And I would say that look at our profits, let's see what profits get published by integrated mills. And then ask me if you really think that we have a cost disadvantage against integrated."

So total intercompany corporate lens were $451 million. The pieces were intercompany profits was $183 million. That was $175 million more than it was in last year's first quarter. It was $125 million more than it was in the fourth quarter of last year. So that was a big number, and it's going to be lower in the second quarter by a fair amount. We're not targeting a specific number, but that's going to come down. 
Profit sharing, which is 10% of pretax profits, was significant. It was $123 million. We're going to make more money next quarter, so that's going to go up. So based on your profit projection, you should put more money in that pool. 
Other incentive comp that isn't profit-sharing related, it's other incentive comp was up $50 million to $60 million. And that's probably got me in a similar range other than in the second quarter, we grant stock compensation RSUs. And generally, there's a $20 million to $30 million hit because of the timing of that, that just tapped in the second quarter, so that will be extra. 
Other corporate expenses, we're up about $40 million. I would expect that's going to be flat with next quarter.

Number one, we're coming off a capital campaign over the last several years of over $4 billion. Our #1 focus today is to safely and reliably bring that capacity online, which culminates with the startup of Nucor Brandenburg in late 2022. So our very short-term focus is to execute really well and return significant amounts of capital back to our shareholders. 
At the same time, David, we're a growth company. We're not satisfied with the position where we're at today. So I and our team are challenged to think about where do we grow? I can tell you that we're looking hard to continue to invest in our downstream operations to position us well for the future. As I mentioned earlier, our investment strategy isn't to get bigger by volume. It's to add strategic capability and how we differentiate ourselves from our competition. By doing so, our investment in Hickman, Arkansas to be the only EAF producer anywhere to make a full gen 3 product  for the automotive industry is going to be a differentiator for Nucor. So we're going to continue to look hard on how we continue to grow for the long term. The investment in Brandenburg isn't a 1- or 2-year play. It's a 30- or 40- or 50-year play. And so as we think about the opportunities before us, again, it begins with executing really well in culminating and finishing the $4 billion sort of campaign we've been on.

I want to take just a minute to congratulate Ray Napolitan on his upcoming retirement in June. Ray has been an invaluable part of the executive leadership team, and I will greatly miss his leadership, strategic vision and keen insights. I wish him and his wife, [ Jody ], a long, healthy and happy retirement. Thank you both for your commitment and sacrifices during your 25 years with Nucor.

Craig, we wish you and [ Sherry ] a very long, healthy, happy retirement. And on behalf of our entire team, thank you.
As we continue to work toward our goal of becoming the safest steel company in the world, we are maintaining our focus, especially as our operations have ramped up across the company in response to strong steel demand. Knowing where to focus our efforts can bring tremendous improvement in safety performance.
Looking at our safety data. Approximately 40% to 50% of our recordable injuries are hand related. To address this, we held a company-wide Hand Safety Week at the end of February. We are optimistic that our increased focus in this area will enable us to make meaningful progress toward our goal. I want to thank all of our teammates for your commitment to improve the most important value in our company, the safety, health and well-being of our entire Nucor family. This past quarter was our best quarter in Nucor's history. I'd like to thank our customers for the trust you place in us with each and every order, and I'd also like to thank our team who make extraordinary results like these possible.
Net earnings per share of $3.10 far surpassed our previous quarterly record of $2.31 set back in the third quarter of 2008. Robust cash flow from operations during the quarter allowed Nucor to return $425 million to our shareholders while maintaining our strong liquidity position.
Demand for our products remains quite strong, with healthy volumes and metal spreads across our diverse portfolio of products. Capacity utilization at our steel mills increased to 95% for the quarter from 87% in the fourth quarter of last year. Many of our product groups are running at or near full capacity. We have had some spare capacity in long products. We are adding shifts in many of our steel product facilities to meet robust market demand. It's gratifying to see such strong performance across all of Nucor. We are clearly reaping the rewards from our prior investments and the more strategic approaches we are taking with our key end-use markets.
Most of the end-use markets we serve remain strong, and inventories remain lean across supply chains. We have greater certainty today that the current favorable demand outlook will persist through the rest of 2021. We are benefiting from our strategy of intentionally targeting our product capabilities at attractive subsegments of our various markets.
Our latest project announcements continue in this vein, namely the new tube mill we are building in Kentucky and the new insulated panel facility in Utah. We also see indications that the strength in nonres construction is broadening out beyond the warehouse, data center and cold storage subsectors. The ABI Index turned positive in February after 11 consecutive months of contraction, and the Dodge Momentum Index recently registered 151.4, which I believe is the highest reading since 2018.
Also, backlogs across our steel product segments are all very strong. Our fabricating partner customers are reporting strong demand and strong inquiry activity in the construction and fabrication markets. I'm particularly excited to see the business momentum being generated by our Construction Solutions team. We formed this group last year so we can develop deeper strategic relationships in the construction market and better leverage our diverse product offering. The team regularly interacts with a broad set of influencers, including owners, developers, architects and engineers.
We also recently launched a trademark high-strength beam product called Aeos, a grade A913 beam. Aeos beams are produced efficiently from sustainable, recycled steel at our Nucor-Yamato Steel plant and allow for faster and lighter construction. Nucor-Yamato is the only producer of these grade A913, high-strength beams in North America. We are already realizing attractive orders from this effort and are optimistic that we will see many more opportunities as we leverage the unique capabilities of the Nucor portfolio, including Aeos.
We are also pleased that President Biden has put forward an ambitious infrastructure plan. We look forward to working with the administration and Congress and are confident our country can make a meaningful investment with sustainable funding to rebuild our nation's infrastructure. Action is long overdue as the recent grade of C minus by the American Society of Civil Engineers' U.S. infrastructure report card illustrates. In the last 5 years, Nucor alone has melted, poured and shipped over 130 million tons of steel rebar, plate, structural beams, sheet and countless other steel products. We are well positioned and ready to help our nation build back better.
Turning to the automotive market. We expect the industry to produce approximately 16 million vehicles this year. The shortage of semiconductors, severe weather impacts and other issues have hurt recent production volumes in the auto market. We expect the difficulties to continue into the third quarter. Even with these disruptions, our mills have been running full-out to satisfy customer requirements from the auto sector. It's also worth noting that light vehicle demand is very strong, and inventories are quite low. We expect that sector will be running hard to get caught up with the demand for at least the rest of the year.
We continue to see strong demand in the renewable energy market, and we believe that the steel needs of this sector will grow rapidly in the coming years. The Biden administration has set a goal of deploying 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind power by 2030. This could require as much as 8 million tons of steel. We look forward to supplying the requirements of the renewable power sector with steel and steel products that have much lower levels of embedded CO2 emissions than those of competitors and are a natural fit for the renewable energy applications. We have the right capabilities to provide steel products to this market, and executing power purchase agreements like the ones we have concluded with Ørsted and EDF helps us to develop constructive commercial relationships in this sector while lowering our overall CO2 intensity even further.
In other markets, agriculture, trucks and other heavy equipment are all showing strength. The oil and gas market is improving, with rig counts climbing gradually from the depressed levels seen last year. The appliance market is benefiting from the economic rebound in direct payments people are receiving as part of the COVID relief passed by Congress.
Now I'd like to give you a brief update on the progress of several of our strategic growth projects. Following a pandemic-related delay, commissioning resumed last fall at our galvanizing line JV with JFE in Mexico. The team there is busy, trialing and qualifying product with automotive customers as well as shipping product for alternative end-use applications while this work proceeds.
The commissioning of our new Gen 3 galvanizing line at Nucor Steel Arkansas is expected to occur in the third quarter, with prime production off that line to follow soon after. We are excited about the advanced capabilities this project will give the mill, and I think it is fair to say that our customers are excited as well.
The expansion and modernization project at Nucor Steel Gallatin in Kentucky is on track to produce steel by the end of the year. To prepare for commissioning, the Gallatin mill will be shut down for 3 weeks sometime in the fourth quarter. We are anticipating a gradual ramp-up of the incremental capacity at Gallatin, expecting to achieve 1 million tons of incremental output from the upgraded facilities in 2022 and to achieve the full benefit of the added production capability of 1.4 million tons in 2023.
We also remain on schedule with the construction of our new plate mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky. We see Brandenburg's commissioning time frame, which is scheduled for a start-up in late 2022, as ideally suited to serve the offshore wind market. Nucor Steel Brandenburg will be one of only a very few mills in the world capable of reliably supplying steel plate suited to offshore wind market applications and expectations.
Now Jim Frias will provide more details about our record financial performance in the first quarter. Jim?"

First quarter earnings of $3.10 per diluted share were at the high end of our guidance range. Nucor's record quarterly earnings were driven by strong performances across our broad portfolio of steelmaking, downstream and raw materials busine",896,"Thanks, Leon. First quarter earnings of $3.10 per diluted share were at the high end of our guidance range. Nucor's record quarterly earnings were driven by strong performances across our broad portfolio of steelmaking, downstream and raw materials businesses and highlights the success of our 26,000 team members at building a stronger and more profitable Nucor. The performance of our steel products segment was perhaps the biggest surprise of the quarter as it delivered improved earnings over its very strong fourth quarter results, countering the normal seasonal trend and overcoming the impact of a temporary margin squeeze due to the quick run-up of steel prices.
The just completed quarter included some initial returns from our multiyear growth investment projects. Our Hickman, Arkansas sheet mill's specialty cold-rolling mill is rapidly expanding its portfolio of high-strength, lightweight products increasingly demanded by OEM customers. The mill ran at 111% of nameplate capacity in the first quarter, with cash flow and profit contribution well ahead of the project's capital authorization budget.
Our new Gallatin, Kentucky hot band galvanizing line production rate in the first quarter was 116% of its design capacity, with cash flow and profit contribution substantially exceeding our capital budget projections. Our Gallatin teammates are building a strong portfolio of automotive and other customers in the underserved Midwest heavy-gauge, galvanized hot band market.
The Sedalia, Missouri rebar micro mill completed its first year of production in February, with cash flow and profit contribution also significantly ahead of the project's budgeted performance. Sedalia's spooled rebar product continues to enjoy strong commercial success.
Our second rebar micro mill, located in Frostproof, Florida, began production in December and achieved profitability for the month of March. We congratulate our Frostproof team for their incredibly fast ramp, achieving this significant milestone well ahead of schedule.
Our Kankakee, Illinois merchant bar rolling mill completed equipment commissioning in December, product trials in February and achieved positive cash flow for the month of March. Further upgrades to Kankakee's melt shop are proceeding and on schedule for completion later this year. With its new capabilities, Nucor Steel Kankakee is well positioned in the heart of the Midwest MBQ market to serve our customers with a state-of-the-art mill and an unrivaled product portfolio.
We are delighted with the successful ramp-up of these important new additions to new Nucor's capabilities. We believe this validates both our strategies and the team's consistent focus on execution. We are confident in these projects' prospects to continue generating attractive returns with reduced volatility throughout the economic cycle.
We again generated strong operating cash flow during the first quarter, enabling us to fund our CapEx and to post free cash flow of about $217 million for the period. Financial strength continues to be a critical underpinning to our company's ability to grow long-term earnings power. At the close of the first quarter, our cash, short-term investments and restricted cash holdings totaled just under $3 billion. Total long-term debt was approximately $5.3 billion. Gross debt as a percent of total capital was 31%, while net debt represented only 13% of total capital.
We generally seek to keep net debt to total capital within a range of 18% to 23%. We feel this is consistent with the strong investment-grade credit rating that Nucor has strategically maintained through economic cycles over the years. At present, of course, we are somewhat underleveraged. This reflects our conservative approach in early 2020 when the economic outlook was more uncertain. We will continue to manage to this target capitalization and will adjust going forward by returning excess capital to our shareholders just as we have in the past.
We took some steps in that direction during the first quarter. Cash returned to shareholders was 45% of net income or $425 million, including the repurchase of 5.4 million shares at an average price slightly above $56 per share. And with the payment of our February quarterly dividend, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 48 consecutive years or every year since we first began paying dividends in 1973.
Our highest capital allocation priority remains investing in our businesses to ensure our continued growth and long-term profitability. We continue to estimate total capital spending for 2021 of approximately $2 billion. Approximately 80% of the 2021 capital spending is for improved product capabilities and cost savings projects. About half of the anticipated total 2021 capital spending is for our 3 remaining major projects: the expansion and modernization of the Gallatin, Kentucky sheet mill; the Generation 3 flexible galvanizing line at the Hickman, Arkansas sheet mill; and the greenfield Brandenburg, Kentucky plate mill.
Turning to the outlook for the second quarter of 2021. As Leon mentioned, we are optimistic. We see improving or stable market conditions for the vast majority of the end-use markets served by Nucor. At the same time, inventories throughout the supply chain remain lean.
Earnings in the second quarter of 2021 are expected to again set a new record for the company. The primary driver for this increase is further margin expansion at our sheet and plate mills. Our first quarter record performance reinforces our confidence in the value being created by our strategic initiatives. The opportunities ahead for the Nucor team are exciting. We have great determination to deliver increasing long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you for your interest in our company. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A."

You mentioned the offshore wind market. That's obviously something we're watching very carefully and very excited about. As Leon mentioned, the positioning of Brandenburg within that market is truly ideal. There's many things about the capability of that mill that generate competitive advantage for us. One of them is the width. With the capability up to 14 feet, that's an advantage within the offshore market as well as many others. The exceptional quality capabilities out of that mill create advantage for that market as well as the grade and chemistry range. It's got an outstanding grade range, and it's really squarely aimed at the offshore wind market. So we are watching that very, very carefully.

So how much receivables go up will depend on how much pricing goes up. We generally collect receivables in about 30 days. So what's outstanding on our balance sheet is roughly 30 days of sales to our outside customers.
Relative to inventory, our inventories went up in the neighborhood of 6%. Of course, the cost per ton went up a significant amount because of scrap and pig iron and DRI prices were -- being up as well. And so inventories are, again, likely not to go up in volume next quarter. I think they're going to be relatively flat.

And then if I could, on top of that, can you comment on why utilization has seemed to barely budge in the industry, given the volume improvements and restarts that we hear about and customers clamoring for supply? I'd really like to hear your take on that."

And we saw much of that come in plate and -- or plate and sheet. But also our structural mills, rebar mills are -- moved significantly up in their utilization rates. We're seeing incredibly strong backlogs at Nucor-Yamato Steel and Berkeley beams and so the backlog side of the structural market. And I'm not sure I fully understood the question you were driving at structurally, but that demand and the backlogs there are not historic, but they're very, very strong, probably the strongest since the last decade anyway. So as we see that moving forward, that sector, those markets that they serve, we think, will not only be robust but continue well into the year. Al, anything you'd add on the structural side?"

And the other thing was a project from fourth quarter that we highlighted, a significant modernization upgrade of that mill. That was tremendously successful, but it's got such a broad product range that it stretched into January before we had fully shaken out the entire product cycle. So that mill today is running as efficiently as it ever has. That's been a very successful upgrade. So to your point about Q2, no, we expect Q2 run rates to be excellent. Leon made the point about backlogs. They've improved significantly, even just in the last couple of weeks and are at an all-time record.

What I do -- what we do believe is with the President signing an executive order commissioning 30,000 megawatts of offshore power, that's going to drive an awful lot more activity behind just these 2 projects.

Again, with the start-up of Brandenburg in late '22, it really is positioned incredibly well to capitalize and take full advantage of that opportunity in the marketplace.

The second part of your question about product mix, yes, we have flexibility. We use most of the prime scrap and substitutes, which include pig iron, DRI, HBI.

We use most of the prime scrap and substitutes, which include pig iron, DRI, HBI. We use most of those products at the sheet mills. We can use some at the plate mills as well and some of the other mills, but it's primarily consumed at the sheet mills, and we're already using those products. And we think we've got the most flexible supply chain, probably because a lot of our larger mills are on deepwater ports where they can be a barge or other vessels, receive shipments not only from domestic suppliers, but from offshore suppliers very efficiently, again, because of our positioning of our locations being on the waters oftentimes. But yes, we mix -- we change the mix of feedstocks based on what's available and what the costs are on a fairly regular basis. And so that's a part of our strategic business plan.
In terms of tightness in prime scrap markets long term, we saw this coming several years ago, and that's why we started building DRI plants. So we've got 2 DRI plants that help give us an option in our supply chain. And when it makes sense to use more HBI, we max out the usage of what we can use in HBI. The follow-on question we often get is should we build more -- I'm sorry, I said HBI, I meant DRI. A follow-up question we get is should we build more DRI plants. And our view right now is not today. If we have so much DRI that we keep prime scrap prices depressed, we're helping our competitors with our capital investment. If the price for prime scrap is tight and we get an advantage that we can capture with profits at the DRI plant, then we have a competitive advantage against other mini mills that make sheet steel. And I would say that look at our profits, let's see what profits get published by integrated mills. And then ask me if you really think that we have a cost disadvantage against integrateds."

Obviously, low-hanging fruit from a restart perspective is kind of done now. The pipeline on the greenfield side is fairly well defined and getting to being -- to the point where it's behind the industry in a certain respect. Obviously, Nucor over the last few years shifted to a much more aggressive growth profile, including steelmaking capacity. So my question really is, considering the landscape, everything you see out there, should we be thinking that Nucor will continue to add steelmaking capacity, meaningful steelmaking capacity like we've seen with Gallatin and Brandenburg? And if so, when should we start hearing about that?"

Number one, we're coming off a capital campaign over the last several years of over $4 billion. Our #1 focus today is to safely and reliably bring that capacity online, which culminates with the start-up of Nucor Brandenburg in late 2022. So our very short-term focus is to execute really well and return significant amounts of capital back to our shareholders.
At the same time, David, we're a growth company. We're not satisfied with the position where we're at today. So I and our team are challenged to think about where do we grow. I can tell you that we're looking hard to continue to invest in our downstream operations to position us well for the future. As I mentioned earlier, our investment strategy isn't to get bigger by volume. It's to add strategic capability and how we differentiate ourselves from our competition by doing so. Our investment in Hickman, Arkansas, to be the only EAF producer anywhere to make a full Gen 3 product for the automotive industry, is going to be a differentiator for Nucor. So we're going to continue to look hard on how we continue to grow for the long term.
The investment in Brandenburg isn't a 1- or 2-year play. It's a 30- or 40- or 50-year play. And so as we think about the opportunities before us, again, it begins with executing really well in culminating and finishing the $4 billion sort of campaign we've been on. And then how do we think about growth and where does that need to include. And I won't give much more detail other than to tell you we're looking really hard and continuing how to position Nucor for the future."

Thank you for joining us today. With demand for steel remaining strong, and most of our facilities operating at peak performance, we have not lost focus on our goal of becoming the world's safest steel company. We continue to perform well on the safety front as we look to make 2021 our safest year ever, besting our record set just last year. In particular, I want to acknowledge the progress demonstrated by our sheet mills in our 2 DRI facilities for achieving world-class safety performance so far this year. I encourage all of our teammates to maintain their focus on safety so we can achieve the most important goal that we have set for our company. 
Consistent with last month's guidance, Nucor posted record quarterly earnings in the second quarter. Our earnings of $5.04 per share surpassed our previous earnings per share record set last quarter. Our first half earnings of $8.13 per share exceeds our full year EPS record of $7.42 set in 2018. All 3 operating segments are continuing to generate robust profits due to strong demand, higher average selling prices and excellent execution across Nucor. In our Steel Mills segment, we saw the greatest improvement in profitability from our sheet and plate mills. The performance of our Steel Products group also improved compared to the first quarter. Jim will provide more details about our performance this quarter and our outlook for the third quarter in a few minutes. 
This level of performance is the result of years of work strategically growing and positioning our company to thrive in market conditions like we are experiencing today. My congratulations to the entire Nucor team. There are several fundamental drivers of the strong market conditions Nucor is benefiting from today. The most important of these is robust demand. Virtually all the steel end use markets that we monitor are growing. Some of this growth may simply be catch up from the pandemic-induced economic loan we experienced here in the U.S., but we think it goes beyond a temporary rebound. One sign of this is the increasing confidence about next year that we sense from our customers, ranging from automotive, trucking, heavy and ag equipment and across the construction sector. There are noteworthy new drivers for growth in steel demand, warehouses for e-commerce, renewable energy projects and an increase in U.S. manufacturing investment focused on greater supply chain resiliency are all creating new market opportunities for Nucor. Very strong housing and automotive markets are also creating incremental steel demand, not to mention activity by state DOTs, whose infrastructure investment spending has held up better than expected. 
We are fortunate that several of our strategic growth investments have come online during this period, and our results reflect better-than-expected contributions from Nucor Steel Mills in Sedalia, Frostproof, Kankakee, Marion, Gallatin's new galvanizing line and Hickman's new cold mill. My thanks, especially to our teammates at these locations, who have worked safely to ramp these projects up quickly to meet market demands. 
Our strategy continues to be: grow the core, expand beyond and live our culture. We are continuing to make targeted investments and acquisitions to grow our share in attractive markets and increase our long-term earnings power. We are complementing our investment strategy with a sharpened commercial focus that is enabling us to leverage our broad portfolio and deliver increased value to our customers with more integrated solutions. Acquisition announcements we made in the second quarter are focused on the expand beyond part of our mission statement. Our pending acquisition of Cornerstone Building Brands, Insulated Metal Panels business, IMP for short, is squarely aimed at some of the fastest-growing markets I've mentioned. For example, distribution center investments driven by evolving consumer preferences regarding e-commerce and grocery delivery as well as the expansion of data centers and server farms, which all require temperature-controlled environments. Cornerstone's IMP business is a market leader and innovator in the growing IMP product category. 
IMP products are gaining market share as companies and institutions continue to focus on environmental performance and energy efficiency. The superior insulating performance of IMP products reduces energy usage and overall operations-related greenhouse gas emissions Additionally, IMP products are easier to install with lower maintenance cost versus other wall and roofing solutions. Cornerstone's IMP business is an excellent fit with Nucor Buildings Group and we are confident that we can help the team there take performance to an even higher level. 
We also announced earlier this week our agreement to acquire Hannibal Industries, one of the largest steel pallet rack manufacturers in the U.S. Hannibal provides racking solutions to warehouse serving the e-commerce, industrial, food storage and retail segments. Adding Hannibal to Nucor creates a new growth platform that broadens our offering to the distribution center market, including beams, joist deck, metal buildings and, of course, insulated metal panels. As an employee-owned company, we are optimistic that Hannibal Industries will be a great fit with the Nucor culture. 
Also, on the expand beyond front, we continue to build out our own growth platform in industrial gases, enabling lower cost supply to our steel mills, while also creating additional streams of revenue with sales to third parties. The team that joined Nucor with our acquisition of Universal Industrial Gases in 2019 continues to do a great job executing these initiatives. We have an operating air separation unit at [ Nucor Hartford ] and are actively selling liquid gases on the open market. We will continue to have more ASUs supporting our other mills up and running in the coming months. We are bringing the safety-focused, performance-driven, team-oriented Nucor culture to each of these businesses, and we are excited to welcome these teammates to the Nucor family. 
As one of the cleanest steel producers on the planet, Nucor will continue to take our environmental leadership position even further. Our new greenhouse gas reduction commitment will take our carbon intensity down to 77% below today's world average. Our commitment is to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by a combined 35%. This commitment will be measured against the 2015 baseline, the year the Paris Climate Agreement was signed. At our current greenhouse gas intensity, Nucor has already achieved the steel sector benchmark established in the Paris Agreement. Our performance today is what many of our competitors around the globe are aspiring to achieve by 2030, '40, '50 and beyond. And compared to many of our integrated competitors, our starting point is already better than their near and intermediate goals. And now we're going to get even better. We are a leader today in sustainable steel production and our commitment to further reduce our emissions intensity will keep us a leader as we move forward. 
Turning to infrastructure. We urge Congress to make good on the recent bipartisan framework reached in the Senate and come together to pass a significant infrastructure funding bill. We strongly believe that modernizing our infrastructure will boost our nation's economic competitiveness, not to mention, making us all safer. Federal infrastructure spending plans currently under consideration are expected to increase U.S. steel demand by as much as 5 million tons per year for every $100 billion of new investment. Nucor is incredibly well positioned to provide steel for infrastructure projects across U.S. We are encouraged that the President and members from both parties continue to focus on this issue, and we are hopeful that they can come together to form a bipartisan solution. 
Again, it is gratifying to see how years of hard work and planning are paying off in this incredibly strong steel market. We're excited about the expanded capabilities we can offer our customers, because of our capital investments and acquisitions we have made in recent years. To the entire Nucor team, congratulations on an excellent first half of 2021. Let's continue to execute and make this our safest and most profitable year. 
Now Jim Frias will provide more details about our performance in the second quarter. Jim?"

Second quarter earnings of $5.04 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range. Better-than-expected results for the month of June were achieved across a broad group of businesses, including our beam mills, bar mills, sheet mills, rebar fabr",1018,"Thanks, Leon. Second quarter earnings of $5.04 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range. Better-than-expected results for the month of June were achieved across a broad group of businesses, including our beam mills, bar mills, sheet mills, rebar fabrication, tubular products and joist and deck. Nucor's diverse portfolio of products and capabilities is consistently a powerful driver of value creation for Nucor shareholders and customers. 
Recently completed capital projects made significant and above budget earnings contributions in the first half of this year. These projects are the rolling mill modernization at our Ohio rebar mill; the hot band galvanizing line at our Kentucky sheet mill; the specialty cold rolling mill at our Arkansas sheet mill; the rebar micro mills in Missouri and Florida; and the merchant bar rolling mill at our Illinois bar mill. These targeted investments are enabling Nucor to earning a growing and profitable share of the markets we serve. 
The Hickman, Arkansas specialty cold mill is an excellent example of Nucor's growth strategy. There are no other carbon steel mills in North America that match our new range of capabilities. In the second quarter, the Hickman specialty cold mill ran at 118% of rated capacity, more than double its originally projected production ramp time line. Since beginning operations in mid-2019, this project's life-to-date profitability also substantially exceeds its initial forecast. And the Hickman team is looking ahead to further expanding long-term earnings power as it begins the work of commissioning its third-generation flexible galvanizing line equipment. The state-of-the-art capabilities of these new assets will position Nucor to further grow our automotive footprint. 
We will provide our automotive customers the greenest, most advanced high-strength steels in the industry. These deals will provide our customers the ultimate solution that satisfies their needs, long into the future. Our success bringing strategic projects like this online reflects the Nucor team's commitment to being effective stewards of our shareholders' valuable capital. Our growth investments are targeted at defined market objectives and opportunities to generate attractive returns with reduced volatility through the economic cycle. 
Financial strength continues to be a critical underpinning to Nucor's ability to grow long-term earnings power. At the close of the second quarter, our cash, short-term investments and restricted cash holdings totaled $3.2 billion. Compared with the end of the first quarter position, our second quarter cash position increased by about $226 million. That increase is after funding share repurchases of $614 million, cash dividends of $123 million, capital expenditures of $389 million and a working capital expansion on the inventory receivables and payables line items totaling about $945 million. Nucor's liquidity also includes our undrawn $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which does not mature until April of 2023. 
Total long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5.3 billion at quarter end. Gross debt as a percent of total capital was approximately 30%, while net debt was 12% of total capital and remains well below our targeted range of 18% to 23%. We remain materially underleveraged on this basis, but we anticipate that this will change somewhat as we deploy capital to acquire Cornerstone's IMP business and Hannibal Industries. 
We're excited to be moving forward with these new growth platforms. We expect that these businesses, along with the numerous internal growth projects we have been executing on, will materially add to Nucor's earnings and cash flow generation in the years ahead. Cash provided by operating activities for the first half of 2021 was $1.9 billion. Nucor's free cash flow or cash provided by operations minus capital spending was $1.2 billion. 
Nucor's financial strength and robust through-the-cycle cash flow allows for consistent balanced approach to capital allocation. We now estimate total year capital spending of approximately $1.8 billion. Each of our 3 most significant capital projects, the expansion and modernization of the Gauting, Kentucky sheet mill; the Generation 3 flexible galvanizing line at the Hickman, Arkansas sheet mill; and the greenfield Brandenburg, Kentucky plate mill, remain on schedule. At Brandenburg, the timing of some equipment deliveries has been delayed, but overall, the project remains on schedule for a late 2022 commissioning. 
During the second quarter, we continued to see attractive value in our shares, repurchasing 6.765 million shares at an average cost of approximately $91 per share. Over the first half of this year, Nucor share repurchases totaled more than 12 million shares at an average cost of about $75 per share. Shares outstanding have been reduced by approximately 3% from the year-end 2020 level. For the first half of 2021, total cash returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases totaled just under $1.2 billion, representing approximately 47% of net earnings for the period. As we have said previously, we intend to return a minimum of 40% of our net income to Nucor shareholders. We are rewarding shareholders with substantial cash returns while continuing to invest for future profitable growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
Turning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2021, we are encouraged by a number of positive factors impacting our markets. As Leon mentioned, we see improving or stable market conditions for the vast majority of the end-use markets served by Nucor. In fact, order backlogs at most of our businesses suggest strength well into 2022. Further supporting our optimistic outlook, inventories throughout the supply chain remain lean. We expect earnings in the third quarter of 2021 to again set a new record. Compared to the second quarter, we expect earnings growth at all 3 of our segments, most notably our Steel Mills segment. Additionally, with our expectation of a strong fourth quarter, we believe second half of 2021 earnings will exceed first half of 2021 earnings. 
Nucor's record results highlight the success of our 27,000 team members building a stronger and more profitable Nucor. Our team's 2021 performance is simply outstanding. We remain excited by the opportunities ahead for our company. We have great determination to deliver increasing long-term value for our shareholders. Living our culture means driving sustainable performance.

Look, I would tell you broadly, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our mission is to grow the core, expand beyond and live the culture. We see opportunities as we think about growing the core, and that's the expansions at our Hickman galvanizing line to become the first EAF to be able to produce a full generation 3 steel for the automotive sector. It's the expansion at our Gallatin sheet mill in expanding that footprint into a more attractive returns in different sectors like automotive, energy, and our culmination with the largest single investment in Nucor's history, our plate mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky, that's going to be brought online next year. That's going to be located in the heart of the largest plate-consuming region in the United States. And from a timing perspective, as we think about the renewable energy market and sector, that mill is incredibly ideally positioned and well suited to meet the demands of both onshore wind, but particularly offshore when that grows as a business. 
But we also see opportunities as we think about growth in the core outside of that. And so there are times that you're going to see Nucor continue to look within the framework of traditional steelmaking lanes that we've operated in for the last half of a century, but also expanding beyond. And that is the recent acquisitions with both Cornerstone and Hannibal that fit Nucor's long-term strategic objectives of maximizing shareholder returns. But also Emily, it's a focus on moving into markets that are truly growing. As you know, steel is a cyclical business in the industry and what we see in those renewable space. What we see in the green economy and digital economy is a fast-growing and increasing market opportunity for Nucor to maximize and leverage its strength, its cultural stewardship and to bring a leadership perspective into those businesses."

Some recent projects that came up and the success that we've had, that the team has shown and been able to do, it gives us a lot of confidence and a lot of excitement that these projects will come up and they'll come up running better than ever or faster than ever. 
If you think about the Gallatin galvanizing line, they're already running that way past the nameplate capacity. Jim mentioned the cold mill over in Arkansas running at higher than the nameplate. So they basically ran slightly higher than nameplate as well in Florida. Florida is moving right under their heel. So very excited about the team and the team's capabilities of providing these projects or bringing these projects online safely."

It's an important segment for Nucor, it's certainly front of mind as we think about the opportunities for us as we move more into the automotive sector. 
But to your point, as we think about the contrast, I've spent several of my years at the beam mill at Nucor Yamato. Over the last decade or so, I would say Nucor Yamato is averaged in that 70% utilization range. They're approaching 90% today, and we've not seen that for nearly a decade. And so the performance of that mill has been exemplary through that period, profitability-wise. But now in this market, we're seeing an incredible strength. Backlogs are improving. Order conditions are improving in the forecast as we move, not just through the rest of the year, but in some cases, well into '22, strength through the cycle in many of those groups. 
All of that is to say -- none of that is to say, rather, or include any thought of what a meaningful infrastructure bill being passed in the United States, could do and include. And again, we have room, we have opportunity in terms of creating and generating more steel for that sector. But the same conditions exist in long products.

A lot of that construction is centered on low-rise industrial, warehouse distribution, data centers, what's left to start showing some life is high-rise, which is only continued tailwinds for the beam market and the high-rise construction has been very, very slow over the last year or so, but it's starting to show some signs of life. 
In the plate market, specifically, really all markets are quite strong. The heavy ag market, transportation with rail cars, even oil and gas is starting to come back now. That's been one of the weaker markets, but we're starting to see activity in oil and gas and then take cars, you've got to move oil one way or another. And if it's not in the pipeline, it's in a tank car. And so we see continued strength in the plate market. We see a good balance between supply and demand. That's what drives the pricing of the product, and we see continued strike through the second half of this year and then some."

As we think about Nucor expanding and some of our competitors expanding further upstream into more value-added businesses. On the EAF side, the demand for prime is going to get tighter. And that is why Nucor long ago began a very thoughtful and long-term strategy to control more of our metallics inventory. And that's why we built the facility in Louisiana. 
And again, I'm proud of the team. I'm proud of the work that they've done. For way too many years on this call, we shared one reliability issue after the next. Their downturn that they took back in 2019 to fix the reliability issues has manifested itself to what Doug shared earlier in terms of world-class reliability, now operating not just in Trinidad, which is done for a long time, but now marrying that up with our capability in Louisiana. So under new course control, we have about [ 4.5 million tonnes ] of DRI metallics that are in our direct control, and that offers us a unique material advantage as we move forward. And as we think about expansion and the demand on the metallic side, is there opportunity? Yes, I think there's some opportunities as we think about -- is there an opportunity in this country for certain integrated competitors to pig iron in those facilities and have a sourced buyer in the United States? Absolutely. And Nucor would be absolutely supportive of that strategy. But again, that's for them to sort through and work through. But again, we're confident in our capability today."

And we've got to restore manufacturing in this country, whether it be pharma, PPE, medical equipment devices and semiconductors. But directly to answer your question, you think about the days on hand in the automotive world of about 27 days on hand, inventory numbers are staggeringly low. We think about the rental car fleets across this nation, it's going to take a long time to replenish the dealer inventory networks as well as the rental car side. 
But as we mentioned, our investment strategies and our move in automotive is really exciting for Nucor. We're about [ 1.5 million tonnes ] today into the automotive sector. And our focus is to, in the next several years, double that. Our OEM relationships that we've built over the years, now becoming General Motors Supplier of the Year back to back to back years, 3 years in a row, our team has done a phenomenal job. I couldn't be more proud of the work that's done. So while I do think we're going to see some constraints, obviously, you're reading the headlines as we are talking to our customers, there's going to be a lot of pressure, right? The GM announced they're going to take some downtime on some of their Silverados and building out of their pickup trucks. None of that is by design, right? It's because they can't get the parts that they need. 
So while it will have an overall material impact to the industry, Nucor's volumes are not significantly off. And we have a unique platform where our OEM direct customers that we have today are asking Nucor to take bigger shares, and that is, again, an exciting opportunity as we think about marrying up the investment strategy to where our long-term goals want to be in automotive."

Thank you for joining us today. With demand for steel remaining strong and most of our facilities operating at peak performance, we have not lost focus on our goal of becoming the world's safest steel company. We continue to perform well on the safety front as we look to make 2021 our safest year ever, besting our record set just last year. In particular, I want to acknowledge the progress demonstrated by our sheet mills in our 2 DRI facilities for achieving world-class safety performance so far this year. I encourage all of our teammates to maintain their focus on safety so we can achieve the most important goal that we have set for our company. 
Consistent with last month's guidance, Nucor posted record quarterly earnings in the second quarter. Our earnings of $5.04 per share surpassed our previous earnings per share record set last quarter. Our first half earnings of $8.13 per share exceeds our full year EPS record of $7.42 set in 2018. All 3 operating segments are continuing to generate robust profits due to strong demand, higher average selling prices and excellent execution across Nucor. In our steel mills segment, we saw the greatest improvement in profitability from our sheet and plate mills. The performance of our steel products group also improved compared to the first quarter. Jim will provide more details about our performance at this quarter and our outlook for the third quarter in a few minutes. 
This level of performance is the result of years of work strategically growing and positioning our company to thrive in market conditions like we are experiencing today. My congratulations to the entire Nucor team. There are several fundamental drivers of the strong market conditions Nucor is benefiting from today. The most important of these is robust demand. Virtually all the steel end use markets that we monitor are growing. 
Some of this growth may simply be catch-up from the pandemic-induced economic low we experienced here in the U.S., but we think it goes beyond a temporary rebound. One sign of this is the increasing confidence about next year that we sense from our customers, ranging from automotive, trucking, heavy and ag equipment and across the construction sector. There are noteworthy new drivers for growth in steel demand, warehouses for e-commerce, renewable energy projects and an increase in U.S. manufacturing investment focused on greater supply chain resiliency are all creating new market opportunities for Nucor. Very strong housing and automotive markets are also creating incremental steel demand, not to mention activity by state DOTs, whose infrastructure investment spending has held up better than expected. 
We are fortunate that several of our strategic growth investments have come online during this period, and our results reflect better-than-expected contributions from Nucor steel mills in Sedalia, Frostproof, Kankakee, Marion, Gallatin's new galvanizing line and Hickman's new cold mill. My thanks, especially to our teammates at these locations, who have worked safely to ramp these projects up quickly to meet market demands. 
Our strategy continues to be: grow the core, expand beyond and live our culture. We are continuing to make targeted investments and acquisitions to grow our share in attractive markets and increase our long-term earnings power. We are complementing our investment strategy with a sharpened commercial focus that is enabling us to leverage our broad portfolio and deliver increased value to our customers with more integrated solutions. Acquisition announcements we made in the second quarter are focused on the expand beyond part of our mission statement. Our pending acquisition of Cornerstone Building Brands' insulated metal panels business, IMP for short, is squarely aimed at some of the fastest-growing markets I've mentioned. For example, distribution center investments driven by evolving consumer preferences regarding e-commerce and grocery delivery as well as the expansion of data centers and server farms, which all require temperature-controlled environments. Cornerstone's IMP business is a market leader and innovator in the growing IMP product category. 
IMP products are gaining market share as companies and institutions continue to focus on environmental performance and energy efficiency. The superior insulating performance of IMP products reduces energy usage and overall operations-related greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, IMP products are easier to install with lower maintenance cost versus other wall and roofing solutions. Cornerstone's IMP business is an excellent fit with Nucor Buildings Group and we are confident that we can help the team there take performance to an even higher level. 
We also announced earlier this week our agreement to acquire Hannibal Industries, one of the largest steel pallet rack manufacturers in the U.S. Hannibal provides racking solutions to warehouse serving the e-commerce, industrial, food storage and retail segments. Adding Hannibal to Nucor creates a new growth platform that broadens our offering to the distribution center market, including beams, joist, deck, metal buildings and, of course, insulated metal panels. As an employee-owned company, we are optimistic that Hannibal Industries will be a great fit with the Nucor culture. 
Also, on the expand beyond front, we continue to build out our own growth platform in industrial gases, enabling lower cost supply to our steel mills, while also creating additional streams of revenue with sales to third parties. The team that joined Nucor with our acquisition of Universal Industrial Gases in 2019 continues to do a great job executing these initiatives. We have an operating air separation unit at Nucor Hertford and are actively selling liquid gases on the open market. We will continue to have more ASUs supporting our other mills up and running in the coming months. We are bringing the safety-focused, performance-driven, team-oriented Nucor culture to each of these businesses, and we are excited to welcome these teammates to the Nucor family. 
As one of the cleanest steel producers on the planet, Nucor will continue to take our environmental leadership position even further. Our new greenhouse gas reduction commitment will take our carbon intensity down to 77% below today's world average. Our commitment is to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by a combined 35%. This commitment will be measured against the 2015 baseline, the year the Paris Climate Agreement was signed. At our current greenhouse gas intensity, Nucor has already achieved the steel sector benchmark established in the Paris Agreement. Our performance today is what many of our competitors around the globe are aspiring to achieve by 2030, '40, '50 and beyond. And compared to many of our integrated competitors, our starting point is already better than their near and intermediate goals. And now we're going to get even better. We are a leader today in sustainable steel production, and our commitment to further reduce our emissions intensity will keep us a leader as we move forward. 
Turning to infrastructure. We urge Congress to make good on the recent bipartisan framework reached in the Senate and come together to pass a significant infrastructure funding bill. We strongly believe that modernizing our infrastructure will boost our nation's economic competitiveness, not to mention, making us all safer. Federal infrastructure spending plans currently under consideration are expected to increase U.S. steel demand by as much as 5 million tons per year for every $100 billion of new investment. Nucor is incredibly well positioned to provide steel for infrastructure projects across U.S. We are encouraged that the President and members from both parties continue to focus on this issue, and we are hopeful that they can come together to form a bipartisan solution. 
Again, it is gratifying to see how years of hard work and planning are paying off in this incredibly strong steel market. We're excited about the expanded capabilities we can offer our customers because of our capital investments and acquisitions we have made in recent years. To the entire Nucor team, congratulations on an excellent first half of 2021. Let's continue to execute and make this our safest and most profitable year. 
Now Jim Frias will provide more details about our performance in the second quarter. Jim?"

Second quarter earnings of $5.04 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range. Better-than-expected results for the month of June were achieved across a broad group of businesses, including our beam mills, bar mills, sheet mills, rebar fabr",1018,"Thanks, Leon. Second quarter earnings of $5.04 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range. Better-than-expected results for the month of June were achieved across a broad group of businesses, including our beam mills, bar mills, sheet mills, rebar fabrication, tubular products and joist and deck. Nucor's diverse portfolio of products and capabilities is consistently a powerful driver of value creation for Nucor shareholders and customers. 
Recently completed capital projects made significant and above budget earnings contributions in the first half of this year. These projects are the rolling mill modernization at our Ohio rebar mill; the hot band galvanizing line at our Kentucky sheet mill; the specialty cold rolling mill at our Arkansas sheet mill; the rebar micro mills in Missouri and Florida; and the merchant bar rolling mill at our Illinois bar mill. These targeted investments are enabling Nucor to earning a growing and profitable share of the markets we serve. 
The Hickman, Arkansas specialty cold mill is an excellent example of Nucor's growth strategy. There are no other carbon steel mills in North America that match our new range of capabilities. In the second quarter, the Hickman specialty cold mill ran at 118% of rated capacity, more than double its originally projected production ramp time line. Since beginning operations in mid-2019, this project's life-to-date profitability also substantially exceeds its initial forecast. And the Hickman team is looking ahead to further expanding long-term earnings power as it begins the work of commissioning its third-generation flexible galvanizing line equipment. The state-of-the-art capabilities of these new assets will position Nucor to further grow our automotive footprint. 
We will provide our automotive customers the greenest, most advanced high-strength steels in the industry. These deals will provide our customers the ultimate solution that satisfies their needs, long into the future. Our success bringing strategic projects like this online reflects the Nucor team's commitment to being effective stewards of our shareholders' valuable capital. Our growth investments are targeted at defined market objectives and opportunities to generate attractive returns with reduced volatility through the economic cycle. 
Financial strength continues to be a critical underpinning to Nucor's ability to grow long-term earnings power. At the close of the second quarter, our cash, short-term investments and restricted cash holdings totaled $3.2 billion. Compared with the end of the first quarter position, our second quarter cash position increased by about $226 million. That increase is after funding share repurchases of $614 million, cash dividends of $123 million, capital expenditures of $389 million and a working capital expansion on the inventory receivables and payables line items totaling about $945 million. Nucor's liquidity also includes our undrawn $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which does not mature until April of 2023. 
Total long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5.3 billion at quarter end. Gross debt as a percent of total capital was approximately 30%, while net debt was 12% of total capital and remains well below our targeted range of 18% to 23%. We remain materially underleveraged on this basis, but we anticipate that this will change somewhat as we deploy capital to acquire Cornerstone's IMP business and Hannibal Industries. 
We're excited to be moving forward with these new growth platforms. We expect that these businesses, along with the numerous internal growth projects we have been executing on, will materially add to Nucor's earnings and cash flow generation in the years ahead. Cash provided by operating activities for the first half of 2021 was $1.9 billion. Nucor's free cash flow or cash provided by operations minus capital spending was $1.2 billion. 
Nucor's financial strength and robust through-the-cycle cash flow allows for consistent balanced approach to capital allocation. We now estimate total year capital spending of approximately $1.8 billion. Each of our 3 most significant capital projects, the expansion and modernization of the Gallatin, Kentucky sheet mill; the Generation 3 flexible galvanizing line at the Hickman, Arkansas sheet mill; and the greenfield Brandenburg, Kentucky plate mill, remain on schedule. At Brandenburg, the timing of some equipment deliveries has been delayed, but overall, the project remains on schedule for a late 2022 commissioning. 
During the second quarter, we continued to see attractive value in our shares, repurchasing 6.765 million shares at an average cost of approximately $91 per share. Over the first half of this year, Nucor share repurchases totaled more than 12 million shares at an average cost of about $75 per share. Shares outstanding have been reduced by approximately 3% from the year-end 2020 level. For the first half of 2021, total cash returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases totaled just under $1.2 billion, representing approximately 47% of net earnings for the period. As we have said previously, we intend to return a minimum of 40% of our net income to Nucor shareholders. We are rewarding shareholders with substantial cash returns while continuing to invest for future profitable growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
Turning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2021, we are encouraged by a number of positive factors impacting our markets. As Leon mentioned, we see improving or stable market conditions for the vast majority of the end-use markets served by Nucor. In fact, order backlogs at most of our businesses suggest strength well into 2022. Further supporting our optimistic outlook, inventories throughout the supply chain remain lean. We expect earnings in the third quarter of 2021 to again set a new record. Compared to the second quarter, we expect earnings growth at all 3 of our segments, most notably our steel mills segment. Additionally, with our expectation of a strong fourth quarter, we believe second half of 2021 earnings will exceed first half of 2021 earnings. 
Nucor's record results highlight the success of our 27,000 team members building a stronger and more profitable Nucor. Our team's 2021 performance is simply outstanding. We remain excited by the opportunities ahead for our company. We have great determination to deliver increasing long-term value for our shareholders. Living our culture means driving sustainable performance.

Look, I would tell you broadly, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our mission is to grow the core, expand beyond and live the culture. We see opportunities as we think about growing the core, and that's the expansions at our Hickman galvanizing line to become the first EAF to be able to produce a full Generation 3 steel for the automotive sector. It's the expansion at our Gallatin sheet mill in expanding that footprint into a more attractive returns in different sectors like automotive, energy, and our culmination with the largest single investment in Nucor's history, our plate mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky, that's going to be brought online next year. That's going to be located in the heart of the largest plate-consuming region in the United States. And from a timing perspective, as we think about the renewable energy market and sector, that mill is incredibly ideally positioned and well suited to meet the demands of both onshore wind, but particularly offshore when that grows as a business. 
But we also see opportunities as we think about growth in the core outside of that. And so there are times that you're going to see Nucor continue to look within the framework of traditional steelmaking lanes that we've operated in for the last half of a century, but also expanding beyond. And that is the recent acquisitions with both Cornerstone and Hannibal that fit Nucor's long-term strategic objectives of maximizing shareholder returns. But also Emily, it's a focus on moving into markets that are truly growing. As you know, steel is a cyclical business and industry. And what we see in those renewable space, what we see in the green economy and digital economy is a fast-growing and increasing market opportunity for Nucor to maximize and leverage its strength, its cultural stewardship and to bring a leadership perspective into those businesses."

Maybe I'll kick it off, and then Al, if you want to dive in a little bit deeper on plate, and then Rex may be on the sheet side. It's a great point. And you're right, for a lot of obvious reasons as we think about it, sheet does get a lot of press. It's a 60 million ton a year market. It's an important segment for Nucor. It's certainly front of mind as we think about the opportunities for us as we move more into the automotive sector. 
But to your point, as we think about the contrast, I've spent several of my years at the beam mill at Nucor-Yamato. Over the last decade or so, I would say Nucor-Yamato has averaged in that 70% utilization range. They're approaching 90% today, and we've not seen that for nearly a decade. And so the performance of that mill has been exemplary through that period, profitability-wise. But now in this market, we're seeing an incredible strength. Backlogs are improving. Order conditions are improving in the forecast as we move, not just through the rest of the year, but in some cases, well into '22, strength through the cycle in many of those groups. 
All of that is to say -- none of that is to say, rather, or includes any thought of what a meaningful infrastructure bill being passed in the United States could do and include. And again, we have room, we have opportunity in terms of creating and generating more steel for that sector. But the same conditions exist in long products. Al, why don't you touch on plate and then again, Rex on sheet."

Construction is obviously a huge market for beams and it is for plate as well, and it speaks to the strength of nonres construction that we've seen all this year. A lot of that construction is centered on low-rise industrial, warehouse distribution, data centers. What's left to start showing some life is high-rise, which has only continued tailwinds for the beam market. And the high-rise construction has been very, very slow over the last year or so, but it's starting to show some signs of life. 
In the plate market, specifically, really all markets are quite strong. The heavy ag market, transportation with rail cars, even oil and gas is starting to come back now. That's been one of the weaker markets, but we're starting to see activity in oil and gas. And then take cars, you've got to move oil one way or another. And if it's not in the pipeline, it's in a tank car. And so we see continued strength in the plate market. We see a good balance between supply and demand. That's what drives the pricing of the product, and we see continued strength through the second half of this year and then some."

We have the capabilities going -- increasing at Hickman with the gal, the capacity coming online at Gallatin. Sectors are strong in building construction. Energy, more on the renewable side that we see. We're squeezing some of our outages. We're not going to compromise our reliability, but we are pulling some days out when we can on our outages on the sheet side so that we're able to produce more. And auto is tepid right now. So we haven't seen that with the chip issues that are going on. So we see there's a future opportunity as that comes about to see strength in the future on that. So that's the sheet side."

And look, I'll touch on it and ask Jim or Doug to chime in. As we think about your framing, you're right. As we think about Nucor expanding and some of our competitors expanding further upstream into more value-added businesses, on the EAF side, the demand for prime is going to get tighter. And that is why Nucor long ago began a very thoughtful and long-term strategy to control more of our metallics inventory. And that's why we built the facility in Louisiana. 
And again, I'm proud of the team. I'm proud of the work that they've done. For way too many years on this call, we shared one reliability issue after the next. Their downturn that they took back in 2019 to fix the reliability issues has manifested itself to what Doug shared earlier in terms of world-class reliability, now operating not just in Trinidad, which is done for a long time, but now marrying that up with our capability in Louisiana. So under new course control, we have about 4.5 million tons of DRI metallics that are in our direct control, and that offers us a unique material advantage as we move forward. And as we think about expansion and the demand on the metallic side, is there opportunity? Yes, I think there's some opportunities as we think about -- is there an opportunity in this country for certain integrated competitors to bank pig iron in those facilities and have a sourced buyer in the United States? Absolutely. And Nucor would be absolutely supportive of that strategy. But again, that's for them to sort through and work through. But again, we're confident in our capability today."

And we've got to restore manufacturing in this country, whether it be pharma, PPE, medical equipment devices and semiconductors. But directly to answer your question, you think about the days on hand in the automotive world of about 27 days on hand, inventory numbers are staggeringly low. We think about the rental car fleets across this nation, it's going to take a long time to replenish the dealer inventory networks as well as the rental car side. 
But as we mentioned, our investment strategies and our move in automotive is really exciting for Nucor. We're about 1.5 million tons today into the automotive sector. And our focus is to, in the next several years, double that. Our OEM relationships that we've built over the years, now becoming General Motors Supplier of the Year back to back to back years, 3 years in a row, our team has done a phenomenal job. I couldn't be more proud of the work that's done. So while I do think we're going to see some constraints, obviously, you're reading the headlines as we are talking to our customers, there's going to be a lot of pressure, right? The GM announced they're going to take some downtime on some of their Silverados and building out of their pickup trucks. None of that is by design, right? It's because they can't get the parts that they need. 
So while it will have an overall material impact to the industry, Nucor's volumes are not significantly off. And we have a unique platform where our 14 OEM direct customers that we have today are asking Nucor to take bigger shares, and that is, again, an exciting opportunity as we think about marrying up the investment strategy to where our long-term goals want to be in automotive."

Thank you for joining us today. With demand for steel remaining strong and most of our facilities operating at peak performance, we have not lost focus on our goal of becoming the world's safest steel company. We continue to perform well on the safety front as we look to make 2021 our safest year ever, besting our record set just last year. In particular, I want to acknowledge the progress demonstrated by our sheet mills in our 2 DRI facilities for achieving world-class safety performance so far this year. I encourage all of our teammates to maintain their focus on safety so we can achieve the most important goal that we have set for our company. 
Consistent with last month's guidance, Nucor posted record quarterly earnings in the second quarter. Our earnings of $5.04 per share surpassed our previous earnings per share record set last quarter. Our first half earnings of $8.13 per share exceeds our full year EPS record of $7.42 set in 2018. All 3 operating segments are continuing to generate robust profits due to strong demand, higher average selling prices and excellent execution across Nucor. In our steel mills segment, we saw the greatest improvement in profitability from our sheet and plate mills. The performance of our steel products group also improved compared to the first quarter. Jim will provide more details about our performance at this quarter and our outlook for the third quarter in a few minutes. 
This level of performance is the result of years of work strategically growing and positioning our company to thrive in market conditions like we are experiencing today. My congratulations to the entire Nucor team. There are several fundamental drivers of the strong market conditions Nucor is benefiting from today. The most important of these is robust demand. Virtually all the steel end use markets that we monitor are growing. 
Some of this growth may simply be catch-up from the pandemic-induced economic low we experienced here in the U.S., but we think it goes beyond a temporary rebound. One sign of this is the increasing confidence about next year that we sense from our customers, ranging from automotive, trucking, heavy and ag equipment and across the construction sector. There are noteworthy new drivers for growth in steel demand, warehouses for e-commerce, renewable energy projects and an increase in U.S. manufacturing investment focused on greater supply chain resiliency are all creating new market opportunities for Nucor. Very strong housing and automotive markets are also creating incremental steel demand, not to mention activity by state DOTs, whose infrastructure investment spending has held up better than expected. 
We are fortunate that several of our strategic growth investments have come online during this period, and our results reflect better-than-expected contributions from Nucor steel mills in Sedalia, Frostproof, Kankakee, Marion, Gallatin's new galvanizing line and Hickman's new cold mill. My thanks, especially to our teammates at these locations, who have worked safely to ramp these projects up quickly to meet market demands. 
Our strategy continues to be: grow the core, expand beyond and live our culture. We are continuing to make targeted investments and acquisitions to grow our share in attractive markets and increase our long-term earnings power. We are complementing our investment strategy with a sharpened commercial focus that is enabling us to leverage our broad portfolio and deliver increased value to our customers with more integrated solutions. Acquisition announcements we made in the second quarter are focused on the expand beyond part of our mission statement. Our pending acquisition of Cornerstone Building Brands' insulated metal panels business, IMP for short, is squarely aimed at some of the fastest-growing markets I've mentioned. For example, distribution center investments driven by evolving consumer preferences regarding e-commerce and grocery delivery as well as the expansion of data centers and server farms, which all require temperature-controlled environments. Cornerstone's IMP business is a market leader and innovator in the growing IMP product category. 
IMP products are gaining market share as companies and institutions continue to focus on environmental performance and energy efficiency. The superior insulating performance of IMP products reduces energy usage and overall operations-related greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, IMP products are easier to install with lower maintenance cost versus other wall and roofing solutions. Cornerstone's IMP business is an excellent fit with Nucor Buildings Group and we are confident that we can help the team there take performance to an even higher level. 
We also announced earlier this week our agreement to acquire Hannibal Industries, one of the largest steel pallet rack manufacturers in the U.S. Hannibal provides racking solutions to warehouse serving the e-commerce, industrial, food storage and retail segments. Adding Hannibal to Nucor creates a new growth platform that broadens our offering to the distribution center market, including beams, joist, deck, metal buildings and, of course, insulated metal panels. As an employee-owned company, we are optimistic that Hannibal Industries will be a great fit with the Nucor culture. 
Also, on the expand beyond front, we continue to build out our own growth platform in industrial gases, enabling lower cost supply to our steel mills, while also creating additional streams of revenue with sales to third parties. The team that joined Nucor with our acquisition of Universal Industrial Gases in 2019 continues to do a great job executing these initiatives. We have an operating air separation unit at Nucor Hertford and are actively selling liquid gases on the open market. We will continue to have more ASUs supporting our other mills up and running in the coming months. We are bringing the safety-focused, performance-driven, team-oriented Nucor culture to each of these businesses, and we are excited to welcome these teammates to the Nucor family. 
As one of the cleanest steel producers on the planet, Nucor will continue to take our environmental leadership position even further. Our new greenhouse gas reduction commitment will take our carbon intensity down to 77% below today's world average. Our commitment is to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by a combined 35%. This commitment will be measured against the 2015 baseline, the year the Paris Climate Agreement was signed. At our current greenhouse gas intensity, Nucor has already achieved the steel sector benchmark established in the Paris Agreement. Our performance today is what many of our competitors around the globe are aspiring to achieve by 2030, '40, '50 and beyond. And compared to many of our integrated competitors, our starting point is already better than their near and intermediate goals. And now we're going to get even better. We are a leader today in sustainable steel production, and our commitment to further reduce our emissions intensity will keep us a leader as we move forward. 
Turning to infrastructure. We urge Congress to make good on the recent bipartisan framework reached in the Senate and come together to pass a significant infrastructure funding bill. We strongly believe that modernizing our infrastructure will boost our nation's economic competitiveness, not to mention, making us all safer. Federal infrastructure spending plans currently under consideration are expected to increase U.S. steel demand by as much as 5 million tons per year for every $100 billion of new investment. Nucor is incredibly well positioned to provide steel for infrastructure projects across U.S. We are encouraged that the President and members from both parties continue to focus on this issue, and we are hopeful that they can come together to form a bipartisan solution. 
Again, it is gratifying to see how years of hard work and planning are paying off in this incredibly strong steel market. We're excited about the expanded capabilities we can offer our customers because of our capital investments and acquisitions we have made in recent years. To the entire Nucor team, congratulations on an excellent first half of 2021. Let's continue to execute and make this our safest and most profitable year. 
Now Jim Frias will provide more details about our performance in the second quarter. Jim?"

Second quarter earnings of $5.04 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range. Better-than-expected results for the month of June were achieved across a broad group of businesses, including our beam mills, bar mills, sheet mills, rebar fabr",1018,"Thanks, Leon. Second quarter earnings of $5.04 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range. Better-than-expected results for the month of June were achieved across a broad group of businesses, including our beam mills, bar mills, sheet mills, rebar fabrication, tubular products and joist and deck. Nucor's diverse portfolio of products and capabilities is consistently a powerful driver of value creation for Nucor shareholders and customers. 
Recently completed capital projects made significant and above budget earnings contributions in the first half of this year. These projects are the rolling mill modernization at our Ohio rebar mill; the hot band galvanizing line at our Kentucky sheet mill; the specialty cold rolling mill at our Arkansas sheet mill; the rebar micro mills in Missouri and Florida; and the merchant bar rolling mill at our Illinois bar mill. These targeted investments are enabling Nucor to earning a growing and profitable share of the markets we serve. 
The Hickman, Arkansas specialty cold mill is an excellent example of Nucor's growth strategy. There are no other carbon steel mills in North America that match our new range of capabilities. In the second quarter, the Hickman specialty cold mill ran at 118% of rated capacity, more than double its originally projected production ramp time line. Since beginning operations in mid-2019, this project's life-to-date profitability also substantially exceeds its initial forecast. And the Hickman team is looking ahead to further expanding long-term earnings power as it begins the work of commissioning its third-generation flexible galvanizing line equipment. The state-of-the-art capabilities of these new assets will position Nucor to further grow our automotive footprint. 
We will provide our automotive customers the greenest, most advanced high-strength steels in the industry. These steels will provide our customers the ultimate solution that satisfies their needs, long into the future. Our success bringing strategic projects like this online reflects the Nucor team's commitment to being effective stewards of our shareholders' valuable capital. Our growth investments are targeted at defined market objectives and opportunities to generate attractive returns with reduced volatility through the economic cycle. 
Financial strength continues to be a critical underpinning to Nucor's ability to grow long-term earnings power. At the close of the second quarter, our cash, short-term investments and restricted cash holdings totaled $3.2 billion. Compared with the end of the first quarter position, our second quarter cash position increased by about $226 million. That increase is after funding share repurchases of $614 million, cash dividends of $123 million, capital expenditures of $389 million and a working capital expansion on the inventory receivables and payables line items totaling about $945 million. Nucor's liquidity also includes our undrawn $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which does not mature until April of 2023. 
Total long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5.3 billion at quarter end. Gross debt as a percent of total capital was approximately 30%, while net debt was 12% of total capital and remains well below our targeted range of 18% to 23%. We remain materially underleveraged on this basis, but we anticipate that this will change somewhat as we deploy capital to acquire Cornerstone's IMP business and Hannibal Industries. 
We're excited to be moving forward with these new growth platforms. We expect that these businesses, along with the numerous internal growth projects we have been executing on, will materially add to Nucor's earnings and cash flow generation in the years ahead. Cash provided by operating activities for the first half of 2021 was $1.9 billion. Nucor's free cash flow or cash provided by operations minus capital spending was $1.2 billion. 
Nucor's financial strength and robust through-the-cycle cash flow allows for consistent balanced approach to capital allocation. We now estimate total year capital spending of approximately $1.8 billion. Each of our 3 most significant capital projects, the expansion and modernization of the Gallatin, Kentucky sheet mill; the Generation 3 flexible galvanizing line at the Hickman, Arkansas sheet mill; and the greenfield Brandenburg, Kentucky plate mill, remain on schedule. At Brandenburg, the timing of some equipment deliveries has been delayed, but overall, the project remains on schedule for a late 2022 commissioning. 
During the second quarter, we continued to see attractive value in our shares, repurchasing 6.765 million shares at an average cost of approximately $91 per share. Over the first half of this year, Nucor share repurchases totaled more than 12 million shares at an average cost of about $75 per share. Shares outstanding have been reduced by approximately 3% from the year-end 2020 level. For the first half of 2021, total cash returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases totaled just under $1.2 billion, representing approximately 47% of net earnings for the period. As we have said previously, we intend to return a minimum of 40% of our net income to Nucor shareholders. We are rewarding shareholders with substantial cash returns while continuing to invest for future profitable growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
Turning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2021, we are encouraged by a number of positive factors impacting our markets. As Leon mentioned, we see improving or stable market conditions for the vast majority of the end-use markets served by Nucor. In fact, order backlogs at most of our businesses suggest strength well into 2022. Further supporting our optimistic outlook, inventories throughout the supply chain remain lean. We expect earnings in the third quarter of 2021 to again set a new record. Compared to the second quarter, we expect earnings growth at all 3 of our segments, most notably our steel mills segment. Additionally, with our expectation of a strong fourth quarter, we believe second half of 2021 earnings will exceed first half of 2021 earnings. 
Nucor's record results highlight the success of our 27,000 team members building a stronger and more profitable Nucor. Our team's 2021 performance is simply outstanding. We remain excited by the opportunities ahead for our company. We have great determination to deliver increasing long-term value for our shareholders. Living our culture means driving sustainable performance.

Look, I would tell you broadly, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our mission is to grow the core, expand beyond and live the culture. We see opportunities as we think about growing the core, and that's the expansions at our Hickman galvanizing line to become the first EAF to be able to produce a full Generation 3 steel for the automotive sector. It's the expansion at our Gallatin sheet mill in expanding that footprint into a more attractive returns in different sectors like automotive, energy, and our culmination with the largest single investment in Nucor's history, our plate mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky, that's going to be brought online next year. That's going to be located in the heart of the largest plate-consuming region in the United States. And from a timing perspective, as we think about the renewable energy market and sector, that mill is incredibly ideally positioned and well suited to meet the demands of both onshore wind, but particularly offshore wind as that grows as a business. 
But we also see opportunities as we think about growth in the core outside of that. And so there are times that you're going to see Nucor continue to look within the framework of traditional steelmaking lanes that we've operated in for the last half of a century, but also expanding beyond. And that is the recent acquisitions with both Cornerstone and Hannibal that fit Nucor's long-term strategic objectives of maximizing shareholder returns. But also Emily, it's a focus on moving into markets that are truly growing. As you know, steel is a cyclical business and industry. And what we see in those -- renewable space, what we see in the green economy and digital economy is a fast-growing and increasing market opportunity for Nucor to maximize and leverage its strength, its cultural stewardship and to bring a leadership perspective into those businesses."

But to your point, as we think about the contrast, I've spent several of my years at the beam mill at Nucor-Yamato. Over the last decade or so, I would say Nucor-Yamato has averaged in that 70% utilization range. They're approaching 90% today, and we've not seen that for nearly a decade. And so the performance of that mill has been exemplary through that period, profitability-wise. But now in this market, we're seeing an incredible strength. Backlogs are improving. Order conditions are improving in the forecast as we move, not just through the rest of the year, but in some cases, well into '22, strength through the cycle in many of those groups.

What's left to start showing some life is high-rise, which has only continued tailwinds for the beam market. And the high-rise construction has been very, very slow over the last year or so, but it's starting to show some signs of life. 
In the plate market, specifically, really all markets are quite strong. The heavy ag market, transportation with rail cars, even oil and gas is starting to come back now. That's been one of the weaker markets, but we're starting to see activity in oil and gas. And then take cars, you've got to move oil one way or another. And if it's not in the pipeline, it's in a tank car. And so we see continued strength in the plate market. We see a good balance between supply and demand.

Look, let me begin with the kind of the backdrop of as we think about semiconductors and one of the things that I think most Americans have learned through this pandemic is this nation needs to be a nation that builds and makes things again. And we've got to restore manufacturing in this country, whether it be pharma, PPE, medical equipment devices and semiconductors. But directly to answer your question, you think about the days on hand in the automotive world of about 27 days on hand, inventory numbers are staggeringly low. We think about the rental car fleets across this nation, it's going to take a long time to replenish the dealer inventory networks as well as the rental car side. 
But as we mentioned, our investment strategies and our move in automotive is really exciting for Nucor. We're about 1.5 million tons today into the automotive sector. And our focus is to, in the next several years, double that. Our OEM relationships that we've built over the years, now becoming General Motors Supplier of the Year back to back to back years, 3 years in a row, our team has done a phenomenal job. I couldn't be more proud of the work that's done. So while I do think we're going to see some constraints, obviously, you're reading the headlines as we are and talking to our customers, there's going to be a lot of pressure, right? GM announced they're going to take some downtime on some of their Silverados and building out of their pickup trucks. None of that is by design, right? It's because they can't get the parts that they need. 
So while it will have an overall material impact to the industry, Nucor's volumes are not significantly off. And we have a unique platform where our 14 OEM direct customers that we have today are asking Nucor to take bigger shares, and that is, again, an exciting opportunity as we think about marrying up the investment strategy to where our long-term goals want to be in automotive."

Thank you for joining us today. With demand for steel remaining strong and most of our facilities operating at peak performance, we have not lost focus on our goal of becoming the world's safest steel company. We continue to perform well on the safety front as we look to make 2021 our safest year ever, besting our record set just last year. In particular, I want to acknowledge the progress demonstrated by our sheet mills in our 2 DRI facilities for achieving world-class safety performance so far this year. I encourage all of our teammates to maintain their focus on safety so we can achieve the most important goal that we have set for our company. 
Consistent with last month's guidance, Nucor posted record quarterly earnings in the second quarter. Our earnings of $5.04 per share surpassed our previous earnings per share record set last quarter. Our first half earnings of $8.13 per share exceeds our full year EPS record of $7.42 set in 2018. All 3 operating segments are continuing to generate robust profits due to strong demand, higher average selling prices and excellent execution across Nucor. In our steel mills segment, we saw the greatest improvement in profitability from our sheet and plate mills. The performance of our steel products group also improved compared to the first quarter. Jim will provide more details about our performance at this quarter and our outlook for the third quarter in a few minutes. 
This level of performance is the result of years of work strategically growing and positioning our company to thrive in market conditions like we are experiencing today. My congratulations to the entire Nucor team. There are several fundamental drivers of the strong market conditions Nucor is benefiting from today. The most important of these is robust demand. Virtually all the steel end use markets that we monitor are growing. 
Some of this growth may simply be catch-up from the pandemic-induced economic low we experienced here in the U.S., but we think it goes beyond a temporary rebound. One sign of this is the increasing confidence about next year that we sense from our customers, ranging from automotive, trucking, heavy and ag equipment and across the construction sector. There are noteworthy new drivers for growth in steel demand, warehouses for e-commerce, renewable energy projects and an increase in U.S. manufacturing investment focused on greater supply chain resiliency are all creating new market opportunities for Nucor. Very strong housing and automotive markets are also creating incremental steel demand, not to mention activity by state DOTs, whose infrastructure investment spending has held up better than expected. 
We are fortunate that several of our strategic growth investments have come online during this period, and our results reflect better-than-expected contributions from Nucor steel mills in Sedalia, Frostproof, Kankakee, Marion, Gallatin's new galvanizing line and Hickman's new cold mill. My thanks, especially to our teammates at these locations, who have worked safely to ramp these projects up quickly to meet market demands. 
Our strategy continues to be: grow the core, expand beyond and live our culture. We are continuing to make targeted investments and acquisitions to grow our share in attractive markets and increase our long-term earnings power. We are complementing our investment strategy with a sharpened commercial focus that is enabling us to leverage our broad portfolio and deliver increased value to our customers with more integrated solutions. Acquisition announcements we made in the second quarter are focused on the expand beyond part of our mission statement. Our pending acquisition of Cornerstone Building Brands' insulated metal panels business, IMP for short, is squarely aimed at some of the fastest-growing markets I've mentioned. For example, distribution center investments driven by evolving consumer preferences regarding e-commerce and grocery delivery as well as the expansion of data centers and server farms, which all require temperature-controlled environments. Cornerstone's IMP business is a market leader and innovator in the growing IMP product category. 
IMP products are gaining market share as companies and institutions continue to focus on environmental performance and energy efficiency. The superior insulating performance of IMP products reduces energy usage and overall operations-related greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, IMP products are easier to install with lower maintenance cost versus other wall and roofing solutions. Cornerstone's IMP business is an excellent fit with Nucor Buildings Group and we are confident that we can help the team there take performance to an even higher level. 
We also announced earlier this week our agreement to acquire Hannibal Industries, one of the largest steel pallet rack manufacturers in the U.S. Hannibal provides racking solutions to warehouse serving the e-commerce, industrial, food storage and retail segments. Adding Hannibal to Nucor creates a new growth platform that broadens our offering to the distribution center market, including beams, joist, deck, metal buildings and, of course, insulated metal panels. As an employee-owned company, we are optimistic that Hannibal Industries will be a great fit with the Nucor culture. 
Also, on the expand beyond front, we continue to build out our own growth platform in industrial gases, enabling lower cost supply to our steel mills, while also creating additional streams of revenue with sales to third parties. The team that joined Nucor with our acquisition of Universal Industrial Gases in 2019 continues to do a great job executing these initiatives. We have an operating air separation unit at Nucor Hertford and are actively selling liquid gases on the open market. We will continue to have more ASUs supporting our other mills up and running in the coming months. We are bringing the safety-focused, performance-driven, team-oriented Nucor culture to each of these businesses, and we are excited to welcome these teammates to the Nucor family. 
As one of the cleanest steel producers on the planet, Nucor will continue to take our environmental leadership position even further. Our new greenhouse gas reduction commitment will take our carbon intensity down to 77% below today's world average. Our commitment is to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by a combined 35%. This commitment will be measured against the 2015 baseline, the year the Paris Climate Agreement was signed. At our current greenhouse gas intensity, Nucor has already achieved the steel sector benchmark established in the Paris Agreement. Our performance today is what many of our competitors around the globe are aspiring to achieve by 2030, '40, '50 and beyond. And compared to many of our integrated competitors, our starting point is already better than their near and intermediate goals. And now we're going to get even better. We are a leader today in sustainable steel production, and our commitment to further reduce our emissions intensity will keep us a leader as we move forward. 
Turning to infrastructure. We urge Congress to make good on the recent bipartisan framework reached in the Senate and come together to pass a significant infrastructure funding bill. We strongly believe that modernizing our infrastructure will boost our nation's economic competitiveness, not to mention, making us all safer. Federal infrastructure spending plans currently under consideration are expected to increase U.S. steel demand by as much as 5 million tons per year for every $100 billion of new investment. Nucor is incredibly well positioned to provide steel for infrastructure projects across U.S. We are encouraged that the President and members from both parties continue to focus on this issue, and we are hopeful that they can come together to form a bipartisan solution. 
Again, it is gratifying to see how years of hard work and planning are paying off in this incredibly strong steel market. We're excited about the expanded capabilities we can offer our customers because of our capital investments and acquisitions we have made in recent years. To the entire Nucor team, congratulations on an excellent first half of 2021. Let's continue to execute and make this our safest and most profitable year. 
Now Jim Frias will provide more details about our performance in the second quarter. Jim?"

Second quarter earnings of $5.04 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range. Better-than-expected results for the month of June were achieved across a broad group of businesses, including our beam mills, bar mills, sheet mills, rebar fabr",1018,"Thanks, Leon. Second quarter earnings of $5.04 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range. Better-than-expected results for the month of June were achieved across a broad group of businesses, including our beam mills, bar mills, sheet mills, rebar fabrication, tubular products and joist and deck. Nucor's diverse portfolio of products and capabilities is consistently a powerful driver of value creation for Nucor shareholders and customers. 
Recently completed capital projects made significant and above budget earnings contributions in the first half of this year. These projects are the rolling mill modernization at our Ohio rebar mill; the hot band galvanizing line at our Kentucky sheet mill; the specialty cold rolling mill at our Arkansas sheet mill; the rebar micro mills in Missouri and Florida; and the merchant bar rolling mill at our Illinois bar mill. These targeted investments are enabling Nucor to earning a growing and profitable share of the markets we serve. 
The Hickman, Arkansas specialty cold mill is an excellent example of Nucor's growth strategy. There are no other carbon steel mills in North America that match our new range of capabilities. In the second quarter, the Hickman specialty cold mill ran at 118% of rated capacity, more than double its originally projected production ramp time line. Since beginning operations in mid-2019, this project's life-to-date profitability also substantially exceeds its initial forecast. And the Hickman team is looking ahead to further expanding long-term earnings power as it begins the work of commissioning its third-generation flexible galvanizing line equipment. The state-of-the-art capabilities of these new assets will position Nucor to further grow our automotive footprint. 
We will provide our automotive customers the greenest, most advanced high-strength steels in the industry. These steels will provide our customers the ultimate solution that satisfies their needs, long into the future. Our success bringing strategic projects like this online reflects the Nucor team's commitment to being effective stewards of our shareholders' valuable capital. Our growth investments are targeted at defined market objectives and opportunities to generate attractive returns with reduced volatility through the economic cycle. 
Financial strength continues to be a critical underpinning to Nucor's ability to grow long-term earnings power. At the close of the second quarter, our cash, short-term investments and restricted cash holdings totaled $3.2 billion. Compared with the end of the first quarter position, our second quarter cash position increased by about $226 million. That increase is after funding share repurchases of $614 million, cash dividends of $123 million, capital expenditures of $389 million and a working capital expansion on the inventory receivables and payables line items totaling about $945 million. Nucor's liquidity also includes our undrawn $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which does not mature until April of 2023. 
Total long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5.3 billion at quarter end. Gross debt as a percent of total capital was approximately 30%, while net debt was 12% of total capital and remains well below our targeted range of 18% to 23%. We remain materially underleveraged on this basis, but we anticipate that this will change somewhat as we deploy capital to acquire Cornerstone's IMP business and Hannibal Industries. 
We're excited to be moving forward with these new growth platforms. We expect that these businesses, along with the numerous internal growth projects we have been executing on, will materially add to Nucor's earnings and cash flow generation in the years ahead. Cash provided by operating activities for the first half of 2021 was $1.9 billion. Nucor's free cash flow or cash provided by operations minus capital spending was $1.2 billion. 
Nucor's financial strength and robust through-the-cycle cash flow allows for consistent balanced approach to capital allocation. We now estimate total year capital spending of approximately $1.8 billion. Each of our 3 most significant capital projects, the expansion and modernization of the Gallatin, Kentucky sheet mill; the Generation 3 flexible galvanizing line at the Hickman, Arkansas sheet mill; and the greenfield Brandenburg, Kentucky plate mill, remain on schedule. At Brandenburg, the timing of some equipment deliveries has been delayed, but overall, the project remains on schedule for a late 2022 commissioning. 
During the second quarter, we continued to see attractive value in our shares, repurchasing 6.765 million shares at an average cost of approximately $91 per share. Over the first half of this year, Nucor share repurchases totaled more than 12 million shares at an average cost of about $75 per share. Shares outstanding have been reduced by approximately 3% from the year-end 2020 level. For the first half of 2021, total cash returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases totaled just under $1.2 billion, representing approximately 47% of net earnings for the period. As we have said previously, we intend to return a minimum of 40% of our net income to Nucor shareholders. We are rewarding shareholders with substantial cash returns while continuing to invest for future profitable growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
Turning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2021, we are encouraged by a number of positive factors impacting our markets. As Leon mentioned, we see improving or stable market conditions for the vast majority of the end-use markets served by Nucor. In fact, order backlogs at most of our businesses suggest strength well into 2022. Further supporting our optimistic outlook, inventories throughout the supply chain remain lean. We expect earnings in the third quarter of 2021 to again set a new record. Compared to the second quarter, we expect earnings growth at all 3 of our segments, most notably our steel mills segment. Additionally, with our expectation of a strong fourth quarter, we believe second half of 2021 earnings will exceed first half of 2021 earnings. 
Nucor's record results highlight the success of our 27,000 team members building a stronger and more profitable Nucor. Our team's 2021 performance is simply outstanding. We remain excited by the opportunities ahead for our company. We have great determination to deliver increasing long-term value for our shareholders. Living our culture means driving sustainable performance. 
Thank you for your interest in our company. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Look, I would tell you broadly, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our mission is to grow the core, expand beyond and live the culture. We see opportunities as we think about growing the core, and that's the expansions at our Hickman galvanizing line to become the first EAF to be able to produce a full Generation 3 steel for the automotive sector. It's the expansion at our Gallatin sheet mill in expanding that footprint into a more attractive returns in different sectors like automotive, energy, and our culmination with the largest single investment in Nucor's history, our plate mill in Brandenburg, Kentucky, that's going to be brought online next year. That's going to be located in the heart of the largest plate-consuming region in the United States. And from a timing perspective, as we think about the renewable energy market and sector, that mill is incredibly ideally positioned and well suited to meet the demands of both onshore wind, but particularly offshore wind as that grows as a business. 
But we also see opportunities as we think about growth in the core outside of that. And so there are times that you're going to see Nucor continue to look within the framework of traditional steelmaking lanes that we've operated in for the last half of a century, but also expanding beyond. And that is the recent acquisitions with both Cornerstone and Hannibal that fit Nucor's long-term strategic objectives of maximizing shareholder returns. But also Emily, it's a focus on moving into markets that are truly growing. As you know, steel is a cyclical business and industry. And what we see in those -- renewable space, what we see in the green economy and digital economy is a fast-growing and increasing market opportunity for Nucor to maximize and leverage its strength, its cultural stewardship and to bring a leadership perspective into those businesses."

It's certainly front of mind as we think about the opportunities for us as we move more into the automotive sector. 
But to your point, as we think about the contrast, I've spent several of my years at the beam mill at Nucor-Yamato. Over the last decade or so, I would say Nucor-Yamato has averaged in that 70% utilization range. They're approaching 90% today, and we've not seen that for nearly a decade. And so the performance of that mill has been exemplary through that period, profitability-wise. But now in this market, we're seeing an incredible strength. Backlogs are improving. Order conditions are improving in the forecast as we move, not just through the rest of the year, but in some cases, well into '22, strength through the cycle in many of those groups. 
All of that is to say -- none of that is to say, rather, or includes any thought of what a meaningful infrastructure bill being passed in the United States could do and include. And again, we have room, we have opportunity in terms of creating and generating more steel for that sector. But the same conditions exist in long products.

Construction is obviously a huge market for beams and it is for plate as well, and it speaks to the strength of nonres construction that we've seen all this year. A lot of that construction is centered on low-rise industrial, warehouse distribution, data centers. What's left to start showing some life is high-rise, which has only continued tailwinds for the beam market. And the high-rise construction has been very, very slow over the last year or so, but it's starting to show some signs of life. 
In the plate market, specifically, really all markets are quite strong. The heavy ag market, transportation with rail cars, even oil and gas is starting to come back now. That's been one of the weaker markets, but we're starting to see activity in oil and gas. And then take cars, you've got to move oil one way or another. And if it's not in the pipeline, it's in a tank car. And so we see continued strength in the plate market. We see a good balance between supply and demand. That's what drives the pricing of the product, and we see continued strength through the second half of this year and then some."

As we think about Nucor expanding and some of our competitors expanding further upstream into more value-added businesses, on the EAF side, the demand for prime is going to get tighter.

And again, I'm proud of the team. I'm proud of the work that they've done. For way too many years on this call, we shared one reliability issue after the next. Their downturn that they took back in 2019 to fix the reliability issues has manifested itself to what Doug shared earlier in terms of world-class reliability, now operating not just in Trinidad, which it's done for a long time, but now marrying that up with our capability in Louisiana. So under Nucor's control, we have about 4.5 million tons of DRI metallics that are in our direct control, and that offers us a unique material advantage as we move forward. And as we think about expansion and the demand on the metallic side, is there opportunity? Yes, I think there's some opportunities as we think about -- is there an opportunity in this country for certain integrated competitors to bank pig iron in those facilities and have a sourced buyer in the United States? Absolutely. And Nucor would be absolutely supportive of that strategy. But again, that's for them to sort through and work through. But again, we're confident in our capability today."

Automotive has been sort of squishy, given the push outs in the second quarter and some of the downtime that manufacturers have taken one. And one of your competitors earlier today said that they had to withhold some volume and kept in their inventory, that they hope to lap later this year. I mean, any thoughts in terms of what you all are seeing on automotive and what have the signals been? And what are you planning for because it's been very tough to read from our standpoint?"

Look, let me begin with the kind of the backdrop of as we think about semiconductors and one of the things that I think most Americans have learned through this pandemic is this nation needs to be a nation that builds and makes things again. And we'v",344,"Yes. Look, let me begin with the kind of the backdrop of as we think about semiconductors and one of the things that I think most Americans have learned through this pandemic is this nation needs to be a nation that builds and makes things again. And we've got to restore manufacturing in this country, whether it be pharma, PPE, medical equipment devices and semiconductors. But directly to answer your question, you think about the days on hand in the automotive world of about 27 days on hand, inventory numbers are staggeringly low. We think about the rental car fleets across this nation, it's going to take a long time to replenish the dealer inventory networks as well as the rental car side. 
But as we mentioned, our investment strategies and our move in automotive is really exciting for Nucor. We're about 1.5 million tons today into the automotive sector. And our focus is to, in the next several years, double that. Our OEM relationships that we've built over the years, now becoming General Motors Supplier of the Year back to back to back years, 3 years in a row, our team has done a phenomenal job. I couldn't be more proud of the work that's done. So while I do think we're going to see some constraints, obviously, you're reading the headlines as we are and talking to our customers, there's going to be a lot of pressure, right? GM announced they're going to take some downtime on some of their Silverados and building out of their pickup trucks. None of that is by design, right? It's because they can't get the parts that they need. 
So while it will have an overall material impact to the industry, Nucor's volumes are not significantly off. And we have a unique platform where our 14 OEM direct customers that we have today are asking Nucor to take bigger shares, and that is, again, an exciting opportunity as we think about marrying up the investment strategy to where our long-term goals want to be in automotive."

Nucor continues to deliver strong results in our safety performance as we work towards our goal of becoming the world's safest steel company. Our performance in 2021 is slightly ahead of last year, which was the safest year in Nucor's history. Our team is committed to identifying and eliminating those risks which could lead to injury. Our most important value is the safety, health and well-being of our entire Nucor family. 
During the third quarter, we once again achieved record results. With earnings per share of $7.28, our third quarter performance surpasses our previous record of $5.04 set in the second quarter of this year and nearly matches our full year earnings record of $7.42 that we set back in 2018. I'd like to congratulate the entire Nucor team for delivering the phenomenal results we have seen so far this year, while staying focused on our safety goals. I'm incredibly proud of our team and what we are accomplishing together. 
Since our founding 56 years ago, sustainability has been at the Nucor of Nucor's business model. More than ever before, we see opportunities to advance our continued success by partnering with customers to help them meet their own growth and sustainability objectives. Our recent launch of Econiq, which is a new line of net zero carbon emission seal products, gives our customers confidence in the trust that the products that they're purchasing from Nucor will not only help them meet their sustainability goals, but provide a differentiated value proposition for them for the future. Our use of recycled scrap-based EAF technology enables us to operate at 70% below the current GHG intensity for the global steel industry. Eqonic Steel will further advance our leadership position by applying credits from 100% renewable electricity and high-quality carbon offsets to negate any remaining scope 1 or 2 emissions from our steelmaking process. 
We are delighted that General Motors will be the first customer for Econiq. With our first shipment slated for early 2022, Econiq is going to be a key piece of GM's vision of a net zero emission future as GM continues to work towards reducing carbon emissions throughout their supply chain and through electrification of their model lineups. And we also look forward to deploying Econiq more broadly to help customers from across numerous other steel-consuming end markets meet their goals and develop more sustainable products. 
And while I'm on the topic of sustainability, our new Corporate Sustainability Report can be found on nucor.com. along with our first TCFD aligned report and updated SASB, aligned report from our steel mills segment. We hope you will find all this information informative and useful. 
The third quarter was a very eventful one for Nucor strategically as we announced or closed on several investments that will help us continue to advance our company's mission to grow the core, expand beyond and live our culture. We announced our plan to build a state-of-the-art sheet mill in the Midwest on September 20. With 3 million tons of annual capacity, this mill will be located to serve the country's largest steel consuming regions: the Midwest and the Northeast. These are regions where Nucor is currently underrepresented. 
With coil width of up to 84 inches, a tandem cold mill and initially 2 galvanizing lines, the new sheet mill will position Nucor to grow its market share in value-added products from automotive, appliance, HVAC, heavy equipment, agricultural, transportation and construction applications. The mill's product mix will be approximately 2/3 coiled roll and galv. 
The U.S. steel market is undergoing a structural transformation driven by the dual imperatives of economic efficiency and sustainability. Our mill will be state-of-the-art and have a significantly lower carbon footprint than nearby competitors. 
With our financial strength and multi-decade track record of innovation and execution, Nucor is uniquely positioned to continue leading this acceleration steel market transformation. Our investment in this greenfield sheet mill represents a continuation of Nucor's balanced approach to capital allocation, investing in projects and acquisitions expected to generate returns that substantially exceed our cost of capital, while also continuing to return at least 40% of our net income to stockholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Jim will discuss this further in his opening remarks. 
Also, we recently announced our plans to expand out West We will build a new melt shop at one of our existing bar mills in the western United States. This facility will have the capacity of 600,000 tons annually, adding melt capacity positioned to Nucor to build on our market leadership position in the region, which is experiencing both population growth and the infrastructure investment that typically accompanies it. Our bar mill group is where our steelmaking started over 50 years ago, and it continues to generate very attractive returns on capital. 
In addition to prudently investing to grow our Nucor steel businesses, we are executing on our opportunities to expand beyond. During the quarter, we acquired Cornerstone's insulated metal panels business; as well as Hannibal Industries, a steel racking manufacturer. We are now able to offer a broad range of insulated metal panel products and racking solutions. Each of these businesses is aimed squarely at serving fast-growing markets such as warehouses and data centers. Our strategic investments will continue to be aimed at positioning Nucor to serve attractive growing end use markets as the economy evolves to rely more on renewable power and Internet-based services. We are excited to welcome our newest team members to the Nucor family. 
As you can see, we are adding capabilities to increase our presence in attractive markets and extend our company's long record of growth and value creation. Nucor is positioned to provide the sustainable steel and steel products needed to build the 21st century green economy. A key requirement of that economy is modern, resilient and sustainable infrastructure. Republicans and Democrats agree that the bipartisan infrastructure bill is urgently needed, and we hope Congress can find a path forward to get this bill passed in order to ensure the safety of our citizens, the health of our economy and future opportunities for American workers. We cannot afford to have Congress miss this opportunity. 
Before I turn the call over to Jim, let me take a moment to congratulate our team. You all should be very proud of the safety and financial results achieved in the first 9 months of the year. We can only benefit from these strong market conditions if our facilities are running safely, responsibly and reliably. Once again, thank you to each of you for what you do to help Nucor win. Nucor will continue to invest in our future and provide our customers a differentiated value proposition while offering the most diverse set of capabilities of any steelmaker. Thank you all for what you do. And as we approach the end of the year, let's continue to make 2021 our safest and most profitable year in Nucor's history. 
Now Jim Frias will provide more details about our performance in the third quarter. Jim?"

We are proud to report our third quarter of 2021 earnings of $7.28 per diluted share, establishing a new quarterly earnings record. This quarter's results also compare favorably with year-ago third quarter earnings of $0.63 per diluted share. We are benefiting from strong demand and profitability across Nucor's diverse portfolio of products and capabilities. Nucor's product breadth continues to be a powerful driver of value creation for both Nucor customers and shareholders. 
Due to higher-than-expected inventory profit eliminations, third quarter earnings were slightly below our guidance range of $7.30 to $7.40 per diluted share. Year-to-date earnings of $15.34 per diluted share are more than double 2018's record annual earnings of $7.42 per diluted share. 
We are extremely proud of our team's strong performance during the current up cycle and through all the pandemic-related challenges we have experienced this year and last. Our confidence in Nucor's competitive positioning has never been greater as we look to execute on further opportunities in the months and years ahead. Our results reflect strong returns from consistent reinvestment in our operations over the years and outstanding execution by our team. 
5 significant organic growth investment projects, representing approximately $1 billion in aggregate capital investment, completed start-up and full product commissioning over the 2019 to 2020 period: the rolling mill and modernization at our Marion, Ohio rebar mill, the hot band galvanizing line at our Kentucky sheet mill, the specialty coiled rolling mill at our Arkansas sheet mill, the rebar micro mill in Missouri, the rebar micro mill in Florida. Each of these projects are delivering life-to-date profitability well above their original projections. During this past quarter, these projects together generated EBITDA exceeding $180 million. 
The 2 completed sheet mill capability expansion projects merit additional comments. Just 2 years after beginning operations in September of 2019, the Gallatin, Kentucky hot band galvanizing lines cumulative EBITDA exceeds the project's $200 million investment. At 72 inches wide, this line is the widest hot rolling galvanizing line in North America and is uniquely positioned to serve value-added markets such as automotive, solar tubing, grain storage, culverts and cooling towers. The facility ran at 112% of design capacity in the third quarter of 2021.
Next, the Hickman, Arkansas specialty coiled mill continues to be another great success story. After beginning operations in mid-2019, the specialty coiled mill's cumulative EBITDA already exceeds half of the project's capital investment. This facility also ran at 112% of rated capacity in the third quarter of 2021. Further, our specialty coiled mill team is still very early in the process of developing unique product capabilities and applications. leveraging Hickman's flexible coiled rolling mill to produce the high-strength lightweight products that are increasingly demanded by OEM customers. 
To our teammates at these locations and across Nucor, congratulations and thank you for your outstanding work. 
As most of you are aware, 2 more major capital projects, also totaling approximately $1 billion, are on schedule to begin start-up during the fourth quarter. These investments will expand further Nucor's product capabilities into the sheet market. They are the expansion and modernization of the Gallatin sheet mill's hot band production capability the Generation 3 flexible galvanizing line at the Hickman sheet mill. Gallatin would begin a 25-day production outage on November 23 for final equipment installation. After the outage, start-up and commissioning will commence. At Hickman, commissioning of the flexible galvanizing line is underway with prime production expected in December. 
Looking into 2022, our team constructing the $1.7 billion Brandenburg, Kentucky state-of-the-art plate mill is on track for start-up late next year. Project-to-date capital spending totaled about $570 million. Located in the middle of the largest U.S. plate-consuming region and able to produce 97% of plate products consumed domestically, this mill positions Nucor to support domestic production of wind towers, while securing a market leadership position in plate. 
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash provided by operating activities for the first 9 months of 2021 was approximately $3.6 billion. Nucor's free cash flow, or cash provided by operations minus capital spending of $1.2 billion, was about $2.4 billion. For full year 2021, we now estimate capital spending of approximately $1.7 billion. 
At the close of the third quarter, our cash, short-term investments and restricted cash holdings totaled $2.3 billion. This is a decline of about $900 million from the second quarter level. During the third quarter, Nucor funded significant uses of cash totaling approximately $3.6 billion, including acquisitions of $1.3 billion; capital spending of $505 million; share repurchases of $858 million, and cash dividends of $120 million; and a net working capital expansion on inventory, receivables, payables and accruals totaling $766 million. These uses were funded primarily from Nucor's ongoing strong cash generated from operations, the cash and short-term investments drawdown, plus the receipt of $197 million from the issuance of green bonds tied to the Brandenburg project. 
At the close of the third quarter, total long-term debt, including current portion, was approximately $5.6 billion. Gross debt as a percentage of total capital was approximately 29%, while net debt was about 17% of total capital. 
Financial strength continues to be a critical underpinning of Nucor's ability to grow long-term earnings power and provide attractive cash returns to shareholders. We remain committed to returning capital through cash dividends and share repurchases a minimum of 40% of our net income over time. 
For the first 9 months of 2021, cash returned to shareholders totaled $2.1 billion. That represents approximately 47% of Nucor's net income for this period. The year-to-date capital returns consisted of dividends of $367 million and almost $1.8 billion of share repurchases. During the third quarter, we repurchased 8.2 million shares at an average cost of approximately $105 per share. Year-to-date repurchases totaled 20.35 million shares at an average cost of just over $87 per share. Over the first 9 months of 2021, Nucor's shares outstanding have decreased by about 5.5%. 
As we approach year-end, Nucor's Board will consider a dividend increase for 2022. We have paid and increased our regular quarterly dividend every year since dividends were instituted in 1973. we expect the Board's deliberations will consider both the effects of our recent repurchases and the sustainable earnings power we see in our businesses. 
Since the end of 2017, Nucor's capital allocation framework has helped us achieve significant value creation for our investors. Issued and outstanding shares have been reduced by more than 10%, moving from 318 million shares at the end of 2017 to approximately 286 million shares at the end of the third quarter. 
Over that same period, we have grown our steel bar production capacity by about 13% to 9.6 million tons. We have also added about 1 million tons of value-added processing capability to our sheet business. Additionally, our steel products capacity has also grown by more than 1 million tons. Today, we have significant projects under construction that will grow our sheet and plate capacity to more than 4 million and 1 million tons, respectively, further increasing our earnings power for decades to come. 
We are having a remarkable year in 2021, but it should not be missed that Nucor's ability to generate higher earnings per share is continuing to grow.
Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021. We are encouraged by ongoing robust demand conditions in most of the end markets served by Nucor. In fact, order backlogs at most of our businesses suggest strength well into 2022. 
At the same time, customer inventories remain relatively lean. Logistical challenges throughout the economy continue to represent a risk factor. However, the moderating influence this is having on current demand may prolong the duration of this favorable economic cycle. 
We believe earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021 are likely to be at or near the record level achieved in the third quarter. Compared to third quarter, we expect earnings growth at our steel mills and steel products segments. The raw materials segment's performance will be challenged by margin pressures in our DRI business. 
We are encouraged by our first 9 months of 2021 performance, and we see great opportunities in our future. We are committed to delivering increasing long-term value for our shareholders. living our culture means driving performance.

Let me start broadly and maybe ask Jim to chime in on some details. 
But obviously, we're looking at all of our costs across the segment and how that affects the bottom line performance of Nucor, whether that be energy scrap, labor and again goods and services that are coming in, again mostly domestically. So while we're certainly seeing and following and tracking the supply chain constraints, we source most of our products here domestically. 
And so in some cases, -- most cases, we've been a little sheltered from some of those impacts. But as we look at labor, as we look at moving trucks and materials, barges, getting ships in and out, those costs are certainly having an impact. 
What we're seeing with energy, obviously we're watching. We have natural gas wells that over the years, we've not continued to drill. However, as we see the market moving up, now it's really a question of how long do we believe that's sustainable? Do we believe that will continue well into the future? And again, that's part of our team's analysis, ongoing analysis now, to determine how bullish we are about that future as we move forward. Jim, anything you'd add to that?"

Year-to-date, we've generated $3.6 billion worth of cash in that time period. However, in the third quarter alone, we generated $1.8 billion of that. So nearly half of the overall year's earnings were accrued or accounted for in the last 3 months. 
So in terms of our performance, the demand drivers driving our business, they remain very, very robust. The piece that we underestimated was the intercompany eliminations. And with that, I'll turn it to Jim, let him take you through a little more color around that and how we accrued that or accounted for that."

First of all, let me use some data on what intercompany elims have been in each quarter this year. There are about $183.6 million in the first quarter, $148.7 million in the second quarter, and they jumped to $268 million in the th",393,"Yes. Thank you, Leon. 
First of all, let me use some data on what intercompany elims have been in each quarter this year. There are about $183.6 million in the first quarter, $148.7 million in the second quarter, and they jumped to $268 million in the third quarter. And so let's talk about why they jumped by such a large amount. 
Our normal amount of intercompany steel inventory, and I'm talking about finished steel products that have been sold to a downstream business or to a sister division that needs that steel for some purpose, is normally around 1.3 million tons. It goes up and down from time to time. And this year, because of the strong demand market that has trended down, in fact at the end of the second quarter, that was down to 1.076 million tons, so down more than 200,000 tons for what we would consider a normal level. 
And then in the third quarter, that inventory came up a little bit. It's now at the end of the third quarter, 1.14 million tons. So it went up by roughly 65 -- I'm sorry, around 60,000 tons. And most of that happened in September, and we didn't forecast it. And the margins on that inventory were very large. And so it caused us to miss our earnings by about our pretax earnings by about $64 million. That was the impact within our forecast. That's equivalent of $0.16 per share. 
So it's we view it as not something you would call out because it wasn't like a onetime item that's tied to an operational issue. It's an intercompany accounting thing that happens when you have so much vertical integration. We view the fact that over 20% of our steel is consumed by in-house customers as a strategic advantage that's important to our business. 
And so in the quarter and then specifically in September, the inventory they required, we had them a little hand to mouth, wasn't enough. And we stepped it up a little in September, and we don't have a way to see that at corporate. We have so many businesses that makes deal and sell it to the internal customers, there's no way for us to measure that on a timely basis until we close the books at the end of the quarter, and that was what happened."

It's something that goes back a very long way in Nucor. That was a focus many, many years ago to begin to control more of our iron units. And the buildout obviously in Trinidad and then subsequently what we had built in our DRI facility in Louisiana gave us a significant amount of material that we could internally control and offset some of the different rents, whether it's pig iron and certainly with the DRI we produced, DM1 wanted to balance that approach out. 
Over the years, we had some challenges as we started up as were well documented on many of these calls. The performance of the team in Louisiana  has been exceptional since their big outage in November or the fourth quarter of '19. The reliability has come up significantly. But Doug, why don't you just speak more specifically about how we look at prime, what that balance is for Nucor and our mix, and some of the things that we're looking at moving forward."

Martin, good question. I think I'll start with just putting some -- a little bit of detail around the capabilities that we have. I think sometimes we lose sight of this. 
We have about 4.3 million tons of capacity in our recycling yards, which is primarily obsolete grade. We have what we call the industrial group that controls about a little over 1 million tons of prime scrap a year, which is about a sixfold increase over the last 5 or 6 years, and we can see that continuing to grow. in there. We have the DRI facilities that we talked about with about 4.5 million tons of capacity. And then all that's tied together with our brokerage group that manages the use of all of that our national purchases and our international purchases. 
So we have a very robust set of capabilities that we can move and react in many different markets. As we see the growth of our steelmaking capacity, we'll be able to take products and use them at the best place to get the best value for them. So places that might be using DRI now, we may shift them to other places, backfill that with different grades from different sources. 
As far as new technologies, yes, we're looking at things all the time. We're constantly improving our recycling yards to produce a better grade of shred We're constantly recovering more nonferrous materials and increasing the value that way, and then just a broad scope of new technologies here around the world wherever it is. So we're pretty comfortable with where we are and pretty aggressive in what we're doing."

And Nucor and others move up the value chain as we make more demanding applications. But at the end of the day, -- and Doug, correct me if I'm wrong, roughly about 25% of our mix in our sheet mills is prime scrap. So it's not a commodity that we're emboldened to [ at ] 40%, 50%, 60% of the mix that we need.
So with what Doug mentioned in the David Joseph Company, we've been building relationships in this market. And it's again a commodity-driven product where we're going to pay what's required. But what's the governor? We believe the DRI actually keeps the level set between prime and obsolete grades. But will that increase? Yes, we do think it will increase. But we feel incredibly good and well positioned with what we've done, what we're currently doing in the mix that are in our mills today. 
And what Doug mentioned, rationalizing that. Because we generate the DRI. It offsets other uses, but some of the mills that are using DRI today don't need that for the end-use customer requirements. We're going to shift those mixes. So again, as we build this new sheet mill, we feel very well positioned to be able to get the mix that we need, to make the grades that we want as we move into the highest applications in automotive in other markets."

So we're going to continue to look at those, as well as continue to look at what are the one standard deviation removed and that expand beyond, that give us a differentiated position. So the acquisitions of the insulated metal panel building business instantly gave us a market leadership position at nearly half or over half of the insulated panel market today, and that's a growth market. As we think about Hannibal in the racking industries the digital economy and green economy will be built with steel. Those are growing. Those are not under the steel type of cyclicality. The focus on data storage and warehousing coiled storage is  significant growth as we move forward. 
So you're going to see Nucor continue to focus on those areas.

And then Doug maybe can address your initial question on prime and the other grades. 
Look, there are certain segments within Nucor. Nucor has the widest product offering of any steel company in North America. Our ability to serve end-use markets from automotive, ag, heavy equipment, renewable sectors, the digital economy, the HVAC construction arena provides a unique insight and obviously backdrop to what is happening. As Chad mentioned, as we think about half of our products move into the construction arena, the robust demand there, as Chad mentioned, is seen well out into 2022. So we see no slowing there at all. 
If we're seeing some slowness, it's from a -- 2 markets really that I'll touch on. One is automotive. The chip shortages is certainly well documented. It's something that people are very familiar with. But with that come some unique opportunities. Obviously, Nucor is not heavily laden in automotive today. We're at 7% to 8% of our overall mix, 1.5, 1.6 million tons that move into the automotive markets. And that's going to increase. We want to double that over the next 2 to 3 years. And when the chip shortage ends and subsides, the pent-up demand in disposable income by consumers in the United States, I think it's going to be a boom for auto industry, but also for companies like Nucor that continue to supply into that. 
So I think there is going to be some or is some elasticity that we're seeing, but I think it's not demand driven. We see it more from a rebounding in supply chain issues and constraints.
The other is in some of the construction. While again the demand is strong, we're seeing some job sites that are slowing because they're having trouble. Their end customers are getting having issues getting their needs from overseas, if they're requiring chemicals or overseas parts and deliveries that are being held up in waterways or finding trucks and getting containers across the ocean. So there are pieces of that, that I think are going to create some softening in that. 
But again overall, we see the fourth quarter being very robust, and again, potentially eclipsing the Q3 record. We'll wait, obviously, to see the results of that, but we anticipate that it could be as strong or slightly stronger. Doug, maybe just touching on this opening question around prime."

The value of inventories went up significantly in our portfolio as well as the valuation of receivables. They both went up. 
The selling price per ton, we're still collecting receivables in 30 days essentially and -- but the value of each ton that a customer owed us for went up. And so we used about $1.2 billion between inventory receivables net of payables in cash in Q3. 
So as we think about Q4, we think there could be some margin expansion, but not at the same rate that we achieved in the third quarter. So we think working capital use of cash should be down dramatically. We're not going to forecast a number. There won't be nearly at that $1.2 billion level."

Yes, there is value-added. Nucor's capability to be able to do this provides a differentiated value proposition as announced. And again, we're so excited with the partnership with General Motors, but we're also excited about the other interest in the companies that we're working with beyond, not just within the auto sector in other companies, but much wider. So the market acceptance for that is going to be significant, and it's also going to be quick. 
But the other piece of that is we think about volumes are not going to state exactly what our volumes are. What I would tell you is when we say at that scale, we're not talking in significant tonnages. We're talking very significant tonnages that Nucor is going to supply into the Econiq family.

And again, our team has done an amazing job of building the relationships with the major OEMs in this nation. We're excited about the opportunities to serve that market. 
And at the end of the day, the Econiq family in providing a net zero steel is  going to be a piece of the automakers' commitments in providing a net zero output. So in order for them to reach their goals, they've got to start with a net zero steel. We believe we have a differentiated value proposition to offer those steels today unlike any other producer. So yes, we're very excited about that. Our market share is growing. 
And again, part of the new mills focus is to move and continue up that value chain. The mill that's being built there is differentiated. It will not be what we've built in the past. It will provide significant quality advanced high-strength steel capabilities that match and mirror very, very nicely with the lowest carbon footprint anywhere in the world. So we're again, tremendously excited about that and the relationship that Nucor has built. 
We are the only EAF producer ever to receive the GM Supplier of the Year Award. We've now done that back to back to back years, 3 years in a row. And so again, it's been a lot of years and Nucor's worked very hard. But the fruits of that work and the relationships that are built are paying dividends."

We'll shift supply between our plants to accommodate that. 
Probably the outage that's getting the most notoriety right now is with the expansion of Gallatin. And that's progressing well. We're excited about it. And we're going to be concluding that soon. And that's going into conclude with the largest outage we have coming up in December, a 25-day outage. We've been prepping for that for months already ahead of time. So we have already had and will continue to have coil, and so that we can continue to ship from the pickle galv line through there, but also we'll take care of customers from some of our other plants.

We don't have our final budget in yet, but I can give you some color around the bigger projects that are wrapping up this year and next year. So let me flip to my document that has information. 
Yes. So for Brandenburg, in the fourth quarter, we think the cap spending there is going to be in the neighborhood of 250 to 70 million, somewhere in that range. And then next year we'll be in the $800 million to $900 million range. 
For the galvanizing line in Arkansas, roughly $5 million to $6 million in the fourth quarter. And it's going to start up in the fourth quarter, but there's always carryover expenses because of the when the timing of when bills come in. So probably another $5 million next year in the first quarter. 
Gallatin will probably spend in the high $80 million range in the fourth quarter, and there's probably going to be carryover in low to mid-20s into next year. 
And those are the bigger items. So we don't have a formal budget yet. We have to go before the Board in December with our capital plan and have them approve it, so it wouldn't be appropriate for us to give a  total number for next year. But I don't think it's going to be dynamically different than our spending level this year. It's going to be in the range of what we're doing this year."

Secretary Raimondo and Katherine Tai, the USTR, has done a great job. They know the markets. They know the industry very, very well. 
And again, I think a piece of this, Andrew, is already in the works now with what's being conducted with Europe. And so we think that's going to move away obviously from 232 and what the final outcome looks like, whether it's a tariff rate quota. We'll wait and see. But as you mentioned, as we think about the environmental advantage, there is a huge piece of recognizing both in Congress as well as the American consumer. 
That when we think about a green economy, as we think about renewables, it should be very important to the members of the House and Senate that those renewable energy projects are not built with the dirtiest steels from overseas in the world but are built with the most sustainable, cleanest steel and steel companies found here in the United States like Nucor and other EAF producers. There is a significant advantage. 
And so if that happens, Nucor has also provided our commentary and analysis on what a border adjustment tax must include. Because it is not apples to apples in that steel product. And so again, we're going to be very vocal. We're going to continue to advocate. But we do have a high regard for Secretary Raimondo and Katherine Tai in understanding those issues and the nuances. And again, I can't tell you when 232 will go away at some point, but it is a vehicle to bring other nations to the negotiating table to negotiate a better trade arrangement."

Nucor continues to deliver strong results in our safety performance as we work towards our goal of becoming the world's safest steel company. Our performance in 2021 is slightly ahead of last year, which was the safest year in Nucor's history. 
Our team is committed to identifying and eliminating those risks, which could lead to injury. Our most important value is the safety, health and well being of our entire Nucor family.  
During the third quarter, we once again achieved record results. With earnings per share of $7.28, our third quarter performance surpasses our previous record of $5.04 set in the second quarter of this year and nearly matches our full year earnings record of $7.42 that we set back in 2018. 
I'd like to congratulate the entire Nucor team for delivering the phenomenal results we have seen so far this year, while staying focused on our safety goals. I'm incredibly proud of our team and what we are accomplishing together.  
Since our founding 56 years ago, sustainability has been at the core of Nucor's business model. More than ever before, we see opportunities to advance our continued success by partnering with customers to help them meet their own growth and sustainability objectives. 
Our recent launch of Econiq, which is a new line of net zero carbon emission seal products, gives our customers confidence and the trust that the products that they're purchasing from Nucor will not only help them meet their sustainability goals, but provide a differentiated value proposition for them for the future. 
Our use of recycled scrap-based EAF technology enables us to operate at 70% below the current GHG intensity for the global steel industry. Econiq steel will further advance our leadership position by applying credits from 100% renewable electricity and high-quality carbon offsets to negate any remaining Scope 1 or 2 emissions from our steelmaking process.  
We are delighted that General Motors will be the first customer for Econiq. With our first shipment slated for early 2022, Econiq is going to be a key piece of GM's vision of a net zero emission future, as GM continues to work towards reducing carbon emissions throughout their supply chain and through electrification of their model lineups, and we also look forward to deploying Econiq more broadly to help customers from across numerous other steel-consuming end markets meet their goals and develop more sustainable products.  
And while I'm on the topic of sustainability, our new Corporate Sustainability Report can be found on nucor.com, along with our first TCFD aligned report and updated SASB aligned report from our steel mills segment. We hope you will find all this information informative and useful.  
The third quarter was a very eventful one for Nucor strategically as we announced or closed on several investments that will help us continue to advance our company's mission to grow the core, expand beyond and live our culture. 
We announced our plan to build a state-of-the-art sheet mill in the Midwest on September 20. With 3 million tons of annual capacity, this mill will be located to serve the country's largest steel consuming regions, the Midwest and the Northeast. These are regions where Nucor is currently underrepresented. 
With coil width of up to 84 inches, a tandem cold mill and initially 2 galvanizing lines, the new sheet mill will position Nucor to grow its market share in value-added products from automotive, appliance, HVAC, heavy equipment, agricultural, transportation and construction applications. The mill's product mix will be approximately 2/3 cold rolled and galv.  
The U.S. steel market is undergoing a structural transformation driven by the dual imperatives of economic efficiency and sustainability. Our mill will be state-of-the-art and have a significantly lower carbon footprint than nearby competitors.  
With our financial strength and multi-decade track record of innovation and execution, Nucor is uniquely positioned to continue leading this acceleration steel market transformation. 
Our investment in this greenfield sheet mill represents a continuation of Nucor's balanced approach to capital allocation, investing in projects and acquisitions expected to generate returns that substantially exceed our cost of capital, while also continuing to return at least 40% of our net income to stockholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Jim will discuss this further in his opening remarks.  
Also we recently announced our plans to expand out West. We will build a new melt shop at one of our existing bar mills in the Western United States. This facility will have the capacity of 600,000 tons annually. Adding melt capacity positions Nucor to build on our market leadership position in the region, which is experiencing both population growth and the infrastructure investment that typically accompanies it. Our bar mill group is where our steelmaking started over 50 years ago, and it continues to generate very attractive returns on capital.  
In addition to prudently investing to grow our core steel businesses, we are executing on our opportunities to expand beyond. During the quarter, we acquired Cornerstone's insulated metal panels business as well as Hannibal Industries, a steel racking manufacturer. 
We are now able to offer a broad range of insulated metal panel products and racking solutions. Each of these businesses is aimed squarely at serving fast-growing markets such as warehouses and data centers. 
Our strategic investments will continue to be aimed at positioning Nucor to serve attractive growing end use markets as the economy evolves to rely more on renewable power and Internet-based services. We are excited to welcome our newest team members to the Nucor family.  
As you can see, we are adding capabilities to increase our presence in attractive markets and extend our company's long record of growth and value creation. Nucor is positioned to provide the sustainable steel and steel products needed to build the 21st century green economy. 
A key requirement of that economy is modern, resilient and sustainable infrastructure. Republicans and Democrats agree that the bipartisan infrastructure bill is urgently needed, and we hope Congress can find a path forward to get this bill passed in order to ensure the safety of our citizens, the health of our economy and future opportunities for American workers. We cannot afford to have Congress miss this opportunity.  
Before I turn the call over to Jim, let me take a moment to congratulate our team. You all should be very proud of the safety and financial results achieved in the first 9 months of the year. We can only benefit from these strong market conditions if our facilities are running safely, responsibly and reliably. Once again, thank you to each of you for what you do to help Nucor win.  
Nucor will continue to invest in our future and provide our customers a differentiated value proposition, while offering the most diverse set of capabilities of any steelmaker. Thank you all for what you do. And as we approach the end of the year, let's continue to make 2021 our safest and most profitable year in Nucor's history.  
Now Jim Frias will provide more details about our performance in the third quarter. Jim?"

We are proud to report our third quarter of 2021 earnings of $7.28 per diluted share, establishing a new quarterly earnings record. This quarter's results also compare favorably with year-ago third quarter earnings of $0.63 per diluted share.  
We are benefiting from strong demand and profitability across Nucor's diverse portfolio of products and capabilities. Nucor's product breadth continues to be a powerful driver of value creation for both Nucor customers and shareholders.  
Due to higher-than-expected inventory profit eliminations, third quarter earnings were slightly below our guidance range of $7.30 to $7.40 per diluted share. Year-to-date earnings of $15.34 per diluted share are more than double 2018's record annual earnings of $7.42 per diluted share.  
We are extremely proud of our team's strong performance during the current up cycle and through all the pandemic-related challenges we have experienced this year and last. Our confidence in Nucor's competitive positioning has never been greater, as we look to execute on further opportunities in the months and years ahead. 
Our results reflect strong returns from consistent reinvestment in our operations over the years and outstanding execution by our team by significant organic growth investment projects, representing approximately $1 billion in aggregate capital investment, completed start-up and full product commissioning over the 2019 to 2020 period. 
The rolling mill and modernization at our Marion, Ohio rebar mill, the hot band galvanizing line at our Kentucky sheet mill, the specialty cold rolling mill at our Arkansas sheet mill, the rebar micro mill in Missouri and the rebar micro mill in Florida, each of these projects are delivering life-to-date profitability well above their original projections. 
During this past quarter, these projects together generated EBITDA exceeding $180 million. The 2 completed sheet mill capability expansion projects merit additional comments. Just 2 years after beginning operations in September of 2019, the Gallatin, Kentucky hot band galvanizing lines cumulative EBITDA exceeds the project's $200 million investment. 
At 72 inches wide, this line is the widest hot rolling galvanizing line in North America and is uniquely positioned to serve value-added markets, such as automotive, solar tubing, grain storage, culverts and cooling towers. The facility ran at 112% of design capacity in the third quarter of 2021. 
Next, the Hickman, Arkansas specialty cold mill continues to be another great success story. After beginning operations in mid-2019, the specialty cold mill's cumulative EBITDA already exceeds half of the project's capital investment. This facility also ran at 112% of rated capacity in the third quarter of 2021. 
Further, our specialty cold mill team is still very early in the process of developing unique product capabilities and applications, leveraging Hickman's flexible cold rolling mill to produce the high-strength, lightweight products that are increasingly demanded by OEM customers. 
To our teammates at these locations and across Nucor, congratulations and thank you for your outstanding work.  
As most of you are aware, 2 more major capital projects also totaling approximately $1 billion are on schedule to begin start-up during the fourth quarter. These investments will expand further Nucor's product capabilities into the sheet market. 
They are the expansion and modernization of the Gallatin sheet mill's hot band production capability and the Generation 3 flexible galvanizing line at the Hickman sheet mill. Gallatin would begin a 25-day production outage on November 23 for final equipment installation. After the outage, start-up and commissioning will commence. At Hickman, commissioning of the flexible galvanizing line is underway, with prime production expected in December.  
Looking into 2022, our team constructing the $1.7 billion Brandenburg, Kentucky state-of-the-art plate mill is on track for start-up late next year. Project-to-date capital spending totaled about $570 million. Located in the middle of the largest U.S. plate-consuming region and able to produce 97% of plate products consumed domestically, this mill positions Nucor to support domestic production of wind towers, while securing a market leadership position in plate.  
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash provided by operating activities for the first 9 months of 2021 was approximately $3.6 billion. Nucor's free cash flow, or cash provided by operations minus capital spending of $1.2 billion, was about $2.4 billion. For full year 2021, we now estimate capital spending of approximately $1.7 billion.  
At the close of the third quarter, our cash, short-term investments and restricted cash holdings totaled $2.3 billion. This is a decline of about $900 million from the second quarter level. 
During the third quarter, Nucor funded significant uses of cash totaling approximately $3.6 billion, including acquisitions of $1.3 billion, capital spending of $505 million, share repurchases of $858 million and cash dividends of $120 million and a net working capital expansion on inventory, receivables, payables and accruals totaling $766 million. 
These uses were funded primarily from Nucor's ongoing strong cash generated from operations. The cash and short-term investments drawdown, plus the receipt of $197 million from the issuance of green bonds tied to the Brandenburg project.  
At the close of the third quarter, total long-term debt, including current portion, was approximately $5.6 billion. Gross debt as a percentage of total capital was approximately 29%, while net debt was about 17% of total capital.  
Financial strength continues to be a critical underpinning of Nucor's ability to grow long-term earnings power and provide attractive cash returns to shareholders. We remain committed to returning capital through cash dividends and share repurchases a minimum of 40% of our net income over time.  
For the first 9 months of 2021, cash returned to shareholders totaled $2.1 billion. That represents approximately 47% of Nucor's net income for this period. 
The year-to-date capital returns consisted of dividends of $367 million and almost $1.8 billion of share repurchases. During the third quarter, we repurchased 8.2 million shares at an average cost of approximately $105 per share. Year-to-date repurchases totaled 20.35 million shares at an average cost of just over $87 per share. Over the first 9 months of 2021, Nucor's shares outstanding have decreased by about 5.5%.  
As we approach year-end, Nucor's Board will consider a dividend increase for 2022. We have paid and increased our regular quarterly dividend every year since dividends were instituted in 1973. We expect the Board's deliberations will consider both the effects of our recent repurchases and the sustainable earnings power we see in our businesses.  
Since the end of 2017, Nucor's capital allocation framework has helped us achieve significant value creation for our investors. Issued and outstanding shares have been reduced by more than 10%, moving from 318 million shares at the end of 2017 to approximately 286 million shares at the end of the third quarter.  
Over that same period, we have grown our steel bar production capacity by about 13% to 9.6 million tons. We have also added about 1 million tons of value-added processing capability to our sheet business. Additionally, our steel products capacity has also grown by more than 1 million tons. 
Today, we have significant projects under construction that will grow our sheet and plate capacity to more than 4 million and 1 million tons, respectively, further increasing our earnings power for decades to come. 
We are having a remarkable year in 2021, but it should not be missed that Nucor's ability to generate higher earnings per share is continuing to grow. 
Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021. We are encouraged by ongoing robust demand conditions in most of the end markets served by Nucor. In fact, order backlogs at most of our businesses suggest strength well into 2022.  
At the same time, customer inventories remain relatively lean. Logistical challenges throughout the economy continue to represent a risk factor. However, the moderating influence this is having on current demand may prolong the duration of this favorable economic cycle.  
We believe earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021 are likely to be at or near the record level achieved in the third quarter. Compared to third quarter, we expect earnings growth at our steel mills and steel products segments. The raw materials segment's performance will be challenged by margin pressures in our DRI business.  
We are encouraged by our first 9 months of 2021 performance, and we see great opportunities in our future. We are committed to delivering increasing long-term value for our shareholders. Living our culture means driving performance.

Let me start broadly and maybe ask Jim to chime in on some details.  
But obviously, we're looking at all of our cost across the segment and how that affects the bottom line performance of Nucor, whether that be energy, scrap, labor and again goods and services that are coming in, again, mostly domestically. 
So while we're certainly seeing and following and tracking the supply chain constraints, we source most of our products here domestically. And so in some cases -- in most cases, we've been a little sheltered from some of those impacts. But as we look at labor, as we look at moving trucks and materials, barges, getting ships in and out, those costs are certainly having an impact. 
What we're seeing with energy, obviously, we're watching. We have natural gas wells that, over the years, we've not continued to drill. However, as we see the market moving up, now it's really a question of how long do we believe that's sustainable, do we believe that will continue well into the future. And again, that's part of our team's analysis -- ongoing analysis now to determine how bullish we are about that future as we move forward. 
Jim, anything you'd add to that?"

And how should we look about shipments for fourth quarter given the planned shutdown at Gallatin for the expansion and also the normal seasonality that you see there?"
184945,1684667576,2409309,"Nucor Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Yes. Let me be clear.

But largely from a shipments perspective, that was because of the outages we took across our sheet mill group. We approximately took about a week down at each of our sheet mills, and that equated to the shipments roughly that we were down.  
And as we think about performance, and again think about the quarter's perspective, we think a better measure of how Nucor's performed against that is our operating cash flows. 
Year-to-date, we've generated $3.6 billion worth of cash in that time period. However, in the third quarter alone, we generated $1.8 billion of that. So nearly half of the overall year's earnings were accrued or accounted for in the last 3 months.  
So in terms of our performance, the demand drivers driving our business, they remain very, very robust. The piece that we underestimated was the intercompany eliminations. And with that, I'll turn it to Jim. Let him take you through a little more color around that and how we accrued that or accounted for that."
184945,1684667576,2409309,"Nucor Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Yes. Thank you, Leon. First of all, let me use some data on what intercompany elims have been in each quarter this year. There are about $183.6 million in the first quarter, $148.7 million in the second quarter, and they jumped to $268 million in the thir",395,"Yes. Thank you, Leon. First of all, let me use some data on what intercompany elims have been in each quarter this year. There are about $183.6 million in the first quarter, $148.7 million in the second quarter, and they jumped to $268 million in the third quarter. And so let's talk about why they jumped by such a large amount.  
Our normal amount of intercompany steel inventory, and I'm talking about finished steel products that have been sold to a downstream business or to a sister division that needs that steel for some purpose, is normally around 1.3 million tons. It goes up and down from time to time. 
And this year, because of the strong demand market, that has trended down. In fact at the end of the second quarter, that was down to 1.076 million tons, so down more than 200,000 tons for what we would consider a normal level.
And then in the third quarter, that inventory came up a little bit. It's now, at the end of the third quarter, 1.14 million tons. So it went up by roughly 65 -- I'm sorry, around 60,000 tons, and most of that happened in September, and we didn't forecast it. 
And the margins on that inventory were very large, and so it caused us to miss our earnings by about -- our pretax earnings by about $64 million. That was the impact within our forecast. That's equivalent of $0.16 per share. 
So it's -- we view it as not something you would call out because it wasn't like a onetime item that's tied to an operational issue. It's an intercompany accounting thing that happens when you have so much vertical integration. We view the fact that over 20% of our steel is consumed by in-house customers as a strategic advantage that's important to our business.  
And so in the quarter, and then specifically in September, the inventory they required, we had them a little hand to mouth, wasn't enough. And we stepped it up a little in September, and we don't have a way to see that at corporate. 
We have so many businesses that make steel and sell it to the internal customers. There's no way for us to measure that on a timely basis until we close the books at the end of the quarter, and that was what happened."

I'll kick this off, Martin, then I'll turn it to Doug Jellison to give us some more details. Doug's our EVP of raw materials.  
It's something that goes back a very long way at Nucor, and that was a focus many, many years ago to begin to control more of our iron units. And the build-out obviously in Trinidad and then subsequently what we had built in our DRI facility in Louisiana gave us a significant amount of material that we could internally control and offset some of the different irons, whether it's pig iron. 
And certainly, with the DRI we produced, we wanted to balance that approach out. Over the years, we had some challenges as we started up. Those were well documented on many of these calls. 
The performance of the team in Louisiana has been exceptional since their big outage in November or the fourth quarter of '19. Their reliability has come up significantly. 
But Doug, why don't you just speak more specifically about how we look at prime, what that balance is for Nucor and our mix and some of the things that we're looking at moving forward?"

I think I'll start with just putting some -- a little bit of detail around the capabilities that we have. I think sometimes we lose sight of this.  
We have about 4.3 million tons of capacity in our recycling yards, which is primarily obsolete grade. We have what we call the industrial group that controls about a little over 1 million tons of prime scrap a year, which is about a sixfold increase over the last 5 or 6 years, and we can see that continuing to grow in there. 
We have the DRI facilities that we talked about with about 4.5 million tons of capacity. And then all that's tied together with our brokerage group that manages the use of all of that, our national purchases and our international purchases.  
So we have a very robust set of capabilities that we can move and react in many different markets. As we see the growth of our steelmaking capacity, we'll be able to take products and use them at the best place to get the best value for them. So places that might be using DRI now, we may shift them to other places, backfill that with different grades from different sources.  
As far as new technologies, yes, we're looking at things all the time. We're constantly improving our recycling yards to produce a better grade of shred. We're constantly recovering more nonferrous materials and increasing the value that way, and then just a broad scope of new technologies here, around the world, wherever it is. So we're pretty comfortable with where we are and pretty aggressive in what we're doing."

But at the end of the day, and Doug, correct me if I'm wrong, roughly about 25% of our mix in our sheet mills is prime scrap. So it's not a commodity that we're emboldened to at 40%, 50%, 60% of the mix that we need. 
So with what Doug mentioned in the David Joseph Company, we've been building relationships in this market, and it's again a commodity-driven product where we're going to pay what's required. 
But what's the governor? We believe the DRI actually keeps the level set between prime and obsolete grades. But will that increase? Yes, we do think it will increase. But we feel incredibly good and well positioned with what we've done, what we're currently doing in the mix that are in our mills today and what Doug mentioned rationalizing that because we generate the DRI. 
It offsets other uses, but some of the mills that are using DRI today don't need that for the end-use customer requirements. We're going to shift those mixes. 
So again, as we build this new sheet mill, we feel very well positioned to be able to get the mix that we need, to make the grades that we want as we move into the highest applications in automotive and other markets."

And some that we're going to invest in, some we're going to explore further, but we're going to stay very close to making sure that Nucor is on the cutting edge of the steelmaking move to a more sustainable future.

So we're going to continue to look at those as well as continue to look at what are the one standard deviation removed and that expand beyond that give us a differentiated position. 
So the acquisitions of the insulated metal panel building business instantly gave us a market leadership position at nearly half or over half of the insulated panel market today, and that's a growth market. 
As we think about Hannibal in the racking industries, the digital economy and green economy will be built with steel. Those are growing. Those are not under the steel type of cyclicality. The focus on data storage and warehousing cold storage is significant growth as we move forward.  
So you're going to see Nucor continue to focus on those areas. And I can't get into detail, but I would tell you that there are many irons still in the fires for Nucor to continue to grow based on a very deliberate market-driven approach where we believe our culture can bring significantly above our cost of capital returns."

It's firing on all cylinders. It's creating significant demand for distribution centers, warehouses, server storage facilities. We're also seeing manufacturing growth and expansion in plants. And as we probably all read, overall, the U.S. consumer is in a very healthy place.  
When you take that backdrop and then look at our backlogs across our industry-leading breadth of steel products, our quoting activity has been and continues to be very robust across all the steel product groups. And we have very strong backlogs in most of our downstream businesses and, in some cases, all-time record backlogs.

Carlos, maybe I'll kick us off on your latter question around what we're seeing in terms of the market, and then Doug maybe can address your initial question on prime and the other grades. 
Look, there are certain segments within Nucor. Nucor has the widest product offering of any steel company in North America. Our ability to serve end-use markets from automotive, ag, heavy equipment, renewable sectors, the digital economy, the HVAC construction arena provides a unique insight and obviously backdrop to what is happening. 
As Chad mentioned, as we think about half of our products move into the construction arena, the robust demand there, as Chad mentioned, is seen well out into 2022. So we see no slowing there at all. 
If we're seeing some slowness, it's from a -- 2 markets really that I'll touch on. One is automotive. The chip shortages is certainly well documented. It's something that people are very familiar with. But with that come some unique opportunities. 
Obviously, Nucor is not heavily laden in automotive today. We're at 7% to 8% of our overall mix, 1.5 million, 1.6 million tons that move into the automotive markets, and that's going to increase. We want to double that over the next 2 to 3 years. 
And when the chip shortage ends and subsides, the pent-up demand in disposable income by consumers in the United States, I think, is going to be a boom for auto industry, but also for companies like Nucor that continue to supply into that. 
So I think there is going to be some -- or there is some elasticity that we're seeing, but I think it's not demand driven. We see it more from a rebounding in supply chain issues and constraints.
The other is in some of the construction, while again the demand is strong, we're seeing some job sites that are slowing because they're having trouble. Their end customers are getting -- having issues getting their needs from overseas, if they're requiring chemicals or overseas parts and deliveries that are being held up in waterways or finding trucks and getting containers across the ocean. So there are pieces of that, that I think are going to create some softening in that. 
But again, overall, we see the fourth quarter being very robust and, again, potentially eclipsing the Q3 record. We'll wait, obviously, to see the results of that, but we anticipate that it could be as strong or slightly stronger. 
Doug, maybe just touching on this opening question around prime."

So it was really a valuation issue. The value of inventories went up significantly in our portfolio as well as the valuation of receivables. They both went up. 
The selling price per ton, we're still collecting receivables in 30 days essentially and -- but the value of each ton that a customer owed us for went up. And so we used about $1.2 billion between inventory receivables net of payables in cash in Q3. 
So as we think about Q4, we think there could be some margin expansion, but not at the same rate that we achieved in the third quarter. So we think working capital use of cash should be down dramatically. We're not going to forecast a number. There won't be nearly at that $1.2 billion level."

So in order for them to reach their goals, they've got to start with a net zero steel. We believe we have a differentiated value proposition to offer those steels today, unlike any other producer. 
So yes, we're very excited about that. Our market share is growing. And again, part of the new mill's focus is to move and continue up that value chain. 
The mill that's being built there is differentiated. It will not be what we've built in the past. It will provide significant quality in advanced high-strength steel capabilities that match and mirror very, very nicely with the lowest carbon footprint anywhere in the world.

For the galvanizing line in Arkansas, roughly $5 million to $6 million in the fourth quarter. And it's going to start up in the fourth quarter, but there's always carryover expenses because of the -- when the timing of when bills come in.

And so if that happens, Nucor has also provided our commentary and analysis on what a border adjustment tax must include because it is not apples to apples in that steel product.

And again, I can't tell you when 232 will go away at some point, but it is a vehicle to bring other nations to the negotiating table to negotiate a better trade arrangement."
