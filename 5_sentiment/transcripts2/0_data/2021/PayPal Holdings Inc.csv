I'm pleased to report that PayPal just completed the strongest year in our history, achieving record growth in net new active customers, volume, revenue, operating income, earnings and free cash flow. Consumers and businesses of all sizes have embraced a new digital era racing the distinction between online and off-line. A digital-first world is no longer our future. It's our current reality, and it will forever change the way we interact across almost all elements of our lives. At the beginning of the pandemic, consumers and lockdown had no choice but to do all of their shopping online. Today, the vast majority of consumers state that post pandemic, they will continue to shop online at their current elevated levels because it is more convenient, easier and saves time. Retailers are rapidly adapting to a new landscape, adjusting their strategy from encouraging consumers to visit their stores to optimizing for home delivery. The pandemic has accelerated a digital wave of change across almost every industry by 3 to 5 years. Unleashing a profound and permanent structural transformation. Our results in Q4 highlight these strengths. 
In the quarter, we added 16 million net new active customers, including an incremental 1.4 million new merchants. For the year, we delivered a record 73 million net new actives, ending the year with 377 million active accounts, up 24%. We now have over 29 million merchants interacting with nearly 350 million consumers. In 2021, we expect to add another 50 million net new active accounts. 
Equally important, our daily active users remain elevated versus a year ago, up 29% from Q4 of 2019. Our expanding scale and increasing engagement drove a record 4.4 billion transactions in the quarter, up 27%. Our total payment volumes in Q4 were $277 billion, up 36% on an FXN basis. Our TPV, excluding eBay, was up a record 40% percent as we continue to gain market share. eBay TPV grew at 1% and exited the year at just under 6% of our total volume. For the full year, our TPV was up 31% to $936 billion. In Q2 of 2020, our quarterly revenue surpassed $5 billion for the first time. In Q4, we surpassed $6 billion for the first time, with our quarterly revenues growing by 23% to $6.116 billion. 
For the year, our revenues grew by a record 22% on an FX-neutral basis to $21.45 billion. Our non-GAAP EPS grew a record 31% to $3.88, and our free cash flow increased by 48% of to $5 billion. 
Venmo continued its strong performance with Q4 TPV of $47 billion, up 60% year-over-year. Venmo's customer base grew by 32% in 2020, ending just shy of 70 million active accounts. This continued momentum reinforces our conviction that revenues will approach $900 million in 2021. 
In early January, eligible customers were able to cash their stimulus checks within the Venmo app for the first time. Later this month, our Venmo credit card will be available to 100% of our base. And in the coming months, we will launch the ability to buy, hold and sell crypto via the Venmo app. And finally, our revamped Pay with Venmo experience will launch in Q2, offering a best-in-class checkout experience. 
Today's digital reality is rapidly accelerating the need for a digital wallet that encompasses payments, financial services and shopping. This year, our digital wallet will change more than it has ever changed before, significantly increasing its functionality within a single, integrated and beautifully designed app, that should meaningfully increase consumer engagement. In 2020, we made significant progress in expanding the functionality of our PayPal and Venmo wallets. We added the ability to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies, the option to buy now and pay later, direct deposit, check cashing and bill payment capabilities. We introduced Venmo and PayPal QR codes for in-store purchasing as well as our Venmo credit card. This year, we expect to work with our financial industry partners to introduce even more functionality, including budget and savings tools, investment alternatives, including, but not limited to crypto, and enhanced bill pay options. We also intend to fully integrate the entire suite of Honey's shopping tools, including wish lists, price monitoring, deals, coupons and rewards for use in the physical and digital worlds. 
I'm very pleased with the early reception of our PayPal and Venmo QR codes, which are now accepted at over 600,000 retail locations. In 2020, we signed 29 large enterprises, including CVS, Foot Locker, Nike, 5 below, Levi's, Bloomingdale's, Macy's and Uniqlo, and our early in-store results are encouraging. Merchants are experiencing double-digit increases in average basket sizes with consumers who frequently use our QR codes. And we are seeing a 19% increase in TPV from consumers who use our QR codes. 
Across all of our in-store efforts, including QR, tap and pay and cards, we processed over $20 billion of TPV, with almost 10 million consumers using PayPal in store. We also saw an exceptional response from our crypto launch, even with high initial expectations, the volume of crypto traded on our platform greatly exceeded our projections. 
We are excited to build upon this early success by allowing customers to use their crypto balance as a funding source whenever they shop at our 29 million merchants. We anticipate the rollout of that capability to begin late this quarter, and we hope to launch our first international market in the next several months. 
These initial steps are just the beginning of an extensive road map around crypto, blockchain and digital currencies. We are already working with the regulators and central banks to reimagine and shape the next-generation of the financial system as consumers no longer want to handle cash. We all know the current financial system is antiquated. And we can envision a future where transactions are completed in seconds not days, a future where transactions should be less expensive to complete and a future that enables all people to be part of the digital economy, not just the affluent. 
We are significantly investing in our new crypto, blockchain and digital currencies business unit in order to help shape this more inclusive future. 
I would also highlight the rapid growth of our Buy Now Pay Later functionality. We saw tremendous and growing demand throughout the quarter. And witnessed the fastest start to any product we have ever launched. Millions of consumers transacted at hundreds of thousands of merchants in Q4 alone. As with QR codes, we are seeing a meaningful halo effect on overall transactions and TPV, including over $750 million of TPV in our first quarter out of the gate. It's exciting to see that each new service we launch drives incremental increases in our overall consumer lifetime value. Consequently, I would expect that our engagement levels will increase beyond our historic run rates. 
I'm proud to see that the PayPal platform was especially leveraged during the pandemic for philanthropic giving and community support, enabling over $17 billion for charities and those in need. And we also put our $535 million commitment to black and minority-owned businesses and communities into action. We have already invested over 50% of those committed dollars, and we plan to report on their impact as results come in. 
We have entered the next chapter in PayPal's history. The efforts of our employees, along with the investments we have made over the past 5 years, have transformed our technical and compliance infrastructure, enabling rapid product development. We released more products and services in 2020 than in any previous year, and we will step-up that pace in 2021. 
Merchants and consumers are turning to PayPal in record numbers as we accelerate into the digital age. Our opportunities, over the next 5 years, have never been greater. We remain focused on democratizing financial services, assuring that everyone has access and can thrive in the new digital paradigm. We intend to shape that future, and in doing so, become one of the world's leading digital payments, financial services, and commerce platforms. 
I look forward to expanding on this vision during our Investor Day next week. With that, I will turn the call over to John."

I want to start off by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver a record-breaking year. 2020 was pivotal for PayPal and the broader payments industry, marked by rapid acceleration in digitization, cash displacement and e-commerce adoption. These secular trends have been shaping our sector for some time. That said, the rate of change we experienced last year, resulting from the widespread implications of the COVID pandemic, was profound and transformative. Crisis, which has led to hardship and suffering for so many, increased the urgency across our organization to serve our customers in new and innovative ways. Notably, the isolation defined by lockdowns and working from home actually resulted in greater collaboration and brought our teams closer together. 
We've entered 2021 energized by a greater sense of purpose and responsibility and ready to build on our strong momentum. 
Now to our fourth quarter results. Total payment volume grew 36% on a currency-neutral basis. This is the strongest quarterly growth we've reported in history and represents 14 points of acceleration from 2019. The our merchant services volume grew 40%, another record for PayPal, accelerating each quarter in 2020. Volume contribution from eBay Marketplaces continued to decline. We exited December with eBay representing less than 6% of our overall volume. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 23% on both a spot and currency-neutral basis to $6.1 billion. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, U.S. revenue grew 18%, and international revenue grew 29% as the U.S. has a greater proportion of revenue from credit édit and the travel and events verticals. Transaction revenue grew 25%, representing 8 points of acceleration from last year on a spot basis. This growth was primarily driven by strength across our core PayPal business, including strong cross border activity. 
Our core payments platform continues to deliver exceptional growth, with transaction revenue, excluding revenue from eBay, growing 30% in the fourth quarter, also an acceleration of 8 basis points from 2019. 
Other value-added services revenue increased 1% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting incremental Honey revenue, offset by lower interest income on customer balances and less credit revenue. Honey contributed approximately 1.7 points of growth to total revenue and approximately 20 points of growth to other value-added services revenue. In the fourth quarter, transaction take rate was 2.05%, and total take rate was 2.21%. The 22 basis point decline in transaction take rate resulted primarily from changes in volume mix with eBay's contribution continuing to decline, bill payment and P2P volumes accelerating and a reduction of $97 million in international transaction revenue from foreign currency hedges. The 28 basis point decline in total take rate resulted from these factors as well as lower value-added services revenue. 
In the fourth quarter, our volume-based expense performance was exceptional. These expenses delivered 216 basis points of leverage in the quarter, increasing 18% to $2.7 billion. Transaction expense improved 12 basis points as a rate of TPV to 84 basis points, driven by both volume mix and funding mix. Transaction losses improved 5 basis points to a record low rate of 10 basis points. Credit losses were 3 basis points as a rate of TPV. 
Our credit loss reserve coverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 23%, decreasing slightly from the third quarter. The combination of strong revenue and volume-based expense performance resulted in transaction margin dollars increasing 28% to $3.4 billion. In the fourth quarter, we generated incremental transaction margin dollars of $753 million, more than 2x the incremental contribution last year. 
Nontransaction related expenses grew 28%, reflecting increased investments in our key strategic priorities as well as growth related to our acquisitions. This higher level of investment contributed to a 56% increase in sales and marketing expenses and a 27% increase in technology and development spending in the quarter. Leverage across customer support and operations and general and administrative expenses partially offset this increased level of investment. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income in the fourth quarter grew 29% to $1.5 billion. Our operating margin was 24.7%, expanding more than 100 basis points and representing our strongest performance for any fourth quarter. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver operating efficiencies and scale our platform at low incremental cost, while investing in our strategic growth priorities. Non-GAAP other income declined by $62 million relative to last year, driven by reduced interest income from lower interest rates and higher interest expense from our debt issuance last May. The negative impact on non-GAAP EPS from the decline in other income was offset by a lower effective tax rate. 
For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP EPS grew 29% to $1.08. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.2 billion. In addition, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, representing 50% growth from fourth quarter last year. 
I'd now like to discuss our guidance for the full year and the first quarter. We've just completed the strongest year in our history, achieving record growth in net new accounts, volume, revenue, operating income, earnings and free cash flow. We delivered these results while absorbing meaningful macroeconomic headwinds affecting our credit business, the revenue and income effects of lower interest rates, idiosyncratic pressure on the travel and events verticals and the initial step down of volumes from eBay post operating agreement. These headwinds persist as we move into 2021, and yet, our core business continues to perform at unprecedented levels. Our addressable opportunity has never been more expansive, and we're confident we've never been better positioned to capture the benefits of this accelerated secular growth. 
We believe the effects of the pandemic on consumer behavior and business transformation are enduring and sustainable. We also expect e-commerce to drive continued strong payment volume and transaction growth globally. While it appears that additional stimulus measures will support the path toward a more sustained economic recovery, the backdrop continues to evolve and much remains uncertain. And as we've commented on several occasions over the past 9 months, we're focused on balancing transparency with certainty as we develop our outlook. It's with these considerations that we're providing our full year guidance, which is our best estimate at this time. 
For the full year, our plans contemplate TPV growth in the high 20% range. We expect to generate revenue of approximately $25.5 billion, representing growth of approximately 19% based on current spot rates. Included in our guidance is a headwind to revenue growth of approximately 400 basis points from eBay's managed payments transition. In addition, our current forecast contemplates an approximate 200 basis point impact from foreign currency translation as the U.S. dollar has weakened relative to 2020. 
As we've discussed previously, in 2021, we will absorb the greatest revenue impact from the loss of volumes from eBay. In the face of this pressure, we're pleased to be guiding spot revenue growth at 19%. Equally important, once we are beyond the eBay transition, we expect our rates of growth for total payment volume, revenue and earnings to accelerate. 
In 2021, we also expect to deliver approximately 17% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. This earnings guidance contemplates ongoing elevated levels of organic investment. We believe the structural tailwinds for PayPal have never been stronger. To fully realize these opportunities, strengthen our competitive positioning and advance our leadership in digital payments, sustained investment in our business is critical. Cost discipline, together with our ability to efficiently scale our payments platform, will allow us to generate modest operating margin expansion in 2021. In addition, we anticipate that below the line factors, namely higher interest expense and a higher tax rate in 2021 relative to 2020, will offset much of this margin expansion. 
For the full year, we expect to generate approximately $6 billion in free cash flow. 
Before I discuss our Q1 guidance, I'd like to contextualize how to think about the trajectory of our revenue and earnings performance for the year. This year, there are several dynamics that we believe will contribute to more variability in our year-over-year growth rates from quarter-to-quarter than our historic trends. These include lapping our 2020 performance, this year's cadence of planned investments and product introductions, the roll-off of eBay volumes and our timing expectations related to the recovery of travel and events volumes and of a more normalized growth in our credit portfolio. 
Underlying our guidance for 19% revenue growth on a spot basis is our expectation that we will report our highest rate of revenue growth for the year in the first quarter, followed by relatively stable, but more moderate growth in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021. Our full year earnings guidance of 17% growth also contemplates delivering the highest rate of growth in Q1. 
In the second quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings to be relatively flat year-over-year, primarily due to the outsized EPS growth we experienced in Q2 last year, which exceeded 49% as well as the expected timing of our investment spend. Then, in the back half of 2021, we expect a meaningful and sequential reacceleration in earnings growth. Importantly, throughout the year, we expect the absolute dollar performance of our business to be very strong. 
As we move through the year, we'll keep you updated on how we're tracking relative to this expected cadence. 
Consistent with my earlier comments, in the first quarter, we expect revenue growth of approximately 28% on a spot basis, with non-GAAP earnings growth of approximately 50%. 
In summary, last year was a year like no other. But in all of the turmoil and difficulty that people encountered, one thing was clear in our business. PayPal has never been more relevant and needed than we are right now. Our industry, our company is moving forward. The next 5 years will be very different than the last 5, and we're striving to shape that outcome, that future, a future where e-commerce and digital payments are not just a fallback when one can't make it to a fiscal store or don't want to handle cash, but instead a necessity, a necessity that is sought out as the preferred way for people to transact every single day. It's a future where I expect that our scale, our brand of trust and security and our leading solutions for merchants and consumers alike, will allow us to continue to create immense value for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

And honestly, all of them surpassed our internal projections, and they all are creating a halo impact that is really pleasing to see. I talked about kind of QR having a 19% halo effect. 
Crypto, started off with a bang to go. But in a surprise winner, if I had the envelope, I would talk about by Now Pay Later, honestly, as surprising me most to the upside. I -- since I've been here, I've never seen a product launch with that kind of scale so quickly. I mean, we talked about moving into the U.S. in October, we announced. And we had almost 3 million customers using Buy Now Pay Later at hundreds of thousands of merchants. By the way, that's not the total number of transaction. We already saw in the quarter a 40% repeat rate on that as well. And so it's not just that you add customers in it, I mean, they're just voting with their feet and moving forward. And we think that we have a value proposition that is second to none out there. 
First of all, we've got 350 million customers that we can bring that trust PayPal. We know them. And so our approval rates are higher than, we think, than anybody else out there when people sign up for Buy Now Pay Later. Second?"

And in 2020, we put out more products and services than we've ever put out before. I said in my remarks that we're going to step-up that pace in 2021, and we're going to go do that. When I look at all the investment we've made over the past 5-plus years in our tech infrastructure, in our compliance and risk management, what that's enabled us to do now is pretty radically accelerate the amount of software releases that we have. 
We put out last year between config releases and software releases some 60,000 releases. That was up 30% year-over-year at the time that we're all working from home. So our productivity has gone way up. Our developer toolkits are much improved. They're using modern programming language. We have a service-oriented architecture. And by the way, all that's happening, while the number of bugs has gone down 25% in all of our releases from 2019 levels. 
And so I'm really happy with the pace of organic innovation and our ability to deliver products, and that takes away a lot of our need to do acquisition. I would just build on John's point. We obviously have a strong balance sheet, strong cash flow. We will be acquisitive going forward. But we're going to look at that, as John said, in a very disciplined manner. We're going to look at talent, type of acquisitions, where can we do may be a smaller acquisition to bring in great talent in a particular area. We'll look at geographic type of acquisitions where we may want to go after a geography, and there may be a player or 2 there that could help us leapfrog into that market, and we'll look at that carefully. 
And if there's a real capability that -- not that we can't develop and do, but it's going to take us too long to get there because of what we're trying to do on our road map, then we would take a look at that as well. Those are kind of the basic areas, I would say. So I think we've got a good 1, 2 punch between what we can do internally and what we can do from an inorganic perspective."

And just looking off of last year, if you could walk us through the different drivers, whether it's geography or products, giving you the confidence in adding 50 million net new actives in '21 versus the prepandemic $35 million or so levels would be great?"

Yes, Darrin, I think when we look at the cohort of net new actives from last year, it's clearly incremental people coming on. The -- over 50 demographic, 50 years old demographic, one of our strongest growth vectors that we've had. So you're really s",395,"Yes. Yes, Darrin, I think when we look at the cohort of net new actives from last year, it's clearly incremental people coming on. The -- over 50 demographic, 50 years old demographic, one of our strongest growth vectors that we've had. So you're really seeing new demographics come onto the platform. But what's really interesting to me is the engagement metrics of that cohort are also up substantially. We have double-digit increases in value for net new active. Our 90-day engagement rates are up 13% plus over traditional cohorts. 
If you look at a normalized transaction for active spend, is this kind of gets a little bit lost because we're including Honey net new actives in the denominator. And we also, as you said, we put on 72.7 million net new access last year. If you normalize that for 37 million that we would put on on a typical year is when you put somebody onto the platform, they don't have all the transactions because they all didn't come in on January 1, they come in throughout the year. And so that puts pressure on it. But our TPA, which is a real measure of engagement, normalized basis would have grown 11.5%, like that's above any trend line that we have up to about 45.1x a year. And so our churn rates, in general, because of that, are coming down. And when you have a base as big as ours right now, it is as much, maybe even more about the churn rate than it is the new ads coming in. There is plenty of demand to come on to our platform. But when we see churn reduction like we're seeing right now because of increased engagement, and that increased engagement is coming because people are just moving online and because we have these new products that are out right now that people are just using a ton of more like crypto is a great example. Everyone who sign on crypto is opening up their wallet app, 2x the level of what they did previous. 
And so I think that 50 million is a real good guide right now. We'll obviously update as we go on. But we're seeing a lot of really encouraging trends in the underlying cohorts that we're bringing on, which gives a lot of confidence to that 50 million number."

So let me just -- I'll take them in reverse order. We still are seeing elevated levels of debit, and that's consistent with what others have said across the ecosystem, though not at the levels that we saw in 2Q and likely driven by the impact of stimulus measures at that point in time. 
Braintree continues to perform very well for us, but it really suffers the brunt of the impact from the travel and events vertical, which was down 50%, 5-0%, for us. And so that's -- it's a pretty meaningful impact when you consider that, that's in excess of 10% of our volume. But when you look at the areas of leverage for our business. So I think we'll continue to see strong core PayPal trends of PayPal volume. And those tend to come at a higher transaction margin. By the same time, we've seen record performance in transaction expense and transaction losses. And those -- transaction expense will be impacted more by the mixes in our business, but we expect those will be below the levels that we entered this pandemic with, and we expect transaction losses to stay at these levels. We're performing very well there. 
But as you think about the remainder of our income statement, if you will, and all the other sort of non-volume-related expenses, we've invested a lot, obviously, in the back half of last year, and our guidance assumes that as well. But we also demonstrate the ability for our business to scale very efficiently. 
And so if you just -- we don't give expense guidance for the year, but you can back into it based upon our revenue and earnings growth. And that expense growth that we're assuming in 2021, about 75% of that is related to investments we're making in the business, discretionary go-to-market initiatives, all of the things we're doing to help accelerate or continue these trends. And so that leaves the remainder 25%, which is really just demonstrating the scalability of our model. And I'll end my question with one data point that, I think, is reflective of how successful that model is. And so you know, David, I often talk about the incremental margins in our business. And -- meaning -- so for every dollar of revenue that we brought in, in the quarter, what was the profitability related to that? And in the fourth quarter, the organic incremental operating margin was 32% for PayPal. So for every new dollar of revenue we're bringing in, it's got a higher-margin on it than what the rest of the business does. That's a model that we find very appealing and one that we want to continue to keep our foot on the gas on. And that's why that, even in a year like 2021, when we have meaningful investment in our business, we can still, at least, guide to a point where we're expecting modest operating margin expansion."

Some of the trends that we're seeing that Dan talked about in his prepared remarks, they're definitely sustainable. And there's this movement to digitization and the pull forward of e-commerce that certainly stands to benefit us and others in this space. But we provided sort of an approximate number, right? We said approximately 19%. There's not a range around it, like we normally do because, quite frankly, that range would be somewhat artificial or arbitrary. It's -- there are a wide range of outcomes that could happen. But we feel pretty good about what we see in the business. And I think it's important to note that we are a pretty diversified portfolio of products. And so we're not just reliant on one thing. And I'll give one example before I close my answer, but the travel of [indiscernible]. So I mentioned that in an earlier answer, like our baseline assumption on that 19% revenue growth is that as the -- as people begin receiving vaccines, there's pent-up demand for travel. People want to take that summer vacation in 2020 that they missed. 
And so we're assuming that we start to see a rebound in travel and events in the second quarter. And that certainly stands to benefit the Braintree side of our business. The channel things aren't, if that's not the case, then likely there's been other concerns that result in people sort of lacking mobility that still stands to benefit us on the core PayPal business. So it's -- I know it's 11 months out that we're projecting here. But as we've moved through this, we've gotten more confident with some of the trends that we're seeing and feel really good about that guide."

And that, obviously, gives us a very strong legal foundation for the business we have there and for the business that we intend to drive. Very recently, Deputy Governor Pon from the [indiscernible] an article in the financial times that was really kind of this clear statement of China's commitment to trying to strike the right balance between innovation along with prudent regulation. And that plays right into what we want to do inside the market. We really want to work with the regulators there on both of those objectives and assure that we've got both safe and secure digital commerce. And we really have 3 goals over the next couple of years in China. 
So first, obviously, is to make sure we invest to have the right compliant infrastructure inside China. The second is to really leverage all of our cross-border expertise, and that goes in 2 directions. First, we want to significantly increase the amount of cross-border that Chinese merchants can get from the 350 million consumers we have outside of China. And we also want to work inside China that Chinese consumers purchase from the 29 million merchants that we have outside of China. 
Both of those are already growing elements, and we think that those can grow quite nicely in the years to come, and it really plays into our strengths. The third thing, though, is that we do want to work within the ecosystem inside of China with companies like China UnionPay, with the banks there, with the tech platform companies there as well to drive new types of payment services or incremental payment services inside the domestic market, like that could be payouts could be some unbranded full stack processing. It could be QR codes. For instance, I'll just give you an example. China is holding the Olympics in the next couple of years. There's going to be a tremendous amount of visitors going into China. And we want our QR codes to be deployed so that people coming in to China don't necessarily have to download Wechat Pay or Aant. They can use their PayPal wallet inside China to make purchases at merchants. And I think there's a lot of ways that we can leverage our strength, the strength of our partners inside China and our strong regulatory relationship that we have right now to both grow cross-border and then to start to slowly, but surely add incremental services into the domestic market as well."

If you normalize for Honey and all the incremental net new actives that we brought in that are bending our traditional curves. We've never really been above 9% or 10%. Normalized, we're at about 11.5% of growth. Our churn rates are down. All of the new functionality that we've put into place, whether that be crypto or that Buy Now Pay Later, the Venmo card, QR codes are adding to usage. They're adding incremental TPV, they're adding incremental transactions. Once that I didn't mention is that people who use a PayPal product in-store. And again, these are early days on this, but those that are using it in-store, we're seeing, Dan, 54 incremental transactions that are just in-store, that don't displace the online. It's just -- it's basically doubling the number of transactions we have. And so as we start to build out our digital wallet really into the super app, that transcends across payments, commerce and financial services, all of that on a common platform, all of that leveraging common data elements and machine learning on top of that to give next best recommendations. I think we are going to see, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, a real bend in the historic rate of engagement.

I'm pleased to report that PayPal just completed the strongest year in our history, achieving record growth in net new active customers, volume, revenue, operating income, earnings and free cash flow. Consumers and businesses of all sizes have embraced a new digital erasing the distinction between online and off-line.
A digital-first world is no longer our future. It's our current reality, and it will forever change the way we interact across almost all elements of our lives.
At the beginning of the pandemic, consumers and lockdown had no choice but to do all of their shopping online. Today, the vast majority of consumers state that post pandemic, they will continue to shop online at their current elevated levels because it is more convenient, easier and saves time. Retailers are rapidly adapting to a new landscape, adjusting their strategy from encouraging consumers to visit their stores to optimizing for home delivery. The pandemic has accelerated a digital wave of change across almost every industry by 3 to 5 years, unleashing a profound and permanent structural transformation. Our results in Q4 highlight these strengths. 
In the quarter, we added 16 million net new active customers, including an incremental 1.4 million new merchants. For the year, we delivered a record 73 million net new actives, ending the year with 377 million active accounts, up 24%. We now have over 29 million merchants interacting with nearly 350 million consumers. In 2021, we expect to add another 50 million net new active accounts. 
Equally important, our daily active users remain elevated versus a year ago, up 29% from Q4 of 2019. Our expanding scale and increasing engagement drove a record 4.4 billion transactions in the quarter, up 27%. Our total payment volumes in Q4 were $277 billion, up 36% on an FXN basis.
Our TPV, excluding eBay, was up a record 40% percent as we continue to gain market share. eBay TPV grew at 1% and exited the year at just under 6% of our total volume. For the full year, our TPV was up 31% to $936 billion. In Q2 of 2020, our quarterly revenue surpassed $5 billion for the first time. In Q4, we surpassed $6 billion for the first time, with our quarterly revenues growing by 23% to $6.116 billion. 
For the year, our revenues grew by a record 22% on an FX-neutral basis to $21.45 billion. Our non-GAAP EPS grew a record 31% to $3.88, and our free cash flow increased by 48% of to $5 billion. 
Venmo continued its strong performance with Q4 TPV of $47 billion, up 60% year-over-year. Venmo's customer base grew by 32% in 2020, ending just shy of 70 million active accounts. This continued momentum reinforces our conviction that revenues will approach $900 million in 2021. 
In early January, eligible customers were able to cash their stimulus checks within the Venmo app for the first time. Later in this month, our Venmo credit card will be available to 100% of our base. And in the coming months, we will launch the ability to buy, hold and sell crypto via the Venmo app. And finally, our revamped Pay with Venmo experience will launch in Q2, offering a best-in-class checkout experience. 
Today's digital reality is rapidly accelerating the need for a digital wallet that encompasses payments, financial services and shopping. This year, our digital wallet will change more than it has ever changed before, significantly increasing its functionality within a single, integrated and beautifully designed app, that should meaningfully increase consumer engagement.
In 2020, we made significant progress in expanding the functionality of our PayPal and Venmo wallets. We added the ability to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies, the option to buy now and pay later, direct deposit, check cashing and bill payment capabilities. We introduced Venmo and PayPal QR codes for in-store purchasing as well as our Venmo credit card. This year, we expect to work with our financial industry partners to introduce even more functionality, including budget and savings tools, investment alternatives, including, but not limited to crypto, and enhanced bill pay options.
We also intend to fully integrate the entire suite of Honey's shopping tools, including wish lists, price monitoring, deals, coupons and rewards for use in the physical and digital worlds. 
I'm very pleased with the early reception of our PayPal and Venmo QR codes, which are now accepted at over 600,000 retail locations. In 2020, we signed 29 large enterprises, including CVS, Foot Locker, Nike, Five Below, Levi's, Bloomingdales, Macy's and Uniqlo, and our early in-store results are encouraging. Merchants are experiencing double-digit increases in average basket sizes with consumers who frequently use our QR codes. And we are seeing a 19% increase in TPV from consumers who use our QR codes. 
Across all of our in-store efforts, including QR, tap and pay and cards, we processed over $20; billion of TPV, with almost 10 million consumers using PayPal in store. We's also saw an exceptional response from our crypto launch. Even with high initial expectations, the volume of crypto traded on our platform greatly exceeded our projections. 
We are excited to build upon this early success by allowing customers to use their crypto balance as a funding source whenever they shop at our 29 million merchants. We anticipate the rollout of that capability to begin late this quarter, and we hope to launch our first international market in the next several months. 
These initial steps are just the beginning of an extensive road map around crypto, blockchain and digital currencies. We are already working with the regulators and central banks to reimagine and shape the next-generation of the financial system, as consumers no longer want to handle cash. We all know the current financial system is antiquated. And we can envision a future where transactions are completed in seconds not days, a future where transactions should be less expensive to complete and a future that enables all people to be part of the digital economy, not just the affluent. 
We are significantly investing in our new crypto, blockchain and digital currencies business unit in order to help shape this more inclusive future. 
I would also highlight the rapid growth of our buy now, pay later functionality. We saw tremendous and growing demand throughout the quarter and witnessed the fastest start to any product we have ever launched. Millions of consumers transacted at hundreds of thousands of merchants in Q4 alone. As with QR codes, we are seeing a meaningful halo effect on overall transactions and TPV, including over $750 million of TPV in our first quarter out of the gate.
It's exciting to see that each new service we launch drives incremental increases in our overall consumer lifetime value. Consequently, I would expect that our engagement levels will increase beyond our historic run rates. 
I'm proud to see that the PayPal platform was especially leveraged during the pandemic for philanthropic giving and community support, enabling over $17 billion for charities and those in need. And we also put our $535 million commitment to black and minority-owned businesses and communities into action. We have already invested over 50% of those committed dollars, and we plan to report on their impact as results come in. 
We have entered the next chapter in PayPal's history. The efforts of our employees, along with the investments we have made over the past 5 years, have transformed our technical and compliance infrastructure, enabling rapid product development. We released more products and services in 2020 than in any previous year, and we will step-up that pace in 2021. 
Merchants and consumers are turning to PayPal in record numbers as we accelerate into the digital age. Our opportunities, over the next 5 years, have never been greater. We remain focused on democratizing financial services, assuring that everyone has access and can thrive in the new digital paradigm. We intend to shape that future, and in doing so, become one of the world's leading digital payments, financial services, and commerce platforms. 
I look forward to expanding on this vision during our Investor Day next week. With that, I will turn the call over to John."

Notably, the isolation defined by lockdowns and working from home actually resulted in greater collaboration and brought our teams closer together. 
We've entered 2021 energized by a greater sense of purpose and responsibility and ready to build on our strong momentum. 
Now to our fourth quarter results. Total payment volume grew 36% on a currency-neutral basis. This is the strongest quarterly growth we've reported in history and represents 14 points of acceleration from 2019. The our merchant services volume grew 40%, another record for PayPal, accelerating each quarter in 2020. Volume contribution from eBay Marketplaces continued to decline. We exited December with eBay representing less than 6% of our overall volume. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 23% on both a spot and currency-neutral basis to $6.1 billion. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, U.S. revenue grew 18%, and international revenue grew 29% as the U.S. has a greater proportion of revenue from credit and the travel and events verticals. Transaction revenue grew 25%, representing 8 points of acceleration from last year on a spot basis. This growth was primarily driven by strength across our core PayPal business, including strong cross border activity. 
Our core payments platform continues to deliver exceptional growth, with transaction revenue, excluding revenue from eBay, growing 30% in the fourth quarter, also an acceleration of 8 basis points from 2019. 
Other value-added services revenue increased 1% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting incremental Honey revenue, offset by lower interest income on customer balances and less credit revenue. Honey contributed approximately 1.7 points of growth to total revenue and approximately 20 points of growth to other value-added services revenue.
In the fourth quarter, transaction take rate was 2.05%, and total take rate was 2.21%. The 22 basis point decline in transaction take rate resulted primarily from changes in volume mix with eBay's contribution continuing to decline, bill payment and P2P volumes accelerating and a reduction of $97 million in international transaction revenue from foreign currency hedges. The 28 basis point decline in total take rate resulted from these factors as well as lower value-added services revenue. 
In the fourth quarter, our volume-based expense performance was exceptional. These expenses delivered 216 basis points of leverage in the quarter, increasing 18% to $2.7 billion. Transaction expense improved 12 basis points as a rate of TPV to 84 basis points, driven by both volume mix and funding mix. Transaction losses improved 5 basis points to a record low rate of 10 basis points. Credit losses were 3 basis points as a rate of TPV. 
Our credit loss reserve coverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 23%, decreasing slightly from the third quarter. The combination of strong revenue and volume-based expense performance resulted in transaction margin dollars increasing 28% to $3.4 billion. In the fourth quarter, we generated incremental transaction margin dollars of $753 million, more than 2x the incremental contribution last year. 
Nontransaction related expenses grew 28%, reflecting increased investments in our key strategic priorities as well as growth related to our acquisitions. This higher level of investment contributed to a 56% increase in sales and marketing expenses and a 27% increase in technology and development spending in the quarter. Leverage across customer support and operations and general and administrative expenses partially offset this increased level of investment. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income in the fourth quarter grew 29% to $1.5 billion. Our operating margin was 24.7%, expanding more than 100 basis points and representing our strongest performance for any fourth quarter. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver operating efficiencies and scale our platform at low incremental cost, while investing in our strategic growth priorities.
Non-GAAP other income declined by $62 million relative to last year, driven by reduced interest income from lower interest rates and higher interest expense from our debt issuance last May. The negative impact on non-GAAP EPS from the decline in other income was offset by a lower effective tax rate. 
For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP EPS grew 29% to $1.08. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.2 billion. In addition, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, representing 50% growth from fourth quarter last year. 
I'd now like to discuss our guidance for the full year and the first quarter. We've just completed the strongest year in our history, achieving record growth in net new accounts, volume, revenue, operating income, earnings and free cash flow. We delivered these results while absorbing meaningful macroeconomic headwinds affecting our credit business, the revenue and income effects of lower interest rates, idiosyncratic pressure on the travel and events verticals and the initial step down of volumes from eBay post operating agreement.
These headwinds persist as we move into 2021, and yet, our core business continues to perform at unprecedented levels. Our addressable opportunity has never been more expansive, and we're confident we've never been better positioned to capture the benefits of this accelerated secular growth. 
We believe the effects of the pandemic on consumer behavior and business transformation are enduring and sustainable. We also expect e-commerce to drive continued strong payment volume and transaction growth globally. While it appears that additional stimulus measures will support the path toward a more sustained economic recovery, the backdrop continues to evolve and much remains uncertain. And as we've commented on several occasions over the past 9 months, we're focused on balancing transparency with certainty as we develop our outlook. It's with these considerations that we're providing our full year guidance, which is our best estimate at this time. 
For the full year, our plans contemplate TPV growth in the high 20% range. We expect to generate revenue of approximately $25.5 billion, representing growth of approximately 19% based on current spot rates. Included in our guidance is a headwind to revenue growth of approximately 400 basis points from eBay's managed payments transition. In addition, our current forecast contemplates an approximate 200 basis point impact from foreign currency translation as the U.S. dollar has weakened relative to 2020. 
As we've discussed previously, in 2021, we will absorb the greatest revenue impact from the loss of volumes from eBay. In the face of this pressure, we're pleased to be guiding spot revenue growth at 19%. Equally important, once we are beyond the eBay transition, we expect our rates of growth for total payment volume, revenue and earnings to accelerate. 
In 2021, we also expect to deliver approximately 17% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. This earnings guidance contemplates ongoing elevated levels of organic investment. We believe the structural tailwinds for PayPal have never been stronger. To fully realize these opportunities, strengthen our competitive positioning and advance our leadership in digital payments, sustained investment in our business is critical.
Cost discipline, together with our ability to efficiently scale our payments platform, will allow us to generate modest operating margin expansion in 2021. In addition, we anticipate that below the line factors, namely higher interest expense and a higher tax rate in 2021 relative to 2020, will offset much of this margin expansion. For the full year, we expect to generate approximately $6 billion in free cash flow. 
Before I discuss our Q1 guidance, I'd like to contextualize how to think about the trajectory of our revenue and earnings performance for the year. This year, there are several dynamics that we believe will contribute to more variability in our year-over-year growth rates from quarter-to-quarter than our historic trends. These include lapping our 2020 performance, this year's cadence of planned investments and product introductions, the roll off of eBay volumes and our timing expectations related to the recovery of travel and events volumes and of a more normalized growth in our credit portfolio. 
Underlying our guidance for 19% revenue growth on a spot basis is our expectation that we will report our highest rate of revenue growth for the year in the first quarter, followed by relatively stable, but more moderate growth in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021. Our full year earnings guidance of 17% growth also contemplates delivering the highest rate of growth in Q1. 
In the second quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings to be relatively flat year-over-year, primarily due to the outsized EPS growth we experienced in Q2 last year, which exceeded 49% as well as the expected timing of our investment spend. Then, in the back half of 2021, we expect a meaningful and sequential reacceleration in earnings growth. Importantly, throughout the year, we expect the absolute dollar performance of our business to be very strong. 
As we move through the year, we'll keep you updated on how we're tracking relative to this expected cadence. 
Consistent with my earlier comments, in the first quarter, we expect revenue growth of approximately 28% on a spot basis, with non-GAAP earnings growth of approximately 50%. 
In summary, last year was a year like no other. But in all of the turmoil and difficulty that people encountered, one thing was clear in our business. PayPal has never been more relevant and needed than we are right now. Our industry, our company is moving forward.
The next 5 years will be very different than the last 5, and we're striving to shape that outcome, that future, a future where e-commerce and digital payments are not just a fallback when one can't make it to a physical store or don't want to handle cash, but instead a necessity, a necessity that is sought out as the preferred way for people to transact every single day. It's a future where I expect that our scale, our brand of trust and security and our leading solutions for merchants and consumers alike, will allow us to continue to create immense value for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

With respect to offsetting the headwind from eBay, the fact that we're expanding or better said that our projected guidance suggests that we're expanding our operating margins would certainly indicate that we think between the momentum in the business and the additional initiatives combined that we can offset the pressure related to eBay.
Certainly, the initiatives, all initiatives, taking a while to ramp up. The bulk of our new initiatives are really -- we would expect the financial impact to be in the second half of the year. But when you combine that with the momentum in the business, it certainly allows us to offset that headwind."

And honestly, all of them surpassed our internal projections, and they all are creating a halo impact that is really pleasing to see. I talked about kind of QR having a 19% halo effect. 
Crypto started off with a bang and just kept going and is continuing to go. But in a surprise winner, if I had the envelope, I would talk about buy now, pay later, honestly, as surprising me most to the upside. I -- since I've been here, I've never seen a product launch with that kind of scale so quickly. I mean, we talked about moving into the U.S. in October, we announced. And we had almost 3 million customers using buy now, pay later at hundreds of thousands of merchants. By the way, that's not the total number of transaction. We already saw in the quarter a 40% repeat rate on that as well. And so it's not just that you add customers in it, I mean, they're just voting with their feet and moving forward. And we think that we have a value proposition that is second to none out there.

And in 2020, we put out more products and services than we've ever put out before. I said in my remarks that we're going to step-up that pace in 2021, and we're going to go do that. When I look at all the investment we've made over the past 5-plus years in our tech infrastructure, in our compliance and risk management, what that's enabled us to do now is pretty radically accelerate the amount of software releases that we have. 
We put out last year between config releases and software releases some 60,000 releases. That was up 30% year-over-year at the time that we're all working from home. So our productivity has gone way up. Our developer toolkits are much improved. They're using modern programming language. We have a service-oriented architecture. And by the way, all that's happening, while the number of bugs has gone down 25% in all of our releases from 2019 levels. 
And so I'm really happy with the pace of organic innovation and our ability to deliver products, and that takes away a lot of our need to do acquisition.
I would just build on John's point. We obviously have a strong balance sheet, strong cash flow. We will be acquisitive going forward. But we're going to look at that, as John said, in a very disciplined manner. We're going to look at talent, type of acquisitions, working to do maybe a smaller acquisition to bring in great talent in a particular area. We'll look at geographic types of acquisitions where we may want to go after a geography, and there may be a player or 2 there that could help us leapfrog into that market, and we'll look at that carefully. 
And if there's a real capability that -- not that we can't develop and do, but it's going to take us too long to get there because of what we're trying to do on our road map, then we would take a look at that as well. Those are kind of the basic areas, I would say. So I think we've got a good 1, 2 punch between what we can do internally and what we can do from an inorganic perspective."

Does that -- I guess, first, does that underscore the incremental adds, your confidence that the incremental adds in 2020 will really not pull forward, but they're just new demographics. And just looking off of last year, if you could walk us through the different drivers, whether it's geography or products, giving you the confidence in adding 50 million net new actives in '21 versus the prepandemic 35 million or so levels would be great?"

Yes, Darrin, I think when we look at the cohort of net new actives from last year, it's clearly incremental people coming on.

Yes, Darrin, I think when we look at the cohort of net new actives from last year, it's clearly incremental people coming on. The -- over 50 demographic, 50 years old demographic, one of our strongest growth vectors that we've had. So you're really seeing new demographics come onto the platform. But what's really interesting to me is the engagement metrics of that cohort are also up substantially. We have double-digit increases in value for net new actives. Our 90-day engagement rates are up 13% plus over traditional cohorts. 
If you look at a normalized transaction for active spend, is this kind of gets a little bit lost because we're including Honey net new actives in the denominator. And we also, as you said, we put on 72.7 million net new actives last year. If you normalize that for 37 million that we would put on on a typical year because when you put somebody onto the platform, they don't have all the transactions because they all didn't come in on January 1, they come in throughout the year. And so that puts pressure on it.
But our TPA, which is a real measure of engagement, normalized basis would have grown 11.5%, like that's above any trend line that we have up to about 45.1x a year. And so our churn rates, in general, because of that, are coming down. And when you have a base as big as ours right now, it is as much, maybe even more about the churn rate than it is the new ads coming in. There is plenty of demand to come on to our platform.
But when we see churn reduction like we're seeing right now because of increased engagement, and that increased engagement is coming because people are just moving online and because we have these new products that are out right now that people are just using a ton of more like crypto is a great example. Everyone who is signed on crypto is opening up their wallet app, 2x the level of what they did previous. 
And so I think that 50 million is a real good guide right now. We'll obviously update as we go on. But we're seeing a lot of really encouraging trends in the underlying cohorts that we're bringing on, which gives a lot of confidence to that 50 million number."

So let me just -- I'll take them in reverse order. We still are seeing elevated levels of debit, and that's consistent with what others have said across the ecosystem, though not at the levels that we saw in 2Q and likely driven by the impact of stimulus measures at that point in time. 
Braintree continues to perform very well for us, but it really suffers the brunt of the impact from the travel and events vertical, which was down 50%, 5-0 percent, for us. And so that's -- it's a pretty meaningful impact when you consider that, that's in excess of 10% of our volume.
But when you look at the areas of leverage for our business, so I think we'll continue to see strong core PayPal trends of PayPal volume. And those tend to come at a higher transaction margin.
By the same time, we've seen record performance in transaction expense and transaction losses. And those -- transaction expense will be impacted more by the mixes in our business, but we expect those will be below the levels that we entered this pandemic with, and we expect transaction losses to stay at these levels. We're performing very well there. 
But as you think about the remainder of our income statement, if you will, and all the other sort of non-volume-related expenses, we've invested a lot, obviously, in the back half of last year, and our guidance assumes that as well. But we also demonstrate the ability for our business to scale very efficiently. 
And so if you just -- we don't give expense guidance for the year, but you can back into it based upon our revenue and earnings growth. And that expense growth that we're assuming in 2021, about 75% of that is related to investments we're making in the business, discretionary go-to-market initiatives, all of the things we're doing to help accelerate or continue these trends. And so that leaves the remainder 25%, which is really just demonstrating the scalability of our model.
And I'll end my question with one data point that, I think, is reflective of how successful that model is. And so you know, David, I often talk about the incremental margins in our business. And -- meaning -- so for every dollar of revenue that we brought in, in the quarter, what was the profitability related to that? And in the fourth quarter, the organic incremental operating margin was 32% for PayPal. So for every new dollar of revenue we're bringing in, it's got a higher-margin on it than what the rest of the business does.
That's a model that we find very appealing and one that we want to continue to keep our foot on the gas on. And that's why that, even in a year like 2021, when we have meaningful investment in our business, we can still, at least, guide to a point where we're expecting modest operating margin expansion."

We sit here in February of 2021, and there's still uncertainty. There's uncertainty with the level of stimulus measures, the pace of the vaccine roll-out. But there are some things that we've seen that certainly give us a lot more confidence than where we stood 9 months ago sort of at the peak of the concern and trepidation that people had around what could happen to the economy and the impact on everyone's respective company.
Some of the trends that we're seeing that Dan talked about in his prepared remarks, they're definitely sustainable. And there's this movement to digitization and the pull forward of e-commerce that certainly stands to benefit us and others in this space.
But we provided sort of an approximate number, right? We said approximately 19%. There's not a range around it, like we normally do because, quite frankly, that range would be somewhat artificial or arbitrary. It's -- there are a wide range of outcomes that could happen. But we feel pretty good about what we see in the business. And I think it's important to note that we are a pretty diversified portfolio of products. And so we're not just reliant on one thing.
And I'll give one example before I close my answer, but the travel and events portfolio. So I mentioned that in an earlier answer, like our baseline assumption on that 19% revenue growth is that as the -- as people begin receiving vaccines, there's pent-up demand for travel. People want to take that summer vacation in 2020 that they missed. 
And so we're assuming that we start to see a rebound in travel and events in the second quarter. And that certainly stands to benefit the Braintree side of our business. The [ how things aren't, ] if that's not the case, then likely there's been other concerns that result in people sort of lacking mobility that still stands to benefit us on the core PayPal business.

Thanks for the question, Colin. So obviously, we're really pleased that we now own 100% of GoPay. And we're the first and so far the only foreign payments company to operate a full domestic payments business in China. And that, obviou",460,"Yes. I'll take this. Thanks for the question, Colin. So obviously, we're really pleased that we now own 100% of GoPay. And we're the first and so far the only foreign payments company to operate a full domestic payments business in China. And that, obviously, gives us a very strong legal foundation for the business we have there and for the business that we intend to drive.
Very recently, Deputy Governor Pan from the PBOC had an article in the financial times. That was really kind of this clear statement of China's commitment to trying to strike the right balance between innovation along with prudent regulation. And that plays right into what we want to do inside the market. We really want to work with the regulators there on both of those objectives and assure that we've got both safe and secure digital commerce. And we really have 3 goals over the next couple of years in China. 
So first, obviously, is to make sure we invest to have the right compliant infrastructure inside China. The second is to really leverage all of our cross-border expertise, and that goes in 2 directions. First, we want to significantly increase the amount of cross-border that Chinese merchants can get from the 350 million consumers we have outside of China. And we also want to work inside China to have Chinese consumers purchase from the 29 million merchants that we have outside of China. 
Both of those are already growing elements, and we think that those can grow quite nicely in the years to come, and it really plays into our strengths. The third thing, though, is that we do want to work within the ecosystem inside of China with companies like China UnionPay, with the banks there, with the tech platform companies there as well to drive new types of payment services or incremental payment services inside the domestic market, like that could be payouts, it could be some unbranded full stack processing. It could be QR codes.
For instance, I'll just give you an example. China is holding the Olympics in the next couple of years. There's going to be a tremendous amount of visitors going into China. And we want our QR codes to be deployed so that people coming in to China don't necessarily have to download WeChat Pay or [ Ant. ] And they can use their PayPal wallet inside China to make purchases at merchants.
And I think there's a lot of ways that we can leverage our strength, the strength of our partners inside China and our strong regulatory relationship that we have right now to both grow cross-border and then to start to slowly, but surely add incremental services into the domestic market as well."

Dan, that's a great question, kind of goes at the heart of a lot of our strategy. And we're going to be talking a lot about that at our Investor Day next week as well.
So let me just very quickly say that we are seeing engagement levels already. I talked about it. If you normalize for Honey and all the incremental net new actives that we brought in that are bending our traditional curves. We've never really been above 9% or 10%. Normalized, we're at about 11.5% of growth. Our churn rates are down. All of the new functionality that we've put into place, whether that be crypto or that be buy now, pay later, the Venmo card, QR codes are adding to usage.
They're adding incremental TPV, they're adding incremental transactions. Once stat I didn't mention is that people who use a PayPal product in store. And again, these are early days on this, but those that are using it in-store, we're seeing, Dan, 54 incremental transactions that are just in-store, that don't displace the online.
It's just -- it's basically doubling the number of transactions we have. And so as we start to build out our digital wallet really into the super app, that transcends across payments, commerce and financial services, all of that on a common platform, all of that leveraging common data elements and machine learning on top of that to give next best recommendations.
I think we are going to see, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, a real bend in the historic rate of engagement. And it's going to be all around that super app functionality in that digital wallet, moving well beyond just payments. 
So I think, Dan, thank you for a great kind of closing question. And I want to thank everybody for your time today. And I really hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. And we are looking forward to speaking with all of you again next week at our Investor Day. So thank you for your time, and everybody. Take care. Bye-bye."

I'm pleased to report that PayPal just completed the strongest year in our history, achieving record growth in net new active customers, volume, revenue, operating income, earnings and free cash flow. Consumers and businesses of all sizes have embraced a new digital erasing the distinction between online and off-line.
A digital-first world is no longer our future. It's our current reality, and it will forever change the way we interact across almost all elements of our lives.
At the beginning of the pandemic, consumers and lockdown had no choice but to do all of their shopping online. Today, the vast majority of consumers state that post pandemic, they will continue to shop online at their current elevated levels because it is more convenient, easier and saves time. Retailers are rapidly adapting to a new landscape, adjusting their strategy from encouraging consumers to visit their stores to optimizing for home delivery. The pandemic has accelerated a digital wave of change across almost every industry by 3 to 5 years, unleashing a profound and permanent structural transformation. Our results in Q4 highlight these strengths. 
In the quarter, we added 16 million net new active customers, including an incremental 1.4 million new merchants. For the year, we delivered a record 73 million net new actives, ending the year with 377 million active accounts, up 24%. We now have over 29 million merchants interacting with nearly 350 million consumers. In 2021, we expect to add another 50 million net new active accounts. 
Equally important, our daily active users remain elevated versus a year ago, up 29% from Q4 of 2019. Our expanding scale and increasing engagement drove a record 4.4 billion transactions in the quarter, up 27%. Our total payment volumes in Q4 were $277 billion, up 36% on an FXN basis.
Our TPV, excluding eBay, was up a record 40% percent as we continue to gain market share. eBay TPV grew at 1% and exited the year at just under 6% of our total volume. For the full year, our TPV was up 31% to $936 billion. In Q2 of 2020, our quarterly revenue surpassed $5 billion for the first time. In Q4, we surpassed $6 billion for the first time, with our quarterly revenues growing by 23% to $6.116 billion. 
For the year, our revenues grew by a record 22% on an FX-neutral basis to $21.45 billion. Our non-GAAP EPS grew a record 31% to $3.88, and our free cash flow increased by 48% of to $5 billion. 
Venmo continued its strong performance with Q4 TPV of $47 billion, up 60% year-over-year. Venmo's customer base grew by 32% in 2020, ending just shy of 70 million active accounts. This continued momentum reinforces our conviction that revenues will approach $900 million in 2021. 
In early January, eligible customers were able to cash their stimulus checks within the Venmo app for the first time. Later in this month, our Venmo credit card will be available to 100% of our base. And in the coming months, we will launch the ability to buy, hold and sell crypto via the Venmo app. And finally, our revamped Pay with Venmo experience will launch in Q2, offering a best-in-class checkout experience. 
Today's digital reality is rapidly accelerating the need for a digital wallet that encompasses payments, financial services and shopping. This year, our digital wallet will change more than it has ever changed before, significantly increasing its functionality within a single, integrated and beautifully designed app, that should meaningfully increase consumer engagement.
In 2020, we made significant progress in expanding the functionality of our PayPal and Venmo wallets. We added the ability to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies, the option to buy now and pay later, direct deposit, check cashing and bill payment capabilities. We introduced Venmo and PayPal QR codes for in-store purchasing as well as our Venmo credit card. This year, we expect to work with our financial industry partners to introduce even more functionality, including budget and savings tools, investment alternatives, including, but not limited to crypto, and enhanced bill pay options.
We also intend to fully integrate the entire suite of Honey's shopping tools, including wish lists, price monitoring, deals, coupons and rewards for use in the physical and digital worlds. 
I'm very pleased with the early reception of our PayPal and Venmo QR codes, which are now accepted at over 600,000 retail locations. In 2020, we signed 29 large enterprises, including CVS, Foot Locker, Nike, Five Below, Levi's, Bloomingdales, Macy's and Uniqlo, and our early in-store results are encouraging. Merchants are experiencing double-digit increases in average basket sizes with consumers who frequently use our QR codes. And we are seeing a 19% increase in TPV from consumers who use our QR codes. 
Across all of our in-store efforts, including QR, tap and pay and cards, we processed over $20; billion of TPV, with almost 10 million consumers using PayPal in store. We also saw an exceptional response from our crypto launch. Even with high initial expectations, the volume of crypto traded on our platform greatly exceeded our projections. 
We are excited to build upon this early success by allowing customers to use their crypto balance as a funding source whenever they shop at our 29 million merchants. We anticipate the rollout of that capability to begin late this quarter, and we hope to launch our first international market in the next several months. 
These initial steps are just the beginning of an extensive road map around crypto, blockchain and digital currencies. We are already working with the regulators and central banks to reimagine and shape the next-generation of the financial system, as consumers no longer want to handle cash. We all know the current financial system is antiquated. And we can envision a future where transactions are completed in seconds not days, a future where transactions should be less expensive to complete and a future that enables all people to be part of the digital economy, not just the affluent. 
We are significantly investing in our new crypto, blockchain and digital currencies business unit in order to help shape this more inclusive future. 
I would also highlight the rapid growth of our buy now, pay later functionality. We saw tremendous and growing demand throughout the quarter and witnessed the fastest start to any product we have ever launched. Millions of consumers transacted at hundreds of thousands of merchants in Q4 alone. As with QR codes, we are seeing a meaningful halo effect on overall transactions and TPV, including over $750 million of TPV in our first quarter out of the gate.
It's exciting to see that each new service we launch drives incremental increases in our overall consumer lifetime value. Consequently, I would expect that our engagement levels will increase beyond our historic run rates. 
I'm proud to see that the PayPal platform was especially leveraged during the pandemic for philanthropic giving and community support, enabling over $17 billion for charities and those in need. And we also put our $535 million commitment to black and minority-owned businesses and communities into action. We have already invested over 50% of those committed dollars, and we plan to report on their impact as results come in. 
We have entered the next chapter in PayPal's history. The efforts of our employees, along with the investments we have made over the past 5 years, have transformed our technical and compliance infrastructure, enabling rapid product development. We released more products and services in 2020 than in any previous year, and we will step-up that pace in 2021. 
Merchants and consumers are turning to PayPal in record numbers as we accelerate into the digital age. Our opportunities, over the next 5 years, have never been greater. We remain focused on democratizing financial services, assuring that everyone has access and can thrive in the new digital paradigm. We intend to shape that future, and in doing so, become one of the world's leading digital payments, financial services, and commerce platforms. 
I look forward to expanding on this vision during our Investor Day next week. With that, I will turn the call over to John."

I want to start off by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver a record-breaking year. 2020 was pivotal for PayPal and the broader payments industry, marked by rapid acceleration in digitization, cash displacement and e-commerce adoption. These secular trends have been shaping our sector for some time.
That said, the rate of change we experienced last year, resulting from the widespread implications of the COVID pandemic, was profound and transformative. Crisis, which has led to hardship and suffering for so many, increased the urgency across our organization to serve our customers in new and innovative ways. Notably, the isolation defined by lockdowns and working from home actually resulted in greater collaboration and brought our teams closer together. 
We've entered 2021 energized by a greater sense of purpose and responsibility and ready to build on our strong momentum. 
Now to our fourth quarter results. Total payment volume grew 36% on a currency-neutral basis. This is the strongest quarterly growth we've reported in history and represents 14 points of acceleration from 2019. The our merchant services volume grew 40%, another record for PayPal, accelerating each quarter in 2020. Volume contribution from eBay Marketplaces continued to decline. We exited December with eBay representing less than 6% of our overall volume. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 23% on both a spot and currency-neutral basis to $6.1 billion. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, U.S. revenue grew 18%, and international revenue grew 29% as the U.S. has a greater proportion of revenue from credit and the travel and events verticals. Transaction revenue grew 25%, representing 8 points of acceleration from last year on a spot basis. This growth was primarily driven by strength across our core PayPal business, including strong cross border activity. 
Our core payments platform continues to deliver exceptional growth, with transaction revenue, excluding revenue from eBay, growing 30% in the fourth quarter, also an acceleration of 8 basis points from 2019. 
Other value-added services revenue increased 1% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting incremental Honey revenue, offset by lower interest income on customer balances and less credit revenue. Honey contributed approximately 1.7 points of growth to total revenue and approximately 20 points of growth to other value-added services revenue.
In the fourth quarter, transaction take rate was 2.05%, and total take rate was 2.21%. The 22 basis point decline in transaction take rate resulted primarily from changes in volume mix with eBay's contribution continuing to decline, bill payment and P2P volumes accelerating and a reduction of $97 million in international transaction revenue from foreign currency hedges. The 28 basis point decline in total take rate resulted from these factors as well as lower value-added services revenue. 
In the fourth quarter, our volume-based expense performance was exceptional. These expenses delivered 216 basis points of leverage in the quarter, increasing 18% to $2.7 billion. Transaction expense improved 12 basis points as a rate of TPV to 84 basis points, driven by both volume mix and funding mix. Transaction losses improved 5 basis points to a record low rate of 10 basis points. Credit losses were 3 basis points as a rate of TPV. 
Our credit loss reserve coverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 23%, decreasing slightly from the third quarter. The combination of strong revenue and volume-based expense performance resulted in transaction margin dollars increasing 28% to $3.4 billion. In the fourth quarter, we generated incremental transaction margin dollars of $753 million, more than 2x the incremental contribution last year. 
Nontransaction related expenses grew 28%, reflecting increased investments in our key strategic priorities as well as growth related to our acquisitions. This higher level of investment contributed to a 56% increase in sales and marketing expenses and a 27% increase in technology and development spending in the quarter. Leverage across customer support and operations and general and administrative expenses partially offset this increased level of investment. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income in the fourth quarter grew 29% to $1.5 billion. Our operating margin was 24.7%, expanding more than 100 basis points and representing our strongest performance for any fourth quarter. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver operating efficiencies and scale our platform at low incremental cost, while investing in our strategic growth priorities.
Non-GAAP other income declined by $62 million relative to last year, driven by reduced interest income from lower interest rates and higher interest expense from our debt issuance last May. The negative impact on non-GAAP EPS from the decline in other income was offset by a lower effective tax rate. 
For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP EPS grew 29% to $1.08. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.2 billion. In addition, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, representing 50% growth from fourth quarter last year. 
I'd now like to discuss our guidance for the full year and the first quarter. We've just completed the strongest year in our history, achieving record growth in net new accounts, volume, revenue, operating income, earnings and free cash flow. We delivered these results while absorbing meaningful macroeconomic headwinds affecting our credit business, the revenue and income effects of lower interest rates, idiosyncratic pressure on the travel and events verticals and the initial step down of volumes from eBay post operating agreement.
These headwinds persist as we move into 2021, and yet, our core business continues to perform at unprecedented levels. Our addressable opportunity has never been more expansive, and we're confident we've never been better positioned to capture the benefits of this accelerated secular growth. 
We believe the effects of the pandemic on consumer behavior and business transformation are enduring and sustainable. We also expect e-commerce to drive continued strong payment volume and transaction growth globally. While it appears that additional stimulus measures will support the path toward a more sustained economic recovery, the backdrop continues to evolve and much remains uncertain. And as we've commented on several occasions over the past 9 months, we're focused on balancing transparency with certainty as we develop our outlook. It's with these considerations that we're providing our full year guidance, which is our best estimate at this time. 
For the full year, our plans contemplate TPV growth in the high 20% range. We expect to generate revenue of approximately $25.5 billion, representing growth of approximately 19% based on current spot rates. Included in our guidance is a headwind to revenue growth of approximately 400 basis points from eBay's managed payments transition. In addition, our current forecast contemplates an approximate 200 basis point impact from foreign currency translation as the U.S. dollar has weakened relative to 2020. 
As we've discussed previously, in 2021, we will absorb the greatest revenue impact from the loss of volumes from eBay. In the face of this pressure, we're pleased to be guiding spot revenue growth at 19%. Equally important, once we are beyond the eBay transition, we expect our rates of growth for total payment volume, revenue and earnings to accelerate. 
In 2021, we also expect to deliver approximately 17% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. This earnings guidance contemplates ongoing elevated levels of organic investment. We believe the structural tailwinds for PayPal have never been stronger. To fully realize these opportunities, strengthen our competitive positioning and advance our leadership in digital payments, sustained investment in our business is critical.
Cost discipline, together with our ability to efficiently scale our payments platform, will allow us to generate modest operating margin expansion in 2021. In addition, we anticipate that below the line factors, namely higher interest expense and a higher tax rate in 2021 relative to 2020, will offset much of this margin expansion. For the full year, we expect to generate approximately $6 billion in free cash flow. 
Before I discuss our Q1 guidance, I'd like to contextualize how to think about the trajectory of our revenue and earnings performance for the year. This year, there are several dynamics that we believe will contribute to more variability in our year-over-year growth rates from quarter-to-quarter than our historic trends. These include lapping our 2020 performance, this year's cadence of planned investments and product introductions, the roll off of eBay volumes and our timing expectations related to the recovery of travel and events volumes and of a more normalized growth in our credit portfolio. 
Underlying our guidance for 19% revenue growth on a spot basis is our expectation that we will report our highest rate of revenue growth for the year in the first quarter, followed by relatively stable, but more moderate growth in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021. Our full year earnings guidance of 17% growth also contemplates delivering the highest rate of growth in Q1. 
In the second quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings to be relatively flat year-over-year, primarily due to the outsized EPS growth we experienced in Q2 last year, which exceeded 49% as well as the expected timing of our investment spend. Then, in the back half of 2021, we expect a meaningful and sequential reacceleration in earnings growth. Importantly, throughout the year, we expect the absolute dollar performance of our business to be very strong. 
As we move through the year, we'll keep you updated on how we're tracking relative to this expected cadence. 
Consistent with my earlier comments, in the first quarter, we expect revenue growth of approximately 28% on a spot basis, with non-GAAP earnings growth of approximately 50%. 
In summary, last year was a year like no other. But in all of the turmoil and difficulty that people encountered, one thing was clear in our business. PayPal has never been more relevant and needed than we are right now. Our industry, our company is moving forward.
The next 5 years will be very different than the last 5, and we're striving to shape that outcome, that future, a future where e-commerce and digital payments are not just a fallback when one can't make it to a physical store or don't want to handle cash, but instead a necessity, a necessity that is sought out as the preferred way for people to transact every single day. It's a future where I expect that our scale, our brand of trust and security and our leading solutions for merchants and consumers alike, will allow us to continue to create immense value for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Certainly, the initiatives, all initiatives, taking a while to ramp up. The bulk of our new initiatives are really -- we would expect the financial impact to be in the second half of the year. But when you combine that with the momentum in the business, it certainly allows us to offset that headwind."

Like you ask me to choose which of these are my favorite kid. And product managers that are hanging on the answer. So look, we put out a couple of big initiatives into the market from our in-store to our crypto, to our buy now, pay later. And honestly, all of them surpassed our internal projections, and they all are creating a halo impact that is really pleasing to see. I talked about kind of QR having a 19% halo effect. 
Crypto started off with a bang and just kept going and is continuing to go. But in a surprise winner, if I had the envelope, I would talk about buy now, pay later, honestly, as surprising me most to the upside. I -- since I've been here, I've never seen a product launch with that kind of scale so quickly. I mean, we talked about moving into the U.S. in October, we announced. And we had almost 3 million customers using buy now, pay later at hundreds of thousands of merchants. By the way, that's not the total number of transaction. We already saw in the quarter a 40% repeat rate on that as well. And so it's not just that you add customers in it, I mean, they're just voting with their feet and moving forward. And we think that we have a value proposition that is second to none out there. 
First of all, we've got 350 million customers that we can bring that trust PayPal. We know them. And so our approval rates are higher than, we think, than anybody else out there when people sign up for buy now, pay later. Second..."

And in 2020, we put out more products and services than we've ever put out before. I said in my remarks that we're going to step-up that pace in 2021, and we're going to go do that. When I look at all the investment we've made over the past 5-plus years in our tech infrastructure, in our compliance and risk management, what that's enabled us to do now is pretty radically accelerate the amount of software releases that we have. 
We put out last year between config releases and software releases some 60,000 releases. That was up 30% year-over-year at the time that we're all working from home. So our productivity has gone way up. Our developer toolkits are much improved. They're using modern programming language. We have a service-oriented architecture. And by the way, all that's happening, while the number of bugs has gone down 25% in all of our releases from 2019 levels. 
And so I'm really happy with the pace of organic innovation and our ability to deliver products, and that takes away a lot of our need to do acquisition.
I would just build on John's point. We obviously have a strong balance sheet, strong cash flow. We will be acquisitive going forward. But we're going to look at that, as John said, in a very disciplined manner. We're going to look at talent, type of acquisitions, working to do maybe a smaller acquisition to bring in great talent in a particular area. We'll look at geographic types of acquisitions where we may want to go after a geography, and there may be a player or 2 there that could help us leapfrog into that market, and we'll look at that carefully. 
And if there's a real capability that -- not that we can't develop and do, but it's going to take us too long to get there because of what we're trying to do on our road map, then we would take a look at that as well. Those are kind of the basic areas, I would say. So I think we've got a good 1, 2 punch between what we can do internally and what we can do from an inorganic perspective."

Look, your expectation for adding 50 million net new actives in '21 was clearly an impressive number when looking at 72 million, you guys just added.

Does that -- I guess, first, does that underscore the incremental adds, your confidence that the incremental adds in 2020 will really not pull forward, but they're just new demographics. And just looking off of last year, if you could walk us through the different drivers, whether it's geography or products, giving you the confidence in adding 50 million net new actives in '21 versus the prepandemic 35 million or so levels would be great?"

Yes, Darrin, I think when we look at the cohort of net new actives from last year, it's clearly incremental people coming on.

Yes, Darrin, I think when we look at the cohort of net new actives from last year, it's clearly incremental people coming on. The -- over 50 demographic, 50 years old demographic, one of our strongest growth vectors that we've had. So you're really seeing new demographics come onto the platform. But what's really interesting to me is the engagement metrics of that cohort are also up substantially. We have double-digit increases in value for net new actives. Our 90-day engagement rates are up 13% plus over traditional cohorts. 
If you look at a normalized transaction for active spend, is this kind of gets a little bit lost because we're including Honey net new actives in the denominator. And we also, as you said, we put on 72.7 million net new actives last year. If you normalize that for 37 million that we would put on, on a typical year because when you put somebody onto the platform, they don't have all the transactions because they all didn't come in on January 1, they come in throughout the year. And so that puts pressure on it.
But our TPA, which is a real measure of engagement, normalized basis would have grown 11.5%, like that's above any trend line that we have up to about 45.1x a year. And so our churn rates, in general, because of that, are coming down. And when you have a base as big as ours right now, it is as much, maybe even more about the churn rate than it is the new ads coming in. There is plenty of demand to come on to our platform.
But when we see churn reduction like we're seeing right now because of increased engagement, and that increased engagement is coming because people are just moving online and because we have these new products that are out right now that people are just using a ton of more like crypto is a great example. Everyone who is signed on crypto is opening up their wallet app, 2x the level of what they did previous. 
And so I think that 50 million is a real good guide right now. We'll obviously update as we go on. But we're seeing a lot of really encouraging trends in the underlying cohorts that we're bringing on, which gives a lot of confidence to that 50 million number."

So let me just -- I'll take them in reverse order. We still are seeing elevated levels of debit, and that's consistent with what others have said across the ecosystem, though not at the levels that we saw in 2Q and likely driven by the impact of stimulus measures at that point in time. 
Braintree continues to perform very well for us, but it really suffers the brunt of the impact from the travel and events vertical, which was down 50%, 5-0 percent, for us. And so that's -- it's a pretty meaningful impact when you consider that, that's in excess of 10% of our volume.
But when you look at the areas of leverage for our business, so I think we'll continue to see strong core PayPal trends of PayPal volume. And those tend to come at a higher transaction margin.
By the same time, we've seen record performance in transaction expense and transaction losses. And those -- transaction expense will be impacted more by the mixes in our business, but we expect those will be below the levels that we entered this pandemic with, and we expect transaction losses to stay at these levels. We're performing very well there. 
But as you think about the remainder of our income statement, if you will, and all the other sort of non-volume-related expenses, we've invested a lot, obviously, in the back half of last year, and our guidance assumes that as well. But we also demonstrate the ability for our business to scale very efficiently. 
And so if you just -- we don't give expense guidance for the year, but you can back into it based upon our revenue and earnings growth. And that expense growth that we're assuming in 2021, about 75% of that is related to investments we're making in the business, discretionary go-to-market initiatives, all of the things we're doing to help accelerate or continue these trends. And so that leaves the remainder 25%, which is really just demonstrating the scalability of our model.
And I'll end my question with one data point that, I think, is reflective of how successful that model is. And so you know, David, I often talk about the incremental margins in our business. And -- meaning -- so for every dollar of revenue that we brought in, in the quarter, what was the profitability related to that? And in the fourth quarter, the organic incremental operating margin was 32% for PayPal. So for every new dollar of revenue we're bringing in, it's got a higher-margin on it than what the rest of the business does.
That's a model that we find very appealing and one that we want to continue to keep our foot on the gas on. And that's why that, even in a year like 2021, when we have meaningful investment in our business, we can still, at least, guide to a point where we're expecting modest operating margin expansion."

We sit here in February of 2021, and there's still uncertainty. There's uncertainty with the level of stimulus measures, the pace of the vaccine roll-out. But there are some things that we've seen that certainly give us a lot more confidence than where we stood 9 months ago sort of at the peak of the concern and trepidation that people had around what could happen to the economy and the impact on everyone's respective company.
Some of the trends that we're seeing that Dan talked about in his prepared remarks, they're definitely sustainable. And there's this movement to digitization and the pull forward of e-commerce that certainly stands to benefit us and others in this space.
But we provided sort of an approximate number, right? We said approximately 19%. There's not a range around it, like we normally do because, quite frankly, that range would be somewhat artificial or arbitrary. It's -- there are a wide range of outcomes that could happen. But we feel pretty good about what we see in the business. And I think it's important to note that we are a pretty diversified portfolio of products. And so we're not just reliant on one thing.
And I'll give one example before I close my answer, but the travel and events portfolio. So I mentioned that in an earlier answer, like our baseline assumption on that 19% revenue growth is that as the -- as people begin receiving vaccines, there's pent-up demand for travel. People want to take that summer vacation in 2020 that they missed. 
And so we're assuming that we start to see a rebound in travel and events in the second quarter. And that certainly stands to benefit the Braintree side of our business. The [ how things aren't, ] if that's not the case, then likely there's been other concerns that result in people sort of lacking mobility that still stands to benefit us on the core PayPal business. So it's -- I know it's 11 months out that we're projecting here. But as we've moved through this, we've gotten more confident with some of the trends that we're seeing and feel really good about that guide."

So obviously, we're really pleased that we now own 100% of GoPay. And we're the first and so far the only foreign payments company to operate a full domestic payments business in China. And that, obviously, gives us a very strong legal foundation for the business we have there and for the business that we intend to drive.
Very recently, Deputy Governor Pan from the PBOC had an article in the financial times. That was really kind of this clear statement of China's commitment to trying to strike the right balance between innovation along with prudent regulation. And that plays right into what we want to do inside the market. We really want to work with the regulators there on both of those objectives and assure that we've got both safe and secure digital commerce. And we really have 3 goals over the next couple of years in China. 
So first, obviously, is to make sure we invest to have the right compliant infrastructure inside China. The second is to really leverage all of our cross-border expertise, and that goes in 2 directions. First, we want to significantly increase the amount of cross-border that Chinese merchants can get from the 350 million consumers we have outside of China. And we also want to work inside China to have Chinese consumers purchase from the 29 million merchants that we have outside of China. 
Both of those are already growing elements, and we think that those can grow quite nicely in the years to come, and it really plays into our strengths. The third thing, though, is that we do want to work within the ecosystem inside of China with companies like China UnionPay, with the banks there, with the tech platform companies there as well to drive new types of payment services or incremental payment services inside the domestic market, like that could be payouts, it could be some unbranded full stack processing. It could be QR codes.
For instance, I'll just give you an example. China is holding the Olympics in the next couple of years. There's going to be a tremendous amount of visitors going into China. And we want our QR codes to be deployed so that people coming in to China don't necessarily have to download WeChat Pay or [ Ant. ] And they can use their PayPal wallet inside China to make purchases at merchants.
And I think there's a lot of ways that we can leverage our strength, the strength of our partners inside China and our strong regulatory relationship that we have right now to both grow cross-border and then to start to slowly, but surely add incremental services into the domestic market as well."

Dan, that's a great question, kind of goes at the heart of a lot of our strategy. And we're going to be talking a lot about that at our Investor Day next week as well.
So let me just very quickly say that we are seeing engagement levels already. I talked about it. If you normalize for Honey and all the incremental net new actives that we brought in that are bending our traditional curves. We've never really been above 9% or 10%. Normalized, we're at about 11.5% of growth. Our churn rates are down. All of the new functionality that we've put into place, whether that be crypto or that be buy now, pay later, the Venmo card, QR codes are adding to usage.
They're adding incremental TPV, they're adding incremental transactions. Once stat I didn't mention is that people who use a PayPal product in store. And again, these are early days on this, but those that are using it in-store, we're seeing, Dan, 54 incremental transactions that are just in-store, that don't displace the online.
It's just -- it's basically doubling the number of transactions we have. And so as we start to build out our digital wallet really into the super app, that transcends across payments, commerce and financial services, all of that on a common platform, all of that leveraging common data elements and machine learning on top of that to give next best recommendations.
I think we are going to see, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, a real bend in the historic rate of engagement. And it's going to be all around that super app functionality in that digital wallet, moving well beyond just payments. 
So I think, Dan, thank you for a great kind of closing question. And I want to thank everybody for your time today. And I really hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. And we are looking forward to speaking with all of you again next week at our Investor Day. So thank you for your time, and everybody. Take care. Bye-bye."

I'm pleased to report that PayPal just completed the strongest year in our history, achieving record growth in net new active customers, volume, revenue, operating income, earnings and free cash flow. Consumers and businesses of all sizes have embraced a new digital erasing the distinction between online and off-line.
A digital-first world is no longer our future. It's our current reality, and it will forever change the way we interact across almost all elements of our lives.
At the beginning of the pandemic, consumers and lockdown had no choice but to do all of their shopping online. Today, the vast majority of consumers state that post pandemic, they will continue to shop online at their current elevated levels because it is more convenient, easier and saves time. Retailers are rapidly adapting to a new landscape, adjusting their strategy from encouraging consumers to visit their stores to optimizing for home delivery. The pandemic has accelerated a digital wave of change across almost every industry by 3 to 5 years, unleashing a profound and permanent structural transformation. Our results in Q4 highlight these strengths. 
In the quarter, we added 16 million net new active customers, including an incremental 1.4 million new merchants. For the year, we delivered a record 73 million net new actives, ending the year with 377 million active accounts, up 24%. We now have over 29 million merchants interacting with nearly 350 million consumers. In 2021, we expect to add another 50 million net new active accounts. 
Equally important, our daily active users remain elevated versus a year ago, up 29% from Q4 of 2019. Our expanding scale and increasing engagement drove a record 4.4 billion transactions in the quarter, up 27%. Our total payment volumes in Q4 were $277 billion, up 36% on an FXN basis.
Our TPV, excluding eBay, was up a record 40% percent as we continue to gain market share. eBay TPV grew at 1% and exited the year at just under 6% of our total volume. For the full year, our TPV was up 31% to $936 billion. In Q2 of 2020, our quarterly revenue surpassed $5 billion for the first time. In Q4, we surpassed $6 billion for the first time, with our quarterly revenues growing by 23% to $6.116 billion. 
For the year, our revenues grew by a record 22% on an FX-neutral basis to $21.45 billion. Our non-GAAP EPS grew a record 31% to $3.88, and our free cash flow increased by 48% of to $5 billion. 
Venmo continued its strong performance with Q4 TPV of $47 billion, up 60% year-over-year. Venmo's customer base grew by 32% in 2020, ending just shy of 70 million active accounts. This continued momentum reinforces our conviction that revenues will approach $900 million in 2021. 
In early January, eligible customers were able to cash their stimulus checks within the Venmo app for the first time. Later in this month, our Venmo credit card will be available to 100% of our base. And in the coming months, we will launch the ability to buy, hold and sell crypto via the Venmo app. And finally, our revamped Pay with Venmo experience will launch in Q2, offering a best-in-class checkout experience. 
Today's digital reality is rapidly accelerating the need for a digital wallet that encompasses payments, financial services and shopping. This year, our digital wallet will change more than it has ever changed before, significantly increasing its functionality within a single, integrated and beautifully designed app, that should meaningfully increase consumer engagement.
In 2020, we made significant progress in expanding the functionality of our PayPal and Venmo wallets. We added the ability to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies, the option to buy now and pay later, direct deposit, check cashing and bill payment capabilities. We introduced Venmo and PayPal QR codes for in-store purchasing as well as our Venmo credit card. This year, we expect to work with our financial industry partners to introduce even more functionality, including budget and savings tools, investment alternatives, including, but not limited to crypto, and enhanced bill pay options.
We also intend to fully integrate the entire suite of Honey's shopping tools, including wish lists, price monitoring, deals, coupons and rewards for use in the physical and digital worlds. 
I'm very pleased with the early reception of our PayPal and Venmo QR codes, which are now accepted at over 600,000 retail locations. In 2020, we signed 29 large enterprises, including CVS, Foot Locker, Nike, Five Below, Levi's, Bloomingdales, Macy's and Uniqlo, and our early in-store results are encouraging. Merchants are experiencing double-digit increases in average basket sizes with consumers who frequently use our QR codes. And we are seeing a 19% increase in TPV from consumers who use our QR codes. 
Across all of our in-store efforts, including QR, tap and pay and cards, we processed over $20; billion of TPV, with almost 10 million consumers using PayPal in store. We also saw an exceptional response from our crypto launch. Even with high initial expectations, the volume of crypto traded on our platform greatly exceeded our projections. 
We are excited to build upon this early success by allowing customers to use their crypto balance as a funding source whenever they shop at our 29 million merchants. We anticipate the rollout of that capability to begin late this quarter, and we hope to launch our first international market in the next several months. 
These initial steps are just the beginning of an extensive road map around crypto, blockchain and digital currencies. We are already working with the regulators and central banks to reimagine and shape the next-generation of the financial system, as consumers no longer want to handle cash. We all know the current financial system is antiquated. And we can envision a future where transactions are completed in seconds not days, a future where transactions should be less expensive to complete and a future that enables all people to be part of the digital economy, not just the affluent. 
We are significantly investing in our new crypto, blockchain and digital currencies business unit in order to help shape this more inclusive future. 
I would also highlight the rapid growth of our buy now, pay later functionality. We saw tremendous and growing demand throughout the quarter and witnessed the fastest start to any product we have ever launched. Millions of consumers transacted at hundreds of thousands of merchants in Q4 alone. As with QR codes, we are seeing a meaningful halo effect on overall transactions and TPV, including over $750 million of TPV in our first quarter out of the gate.
It's exciting to see that each new service we launch drives incremental increases in our overall consumer lifetime value. Consequently, I would expect that our engagement levels will increase beyond our historic run rates. 
I'm proud to see that the PayPal platform was especially leveraged during the pandemic for philanthropic giving and community support, enabling over $17 billion for charities and those in need. And we also put our $535 million commitment to black and minority-owned businesses and communities into action. We have already invested over 50% of those committed dollars, and we plan to report on their impact as results come in. 
We have entered the next chapter in PayPal's history. The efforts of our employees, along with the investments we have made over the past 5 years, have transformed our technical and compliance infrastructure, enabling rapid product development. We released more products and services in 2020 than in any previous year, and we will step-up that pace in 2021. 
Merchants and consumers are turning to PayPal in record numbers as we accelerate into the digital age. Our opportunities, over the next 5 years, have never been greater. We remain focused on democratizing financial services, assuring that everyone has access and can thrive in the new digital paradigm. We intend to shape that future, and in doing so, become one of the world's leading digital payments, financial services, and commerce platforms. 
I look forward to expanding on this vision during our Investor Day next week. With that, I will turn the call over to John."

I want to start off by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver a record-breaking year. 2020 was pivotal for PayPal and the broader payments industry, marked by rapid acceleration in digitization, cash displacemen",1741,"Thanks, Dan. I want to start off by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver a record-breaking year. 2020 was pivotal for PayPal and the broader payments industry, marked by rapid acceleration in digitization, cash displacement and e-commerce adoption. These secular trends have been shaping our sector for some time.
That said, the rate of change we experienced last year, resulting from the widespread implications of the COVID pandemic, was profound and transformative. Crisis, which has led to hardship and suffering for so many, increased the urgency across our organization to serve our customers in new and innovative ways. Notably, the isolation defined by lockdowns and working from home actually resulted in greater collaboration and brought our teams closer together. 
We've entered 2021 energized by a greater sense of purpose and responsibility and ready to build on our strong momentum. 
Now to our fourth quarter results. Total payment volume grew 36% on a currency-neutral basis. This is the strongest quarterly growth we've reported in history and represents 14 points of acceleration from 2019. The our merchant services volume grew 40%, another record for PayPal, accelerating each quarter in 2020. Volume contribution from eBay Marketplaces continued to decline. We exited December with eBay representing less than 6% of our overall volume. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 23% on both a spot and currency-neutral basis to $6.1 billion. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, U.S. revenue grew 18%, and international revenue grew 29% as the U.S. has a greater proportion of revenue from credit and the travel and events verticals. Transaction revenue grew 25%, representing 8 points of acceleration from last year on a spot basis. This growth was primarily driven by strength across our core PayPal business, including strong cross border activity. 
Our core payments platform continues to deliver exceptional growth, with transaction revenue, excluding revenue from eBay, growing 30% in the fourth quarter, also an acceleration of 8 basis points from 2019. 
Other value-added services revenue increased 1% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting incremental Honey revenue, offset by lower interest income on customer balances and less credit revenue. Honey contributed approximately 1.7 points of growth to total revenue and approximately 20 points of growth to other value-added services revenue.
In the fourth quarter, transaction take rate was 2.05%, and total take rate was 2.21%. The 22 basis point decline in transaction take rate resulted primarily from changes in volume mix with eBay's contribution continuing to decline, bill payment and P2P volumes accelerating and a reduction of $97 million in international transaction revenue from foreign currency hedges. The 28 basis point decline in total take rate resulted from these factors as well as lower value-added services revenue. 
In the fourth quarter, our volume-based expense performance was exceptional. These expenses delivered 216 basis points of leverage in the quarter, increasing 18% to $2.7 billion. Transaction expense improved 12 basis points as a rate of TPV to 84 basis points, driven by both volume mix and funding mix. Transaction losses improved 5 basis points to a record low rate of 10 basis points. Credit losses were 3 basis points as a rate of TPV. 
Our credit loss reserve coverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 23%, decreasing slightly from the third quarter. The combination of strong revenue and volume-based expense performance resulted in transaction margin dollars increasing 28% to $3.4 billion. In the fourth quarter, we generated incremental transaction margin dollars of $753 million, more than 2x the incremental contribution last year. 
Nontransaction-related expenses grew 28%, reflecting increased investments in our key strategic priorities as well as growth related to our acquisitions. This higher level of investment contributed to a 56% increase in sales and marketing expenses and a 27% increase in technology and development spending in the quarter. Leverage across customer support and operations and general and administrative expenses partially offset this increased level of investment. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income in the fourth quarter grew 29% to $1.5 billion. Our operating margin was 24.7%, expanding more than 100 basis points and representing our strongest performance for any fourth quarter. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver operating efficiencies and scale our platform at low incremental cost, while investing in our strategic growth priorities.
Non-GAAP other income declined by $62 million relative to last year, driven by reduced interest income from lower interest rates and higher interest expense from our debt issuance last May. The negative impact on non-GAAP EPS from the decline in other income was offset by a lower effective tax rate. 
For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP EPS grew 29% to $1.08. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.2 billion. In addition, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, representing 50% growth from fourth quarter last year. 
I'd now like to discuss our guidance for the full year and the first quarter. We've just completed the strongest year in our history, achieving record growth in net new accounts, volume, revenue, operating income, earnings and free cash flow. We delivered these results while absorbing meaningful macroeconomic headwinds affecting our credit business, the revenue and income effects of lower interest rates, idiosyncratic pressure on the travel and events verticals and the initial step down of volumes from eBay post operating agreement.
These headwinds persist as we move into 2021, and yet, our core business continues to perform at unprecedented levels. Our addressable opportunity has never been more expansive, and we're confident we've never been better positioned to capture the benefits of this accelerated secular growth. 
We believe the effects of the pandemic on consumer behavior and business transformation are enduring and sustainable. We also expect e-commerce to drive continued strong payment volume and transaction growth globally. While it appears that additional stimulus measures will support the path toward a more sustained economic recovery, the backdrop continues to evolve and much remains uncertain. And as we've commented on several occasions over the past 9 months, we're focused on balancing transparency with certainty as we develop our outlook. It's with these considerations that we're providing our full year guidance, which is our best estimate at this time. 
For the full year, our plans contemplate TPV growth in the high 20% range. We expect to generate revenue of approximately $25.5 billion, representing growth of approximately 19% based on current spot rates. Included in our guidance is a headwind to revenue growth of approximately 400 basis points from eBay's managed payments transition. In addition, our current forecast contemplates an approximate 200 basis point impact from foreign currency translation as the U.S. dollar has weakened relative to 2020. 
As we've discussed previously, in 2021, we will absorb the greatest revenue impact from the loss of volumes from eBay. In the face of this pressure, we're pleased to be guiding spot revenue growth at 19%. Equally important, once we are beyond the eBay transition, we expect our rates of growth for total payment volume, revenue and earnings to accelerate. 
In 2021, we also expect to deliver approximately 17% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. This earnings guidance contemplates ongoing elevated levels of organic investment. We believe the structural tailwinds for PayPal have never been stronger. To fully realize these opportunities, strengthen our competitive positioning and advance our leadership in digital payments, sustained investment in our business is critical.
Cost discipline, together with our ability to efficiently scale our payments platform, will allow us to generate modest operating margin expansion in 2021. In addition, we anticipate that below the line factors, namely higher interest expense and a higher tax rate in 2021 relative to 2020, will offset much of this margin expansion. For the full year, we expect to generate approximately $6 billion in free cash flow. 
Before I discuss our Q1 guidance, I'd like to contextualize how to think about the trajectory of our revenue and earnings performance for the year. This year, there are several dynamics that we believe will contribute to more variability in our year-over-year growth rates from quarter-to-quarter than our historic trends. These include lapping our 2020 performance, this year's cadence of planned investments and product introductions, the roll off of eBay volumes and our timing expectations related to the recovery of travel and events volumes and of a more normalized growth in our credit portfolio. 
Underlying our guidance for 19% revenue growth on a spot basis is our expectation that we will report our highest rate of revenue growth for the year in the first quarter, followed by relatively stable, but more moderate growth in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021. Our full year earnings guidance of 17% growth also contemplates delivering the highest rate of growth in Q1. 
In the second quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings to be relatively flat year-over-year, primarily due to the outsized EPS growth we experienced in Q2 last year, which exceeded 49% as well as the expected timing of our investment spend. Then, in the back half of 2021, we expect a meaningful and sequential reacceleration in earnings growth. Importantly, throughout the year, we expect the absolute dollar performance of our business to be very strong. 
As we move through the year, we'll keep you updated on how we're tracking relative to this expected cadence. 
Consistent with my earlier comments, in the first quarter, we expect revenue growth of approximately 28% on a spot basis, with non-GAAP earnings growth of approximately 50%. 
In summary, last year was a year like no other. But in all of the turmoil and difficulty that people encountered, one thing was clear in our business. PayPal has never been more relevant and needed than we are right now. Our industry, our company is moving forward.
The next 5 years will be very different than the last 5, and we're striving to shape that outcome, that future, a future where e-commerce and digital payments are not just a fallback when one can't make it to a physical store or don't want to handle cash, but instead a necessity, a necessity that is sought out as the preferred way for people to transact every single day. It's a future where I expect that our scale, our brand of trust and security and our leading solutions for merchants and consumers alike, will allow us to continue to create immense value for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

With respect to offsetting the headwind from eBay, the fact that we're expanding or better said that our projected guidance suggests that we're expanding our operating margins would certainly indicate that we think between the momentum in the business and the additional initiatives combined that we can offset the pressure related to eBay.
Certainly, the initiatives, all initiatives, taking a while to ramp up. The bulk of our new initiatives are really -- we would expect the financial impact to be in the second half of the year. But when you combine that with the momentum in the business, it certainly allows us to offset that headwind."

Like you ask me to choose which of these are my favorite kid. And product managers that are hanging on the answer. So look, we put out a couple of big initiatives into the market from our in-store to our crypto, to our buy now, pay later. And honestly, all of them surpassed our internal projections, and they all are creating a halo impact that is really pleasing to see. I talked about kind of QR having a 19% halo effect. 
Crypto started off with a bang and just kept going and is continuing to go. But in a surprise winner, if I had the envelope, I would talk about buy now, pay later, honestly, as surprising me most to the upside. I -- since I've been here, I've never seen a product launch with that kind of scale so quickly. I mean, we talked about moving into the U.S. in October, we announced. And we had almost 3 million customers using buy now, pay later at hundreds of thousands of merchants. By the way, that's not the total number of transaction. We already saw in the quarter a 40% repeat rate on that as well. And so it's not just that you add customers in it, I mean, they're just voting with their feet and moving forward. And we think that we have a value proposition that is second to none out there. 
First of all, we've got 350 million customers that we can bring that trust PayPal. We know them. And so our approval rates are higher than, we think, than anybody else out there when people sign up for buy now, pay later. Second, it is no incremental cost to the merchant. I think all of the other competitors charge a pretty significant incremental cost. And for us, we're just charging the same take rate that the merchant has. It's very, very light integration, which is why we saw well over 10,000 merchants integrate buy now, pay later up the funnel, really on the product pages and not at checkout, and we're beginning to see more and more of that as we come into the year. 
Another thing that's really interesting to me, here, the halo effect, by the way, very early days. The halo effect is about 15% increase in TPV. And we think all of that TPV so far is incremental TPV for us. But the other thing is we're seeing a meaningful double-digit reduction in the cost of those transactions as well. And so when you look at kind of the scale and you look at the value proposition, the take-up of merchants that's continuing on into the first quarter, this is clearly a home run for us and a winner. And it is not to dismiss any of my other favorite kids to say they all had great years, but buy now, pay later was probably the biggest surprise."

But I think there's 2 really important points to consider when we think about acquisitions for PayPal. The first is that we are somewhat unique in the fintech ecosystem insofar as we enjoy outsized growth rates, but we also are extremely profitable, and that results in the type of free cash flow generation with 20% plus free cash flow margins. And that -- it's that uniqueness that allows us the ability to have this effectively an asset where we can go out and look at inorganic opportunities to complement what we're doing organically. So I think that's one important point to think about. 
The second, and it really gets to your point around where some valuations are, but we exercise a tremendous amount of discipline in the way that we look at this. And from an overall capital allocation perspective, our view is every dollar of capital has to compete with the other alternatives out there, whether that be organic, whether that be returning cash to shareholders or going out and acquiring a company. And so we will remain disciplined and really view our acquisitive strategy over a multiyear longer-term time frame."

And in 2020, we put out more products and services than we've ever put out before. I said in my remarks that we're going to step-up that pace in 2021, and we're going to go do that. When I look at all the investment we've made over the past 5-plus years in our tech infrastructure, in our compliance and risk management, what that's enabled us to do now is pretty radically accelerate the amount of software releases that we have. 
We put out last year between config releases and software releases some 60,000 releases. That was up 30% year-over-year at the time that we're all working from home. So our productivity has gone way up. Our developer toolkits are much improved. They're using modern programming language. We have a service-oriented architecture. And by the way, all that's happening, while the number of bugs has gone down 25% in all of our releases from 2019 levels. 
And so I'm really happy with the pace of organic innovation and our ability to deliver products, and that takes away a lot of our need to do acquisition.
I would just build on John's point. We obviously have a strong balance sheet, strong cash flow. We will be acquisitive going forward. But we're going to look at that, as John said, in a very disciplined manner. We're going to look at talent, type of acquisitions, working to do maybe a smaller acquisition to bring in great talent in a particular area. We'll look at geographic types of acquisitions where we may want to go after a geography, and there may be a player or 2 there that could help us leapfrog into that market, and we'll look at that carefully. 
And if there's a real capability that -- not that we can't develop and do, but it's going to take us too long to get there because of what we're trying to do on our road map, then we would take a look at that as well. Those are kind of the basic areas, I would say. So I think we've got a good 1, 2 punch between what we can do internally and what we can do from an inorganic perspective."

Look, your expectation for adding 50 million net new actives in '21 was clearly an impressive number when looking at 72 million, you guys just added. And then the prepandemic normalized level is around 35 million, I think, per year, right?
Does that -- I guess, first, does that underscore the incremental adds, your confidence that the incremental adds in 2020 will really not pull forward, but they're just new demographics. And just looking off of last year, if you could walk us through the different drivers, whether it's geography or products, giving you the confidence in adding 50 million net new actives in '21 versus the prepandemic 35 million or so levels would be great?"
112732,700996472,2235713,"PayPal Holdings, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,"Earnings Calls","PayPal Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Yes, Darrin, I think when we look at the cohort of net new actives from last year, it's clearly incremental people coming on. The -- over 50 demographic, 50 years old demographic, one of our strongest growth vectors that we've had. So you're really s",396,"Yes. Yes, Darrin, I think when we look at the cohort of net new actives from last year, it's clearly incremental people coming on. The -- over 50 demographic, 50 years old demographic, one of our strongest growth vectors that we've had. So you're really seeing new demographics come onto the platform. But what's really interesting to me is the engagement metrics of that cohort are also up substantially. We have double-digit increases in value for net new actives. Our 90-day engagement rates are up 13% plus over traditional cohorts. 
If you look at a normalized transaction for active spend, is this kind of gets a little bit lost because we're including Honey net new actives in the denominator. And we also, as you said, we put on 72.7 million net new actives last year. If you normalize that for 37 million that we would put on, on a typical year because when you put somebody onto the platform, they don't have all the transactions because they all didn't come in on January 1, they come in throughout the year. And so that puts pressure on it.
But our TPA, which is a real measure of engagement, normalized basis would have grown 11.5%, like that's above any trend line that we have up to about 45.1x a year. And so our churn rates, in general, because of that, are coming down. And when you have a base as big as ours right now, it is as much, maybe even more about the churn rate than it is the new ads coming in. There is plenty of demand to come on to our platform.
But when we see churn reduction like we're seeing right now because of increased engagement, and that increased engagement is coming because people are just moving online and because we have these new products that are out right now that people are just using a ton of more like crypto is a great example. Everyone who is signed on crypto is opening up their wallet app, 2x the level of what they did previous. 
And so I think that 50 million is a real good guide right now. We'll obviously update as we go on. But we're seeing a lot of really encouraging trends in the underlying cohorts that we're bringing on, which gives a lot of confidence to that 50 million number."

We still are seeing elevated levels of debit, and that's consistent with what others have said across the ecosystem, though not at the levels that we saw",501,"Sure, David, you packed in a lot in that question. So let me just -- I'll take them in reverse order. We still are seeing elevated levels of debit, and that's consistent with what others have said across the ecosystem, though not at the levels that we saw in 2Q and likely driven by the impact of stimulus measures at that point in time. 
Braintree continues to perform very well for us, but it really suffers the brunt of the impact from the travel and events vertical, which was down 50%, 5-0 percent, for us. And so that's -- it's a pretty meaningful impact when you consider that, that's in excess of 10% of our volume.
But when you look at the areas of leverage for our business, so I think we'll continue to see strong core PayPal trends of PayPal volume. And those tend to come at a higher transaction margin.
By the same time, we've seen record performance in transaction expense and transaction losses. And those -- transaction expense will be impacted more by the mixes in our business, but we expect those will be below the levels that we entered this pandemic with, and we expect transaction losses to stay at these levels. We're performing very well there. 
But as you think about the remainder of our income statement, if you will, and all the other sort of non-volume-related expenses, we've invested a lot, obviously, in the back half of last year, and our guidance assumes that as well. But we also demonstrate the ability for our business to scale very efficiently. 
And so if you just -- we don't give expense guidance for the year, but you can back into it based upon our revenue and earnings growth. And that expense growth that we're assuming in 2021, about 75% of that is related to investments we're making in the business, discretionary go-to-market initiatives, all of the things we're doing to help accelerate or continue these trends. And so that leaves the remainder 25%, which is really just demonstrating the scalability of our model.
And I'll end my question with one data point that, I think, is reflective of how successful that model is. And so you know, David, I often talk about the incremental margins in our business. And -- meaning -- so for every dollar of revenue that we brought in, in the quarter, what was the profitability related to that? And in the fourth quarter, the organic incremental operating margin was 32% for PayPal. So for every new dollar of revenue we're bringing in, it's got a higher-margin on it than what the rest of the business does.
That's a model that we find very appealing and one that we want to continue to keep our foot on the gas on. And that's why that, even in a year like 2021, when we have meaningful investment in our business, we can still, at least, guide to a point where we're expecting modest operating margin expansion."

We sit here in February of 2021, and there's still uncertainty. There's uncertainty with the level of stimulus measures, the pace of the vaccine roll-out. But there are some things that we've seen that certainly give us a lot more confidence than where we stood 9 months ago sort of at the peak of the concern and trepidation that people had around what could happen to the economy and the impact on everyone's respective company.
Some of the trends that we're seeing that Dan talked about in his prepared remarks, they're definitely sustainable. And there's this movement to digitization and the pull forward of e-commerce that certainly stands to benefit us and others in this space.
But we provided sort of an approximate number, right? We said approximately 19%. There's not a range around it, like we normally do because, quite frankly, that range would be somewhat artificial or arbitrary. It's -- there are a wide range of outcomes that could happen. But we feel pretty good about what we see in the business. And I think it's important to note that we are a pretty diversified portfolio of products. And so we're not just reliant on one thing.
And I'll give one example before I close my answer, but the travel and events portfolio. So I mentioned that in an earlier answer, like our baseline assumption on that 19% revenue growth is that as the -- as people begin receiving vaccines, there's pent-up demand for travel. People want to take that summer vacation in 2020 that they missed. 
And so we're assuming that we start to see a rebound in travel and events in the second quarter. And that certainly stands to benefit the Braintree side of our business. The [ how things aren't, ] if that's not the case, then likely there's been other concerns that result in people sort of lacking mobility that still stands to benefit us on the core PayPal business. So it's -- I know it's 11 months out that we're projecting here. But as we've moved through this, we've gotten more confident with some of the trends that we're seeing and feel really good about that guide."

So obviously, we're really pleased that we now own 100% of GoPay. And we're the first and so far the only foreign payments company to operate a full domestic payments business in China. And that, obviously, gives us a very strong legal foundation for the business we have there and for the business that we intend to drive.
Very recently, Deputy Governor Pan from the PBOC had an article in the financial times. That was really kind of this clear statement of China's commitment to trying to strike the right balance between innovation along with prudent regulation. And that plays right into what we want to do inside the market. We really want to work with the regulators there on both of those objectives and assure that we've got both safe and secure digital commerce. And we really have 3 goals over the next couple of years in China. 
So first, obviously, is to make sure we invest to have the right compliant infrastructure inside China. The second is to really leverage all of our cross-border expertise, and that goes in 2 directions. First, we want to significantly increase the amount of cross-border that Chinese merchants can get from the 350 million consumers we have outside of China. And we also want to work inside China to have Chinese consumers purchase from the 29 million merchants that we have outside of China. 
Both of those are already growing elements, and we think that those can grow quite nicely in the years to come, and it really plays into our strengths. The third thing, though, is that we do want to work within the ecosystem inside of China with companies like China UnionPay, with the banks there, with the tech platform companies there as well to drive new types of payment services or incremental payment services inside the domestic market, like that could be payouts, it could be some unbranded full stack processing. It could be QR codes.
For instance, I'll just give you an example. China is holding the Olympics in the next couple of years. There's going to be a tremendous amount of visitors going into China. And we want our QR codes to be deployed so that people coming in to China don't necessarily have to download WeChat Pay or [ Ant. ] And they can use their PayPal wallet inside China to make purchases at merchants.
And I think there's a lot of ways that we can leverage our strength, the strength of our partners inside China and our strong regulatory relationship that we have right now to both grow cross-border and then to start to slowly, but surely add incremental services into the domestic market as well."

Dan, that's a great question, kind of goes at the heart of a lot of our strategy. And we're going to be talking a lot about that at our Investor Day next week as well.
So let me just very quickly say that we are seeing engagement levels already. I talked about it. If you normalize for Honey and all the incremental net new actives that we brought in that are bending our traditional curves. We've never really been above 9% or 10%. Normalized, we're at about 11.5% of growth. Our churn rates are down. All of the new functionality that we've put into place, whether that be crypto or that be buy now, pay later, the Venmo card, QR codes are adding to usage.
They're adding incremental TPV, they're adding incremental transactions. Once stat I didn't mention is that people who use a PayPal product in store. And again, these are early days on this, but those that are using it in-store, we're seeing, Dan, 54 incremental transactions that are just in-store, that don't displace the online.
It's just -- it's basically doubling the number of transactions we have. And so as we start to build out our digital wallet really into the super app, that transcends across payments, commerce and financial services, all of that on a common platform, all of that leveraging common data elements and machine learning on top of that to give next best recommendations.
I think we are going to see, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, a real bend in the historic rate of engagement. And it's going to be all around that super app functionality in that digital wallet, moving well beyond just payments. 
So I think, Dan, thank you for a great kind of closing question. And I want to thank everybody for your time today. And I really hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy.

I'm pleased to report that PayPal just completed the strongest year in our history, achieving record growth in net new active customers, volume, revenue, operating income, earnings and free cash flow. Consumers and businesses of all sizes have embraced a new digital era, erasing the distinction between online and off-line.
A digital-first world is no longer our future. It's our current reality, and it will forever change the way we interact across almost all elements of our lives.
At the beginning of the pandemic, consumers in lockdown had no choice but to do all of their shopping online. Today, the vast majority of consumers state that post pandemic, they will continue to shop online at their current elevated levels because it is more convenient, easier and saves time. Retailers are rapidly adapting to a new landscape, adjusting their strategy from encouraging consumers to visit their stores to optimizing for home delivery. The pandemic has accelerated a digital wave of change across almost every industry by 3 to 5 years, unleashing a profound and permanent structural transformation. Our results in Q4 highlight these strengths. 
In the quarter, we added 16 million net new active customers, including an incremental 1.4 million new merchants. For the year, we delivered a record 73 million net new actives, ending the year with 377 million active accounts, up 24%. We now have over 29 million merchants interacting with nearly 350 million consumers. In 2021, we expect to add another 50 million net new active accounts. 
Equally important, our daily active users remain elevated versus a year ago, up 29% from Q4 of 2019. Our expanding scale and increasing engagement drove a record 4.4 billion transactions in the quarter, up 27%. Our total payment volumes in Q4 were $277 billion, up 36% on an FXN basis.
Our TPV, excluding eBay, was up a record 40% percent as we continue to gain market share. eBay TPV grew at 1% and exited the year at just under 6% of our total volume. For the full year, our TPV was up 31% to $936 billion. In Q2 of 2020, our quarterly revenue surpassed $5 billion for the first time. In Q4, we surpassed $6 billion for the first time, with our quarterly revenues growing by 23% to $6.116 billion. 
For the year, our revenues grew by a record 22% on an FX-neutral basis to $21.45 billion. Our non-GAAP EPS grew a record 31% to $3.88, and our free cash flow increased by 48% of to $5 billion. 
Venmo continued its strong performance with Q4 TPV of $47 billion, up 60% year-over-year. Venmo's customer base grew by 32% in 2020, ending just shy of 70 million active accounts. This continued momentum reinforces our conviction that revenues will approach $900 million in 2021. 
In early January, eligible customers were able to cash their stimulus checks within the Venmo app for the first time. Later this month, our Venmo credit card will be available to 100% of our base. And in the coming months, we will launch the ability to buy, hold and sell crypto via the Venmo app. And finally, our revamped Pay with Venmo experience will launch in Q2, offering a best-in-class checkout experience. 
Today's digital reality is rapidly accelerating the need for a digital wallet that encompasses payments, financial services and shopping. This year, our digital wallet will change more than it has ever changed before, significantly increasing its functionality within a single, integrated and beautifully designed app, that should meaningfully increase consumer engagement.
In 2020, we made significant progress in expanding the functionality of our PayPal and Venmo wallets. We added the ability to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies, the option to buy now and pay later, direct deposit, check cashing and bill payment capabilities. We introduced Venmo and PayPal QR codes for in-store purchasing as well as our Venmo credit card. This year, we expect to work with our financial industry partners to introduce even more functionality, including budget and savings tools, investment alternatives, including, but not limited to crypto, and enhanced bill pay options.
We also intend to fully integrate the entire suite of Honey's shopping tools, including wish lists, price monitoring, deals, coupons and rewards for use in the physical and digital worlds. 
I'm very pleased with the early reception of our PayPal and Venmo QR codes, which are now accepted at over 600,000 retail locations. In 2020, we signed 29 large enterprises, including CVS, Foot Locker, Nike, Five Below, Levi's, Bloomingdales, Macy's and Uniqlo, and our early in-store results are encouraging. Merchants are experiencing double-digit increases in average basket sizes with consumers who frequently use our QR codes. And we are seeing a 19% increase in TPV from consumers who use our QR codes. 
Across all of our in-store efforts, including QR, tap and pay and cards, we processed over $20 billion of TPV, with almost 10 million consumers using PayPal in store. We also saw an exceptional response from our crypto launch. Even with high initial expectations, the volume of crypto traded on our platform greatly exceeded our projections. 
We are excited to build upon this early success by allowing customers to use their crypto balance as a funding source whenever they shop at our 29 million merchants. We anticipate the rollout of that capability to begin late this quarter, and we hope to launch our first international market in the next several months. 
These initial steps are just the beginning of an extensive road map around crypto, blockchain and digital currencies. We are already working with the regulators and central banks to reimagine and shape the next-generation of the financial system, as consumers no longer want to handle cash. 
We all know the current financial system is antiquated. And we can envision a future where transactions are completed in seconds not days, a future where transactions should be less expensive to complete and a future that enables all people to be part of the digital economy, not just the affluent. We are significantly investing in our new crypto, blockchain and digital currencies business unit in order to help shape this more inclusive future. 
I would also highlight the rapid growth of our buy now, pay later functionality. We saw tremendous and growing demand throughout the quarter and witnessed the fastest start to any product we have ever launched. Millions of consumers transacted at hundreds of thousands of merchants in Q4 alone. As with QR codes, we are seeing a meaningful halo effect on overall transactions and TPV, including over $750 million of TPV in our first quarter out of the gate.
It's exciting to see that each new service we launch drives incremental increases in our overall consumer lifetime value. Consequently, I would expect that our engagement levels will increase beyond our historic run rates. 
I'm proud to see that the PayPal platform was especially leveraged during the pandemic for philanthropic giving and community support, enabling over $17 billion for charities and those in need. And we also put our $535 million commitment to black and minority-owned businesses and communities into action. We have already invested over 50% of those committed dollars, and we plan to report on their impact as results come in. 
We have entered the next chapter in PayPal's history. The efforts of our employees, along with the investments we have made over the past 5 years, have transformed our technical and compliance infrastructure, enabling rapid product development. We released more products and services in 2020 than in any previous year, and we will step-up that pace in 2021. 
Merchants and consumers are turning to PayPal in record numbers as we accelerate into the digital age. Our opportunities, over the next 5 years, have never been greater. We remain focused on democratizing financial services, assuring that everyone has access and can thrive in the new digital paradigm. We intend to shape that future, and in doing so, become one of the world's leading digital payments, financial services, and commerce platforms. 
I look forward to expanding on this vision during our Investor Day next week. With that, I will turn the call over to John."
112732,700996472,2236094,"PayPal Holdings, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,"Earnings Calls","PayPal Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. I want to start off by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver a record-breaking year. 2020 was pivotal for PayPal and the broader payments industry, marked by rapid acceleration in digitization, cash displacemen",1740,"Thanks, Dan. I want to start off by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver a record-breaking year. 2020 was pivotal for PayPal and the broader payments industry, marked by rapid acceleration in digitization, cash displacement and e-commerce adoption. These secular trends have been shaping our sector for some time.
That said, the rate of change we experienced last year, resulting from the widespread implications of the COVID pandemic, was profound and transformative. Crisis, which has led to hardship and suffering for so many, increased the urgency across our organization to serve our customers in new and innovative ways. Notably, the isolation defined by lockdowns and working from home actually resulted in greater collaboration and brought our teams closer together. We've entered 2021 energized by a greater sense of purpose and responsibility and ready to build on our strong momentum. 
Now to our fourth quarter results. Total payment volume grew 36% on a currency-neutral basis. This is the strongest quarterly growth we've reported in history and represents 14 points of acceleration from 2019. Our merchant services volume grew 40%, another record for PayPal, accelerating each quarter in 2020. Volume contribution from eBay Marketplaces continued to decline. We exited December with eBay representing less than 6% of our overall volume. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 23% on both a spot and currency-neutral basis to $6.1 billion. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, U.S. revenue grew 18%, and international revenue grew 29% as the U.S. has a greater proportion of revenue from credit and the travel and events verticals. Transaction revenue grew 25%, representing 8 points of acceleration from last year on a spot basis. This growth was primarily driven by strength across our core PayPal business, including strong cross border activity. 
Our core payments platform continues to deliver exceptional growth, with transaction revenue, excluding revenue from eBay, growing 30% in the fourth quarter, also an acceleration of 8 basis points from 2019. 
Other value-added services revenue increased 1% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting incremental Honey revenue, offset by lower interest income on customer balances and less credit revenue. Honey contributed approximately 1.7 points of growth to total revenue and approximately 20 points of growth to other value-added services revenue.
In the fourth quarter, transaction take rate was 2.05%, and total take rate was 2.21%. The 22 basis point decline in transaction take rate resulted primarily from changes in volume mix with eBay's contribution continuing to decline, bill payment and P2P volumes accelerating and a reduction of $97 million in international transaction revenue from foreign currency hedges. The 28 basis point decline in total take rate resulted from these factors as well as lower value-added services revenue. 
In the fourth quarter, our volume-based expense performance was exceptional. These expenses delivered 216 basis points of leverage in the quarter, increasing 18% to $2.7 billion. Transaction expense improved 12 basis points as a rate of TPV to 84 basis points, driven by both volume mix and funding mix. Transaction losses improved 5 basis points to a record low rate of 10 basis points. Credit losses were 3 basis points as a rate of TPV. 
Our credit loss reserve coverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 23%, decreasing slightly from the third quarter. The combination of strong revenue and volume-based expense performance resulted in transaction margin dollars increasing 28% to $3.4 billion. In the fourth quarter, we generated incremental transaction margin dollars of $753 million, more than 2x the incremental contribution last year. 
Nontransaction-related expenses grew 28%, reflecting increased investments in our key strategic priorities as well as growth related to our acquisitions. This higher level of investment contributed to a 56% increase in sales and marketing expenses and a 27% increase in technology and development spending in the quarter. Leverage across customer support and operations and general and administrative expenses partially offset this increased level of investment. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income in the fourth quarter grew 29% to $1.5 billion. Our operating margin was 24.7%, expanding more than 100 basis points and representing our strongest performance for any fourth quarter. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver operating efficiencies and scale our platform at low incremental cost, while investing in our strategic growth priorities.
Non-GAAP other income declined by $62 million relative to last year, driven by reduced interest income from lower interest rates and higher interest expense from our debt issuance last May. The negative impact on non-GAAP EPS from the decline in other income was offset by a lower effective tax rate. 
For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP EPS grew 29% to $1.08. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.2 billion. In addition, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, representing 50% growth from fourth quarter last year. 
I'd now like to discuss our guidance for the full year and the first quarter. We've just completed the strongest year in our history, achieving record growth in net new accounts, volume, revenue, operating income, earnings and free cash flow. We delivered these results while absorbing meaningful macroeconomic headwinds affecting our credit business, the revenue and income effects of lower interest rates, idiosyncratic pressure on the travel and events verticals and the initial step down of volumes from eBay post operating agreement.
These headwinds persist as we move into 2021, and yet, our core business continues to perform at unprecedented levels. Our addressable opportunity has never been more expansive, and we're confident we've never been better positioned to capture the benefits of this accelerated secular growth. 
We believe the effects of the pandemic on consumer behavior and business transformation are enduring and sustainable. We also expect e-commerce to drive continued strong payment volume and transaction growth globally. While it appears that additional stimulus measures will support the path toward a more sustained economic recovery, the backdrop continues to evolve and much remains uncertain. And as we've commented on several occasions over the past 9 months, we're focused on balancing transparency with certainty as we develop our outlook. It's with these considerations that we're providing our full year guidance, which is our best estimate at this time. 
For the full year, our plans contemplate TPV growth in the high 20% range. We expect to generate revenue of approximately $25.5 billion, representing growth of approximately 19% based on current spot rates. Included in our guidance is a headwind to revenue growth of approximately 400 basis points from eBay's managed payments transition. In addition, our current forecast contemplates an approximate 200 basis point impact from foreign currency translation as the U.S. dollar has weakened relative to 2020. 
As we've discussed previously, in 2021, we will absorb the greatest revenue impact from the loss of volumes from eBay. In the face of this pressure, we're pleased to be guiding spot revenue growth at 19%. Equally important, once we are beyond the eBay transition, we expect our rates of growth for total payment volume, revenue and earnings to accelerate. 
In 2021, we also expect to deliver approximately 17% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. This earnings guidance contemplates ongoing elevated levels of organic investment. We believe the structural tailwinds for PayPal have never been stronger. To fully realize these opportunities, strengthen our competitive positioning and advance our leadership in digital payments, sustained investment in our business is critical.
Cost discipline, together with our ability to efficiently scale our payments platform, will allow us to generate modest operating margin expansion in 2021. In addition, we anticipate that below the line factors, namely higher interest expense and a higher tax rate in 2021 relative to 2020, will offset much of this margin expansion. For the full year, we expect to generate approximately $6 billion in free cash flow. 
Before I discuss our Q1 guidance, I'd like to contextualize how to think about the trajectory of our revenue and earnings performance for the year. This year, there are several dynamics that we believe will contribute to more variability in our year-over-year growth rates from quarter-to-quarter than our historic trends. These include lapping our 2020 performance, this year's cadence of planned investments and product introductions, the roll off of eBay volumes and our timing expectations related to the recovery of travel and events volumes and of a more normalized growth in our credit portfolio. 
Underlying our guidance for 19% revenue growth on a spot basis is our expectation that we will report our highest rate of revenue growth for the year in the first quarter, followed by relatively stable, but more moderate growth in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021. Our full year earnings guidance of 17% growth also contemplates delivering the highest rate of growth in Q1. 
In the second quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings to be relatively flat year-over-year, primarily due to the outsized EPS growth we experienced in Q2 last year, which exceeded 49% as well as the expected timing of our investment spend. Then, in the back half of 2021, we expect a meaningful and sequential reacceleration in earnings growth. 
Importantly, throughout the year, we expect the absolute dollar performance of our business to be very strong. As we move through the year, we'll keep you updated on how we're tracking relative to this expected cadence. Consistent with my earlier comments, in the first quarter, we expect revenue growth of approximately 28% on a spot basis, with non-GAAP earnings growth of approximately 50%. 
In summary, last year was a year like no other. But in all of the turmoil and difficulty that people encountered, one thing was clear in our business. PayPal has never been more relevant and needed than we are right now. Our industry, our company is moving forward.
The next 5 years will be very different than the last 5, and we're striving to shape that outcome, that future, a future where e-commerce and digital payments are not just a fallback when one can't make it to a physical store or don't want to handle cash, but instead a necessity, a necessity that is sought out as the preferred way for people to transact every single day. It's a future where I expect that our scale, our brand of trust and security and our leading solutions for merchants and consumers alike, will allow us to continue to create immense value for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

With respect to offsetting the headwind from eBay, the fact that we're expanding or better said that our projected guidance suggests that we're expanding our operating margins would certainly indicate that we think between the momentum in the business and the additional initiatives combined that we can offset the pressure related to eBay.
Certainly, the initiatives, all initiatives, taking a while to ramp up. The bulk of our new initiatives are really -- we would expect the financial impact to be in the second half of the year. But when you combine that with the momentum in the business, it certainly allows us to offset that headwind."

And I've got other product managers that are hanging on the answer. So look, we put out a couple of big initiatives into the market from our in-store to our crypto, to our buy now, pay later. And honestly, all of them surpassed our internal projections, and they all are creating a halo impact that is really pleasing to see. I talked about kind of QR having a 19% halo effect. 
Crypto started off with a bang and just kept going and is continuing to go. But in a surprise winner, if I had the envelope, I would talk about buy now, pay later, honestly, as surprising me most to the upside. I -- since I've been here, I've never seen a product launch with that kind of scale so quickly. I mean, we talked about moving into the U.S. in October, we announced. And we had almost 3 million customers using buy now, pay later at hundreds of thousands of merchants. By the way, that's not the total number of transaction. We already saw in the quarter a 40% repeat rate on that as well. And so it's not just that you add customers in it, I mean, they're just voting with their feet and moving forward. And we think that we have a value proposition that is second to none out there. 
First of all, we've got 350 million customers that we can bring that trust PayPal. We know them. And so our approval rates are higher, we think, than anybody else out there when people sign up for buy now, pay later. Second, it is no incremental cost to the merchant. I mean all of the other competitors charge a pretty significant incremental cost. And for us, we're just charging the same take rate that the merchant has. It's very, very light integration, which is why we saw well over 10,000 merchants integrate buy now, pay later up the funnel, really on the product pages and not at checkout, and we're beginning to see more and more of that as we come into the year. 
Another thing that's really interesting to me, here, the halo effect, by the way, very early days. The halo effect is about 15% increase in TPV. And we think all of that TPV so far is incremental TPV for us. But the other thing is we're seeing a meaningful double-digit reduction in the cost of those transactions as well. And so when you look at kind of the scale, when you look at the value proposition, the take-up of merchants and that's continuing on into the first quarter, this is clearly a home run for us and a winner. And it is not to dismiss any of my other favorite kids to say they all had great years, but buy now, pay later was probably the biggest surprise."

But I think there's 2 really important points to consider when we think about acquisitions for PayPal. The first is that we are somewhat unique in the fintech ecosystem insofar as we enjoy outsized growth rates, but we also are extremely profitable, and that results in the type of free cash flow generation with 20% plus free cash flow margins. And that -- it's that uniqueness that allows us the ability to have this effectively an asset where we can go out and look at inorganic opportunities to complement what we're doing organically. So I think that's one important point to think about. 
The second, and it really gets to your point around where some valuations are, but we exercise a tremendous amount of discipline in the way that we look at this. And from an overall capital allocation perspective, our view is every dollar of capital has to compete with the other alternatives out there, whether that be organic, whether that be returning cash to shareholders or going out and acquiring a company. And so we will remain disciplined and really view our acquisitive strategy over a multiyear longer-term time frame."

And in 2020, we put out more products and services than we've ever put out before. I said in my remarks that we're going to step-up that pace in 2021, and we're going to go do that. When I look at all the investment we've made over the past 5-plus years in our tech infrastructure, in our compliance and risk management, what that's enabled us to do now is pretty radically accelerate the amount of software releases that we have. 
We put out last year between config releases and software releases some 60,000 releases. That was up 30% year-over-year at the time that we're all working from home. So our productivity has gone way up. Our developer toolkits are much improved. They're using modern programming language. We have a service-oriented architecture. And by the way, all that's happening, while the number of bugs has gone down 25% in all of our releases from 2019 levels. 
And so I'm really happy with the pace of organic innovation and our ability to deliver products, and that takes away a lot of our need to do acquisition.
I would just build on John's point. We obviously have a strong balance sheet, strong cash flow. We will be acquisitive going forward. But we're going to look at that, as John said, in a very disciplined manner. We're going to look at talent, type of acquisitions, working to do maybe a smaller acquisition to bring in great talent in a particular area. We'll look at geographic types of acquisitions where we may want to go after a geography, and there may be a player or 2 there that could help us leapfrog into that market, and we'll look at that carefully. 
And if there's a real capability that -- not that we can't develop and do, but it's going to take us too long to get there because of what we're trying to do on our road map, then we would take a look at that as well. Those are kind of the basic areas, I would say. So I think we've got a good one-two punch between what we can do internally and what we can do from an inorganic perspective."

Does that -- I guess, first, does that underscore the incremental adds, your confidence that the incremental adds in 2020 will really not pull forward, but they're just new demographics. And just looking off of last year, if you could walk us through the different drivers, whether it's geography or products, giving you the confidence in adding 50 million net new actives in '21 versus the prepandemic 35 million or so levels, would be great."

Yes, Darrin, I think when we look at the cohort of net new actives from last year, it's clearly incremental people coming on. The -- over 50 demographic, 50 years old demographic, one of our strongest growth vectors that we've had. So you're really seeing new demographics come onto the platform. But what's really interesting to me is the engagement metrics of that cohort are also up substantially. We have double-digit increases in value for net new active. Our 90-day engagement rates are up 13% plus over traditional cohorts. 
If you look at a normalized transaction for active spend, because this kind of gets a little bit lost because we're including Honey net new actives in the denominator. And we also, as you said, we put on 72.7 million net new actives last year. If you normalize that for 37 million that we would put on, on a typical year because when you put somebody onto the platform, they don't have all the transactions because they all didn't come in on January 1, they come in throughout the year. And so that puts pressure on it.
But our TPA, which is a real measure of engagement, normalized basis would have grown 11.5%, like that's above any trend line that we have up to about 45.1x a year. And so our churn rates, in general, because of that, are coming down. And when you have a base as big as ours right now, it is as much, maybe even more about the churn rate than it is the new adds coming in. There is plenty of demand to come on to our platform.
But when we see churn reduction like we're seeing right now because of increased engagement, and that increased engagement is coming because people are just moving online and because we have these new products that are out right now that people are just using a ton of more, like crypto is a great example. Everyone who has signed up for crypto is opening up their wallet app 2x the level of what they did previous. 
And so I think that 50 million is a real good guide right now. We'll obviously update as we go on. But we're seeing a lot of really encouraging trends in the underlying cohorts that we're bringing on, which gives a lot of confidence to that 50 million number."

So let me just -- I'll take them in reverse order. We still are seeing elevated levels of debit, and that's consistent with what others have said across the ecosystem, though not at the levels that we saw",501,"Sure, David, you packed in a lot in that question. So let me just -- I'll take them in reverse order. We still are seeing elevated levels of debit, and that's consistent with what others have said across the ecosystem, though not at the levels that we saw in 2Q and likely driven by the impact of stimulus measures at that point in time. 
Braintree continues to perform very well for us, but it really suffers the brunt of the impact from the travel and events vertical, which was down 50%, 5-0 percent, for us. And so that's -- it's a pretty meaningful impact when you consider that that's in excess of 10% of our volume.
But when you look at the areas of leverage for our business, so I think we'll continue to see strong core PayPal trends, PayPal volume. And those tend to come at a higher transaction margin. But at the same time, we've seen record performance in transaction expense and transaction losses. And those -- transaction expense will be impacted more by the mixes in our business, but we expect those will be below the levels that we entered this pandemic with, and we expect transaction losses to stay at these levels. We're performing very well there. 
But as you think about the remainder of our income statement, if you will, and all the other sort of non-volume-related expenses, we've invested a lot, obviously, in the back half of last year, and our guidance assumes that as well. But we also demonstrate the ability for our business to scale very efficiently. 
And so if you just -- we don't give expense guidance for the year, but you can back into it based upon our revenue and earnings growth. And that expense growth that we're assuming in 2021, about 75% of that is related to investments we're making in the business, discretionary go-to-market initiatives, all of the things we're doing to help accelerate or continue these trends. And so that leaves the remainder 25%, which is really just demonstrating the scalability of our model.
And I'll end my question with one data point that, I think, is reflective of how successful that model is. And so you know, David, I often talk about the incremental margins in our business. And meaning -- so for every dollar of revenue that we brought in, in the quarter, what was the profitability related to that? And in the fourth quarter, the organic incremental operating margin was 32% for PayPal. So for every new dollar of revenue we're bringing in, it's got a higher margin on it than what the rest of the business does.
That's a model that we find very appealing and one that we want to continue to keep our foot on the gas on. And that's why that, even in a year like 2021, when we have meaningful investment in our business, we can still, at least, guide to a point where we're expecting modest operating margin expansion."

We sit here in February of 2021, and there's still uncertainty. There's uncertainty with the level of stimulus measures, the pace of the vaccine roll-out. But there are some things that we've seen that certainly give us a lot more confidence than where we stood 9 months ago sort of at the peak of the concern and trepidation that people had around what could happen to the economy and the impact on everyone's respective company.
Some of the trends that we're seeing that Dan talked about in his prepared remarks, they're definitely sustainable. And there's this movement to digitization and the pull forward of e-commerce that certainly stands to benefit us and others in this space.
But we provided sort of an approximate number, right? We said approximately 19%. There's not a range around it, like we normally do because, quite frankly, that range would be somewhat artificial or arbitrary. It's -- there are a wide range of outcomes that could happen. But we feel pretty good about what we see in the business. And I think it's important to note that we are a pretty diversified portfolio of products. And so we're not just reliant on one thing.
And I'll give one example before I close my answer, but the travel and events portfolio. So I mentioned that in an earlier answer, like our baseline assumption on that 19% revenue growth is that as the -- as people begin receiving vaccines, there's pent-up demand for travel. People want to take that summer vacation in 2020 that they missed. 
And so we're assuming that we start to see a rebound in travel and events in the second quarter. And that certainly stands to benefit the Braintree side of our business. But if things aren't, if that's not the case, then likely there's been other concerns that result in people sort of lacking mobility that still stands to benefit us on the core PayPal business. So it's -- I know it's 11 months out that we're projecting here. But as we've moved through this, we've gotten more confident with some of the trends that we're seeing and feel really good about that guide."

Thanks for the question, Colin. So obviously, we're really pleased that we now own 100% of GoPay. And we're the first and so far the only foreign payments company to operate a full domestic payments business in China. And that, obviou",457,"Yes. I'll take this. Thanks for the question, Colin. So obviously, we're really pleased that we now own 100% of GoPay. And we're the first and so far the only foreign payments company to operate a full domestic payments business in China. And that, obviously, gives us a very strong legal foundation for the business we have there and for the business that we intend to drive.
Very recently, Deputy Governor Pan from the PBOC had an article in the Financial Times. That was really kind of this clear statement of China's commitment to trying to strike the right balance between innovation along with prudent regulation. And that plays right into what we want to do inside the market. We really want to work with the regulators there on both of those objectives and assure that we've got both safe and secure digital commerce. And we really have 3 goals over the next couple of years in China. 
So first, obviously, is to make sure we invest to have the right compliant infrastructure inside China. The second is to really leverage all of our cross-border expertise, and that goes in 2 directions. First, we want to significantly increase the amount of cross-border that Chinese merchants can get from the 350 million consumers we have outside of China. And we also want to work inside China to have Chinese consumers purchase from the 29 million merchants that we have outside of China. 
Both of those are already growing elements, and we think that those can grow quite nicely in the years to come, and it really plays into our strengths. The third thing, though, is that we do want to work within the ecosystem inside of China with companies like China UnionPay, with the banks there, with the tech platform companies there as well to drive new types of payment services or incremental payment services inside the domestic market, like that could be payouts, it could be some unbranded full stack processing. It could be QR codes.
For instance, I'll just give you an example. China is holding the Olympics in the next couple of years. There's going to be a tremendous amount of visitors going into China. And we want our QR codes to be deployed so that people coming in to China don't necessarily have to download WeChat Pay or Ant, and can use their PayPal wallet inside China to make purchases at merchants.
And I think there's a lot of ways that we can leverage our strength, the strength of our partners inside China and our strong regulatory relationship that we have right now to both grow cross-border and then to start to slowly, but surely add incremental services into the domestic market as well."

Dan, that's a great question, kind of goes at the heart of a lot of our strategy. And we're going to be talking a lot about that at our Investor Day next week as well.
So let me just very quickly say that we are seeing engagement levels already. I talked about it. If you normalize for Honey and all the incremental net new actives that we brought in that are bending our traditional curves. We've never really been above 9% or 10%. Normalized, we're at about 11.5% of growth. Our churn rates are down. All of the new functionality that we've put into place, whether that be crypto or that be buy now, pay later, the Venmo card, QR codes, are adding to usage.
They're adding incremental TPV, they're adding incremental transactions. Once stat I didn't mention is that people who use a PayPal product in store. And again, these are early days on this, but those that are using it in-store, we're seeing, Dan, 54 incremental transactions that are just in-store, that don't displace the online.
It's just -- it's basically doubling the number of transactions we have. And so as we start to build out our digital wallet really into this super app that transcends across payments, commerce and financial services, all of that on a common platform, all of that leveraging, common data elements and machine learning on top of that to give next best recommendations, I think we are going to see, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, a real bend in the historic rate of engagement. And it's going to be all around that super app functionality in that digital wallet, moving well beyond just payments. 
So I think, Dan, thank you for a great kind of closing question. And I want to thank everybody for your time today. And I really hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. And we are looking forward to speaking with all of you again next week at our Investor Day. So thank you for your time, and everybody take care. Bye-bye."

I'm pleased to report that PayPal just completed the strongest year in our history, achieving record growth in net new active customers, volume, revenue, operating income, earnings and free cash flow. Consumers and businesses of all sizes have embraced a new digital era, erasing the distinction between online and off-line.
A digital-first world is no longer our future. It's our current reality, and it will forever change the way we interact across almost all elements of our lives.
At the beginning of the pandemic, consumers in lockdown had no choice but to do all of their shopping online. Today, the vast majority of consumers state that post pandemic, they will continue to shop online at their current elevated levels because it is more convenient, easier and saves time. Retailers are rapidly adapting to a new landscape, adjusting their strategy from encouraging consumers to visit their stores to optimizing for home delivery. The pandemic has accelerated a digital wave of change across almost every industry by 3 to 5 years, unleashing a profound and permanent structural transformation. Our results in Q4 highlight these strengths. 
In the quarter, we added 16 million net new active customers, including an incremental 1.4 million new merchants. For the year, we delivered a record 73 million net new actives, ending the year with 377 million active accounts, up 24%. We now have over 29 million merchants interacting with nearly 350 million consumers. In 2021, we expect to add another 50 million net new active accounts. 
Equally important, our daily active users remain elevated versus a year ago, up 29% from Q4 of 2019. Our expanding scale and increasing engagement drove a record 4.4 billion transactions in the quarter, up 27%. Our total payment volumes in Q4 were $277 billion, up 36% on an FXN basis.
Our TPV, excluding eBay, was up a record 40% percent as we continue to gain market share. eBay TPV grew at 1% and exited the year at just under 6% of our total volume. For the full year, our TPV was up 31% to $936 billion. In Q2 of 2020, our quarterly revenue surpassed $5 billion for the first time. In Q4, we surpassed $6 billion for the first time, with our quarterly revenues growing by 23% to $6.116 billion. 
For the year, our revenues grew by a record 22% on an FX-neutral basis to $21.45 billion. Our non-GAAP EPS grew a record 31% to $3.88, and our free cash flow increased by 48% of to $5 billion. 
Venmo continued its strong performance with Q4 TPV of $47 billion, up 60% year-over-year. Venmo's customer base grew by 32% in 2020, ending just shy of 70 million active accounts. This continued momentum reinforces our conviction that revenues will approach $900 million in 2021. 
In early January, eligible customers were able to cash their stimulus checks within the Venmo app for the first time. Later this month, our Venmo credit card will be available to 100% of our base. And in the coming months, we will launch the ability to buy, hold and sell crypto via the Venmo app. And finally, our revamped Pay with Venmo experience will launch in Q2, offering a best-in-class checkout experience. 
Today's digital reality is rapidly accelerating the need for a digital wallet that encompasses payments, financial services and shopping. This year, our digital wallet will change more than it has ever changed before, significantly increasing its functionality within a single, integrated and beautifully designed app, that should meaningfully increase consumer engagement.
In 2020, we made significant progress in expanding the functionality of our PayPal and Venmo wallets. We added the ability to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies, the option to buy now and pay later, direct deposit, check cashing and bill payment capabilities. We introduced Venmo and PayPal QR codes for in-store purchasing as well as our Venmo credit card. This year, we expect to work with our financial industry partners to introduce even more functionality, including budget and savings tools, investment alternatives, including, but not limited to crypto, and enhanced bill pay options.
We also intend to fully integrate the entire suite of Honey's shopping tools, including wish lists, price monitoring, deals, coupons and rewards for use in the physical and digital worlds. 
I'm very pleased with the early reception of our PayPal and Venmo QR codes, which are now accepted at over 600,000 retail locations. In 2020, we signed 29 large enterprises, including CVS, Foot Locker, Nike, Five Below, Levi's, Bloomingdales, Macy's and Uniqlo, and our early in-store results are encouraging. Merchants are experiencing double-digit increases in average basket sizes with consumers who frequently use our QR codes. And we are seeing a 19% increase in TPV from consumers who use our QR codes. 
Across all of our in-store efforts, including QR, tap and pay and cards, we processed over $20 billion of TPV, with almost 10 million consumers using PayPal in store. We also saw an exceptional response from our crypto launch. Even with high initial expectations, the volume of crypto traded on our platform greatly exceeded our projections. 
We are excited to build upon this early success by allowing customers to use their crypto balance as a funding source whenever they shop at our 29 million merchants. We anticipate the rollout of that capability to begin late this quarter, and we hope to launch our first international market in the next several months. 
These initial steps are just the beginning of an extensive road map around crypto, blockchain and digital currencies. We are already working with the regulators and central banks to reimagine and shape the next-generation of the financial system, as consumers no longer want to handle cash. 
We all know the current financial system is antiquated. And we can envision a future where transactions are completed in seconds not days, a future where transactions should be less expensive to complete and a future that enables all people to be part of the digital economy, not just the affluent. We are significantly investing in our new crypto, blockchain and digital currencies business unit in order to help shape this more inclusive future. 
I would also highlight the rapid growth of our buy now, pay later functionality. We saw tremendous and growing demand throughout the quarter and witnessed the fastest start to any product we have ever launched. Millions of consumers transacted at hundreds of thousands of merchants in Q4 alone. As with QR codes, we are seeing a meaningful halo effect on overall transactions and TPV, including over $750 million of TPV in our first quarter out of the gate.
It's exciting to see that each new service we launch drives incremental increases in our overall consumer lifetime value. Consequently, I would expect that our engagement levels will increase beyond our historic run rates. 
I'm proud to see that the PayPal platform was especially leveraged during the pandemic for philanthropic giving and community support, enabling over $17 billion for charities and those in need. And we also put our $535 million commitment to black and minority-owned businesses and communities into action. We have already invested over 50% of those committed dollars, and we plan to report on their impact as results come in. 
We have entered the next chapter in PayPal's history. The efforts of our employees, along with the investments we have made over the past 5 years, have transformed our technical and compliance infrastructure, enabling rapid product development. We released more products and services in 2020 than in any previous year, and we will step-up that pace in 2021. 
Merchants and consumers are turning to PayPal in record numbers as we accelerate into the digital age. Our opportunities, over the next 5 years, have never been greater. We remain focused on democratizing financial services, assuring that everyone has access and can thrive in the new digital paradigm. We intend to shape that future, and in doing so, become one of the world's leading digital payments, financial services, and commerce platforms. 
I look forward to expanding on this vision during our Investor Day next week. With that, I will turn the call over to John."
112732,700996472,2236095,"PayPal Holdings, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,"Earnings Calls","PayPal Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. I want to start off by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver a record-breaking year. 2020 was pivotal for PayPal and the broader payments industry, marked by rapid acceleration in digitization, cash displacemen",1740,"Thanks, Dan. I want to start off by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver a record-breaking year. 2020 was pivotal for PayPal and the broader payments industry, marked by rapid acceleration in digitization, cash displacement and e-commerce adoption. These secular trends have been shaping our sector for some time.
That said, the rate of change we experienced last year, resulting from the widespread implications of the COVID pandemic, was profound and transformative. Crisis, which has led to hardship and suffering for so many, increased the urgency across our organization to serve our customers in new and innovative ways. Notably, the isolation defined by lockdowns and working from home actually resulted in greater collaboration and brought our teams closer together. We've entered 2021 energized by a greater sense of purpose and responsibility and ready to build on our strong momentum. 
Now to our fourth quarter results. Total payment volume grew 36% on a currency-neutral basis. This is the strongest quarterly growth we've reported in history and represents 14 points of acceleration from 2019. Our merchant services volume grew 40%, another record for PayPal, accelerating each quarter in 2020. Volume contribution from eBay Marketplaces continued to decline. We exited December with eBay representing less than 6% of our overall volume. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 23% on both a spot and currency-neutral basis to $6.1 billion. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, U.S. revenue grew 18%, and international revenue grew 29% as the U.S. has a greater proportion of revenue from credit and the travel and events verticals. Transaction revenue grew 25%, representing 8 points of acceleration from last year on a spot basis. This growth was primarily driven by strength across our core PayPal business, including strong cross border activity. 
Our core payments platform continues to deliver exceptional growth, with transaction revenue, excluding revenue from eBay, growing 30% in the fourth quarter, also an acceleration of 8 basis points from 2019. 
Other value-added services revenue increased 1% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting incremental Honey revenue, offset by lower interest income on customer balances and less credit revenue. Honey contributed approximately 1.7 points of growth to total revenue and approximately 20 points of growth to other value-added services revenue.
In the fourth quarter, transaction take rate was 2.05%, and total take rate was 2.21%. The 22 basis point decline in transaction take rate resulted primarily from changes in volume mix with eBay's contribution continuing to decline, bill payment and P2P volumes accelerating and a reduction of $97 million in international transaction revenue from foreign currency hedges. The 28 basis point decline in total take rate resulted from these factors as well as lower value-added services revenue. 
In the fourth quarter, our volume-based expense performance was exceptional. These expenses delivered 216 basis points of leverage in the quarter, increasing 18% to $2.7 billion. Transaction expense improved 12 basis points as a rate of TPV to 84 basis points, driven by both volume mix and funding mix. Transaction losses improved 5 basis points to a record low rate of 10 basis points. Credit losses were 3 basis points as a rate of TPV. 
Our credit loss reserve coverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 23%, decreasing slightly from the third quarter. The combination of strong revenue and volume-based expense performance resulted in transaction margin dollars increasing 28% to $3.4 billion. In the fourth quarter, we generated incremental transaction margin dollars of $753 million, more than 2x the incremental contribution last year. 
Nontransaction-related expenses grew 28%, reflecting increased investments in our key strategic priorities as well as growth related to our acquisitions. This higher level of investment contributed to a 56% increase in sales and marketing expenses and a 27% increase in technology and development spending in the quarter. Leverage across customer support and operations and general and administrative expenses partially offset this increased level of investment. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income in the fourth quarter grew 29% to $1.5 billion. Our operating margin was 24.7%, expanding more than 100 basis points and representing our strongest performance for any fourth quarter. We continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver operating efficiencies and scale our platform at low incremental cost, while investing in our strategic growth priorities.
Non-GAAP other income declined by $62 million relative to last year, driven by reduced interest income from lower interest rates and higher interest expense from our debt issuance last May. The negative impact on non-GAAP EPS from the decline in other income was offset by a lower effective tax rate. 
For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP EPS grew 29% to $1.08. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.2 billion. In addition, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, representing 50% growth from fourth quarter last year. 
I'd now like to discuss our guidance for the full year and the first quarter. We've just completed the strongest year in our history, achieving record growth in net new accounts, volume, revenue, operating income, earnings and free cash flow. We delivered these results while absorbing meaningful macroeconomic headwinds affecting our credit business, the revenue and income effects of lower interest rates, idiosyncratic pressure on the travel and events verticals and the initial step down of volumes from eBay post operating agreement.
These headwinds persist as we move into 2021, and yet, our core business continues to perform at unprecedented levels. Our addressable opportunity has never been more expansive, and we're confident we've never been better positioned to capture the benefits of this accelerated secular growth. 
We believe the effects of the pandemic on consumer behavior and business transformation are enduring and sustainable. We also expect e-commerce to drive continued strong payment volume and transaction growth globally. While it appears that additional stimulus measures will support the path toward a more sustained economic recovery, the backdrop continues to evolve and much remains uncertain. And as we've commented on several occasions over the past 9 months, we're focused on balancing transparency with certainty as we develop our outlook. It's with these considerations that we're providing our full year guidance, which is our best estimate at this time. 
For the full year, our plans contemplate TPV growth in the high 20% range. We expect to generate revenue of approximately $25.5 billion, representing growth of approximately 19% based on current spot rates. Included in our guidance is a headwind to revenue growth of approximately 400 basis points from eBay's managed payments transition. In addition, our current forecast contemplates an approximate 200 basis point impact from foreign currency translation as the U.S. dollar has weakened relative to 2020. 
As we've discussed previously, in 2021, we will absorb the greatest revenue impact from the loss of volumes from eBay. In the face of this pressure, we're pleased to be guiding spot revenue growth at 19%. Equally important, once we are beyond the eBay transition, we expect our rates of growth for total payment volume, revenue and earnings to accelerate. 
In 2021, we also expect to deliver approximately 17% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. This earnings guidance contemplates ongoing elevated levels of organic investment. We believe the structural tailwinds for PayPal have never been stronger. To fully realize these opportunities, strengthen our competitive positioning and advance our leadership in digital payments, sustained investment in our business is critical.
Cost discipline, together with our ability to efficiently scale our payments platform, will allow us to generate modest operating margin expansion in 2021. In addition, we anticipate that below the line factors, namely higher interest expense and a higher tax rate in 2021 relative to 2020, will offset much of this margin expansion. For the full year, we expect to generate approximately $6 billion in free cash flow. 
Before I discuss our Q1 guidance, I'd like to contextualize how to think about the trajectory of our revenue and earnings performance for the year. This year, there are several dynamics that we believe will contribute to more variability in our year-over-year growth rates from quarter-to-quarter than our historic trends. These include lapping our 2020 performance, this year's cadence of planned investments and product introductions, the roll off of eBay volumes and our timing expectations related to the recovery of travel and events volumes and of a more normalized growth in our credit portfolio. 
Underlying our guidance for 19% revenue growth on a spot basis is our expectation that we will report our highest rate of revenue growth for the year in the first quarter, followed by relatively stable, but more moderate growth in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021. Our full year earnings guidance of 17% growth also contemplates delivering the highest rate of growth in Q1. 
In the second quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings to be relatively flat year-over-year, primarily due to the outsized EPS growth we experienced in Q2 last year, which exceeded 49% as well as the expected timing of our investment spend. Then, in the back half of 2021, we expect a meaningful and sequential reacceleration in earnings growth. 
Importantly, throughout the year, we expect the absolute dollar performance of our business to be very strong. As we move through the year, we'll keep you updated on how we're tracking relative to this expected cadence. Consistent with my earlier comments, in the first quarter, we expect revenue growth of approximately 28% on a spot basis, with non-GAAP earnings growth of approximately 50%. 
In summary, last year was a year like no other. But in all of the turmoil and difficulty that people encountered, one thing was clear in our business. PayPal has never been more relevant and needed than we are right now. Our industry, our company is moving forward.
The next 5 years will be very different than the last 5, and we're striving to shape that outcome, that future, a future where e-commerce and digital payments are not just a fallback when one can't make it to a physical store or don't want to handle cash, but instead a necessity, a necessity that is sought out as the preferred way for people to transact every single day. It's a future where I expect that our scale, our brand of trust and security and our leading solutions for merchants and consumers alike, will allow us to continue to create immense value for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

With respect to offsetting the headwind from eBay, the fact that we're expanding or better said that our projected guidance suggests that we're expanding our operating margins would certainly indicate that we think between the momentum in the business and the additional initiatives combined that we can offset the pressure related to eBay.
Certainly, the initiatives, all initiatives, taking a while to ramp up. The bulk of our new initiatives are really -- we would expect the financial impact to be in the second half of the year. But when you combine that with the momentum in the business, it certainly allows us to offset that headwind."

And I've got other product managers that are hanging on the answer. So look, we put out a couple of big initiatives into the market from our in-store to our crypto, to our buy now, pay later. And honestly, all of them surpassed our internal projections, and they all are creating a halo impact that is really pleasing to see. I talked about kind of QR having a 19% halo effect. 
Crypto started off with a bang and just kept going and is continuing to go. But in a surprise winner, if I had the envelope, I would talk about buy now, pay later, honestly, as surprising me most to the upside. I -- since I've been here, I've never seen a product launch with that kind of scale so quickly. I mean we talked about moving into the U.S. in October, we announced. And we had almost 3 million customers using buy now, pay later at hundreds of thousands of merchants. By the way, that's not the total number of transaction. We already saw in the quarter a 40% repeat rate on that as well. And so it's not just that you add customers in it, I mean, they're just voting with their feet and moving forward. And we think that we have a value proposition that is second to none out there. 
First of all, we've got 350 million customers that we can bring that trust PayPal. We know them. And so our approval rates are higher, we think, than anybody else out there when people sign up for buy now, pay later. Second, it is no incremental cost to the merchant. I mean all of the other competitors charge a pretty significant incremental cost. And for us, we're just charging the same take rate that the merchant has. It's very, very light integration, which is why we saw well over 10,000 merchants integrate buy now, pay later up the funnel, really on the product pages and not at checkout, and we're beginning to see more and more of that as we come into the year. 
Another thing that's really interesting to me, here, the halo effect, by the way, very early days. The halo effect is about 15% increase in TPV. And we think all of that TPV so far is incremental TPV for us. But the other thing is we're seeing a meaningful double-digit reduction in the cost of those transactions as well. And so when you look at kind of the scale, when you look at the value proposition, the take-up of merchants and that's continuing on into the first quarter, this is clearly a home run for us and a winner. And it is not to dismiss any of my other favorite kids to say they all had great years, but buy now, pay later was probably the biggest surprise."

But I think there's 2 really important points to consider when we think about acquisitions for PayPal. The first is that we are somewhat unique in the fintech ecosystem insofar as we enjoy outsized growth rates, but we also are extremely profitable, and that results in the type of free cash flow generation with 20% plus free cash flow margins. And that -- it's that uniqueness that allows us the ability to have this effectively an asset where we can go out and look at inorganic opportunities to complement what we're doing organically. So I think that's one important point to think about. 
The second, and it really gets to your point around where some valuations are, but we exercise a tremendous amount of discipline in the way that we look at this. And from an overall capital allocation perspective, our view is every dollar of capital has to compete with the other alternatives out there, whether that be organic, whether that be returning cash to shareholders or going out and acquiring a company. And so we will remain disciplined and really view our acquisitive strategy over a multiyear longer-term time frame."

And in 2020, we put out more products and services than we've ever put out before. I said in my remarks that we're going to step-up that pace in 2021, and we're going to go do that. When I look at all the investment we've made over the past 5-plus years in our tech infrastructure, in our compliance and risk management, what that's enabled us to do now is pretty radically accelerate the amount of software releases that we have. 
We put out last year between config releases and software releases some 60,000 releases. That was up 30% year-over-year at the time that we're all working from home. So our productivity has gone way up. Our developer toolkits are much improved. They're using modern programming language. We have a service-oriented architecture. And by the way, all that's happening, while the number of bugs has gone down 25% in all of our releases from 2019 levels. 
And so I'm really happy with the pace of organic innovation and our ability to deliver products, and that takes away a lot of our need to do acquisition.
I would just build on John's point. We obviously have a strong balance sheet, strong cash flow. We will be acquisitive going forward. But we're going to look at that, as John said, in a very disciplined manner. We're going to look at talent, type of acquisitions, working to do maybe a smaller acquisition to bring in great talent in a particular area. We'll look at geographic types of acquisitions where we may want to go after a geography, and there may be a player or 2 there that could help us leapfrog into that market, and we'll look at that carefully. 
And if there's a real capability that -- not that we can't develop and do, but it's going to take us too long to get there because of what we're trying to do on our road map, then we would take a look at that as well. Those are kind of the basic areas, I would say. So I think we've got a good one-two punch between what we can do internally and what we can do from an inorganic perspective."

Does that -- I guess, first, does that underscore the incremental adds, your confidence that the incremental adds in 2020 will really not pull forward, but they're just new demographics.

Yes, Darrin, I think when we look at the cohort of net new actives from last year, it's clearly incremental people coming on. The -- over 50 demographic, 50 years old demographic, one of our strongest growth vectors that we've had. So you're really seeing new demographics come onto the platform. But what's really interesting to me is the engagement metrics of that cohort are also up substantially. We have double-digit increases in value for net new active. Our 90-day engagement rates are up 13% plus over traditional cohorts. 
If you look at a normalized transaction for active spend, because this kind of gets a little bit lost because we're including Honey net new actives in the denominator. And we also, as you said, we put on 72.7 million net new actives last year. If you normalize that for 37 million that we would put on, on a typical year because when you put somebody onto the platform, they don't have all the transactions because they all didn't come in on January 1, they come in throughout the year. And so that puts pressure on it.
But our TPA, which is a real measure of engagement, normalized basis would have grown 11.5%, like that's above any trend line that we have up to about 45.1x a year. And so our churn rates, in general, because of that, are coming down. And when you have a base as big as ours right now, it is as much, maybe even more about the churn rate than it is the new adds coming in. There is plenty of demand to come on to our platform.
But when we see churn reduction like we're seeing right now because of increased engagement, and that increased engagement is coming because people are just moving online and because we have these new products that are out right now that people are just using a ton of more, like crypto is a great example. Everyone who has signed up for crypto is opening up their wallet app 2x the level of what they did previous. 
And so I think that 50 million is a real good guide right now. We'll obviously update as we go on. But we're seeing a lot of really encouraging trends in the underlying cohorts that we're bringing on, which gives a lot of confidence to that 50 million number."

So let me just -- I'll take them in reverse order. We still are seeing elevated levels of debit, and that's consistent with what others have said across the ecosystem, though not at the levels that we saw in 2Q and likely driven by the impact of stimulus measures at that point in time. 
Braintree continues to perform very well for us, but it really suffers the brunt of the impact from the travel and events vertical, which was down 50%, 5-0 percent, for us. And so that's -- it's a pretty meaningful impact when you consider that that's in excess of 10% of our volume.
But when you look at the areas of leverage for our business, so I think we'll continue to see strong core PayPal trends, PayPal volume. And those tend to come at a higher transaction margin. But at the same time, we've seen record performance in transaction expense and transaction losses. And those -- transaction expense will be impacted more by the mixes in our business, but we expect those will be below the levels that we entered this pandemic with, and we expect transaction losses to stay at these levels. We're performing very well there. 
But as you think about the remainder of our income statement, if you will, and all the other sort of non-volume-related expenses, we've invested a lot, obviously, in the back half of last year, and our guidance assumes that as well. But we also demonstrate the ability for our business to scale very efficiently. 
And so if you just -- we don't give expense guidance for the year, but you can back into it based upon our revenue and earnings growth. And that expense growth that we're assuming in 2021, about 75% of that is related to investments we're making in the business, discretionary go-to-market initiatives, all of the things we're doing to help accelerate or continue these trends. And so that leaves the remainder 25%, which is really just demonstrating the scalability of our model.
And I'll end my question with one data point that, I think, is reflective of how successful that model is. And so you know, David, I often talk about the incremental margins in our business. And meaning -- so for every dollar of revenue that we brought in, in the quarter, what was the profitability related to that? And in the fourth quarter, the organic incremental operating margin was 32% for PayPal. So for every new dollar of revenue we're bringing in, it's got a higher margin on it than what the rest of the business does.
That's a model that we find very appealing and one that we want to continue to keep our foot on the gas on. And that's why that, even in a year like 2021, when we have meaningful investment in our business, we can still, at least, guide to a point where we're expecting modest operating margin expansion."

We sit here in February of 2021, and there's still uncertainty. There's uncertainty with the level of stimulus measures, the pace of the vaccine roll-out. But there are some things that we've seen that certainly give us a lot more confidence than where we stood 9 months ago sort of at the peak of the concern and trepidation that people had around what could happen to the economy and the impact on everyone's respective company.
Some of the trends that we're seeing that Dan talked about in his prepared remarks, they're definitely sustainable. And there's this movement to digitization and the pull forward of e-commerce that certainly stands to benefit us and others in this space.
But we provided sort of an approximate number, right? We said approximately 19%. There's not a range around it, like we normally do because, quite frankly, that range would be somewhat artificial or arbitrary. It's -- there are a wide range of outcomes that could happen. But we feel pretty good about what we see in the business. And I think it's important to note that we are a pretty diversified portfolio of products. And so we're not just reliant on one thing.
And I'll give one example before I close my answer, but the travel and events portfolio. So I mentioned that in an earlier answer, like our baseline assumption on that 19% revenue growth is that as the -- as people begin receiving vaccines, there's pent-up demand for travel. People want to take that summer vacation in 2020 that they missed. 
And so we're assuming that we start to see a rebound in travel and events in the second quarter. And that certainly stands to benefit the Braintree side of our business. But if things aren't, if that's not the case, then likely there's been other concerns that result in people sort of lacking mobility that still stands to benefit us on the core PayPal business. So it's -- I know it's 11 months out that we're projecting here. But as we've moved through this, we've gotten more confident with some of the trends that we're seeing and feel really good about that guide."

So obviously, we're really pleased that we now own 100% of GoPay. And we're the first and so far the only foreign payments company to operate a full domestic payments business in China. And that, obviously, gives us a very strong legal foundation for the business we have there and for the business that we intend to drive.
Very recently, Deputy Governor Pan from the PBOC had an article in the Financial Times. That was really kind of this clear statement of China's commitment to trying to strike the right balance between innovation along with prudent regulation. And that plays right into what we want to do inside the market. We really want to work with the regulators there on both of those objectives and assure that we've got both safe and secure digital commerce. And we really have 3 goals over the next couple of years in China. 
So first, obviously, is to make sure we invest to have the right compliant infrastructure inside China. The second is to really leverage all of our cross-border expertise, and that goes in 2 directions. First, we want to significantly increase the amount of cross-border that Chinese merchants can get from the 350 million consumers we have outside of China. And we also want to work inside China to have Chinese consumers purchase from the 29 million merchants that we have outside of China. 
Both of those are already growing elements, and we think that those can grow quite nicely in the years to come, and it really plays into our strengths. The third thing, though, is that we do want to work within the ecosystem inside of China with companies like China UnionPay, with the banks there, with the tech platform companies there as well to drive new types of payment services or incremental payment services inside the domestic market, like that could be payouts, it could be some unbranded full stack processing. It could be QR codes.
For instance, I'll just give you an example. China is holding the Olympics in the next couple of years. There's going to be a tremendous amount of visitors going into China. And we want our QR codes to be deployed so that people coming in to China don't necessarily have to download WeChat Pay or Ant, and can use their PayPal wallet inside China to make purchases at merchants.
And I think there's a lot of ways that we can leverage our strength, the strength of our partners inside China and our strong regulatory relationship that we have right now to both grow cross-border and then to start to slowly, but surely add incremental services into the domestic market as well."

Dan, that's a great question, kind of goes at the heart of a lot of our strategy. And we're going to be talking a lot about that at our Investor Day next week as well.
So let me just very quickly say that we are seeing engagement levels already. I talked about it. If you normalize for Honey and all the incremental net new actives that we brought in that are bending our traditional curves. We've never really been above 9% or 10%. Normalized, we're at about 11.5% of growth. Our churn rates are down. All of the new functionality that we've put into place, whether that be crypto or that be buy now, pay later, the Venmo card, QR codes, are adding to usage.
They're adding incremental TPV, they're adding incremental transactions. Once stat I didn't mention is that people who use a PayPal product in store. And again, these are early days on this, but those that are using it in-store, we're seeing, Dan, 54 incremental transactions that are just in-store, that don't displace the online.
It's just -- it's basically doubling the number of transactions we have. And so as we start to build out our digital wallet really into this super app that transcends across payments, commerce and financial services, all of that on a common platform, all of that leveraging, common data elements and machine learning on top of that to give next best recommendations, I think we are going to see, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, a real bend in the historic rate of engagement. And it's going to be all around that super app functionality in that digital wallet, moving well beyond just payments. 
So I think, Dan, thank you for a great kind of closing question. And I want to thank everybody for your time today. And I really hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. And we are looking forward to speaking with all of you again next week at our Investor Day. So thank you for your time, and everybody take care. Bye-bye."

Customers across the w",1420,"Thanks, Gabrielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to say that on the heels of the strongest year in PayPal's history, we just completed our strongest quarter ever with record financial and operating results. Customers across the world have clearly embraced the digital economy, and PayPal has become an essential platform for both consumers and merchants. Consequently, I'm pleased to share that we are raising our annual targets for revenue, EPS, TPV and net new active accounts. 
As much of the world begins to shift its attention towards a post-pandemic recovery, we continue to see strong demand for a comprehensive set of services from both our merchants and consumers. Over the coming year, we will accelerate our customers' digital engagement through the rapid innovation of our digital wallet and merchant commerce platform. 
Our addressable market continues to significantly expand driven by accelerating secular trends and the proactive steps we are taking to become a full commerce and payments platform. We believe that the shift in consumer digital behavior will remain essentially unchanged in a post-COVID world. Consumers have expanded their digital lives into a seamless online and off-line experience. Our products are an essential enabler of the digital economy, and our mission to shape a future where everyone can participate fully in this new digital paradigm has never been more important. 
Our Q1 trends are strong across the board and were further accelerated by favorable comps from a year ago. Our TPV grew by 50% on a spot basis or 46% on an FXN basis to $285 billion. eBay now represents 5.5% of our volume, and we expect their TPV to be approximately 3% of total volumes by year-end. Excluding eBay, our MS volumes grew by an all-time high of 54% on a spot basis and 50% on an FXN basis. 
Our transactions in the quarter were approximately 4.4 billion, growing 34% year-over-year. We added 14.5 million net new active accounts, ending the quarter with 392 million active accounts, up 21% year-over-year. We added 1.4 million new merchants in the quarter, continuing the heightened pace from prior quarters, and we now have 31 million merchant accounts on our platform. By the end of Q2, we expect to exceed 400 million active accounts. And for the year, we now believe our NNAs will be between 52 million to 55 million, up from our previous expectations of approximately 50 million last quarter. I'm particularly pleased to see our transactions per active account begin to accelerate due to increased engagement across our portfolio. 
Normalizing for Honey, our Q1 TPA grew by 8.3% and year-over-year to 44.1. We generated $6.033 billion of revenue in Q1, growing a record 31% spot and 29% on an FXN basis. eBay revenues declined 12%, and we expect they will substantially complete their migration to manage payments by year-end. On the back of this strong revenue growth, we delivered non-GAAP EPS in Q1 of $1.22, up 84%. 
Venmo continued its strong performance in Q1 with $51.4 billion of TPV, up 63% year-over-year. We recently launched the ability for Venmo customers to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies, We are heavily investing in Venmo's commerce capabilities, which include rapidly upgrading the Pay with Venmo customer experience with initial rollout beginning this quarter. The Venmo credit card is outpacing our expectations for both new accounts and transactions. And we're also making it easier for small businesses and casual sellers, to accept Venmo payments. We now have over 300,000 small business profiles currently established, including $200,000 in Q1 alone. Our Venmo Commerce TPV and revenue growth continued to accelerate, and we remain confident in our $900 million revenue target. 
We expect to roll out our next-generation digital wallet in Q3. It will be an all-in-one personalized app that will empower our users to make the most of their money and strengthen their financial lives every day. We will provide increasingly customized and unique shopping financial services and payments experiences for our customers. 
Consumers are turning to brands that they trust when it comes to choosing a super app. That clearly plays into our strength as a recent external survey of over 300,000 consumers across the globe, selected PayPal as the second most trusted brand in the world. Merchants continue to turn to PayPal in record numbers as we are now an essential platform to enable their transition into the digital economy. Small businesses who used PayPal during the peak of the pandemic saw their overall revenues grow by 25% versus a negative 9% for all other small businesses in the same time period. Small businesses who used PayPal last year drove 75% of their online sales from outside their local neighborhood, clearly expanding their addressable market. And 65% of small businesses in the U.S. who use PayPal have cross-border sales versus less than 5% of all other small businesses. Across the shopping journey, merchants who use PayPal see a substantial lift. 
According to market research reported by Nielsen, merchants with PayPal experienced 17% more repeat buyers. Their checkout completion goes up by 34%. And PayPal consumers spend an average of 12% more at PayPal merchants. And finally, PayPal consumers are loyal to PayPal merchants, buying 11% more often when PayPal is accepted. 
These are powerful facts that support our brand promise to retailers as we add more and more capabilities to our platform. For instance, our Buy Now, Pay Later product continues to move from strength to strength. In the short time from our launch, we've processed over $1 billion in TPV in the U.S. alone. Early results continue to show a significant 15% engagement lift in transactions and TPV. In addition, nearly 30,000 merchants have implemented our Buy Now, Pay Later capabilities upstream on their product pages with a corresponding lift in our overall share of checkout. 
Demand for our PayPal and Venmo QR codes and in-store payments remains strong, with an additional merchant signing up every 28 seconds. We now have nearly 1 million merchants accepting our QR codes with continued momentum across our large enterprise merchants. Our early adopters of QRC are spending 19% more TPV on the PayPal platform. Our overall in-store efforts across QR and cards equaled $6.4 billion in Q1. 
As I discussed during our Investor Day, we believe the current technological underpinnings of our financial system will be substantially upgraded over the coming years. Both cryptocurrencies and Central Bank-issued digital currencies can play a critical role in shaping a more inclusive recovery and a more equitable financial system. Our leadership in all forms of digital currency has been widely embraced, enabling numerous positive conversations with central banks, regulators and government officials around the world. 
I'm also pleased to share that we closed our Curv acquisition last month. And Curv's talented team will bolster our existing technology resources and accelerate our efforts to shape a new financial infrastructure that is efficient, low-cost and inclusive. 
We have an extensive road map ahead of us, and our innovation will be pursued in partnership with governments and in compliance with local, national and global regulatory frameworks. 
The expiration of our operating agreement with eBay has enabled us to launch an extensive partnership with Alibaba. This global agreement will enable hundreds of millions of consumers outside of China to shop across Alibaba sites in China. 
PayPal is now available as a payment method on Alibaba's wholesale marketplace as well as Ali Express, its global retail marketplace. We are excited at the pace of our current ramp and the ultimate potential of this new partnership. Additionally, our commercial agreement with FlutterWave enables businesses across Africa to have significantly more access to PayPal consumers in order to receive and make payments online. In this quarter, we also collaborated with TelR in the Middle East, allowing merchants in the UAE to accept PayPal for customers shopping online. These efforts serve to significantly broaden our reach and tap into rapidly growing marketplaces across the globe. 
We clearly have a lot of momentum as we exit Q1. We will continue to accelerate new product innovation throughout the year. Our increased expectations for 2021 reflect our conviction that we will continue to grow share and increase our addressable market by capitalizing on the accelerating shift to digital. 
I'd like to thank our employees who continue to work tirelessly on behalf of our customers. Their hard work drives our market leadership and positions us to continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. And with that, let me turn the call over to John."

I want to start by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver an outstanding quarter. We recently marked 1 year into the COVID-19 pandemic. Notwithstanding the challenges that our teams have faced, our focus on execution and culture of collaboration are allowing us to deliver very strong results. We're off to a great start to the year. In Q1, we outperformed on both revenue and earnings and built on our operational and financial momentum exiting 2020. 
In looking at our results for the quarter, the year-over-year growth rates benefit from the comparison to a softer March last year when we absorbed the most meaningful negative COVID impact. That said, our business is growing at structurally faster rates than pre-pandemic. And as a result, we're raising our guidance for this year. 
Before discussing our updated outlook, I'd like to highlight our Q1 results. Total payment volume grew 50% at spot and 46% on a currency-neutral basis. This is the strongest quarterly growth we've ever reported. Our Q1 TPV grew at a 2-year compound annual growth rate of 33%, accelerating from 30% in Q4 and reflecting our strong momentum in user growth. Notably, while we typically experience a sequential decline in volumes from Q4 to Q1, this year, our volume grew 3% quarter-over-quarter. Versus the first quarter last year, merchant services volume grew 50% currency-neutral. And volume contributed by eBay marketplaces declined 3% on the same basis. 
In Q1, eBay represented 5.5% of our volume, down 53 basis points sequentially and down 260 basis points from Q1 last year. Revenue increased a record 31% on spot basis and 29% currency neutral to $6 billion. Transaction revenue grew 33% to $5.6 billion, representing 20 points of acceleration from last year on a spot basis and 8 points of acceleration sequentially. Strong performance across core PayPal, Braintree and Venmo drove these results. Excluding eBay, transaction revenue grew 42%, indicative of the ongoing strength of our diversified 2-sided platform. 
Other value-added services revenue grew 2% on a spot basis and 1% currency neutral to $412 million. These results were driven by strengthening credit performance, which was partially offset by lower interest income on customer balances. 
In the first quarter, transaction take rate was 1.97%, and total take rate was 2.11%. Nearly 1/3 of the 24 basis point decline in transaction take rate resulted from the mix effect of eBay. A reduction of $101 million in international transaction revenue from foreign currency hedges, growth in bill payment volumes and accelerating Venmo volumes also contributed to this decline. The 31 basis point decline in total take rate resulted from these factors as well as lower growth in other value-added services revenue. Volume-based expense performance was the strongest in our history. These expenses increased only 9% to $2.5 billion on 31% revenue growth. As a result, transaction margin dollars grew 52% in the first quarter, and transaction margin reached 57.8%. Normalizing for the macroeconomic-related credit loss provisioning last year, transaction margin dollars grew 38%. 
Going into the expense highlights. Transaction expense improved 12 basis points as a rate of TPV to a record low of 80 basis points, driven by both volume and funding mix. Continued improvements in our risk decisioning and mitigation strategies resulted in transaction losses improving 3 basis points to another record low rate of 10 basis points overall. 
In discussing our credit losses for the quarter, I want to provide additional context given the increased provisioning last year and the complexity in the year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, in Q1 2020, we increased reserves by $227 million for expected credit losses due to the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment. After taxes, this represented a negative $0.17 per share impact. 
During 2020, we increased our reserve coverage ratio and ended the year at 23%. In addition, our gross receivables balance declined from $4.5 billion at the end of the first quarter last year to $3.6 billion at the end of 2020. Tightened underwriting and strong repayment activity contributed to lower balances in our merchant loan portfolio. This decline was partially offset by growth in our consumer portfolio. These trends continued in the first quarter of 2021, and we ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in receivables. More favorable economic conditions and portfolio performance resulted in a partial release of reserves in Q1. This reserve release benefited credit losses by approximately $87 million and provided an approximate $0.06 benefit to EPS. As a result, at the end of the first quarter, our reserve coverage ratio declined to 21%. 
In the quarter, nontransaction-related operating expenses increased 31% and represented 30% of revenue, remaining essentially flat to last year. We are prioritizing growth. And to advance our key initiatives, we're continuing to invest more in sales and marketing and technology and development. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $1.67 billion, and our operating margin was 27.7%, our strongest performance for any first quarter. Normalizing only for the macro-related provisioning last year, operating income grew 46% and operating margin expanded approximately 300 basis points. In Q1, on this normalized basis and inclusive of our elevated investment spend, we earned an incremental $0.38 of operating income for every additional dollar of revenue generated. 
Non-GAAP other income declined by $39 million relative to last year. This was driven by reduced interest income from lower interest rates and higher interest expense from our debt issuance last May. The negative impact on non-GAAP EPS from the decline in other income was largely offset by a lower effective tax rate. For the first quarter, non-GAAP EPS grew 84% to $1.22. Again, normalizing for the $0.17 negative impact last year related to increased credit provisioning, non-GAAP EPS still grew 47%. 
We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.1 billion. In addition, we generated $1.54 billion in free cash flow, representing 27% growth from the first quarter last year. For every dollar of revenue in the first quarter, we generated $0.25 of free cash flow. 
Now I'd like to discuss our updated guidance for 2021 and our guidance for the second quarter. This updated outlook reflects our ability to accelerate growth at scale at increasing rates of profitability as well as the underlying strength of our core business. 
For the full year 2021, based on our record first quarter performance and sustained momentum, we are raising our net new active TPV revenue and earnings outlook. Relative to our prior expectations, eBay's managed payments transition has accelerated, and we now expect a greater percentage of the migration to be complete by the end of the third quarter. This acceleration puts more near-term pressure on our revenue and earnings growth. At the same time, this more compressed timing allows for a cleaner exit in 2021. 
Broad-based strength in our Merchant Services business and improving credit performance allowed us to more than offset this impact. We now expect revenue to be approximately $5.75 billion or growth of approximately 20% on a spot basis for the year. We are raising our expectations for revenue growth by 1 point while at the same time absorbing an additional 2 points of pressure to revenue growth from eBay. 
In addition, we expect to generate approximately 100 basis points of operating margin expansion this year relative to the more modest margin expansion we had guided at the start of the year. As a result, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $4.70, representing growth of approximately 21%. Relative to the guidance we provided at the start of the year, this is an additional 4 points of non-GAAP earnings growth in 2021. 
We're executing from a position of strength and seeing strong adoption of our new products and services. Our updated guidance includes increased investment in our digital wallet initiatives to drive further innovation, adoption and engagement. The strong underlying trends in our business and Q1 outperformance are allowing us to offset these incremental investments and the more pronounced eBay headwinds to deliver stronger earnings growth than we previously expected. 
For the second quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $6.25 billion, representing approximately 19% growth at spot. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q2 to be approximately $1.12, representing growth of approximately 5%. 
As a reminder, last year, operating margin expanded more than 500 basis points in the second quarter. Favorable volume and funding mix dynamics, combined with COVID-related underspend and nontransaction-related expenses, contributed to the strong margin performance and resulted in 49% growth in non-GAAP EPS. This record growth last year creates a tougher comparison. On a 2-year compound annual basis, our earnings guidance reflects 25% growth. 
I'd also like to discuss our updated net new active outlook. We're raising our guidance for 2021 net new active accounts. Based on the 14.5 million additional accounts in Q1 and our current trends, we now expect to add in the range of 52 million to 55 million net new users this year. This is an increase from the 50 million net new actives that we guided to start the year. On top of the approximately 73 million users added last year, at our current pace, we'll add more new users between last year and this year than we did in 2016, '17, '18 and '19 combined. 
As a reminder, in Q2 last year, we added 21.3 million accounts and are now lapping this growth. Given this tougher comp, and the ramp of our initiatives throughout the year, we expect Q2 net new actives to be lower than Q1 and for Q3 and Q4 adds to be sequentially stronger. 
It's worth noting a couple of points related to our guidance and our business overall. 
First, the environment in which we are operating, while more stable than a year ago, continues to be very dynamic and more challenging to predict than in normal times. In many of our core markets, we're on the threshold of some degree of a return to normalcy. People are getting vaccinated. There's a return to physical experiences. Travel is resuming. Some of this is certainly pent-up demand from the void that resulted from COVID-19 over the last year. For some, perhaps it may be a reversion to the way things were prior to 2020. The pace and degree of this change and its impact on the trends on our business is challenging to predict from 1 quarter to the next with the same level of certainty that we have in normal times. 
This brings me to my second point, which is unassailable. Our business has and will continue to benefit from the changes in consumer behavior that have resulted from this pandemic, namely, the acceleration of the continuing trend of the growth in e-commerce penetration and importantly, the growing ubiquity of digital payment experiences. We continue to see elevated e-commerce spending well above pre-pandemic levels, even in countries and markets that have begun to reopen. We're positioned to be a long-term beneficiary of these secular trends and as we've repeatedly said, are investing heavily to help shape this outcome. That said, our short-term forecasting is susceptible to more variability than normal. 
To wrap up, our first quarter results underscore the ongoing strength, diversification and relevance of our scaled, two-sided global platform. We extended our leadership position in digital payments and delivered some of the best performance in our history on both an absolute and relative basis. And our strong trends across the business reflect enduring secular trends and continued business momentum. We're continuing to invest aggressively to drive accelerated growth in a post-pandemic world and capture the significant opportunity ahead. At the same time, our meaningful scale enables us to realize additional efficiencies, expand our operating margin and support significant free cash flow generation. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

We had a strong Q1. It's up 46% ex the onetime Honey adds that we had last year. Ended the quarter with 31 million merchants, 392 million active accounts. We're really getting to a scale right now, Darrin, that has a huge network effect on it. 
We brought on in Q1, 2 new customers every second throughout the quarter. We brought on a new merchant every 5 seconds throughout the quarter. We brought in somewhere between 1.4 million, 1.5 million new merchants. That was up over 100% from a year ago. 
And I think the drivers, it's predominantly PayPal's, predominantly still in our core markets, still seeing great growth from Venmo. But my view on net new actives is I say was -- didn't mean to be too aggressive. Look, I think we have a lot of opportunity yet here. We have a lot of expansion into international markets. I think our marketing programs are really beginning to deliver excellent results. I think we're just scratching the surface there. 
And when I think about what's going on inside the base, our engagement levels are going up substantially. I mean you saw kind of our TPA grow by 7%. If you normalize for Honey, our TPA went up 8% in the quarter. But if you normalize for the huge amount of NNAs that John just talked about, because when you put on huge amounts of NNAs and they don't have the full year to do their full TPA, maybe a bunch came on this quarter and they had 1.5 months to do transactions, and we count them in that TPA, but if you normalize that to say the $37 million we used to be doing, then that TPA grew by 14% in the quarter. And that is really a result of our daily active users coming on. 
Our daily active users were up 33% in Q1 across the base, but our new products and services right now are driving huge engagement levels. I'll just give you a couple of examples. Buy Now, Pay Later, I'm sure somebody will talk about it later because we have a lot of fun things to talk about. But 50% of the customers who have used Buy Now, Pay Later have repeated within 3 months. And 70% have repeated within 6 months. If you look at our in-store cohort now, they're driving an incremental 60 to 120 incremental transactions. And we talked about this last call, and it's holding true. About half of our crypto users open their app every single day. And so we're clearly beginning to see both at the top of the funnel, the potential for increases into the top of the funnel and really narrowing the bottom of the funnel, which is why I'm bullish on with NNA trends. 
The one thing I'd point out, Darrin, that I think is really important is the cadence of those NNAs. Q1 was a good solid quarter for us. Q2 is always going to be the lowest quarter of the year because we did 21.4 million net new actives last year. Even though our churn rates are down, and that was one of the best cohorts we ever activated, it puts incremental pressure at the bottom of the funnel for Q2. And then we see really increasing amounts of NNAs as we go through the year. So in general, really strong on the NNA front, really strong on the engagement front. And hopefully, more of that to come."

Th",259,"Yes. I'll just add real quickly, Darrin. Like if you go back to a year ago or maybe 3 quarters ago, when you saw the record amount of net new actives that came in the second quarter, I mean I think that I mean can we probably surprise everybody, right? That was an enormous number. 
And then you think about it sort of like, ""Okay, well, now what?"" Because we've got to make sure that we're engaging these customers and they're using us in all the ways that they can. And we -- even going back to that point in time, a year ago, we knew that the second quarter this year was going to be our toughest comp from a net new active perspective. Even as Dan said, despite the improvements we've made in reducing churn, there's still a lot of pressure there. And so Q2 is going to be sort of the low point for the year for us. And then we expect 3Q and 4Q to see strengthening acceleration there. But the thing that I will say that sort of gives us confidence in this, and we've talked about this for a period of time, but we've consistently said that these have been our most engaged cohorts that we've ever seen. 
And we're continuing to see those trends. They haven't waned like what you might expect related to people returning to the physical world. And so that gives us the conviction around raising this and really what bodes for the rest of our business as well."

To specifically ad",362,"So I think starting with the full year, you're right. The momentum that we're seeing in the business really has allowed us to overcome the headwinds that we're seeing from a more accelerated migration for eBay to its managed payments. 
To specifically address your question on Q1, there's actually a handful of things that, I think, performed differently than what we expected. Starting with January, so there was an extended holiday shopping period. Like the first couple of weeks of January, we saw much stronger e-commerce activity than normal. On sort of the other booking, getting to March, we saw a resumption in travel that happen quicker than -- more quickly than what we had estimated. And then sort of in between that, you've got the stimulus. And I don't want to overstate the effect of stimulus because we had assumed some of that in our forecast. I think it was pretty clear at that point in time that, that was going to happen. 
But I think fundamentally, if you step back and you think about these things that I described that maybe are more transitory, what has been I think a more permanent shift is what we're seeing around, call it, the displacement of cash. And you're just seeing more and more digital experiences that are replacing cash. So I'll give you one sort of silly example, Tien-Tsin, but last Saturday night, I went out to dinner. And a restaurant had reopened, I'm sitting inside. And when it gets time for me to get my check, I'm not handing off my credit card to the waiter for them to run and put it through the machine. They're printing a receipt with the QR code on it right there. 
I'd say physical world experience that is happening digital. And this is the transformation that is happening right in front of our eyes right now. We are on the threshold of this. And that's fundamentally, I think it's a small anecdote, but it's -- I think it's a good example of kind of what we're seeing in our business, where there's this convergence of online and off-line that is really benefiting our business."

That's re",336,"I'll just add on to that, John, because I think that is the strength that we're seeing even in markets that are opening. If you think about, we did a 100-point raise in guidance for revenues, you had 200 incremental points of pressure from eBay. That's really, in effect, a 30-point raise on our core business. And that's because we are now seeing people living a digital life. 
And what used to be and for us as well, like 1 year, 1.5 years ago is there was a separate distinction between in-store or the physical world and e-commerce in the online world. And now what we're seeing is that it's just a digital world. Even as economies open, more and more of those payments are moving to digital. Think about it like Uber would be a good example. As more and more rides start there, they're moving into a physical environment, but it's all done through a digital platform and digital payments. And so clearly, that is something that we see as a sustaining and growing trend going forward. 
And I think John mentioned cash is definitely being replaced. There's just a study done a week or 2 ago by one of the major networks that said anywhere between 60% to 70% of consumers are going to use cash less frequently, and that's moving to digital. It's moving to digital forms of payment, and it's moving to P2P. And by the way, when it moves to digital, it's moving predominantly to debit, which obviously is also great from a funding perspective on that. 
And so I think we have this portfolio of services right now, whether it be iZettle or Braintree or QR codes or just what's happening in the physical world that complements now what's happening in the online world with our more traditional products. And that's kind of a 1-, 2-punch that I don't think any of us really understood the extent of or the depth of the transition to a digital economy."

I won't kind of obviously talk about the specifics of any of our conversations that we've had with them. What I would say is it is a conversation that is very much one of learning from each other, understanding the capabilities that each of us have, what some of the concerns that some of the central banks might have or governments, what some of the benefits of a platform like PayPal could do in various forms of how CBDCs could be issued. 
And I believe based on all my conversations that each country is going to go at different speeds. We're going to have different regulatory oversight in it. But there isn't one country around the world in which we've engaged in, where I don't think that they're envisioning a future that isn't one of a digitized Fiat currency. I think, obviously, there's a lot of synergy with digital wallets. There's a lot of interesting things as you think about next-generation technology that can add utility to payments that can take down perhaps cost, the elimination of unnecessary intermediaries and certainly can speed the time in which somebody can access their money. 
So we've got a tremendous amount of really great results going on tactically with our cryptocurrency efforts right now. And we're excited about those. We're investing in those. But this whole idea around establishing a digital currency and blockchain business unit inside PayPal is to think about what is the financial system going to start to move towards? And how can we be a shaper of that, a leader within that and not a reactor to how that's happening. And that -- those conversations have been -- have gone well beyond my expectations in terms of the openness of governments and central banks to think about new ways of managing and moving money through the system."

I think there's a number of things there that we're observing. I think building on your question around debit, that's certainly something that stands out. We see a shift in funding towards more debit versus credit, and that's across our broad portfolio of products, but a good example is even like Buy Now, Pay Later, where in the previous quarter. About 78% of that was funded with debit. That moved up to 82% in the most recent quarter. 
And so clearly, we're seeing shift there. And again, going back to an earlier answer, we believe some of that is the displacement of cash. 
In terms of overall kind of trends that we're seeing around reopening, certainly, travel has picked back up. And that happened a little bit earlier than what we had anticipated. Among the verticals that sort of stand out, fashion still is one of the single largest growth verticals in terms of overall volume for us. But in terms of the highest year-over-year growth rates, still food and groceries and incidentally, even in markets where you've seen some reopening. So again, it just -- it really supports what consumers have been telling the world in surveys for 12 months now. Now we're seeing it in behaviors.

TPV, up 63%. It's off to a great start in Q2 as well. 
One really interesting thing on that John and I were remarking on the other day, is if you look at the annualized TPV of Venmo right now, call it about $205 million, $210 billion of TPV. Think back when we went public, our TPV for the year was $285 billion. So you basically have another PayPal inside of PayPal but when we went public a year ago. And there is such huge monetization opportunity on that. 
I think, obviously, we feel very confident in the $900 million, but that is scratching the surface of what Venmo can be. This is a huge base that's growing. And the great thing is that the team there is executing on all of their initiatives. Credit card, we knew is a great experience, but it's performing beyond our expectations, new sign-ups, transactions. That's what happens when you have a great value proposition consumer experience. Crypto launched a 1% ramp. It just went to 5% ramp. It will be 100% ramped by the end of this month, the end of May. And obviously, if you look at again surveys that have come out recently and you look at millennials, something like 74% of them anticipate that they're going to use crypto in the next year or 2 in some way. 
Business profiles growing above plan. We're going to be introducing things like goods and services by our protection. That's a huge revenue generator on the PayPal P2P side. That same thing will be happening on the Venmo side. 
Pay with Venmo, which by the way, is very little of this year's $900 million. But that pay with demo is going to be the majority of revenues as you look out several years from now. And so we're really excited about that rolling out. And eventually, Venmo is going to move down the same path that the PayPal super app digital wallet is going down. It's going to become a super app itself, putting in more and more capabilities and services around, again, shopping and basic consumer financial services and payments. It has international expansion in front of it. 
And there's just so much opportunity. I think we've all been bullish on the potential of Venmo. We are now beginning to see it realized and we just think that just want to keep investing in that because The opportunity is quite large."

And one of the great things we're seeing with customers that are engaging Buy Now, Pay Later is there's a 15% halo lift in TPV on the platform.

So again, I want to repeat the number because it's a whopping number. 38% incremental operating margins in the quarter. That's it really demonstrates the scalability of our platform, particularly when you think about the level of investment that we've had internally, and you can look at some of the year-over-year comps in our expense line items and get an idea of that. 
But I think there's a number of different areas, but a couple that obviously stand out are the transaction-related operating expenses of transaction expense and transaction loss. To have record lows in both those, again, like the improvements that we've made in our risk capabilities to drive down transaction losses has just been tremendous. And we start talking about this probably 5 or 6 quarters ago. And look, I don't know if we're going to come in at 10 basis points every quarter. I certainly would hope so. But that is a performance that was really hard to imagine a couple of years ago. But the improvements there that we've made in terms of the capabilities are definitely sustainable. 
On transaction expense, Look, I think you can pick at any one part of our P&L. And like a take rate as an example. We saw declines there. Some of that's related to mix, like we're obviously doing, as an example, more bill payment right now. which carries a lower take rate. Well at the same time, it carries a lower transaction expense. And so we've always focused on that margin between the 2. And again, to have a margin, a transaction margin approaching 60% this quarter, we're really pleased about it. 
And so the obvious question is where does that level out over time? Does it go down from 80 basis does it go up from 80 basis points. It's tough to tell, but I certainly don't think that we're going to see levels that we saw pre-pandemic. There may be some inflation. But I think all of the mix changes in our business and what we're seeing around the pull forward of e-commerce, we would expect transaction expense to remain at lower levels pre pandemic, which, again, gives us the just amazing leverage that we have on this platform."

Customers across the w",1418,"Thanks, Gabrielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to say that on the heels of the strongest year in PayPal's history, we just completed our strongest quarter ever with record financial and operating results. Customers across the world have clearly embraced the digital economy, and PayPal has become an essential platform for both consumers and merchants. Consequently, I'm pleased to share that we are raising our annual targets for revenue, EPS, TPV and net new active accounts. 
As much of the world begins to shift its attention towards a post-pandemic recovery, we continue to see strong demand for a comprehensive set of services from both our merchants and consumers. Over the coming year, we will accelerate our customers' digital engagement through the rapid innovation of our digital wallet and merchant commerce platform. 
Our addressable market continues to significantly expand driven by accelerating secular trends and the proactive steps we are taking to become a full commerce and payments platform. We believe that the shift in consumer digital behavior will remain essentially unchanged in a post-COVID world. Consumers have expanded their digital lives into a seamless online and off-line experience. Our products are an essential enabler of the digital economy, and our mission to shape a future where everyone can participate fully in this new digital paradigm has never been more important. 
Our Q1 trends are strong across the board and were further accelerated by favorable comps from a year ago. Our TPV grew by 50% on a spot basis or 46% on an FXN basis to $285 billion. eBay now represents 5.5% of our volume, and we expect their TPV to be approximately 3% of total volumes by year-end. Excluding eBay, our MS volumes grew by an all-time high of 54% on a spot basis and 50% on an FXN basis. 
Our transactions in the quarter were approximately 4.4 billion, growing 34% year-over-year. We added 14.5 million net new active accounts, ending the quarter with 392 million active accounts, up 21% year-over-year. We added 1.4 million new merchants in the quarter, continuing the heightened pace from prior quarters, and we now have 31 million merchant accounts on our platform. By the end of Q2, we expect to exceed 400 million active accounts. And for the year, we now believe our NNAs will be between 52 million to 55 million, up from our previous expectations of approximately 50 million last quarter. I'm particularly pleased to see our transactions per active account begin to accelerate due to increased engagement across our portfolio. 
Normalizing for Honey, our Q1 TPA grew by 8.3% year-over-year to 44.1. We generated $6.033 billion of revenue in Q1, growing a record 31% spot and 29% on an FXN basis. eBay revenues declined 12%, and we expect they will substantially complete their migration to manage payments by year-end. On the back of this strong revenue growth, we delivered non-GAAP EPS in Q1 of $1.22, up 84%. 
Venmo continued its strong performance in Q1 with $51.4 billion of TPV, up 63% year-over-year. We recently launched the ability for Venmo customers to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies. We are heavily investing in Venmo's commerce capabilities, which include rapidly upgrading the Pay with Venmo customer experience with initial rollout beginning this quarter. The Venmo credit card is outpacing our expectations for both new accounts and transactions. And we're also making it easier for small businesses and casual sellers,to accept Venmo payments. We now have over 300,000 small business profiles currently established, including $200,000 in Q1 alone. Our Venmo Commerce TPV and revenue growth continued to accelerate, and we remain confident in our $900 million revenue target. 
We expect to roll out our next-generation digital wallet in Q3. It will be an all-in-one personalized app that will empower our users to make the most of their money and strengthen their financial lives every day. We will provide increasingly customized and unique shopping, financial services and payments experiences for our customers. 
Consumers are turning to brands that they trust when it comes to choosing a super app. That clearly plays into our strength as a recent external survey of over 300,000 consumers across the globe selected PayPal as the second most trusted brand in the world. Merchants continue to turn to PayPal in record numbers as we are now an essential platform to enable their transition into the digital economy. Small businesses who used PayPal during the peak of the pandemic saw their overall revenues grow by 25% versus a negative 9% for all other small businesses in the same time period. 
Small businesses who used PayPal last year drove 75% of their online sales from outside their local neighborhood, clearly expanding their addressable market. And 65% of small businesses in the U.S. who use PayPal have cross-border sales versus less than 5% of all other small businesses. Across the shopping journey, merchants who use PayPal see a substantial lift. 
According to market research reported by Nielsen, merchants with PayPal experienced 17% more repeat buyers. Their checkout completion goes up by 34%. And PayPal consumers spend an average of 12% more at PayPal merchants. And finally, PayPal consumers are loyal to PayPal merchants, buying 11% more often when PayPal is accepted. 
These are powerful facts that support our brand promise to retailers as we add more and more capabilities to our platform. For instance, our Buy Now, Pay Later product continues to move from strength to strength. In the short time from our launch, we've processed over $1 billion in TPV in the U.S. alone. Early results continue to show a significant 15% engagement lift in transactions and TPV. In addition, nearly 30,000 merchants have implemented our Buy Now, Pay Later capabilities upstream on their product pages with a corresponding lift in our overall share of checkout. 
Demand for our PayPal and Venmo QR codes and in-store payments remains strong, with an additional merchant signing up every 28 seconds. We now have nearly 1 million merchants accepting our QR codes with continued momentum across our large enterprise merchants. Our early adopters of QRC are spending 19% more TPV on the PayPal platform. Our overall in-store efforts across QR and cards equaled $6.4 billion in Q1. 
As I discussed during our Investor Day, we believe the current technological underpinnings of our financial system will be substantially upgraded over the coming years. Both cryptocurrencies and central bank-issued digital currencies can play a critical role in shaping a more inclusive recovery and a more equitable financial system. Our leadership in all forms of digital currency has been widely embraced, enabling numerous positive conversations with central banks, regulators and government officials around the world. 
I'm also pleased to share that we closed our Curv acquisition last month. And Curv's talented team will bolster our existing technology resources and accelerate our efforts to shape a new financial infrastructure that is efficient, low-cost and inclusive. 
We have an extensive road map ahead of us, and our innovation will be pursued in partnership with governments and in compliance with local, national and global regulatory frameworks. 
The expiration of our operating agreement with eBay has enabled us to launch an extensive partnership with Alibaba. This global agreement will enable hundreds of millions of consumers outside of China to shop across Alibaba sites in China. 
PayPal is now available as a payment method on Alibaba's wholesale marketplace as well as Ali Express, its global retail marketplace. We are excited at the pace of our current ramp and the ultimate potential of this new partnership. Additionally, our commercial agreement with FlutterWave enables businesses across Africa to have significantly more access to PayPal consumers in order to receive and make payments online. In this quarter, we also collaborated with TelR in the Middle East, allowing merchants in the UAE to accept PayPal for customers shopping online. These efforts serve to significantly broaden our reach and tap into rapidly growing marketplaces across the globe. 
We clearly have a lot of momentum as we exit Q1. We will continue to accelerate new product innovation throughout the year. Our increased expectations for 2021 reflect our conviction that we will continue to grow share and increase our addressable market by capitalizing on the accelerating shift to digital. 
I'd like to thank our employees who continue to work tirelessly on behalf of our customers. Their hard work drives our market leadership and positions us to continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. And with that, let me turn the call over to John."

I want to start by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver an outstanding quarter. We recently marked 1 year into the COVID-19 pandemic. Notwithstanding the challenges that our teams have faced, our focus on execution and culture of collaboration are allowing us to deliver very strong results. We're off to a great start to the year. In Q1, we outperformed on both revenue and earnings and built on our operational and financial momentum exiting 2020. 
In looking at our results for the quarter, the year-over-year growth rates benefit from the comparison to a softer March last year when we absorbed the most meaningful negative COVID impact. That said, our business is growing at structurally faster rates than pre-pandemic. And as a result, we're raising our guidance for this year. 
Before discussing our updated outlook, I'd like to highlight our Q1 results. Total payment volume grew 50% at spot and 46% on a currency-neutral basis. This is the strongest quarterly growth we've ever reported. Our Q1 TPV grew at a 2-year compound annual growth rate of 33%, accelerating from 30% in Q4 and reflecting our strong momentum in user growth. Notably, while we typically experience a sequential decline in volumes from Q4 to Q1, this year, our volume grew 3% quarter-over-quarter. Versus the first quarter last year, merchant services volume grew 50% currency-neutral. And volume contributed by eBay marketplaces declined 3% on the same basis. 
In Q1, eBay represented 5.5% of our volume, down 53 basis points sequentially and down 260 basis points from Q1 last year. Revenue increased a record 31% on spot basis and 29% currency neutral to $6 billion. Transaction revenue grew 33% to $5.6 billion, representing 20 points of acceleration from last year on a spot basis and 8 points of acceleration sequentially. Strong performance across core PayPal, Braintree and Venmo drove these results. Excluding eBay, transaction revenue grew 42%, indicative of the ongoing strength of our diversified 2-sided platform. 
Other value-added services revenue grew 2% on a spot basis and 1% currency neutral to $412 million. These results were driven by strengthening credit performance, which was partially offset by lower interest income on customer balances. 
In the first quarter, transaction take rate was 1.97%, and total take rate was 2.11%. Nearly 1/3 of the 24 basis point decline in transaction take rate resulted from the mix effect of eBay. A reduction of $101 million in international transaction revenue from foreign currency hedges, growth in bill payment volumes and accelerating Venmo volumes also contributed to this decline. The 31 basis point decline in total take rate resulted from these factors as well as lower growth in other value-added services revenue. Volume-based expense performance was the strongest in our history. These expenses increased only 9% to $2.5 billion on 31% revenue growth. As a result, transaction margin dollars grew 52% in the first quarter, and transaction margin reached 57.8%. Normalizing for the macroeconomic-related credit loss provisioning last year, transaction margin dollars grew 38%. 
Going into the expense highlights. Transaction expense improved 12 basis points as a rate of TPV to a record low of 80 basis points, driven by both volume and funding mix. Continued improvements in our risk decisioning and mitigation strategies resulted in transaction losses improving 3 basis points to another record low rate of 10 basis points overall. 
In discussing our credit losses for the quarter, I want to provide additional context given the increased provisioning last year and the complexity in the year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, in Q1 2020, we increased reserves by $227 million for expected credit losses due to the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment. After taxes, this represented a negative $0.17 per share impact. 
During 2020, we increased our reserve coverage ratio and ended the year at 23%. In addition, our gross receivables balance declined from $4.5 billion at the end of the first quarter last year to $3.6 billion at the end of 2020. Tightened underwriting and strong repayment activity contributed to lower balances in our merchant loan portfolio. This decline was partially offset by growth in our consumer portfolio. These trends continued in the first quarter of 2021, and we ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in receivables. More favorable economic conditions and portfolio performance resulted in a partial release of reserves in Q1. This reserve release benefited credit losses by approximately $87 million and provided an approximate $0.06 benefit to EPS. As a result, at the end of the first quarter, our reserve coverage ratio declined to 21%. 
In the quarter, nontransaction-related operating expenses increased 31% and represented 30% of revenue, remaining essentially flat to last year. We are prioritizing growth. And to advance our key initiatives, we're continuing to invest more in sales and marketing and technology and development. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $1.67 billion, and our operating margin was 27.7%, our strongest performance for any first quarter. Normalizing only for the macro-related provisioning last year, operating income grew 46% and operating margin expanded approximately 300 basis points. In Q1, on this normalized basis and inclusive of our elevated investment spend, we earned an incremental $0.38 of operating income for every additional dollar of revenue generated. 
Non-GAAP other income declined by $39 million relative to last year. This was driven by reduced interest income from lower interest rates and higher interest expense from our debt issuance last May. The negative impact on non-GAAP EPS from the decline in other income was largely offset by a lower effective tax rate. For the first quarter, non-GAAP EPS grew 84% to $1.22. Again, normalizing for the $0.17 negative impact last year related to increased credit provisioning, non-GAAP EPS still grew 47%. 
We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.1 billion. In addition, we generated $1.54 billion in free cash flow, representing 27% growth from the first quarter last year. For every dollar of revenue in the first quarter, we generated $0.25 of free cash flow. 
Now I'd like to discuss our updated guidance for 2021 and our guidance for the second quarter. This updated outlook reflects our ability to accelerate growth at scale at increasing rates of profitability as well as the underlying strength of our core business. 
For the full year 2021, based on our record first quarter performance and sustained momentum, we are raising our net new active TPV revenue and earnings outlook. Relative to our prior expectations, eBay's managed payments transition has accelerated, and we now expect a greater percentage of the migration to be complete by the end of the third quarter. This acceleration puts more near-term pressure on our revenue and earnings growth. At the same time, this more compressed timing allows for a cleaner exit in 2021. 
Broad-based strength in our Merchant Services business and improving credit performance allowed us to more than offset this impact. We now expect revenue to be approximately $25.75 billion for a growth of approximately 20% on a spot basis for the year. We are raising our expectations for revenue growth by 1 point while at the same time absorbing an additional 2 points of pressure to revenue growth from eBay. 
In addition, we expect to generate approximately 100 basis points of operating margin expansion this year relative to the more modest margin expansion we had guided at the start of the year. As a result, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $4.70, representing growth of approximately 21%. Relative to the guidance we provided at the start of the year, this is an additional 4 points of non-GAAP earnings growth in 2021. 
We're executing from a position of strength and seeing strong adoption of our new products and services. Our updated guidance includes increased investment in our digital wallet initiatives to drive further innovation, adoption and engagement. The strong underlying trends in our business and Q1 outperformance are allowing us to offset these incremental investments and the more pronounced eBay headwinds to deliver stronger earnings growth than we previously expected. 
For the second quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $6.25 billion, representing approximately 19% growth at spot. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q2 to be approximately $1.12, representing growth of approximately 5%. 
As a reminder, last year, operating margin expanded more than 500 basis points in the second quarter. Favorable volume and funding mix dynamics, combined with COVID-related underspend and nontransaction-related expenses, contributed to the strong margin performance and resulted in 49% growth in non-GAAP EPS. This record growth last year creates a tougher comparison. On a 2-year compound annual basis, our earnings guidance reflects 25% growth. 
I'd also like to discuss our updated net new active outlook. We're raising our guidance for 2021 net new active accounts. Based on the 14.5 million additional accounts in Q1 and our current trends, we now expect to add in the range of 52 million to 55 million net new users this year. This is an increase from the 50 million net new actives that we guided to start the year. On top of the approximately 73 million users added last year, at our current pace, we'll add more new users between last year and this year than we did in 2016, '17, '18 and '19 combined. 
As a reminder, in Q2 last year, we added 21.3 million accounts and are now lapping this growth. Given this tougher comp, and the ramp of our initiatives throughout the year, we expect Q2 net new actives to be lower than Q1 and for Q3 and Q4 adds to be sequentially stronger. 
It's worth noting a couple of points related to our guidance and our business overall. 
First, the environment in which we are operating, while more stable than a year ago, continues to be very dynamic and more challenging to predict than in normal times. In many of our core markets, we're on the threshold of some degree of a return to normalcy. People are getting vaccinated. There's a return to physical experiences. Travel is resuming. Some of this is certainly pent-up demand from the void that resulted from COVID-19 over the last year. For some, perhaps it may be a reversion to the way things were prior to 2020. The pace and degree of this change and its impact on the trends on our business is challenging to predict from 1 quarter to the next with the same level of certainty that we have in normal times. 
This brings me to my second point, which is unassailable. Our business has and will continue to benefit from the changes in consumer behavior that have resulted from this pandemic, namely, the acceleration of the continuing trend of the growth in e-commerce penetration and importantly, the growing ubiquity of digital payment experiences. We continue to see elevated e-commerce spending well above pre-pandemic levels, even in countries and markets that have begun to reopen. We're positioned to be a long-term beneficiary of these secular trends and as we've repeatedly said, are investing heavily to help shape this outcome. That said, our short-term forecasting is susceptible to more variability than normal. 
To wrap up, our first quarter results underscore the ongoing strength, diversification and relevance of our scaled, two-sided global platform. We extended our leadership position in digital payments and delivered some of the best performance in our history on both an absolute and relative basis. And our strong trends across the business reflect enduring secular trends and continued business momentum. 
We're continuing to invest aggressively to drive accelerated growth in a post-pandemic world and capture the significant opportunity ahead. At the same time, our meaningful scale enables us to realize additional efficiencies, expand our operating margin and support significant free cash flow generation. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

And especially as we go into reopening in the market, can you just talk through the activity and the churn levels?

We had a strong Q1. It's up 46% ex the onetime Honey adds that we had last year. Ended the quarter with 31 million merchants, 392 million active accounts. We're really getting to a scale right now, Darrin, that has a huge network effect on it. 
We brought on in Q1, 2 new customers every second throughout the quarter. We brought on a new merchant every 5 seconds throughout the quarter. We brought in somewhere between 1.4 million, 1.5 million new merchants. That was up over 100% from a year ago. 
And I think of the drivers, it's predominantly PayPal's, predominantly still in our core markets, still seeing great growth from Venmo. But my view on net new actives is I say without being too aggressive here, look, I think we have a lot of opportunity yet here. We have a lot of expansion into international markets. I think our marketing programs are really beginning to deliver excellent results. I think we're just scratching the surface there. 
And when I think about what's going on inside the base, our engagement levels are going up substantially. I mean, you saw kind of our TPA grow by 7%. If you normalize for Honey, our TPA went up 8% in the quarter. But if you normalize for the huge amount of NNAs that John just talked about, because when you put on huge amounts of NNAs that John just talked about. Because when you put on huge amounts of NNAs, and they don't have the full year to do their full TPA, maybe a bunch came on this quarter and they had 1.5 months to do transactions, and we count them in that TPA, but if you normalize that to say the $37 million we used to be doing, then that TPA grew by 14% in the quarter. And that is really a result of our daily active users coming on. 
Our daily active users were up 33% in Q1 across the base, but our new products and services right now are driving huge engagement levels. I'll just give you a couple of examples. Buy Now, Pay Later, I'm sure somebody will talk about it later because we have a lot of fun things to talk about. But 50% of the customers who have used Buy Now, Pay Later have repeated within 3 months. And 70% have repeated within 6 months. If you look at our in-store cohort now, they're driving an incremental 60 to 120 incremental transactions. And we talked about this last call, and it's holding true. About half of our crypto users open their app every single day. And so we're clearly beginning to see both at the top of the funnel, the potential for increases into the top of the funnel and really narrowing the bottom of the funnel, which is why I'm bullish on -- actually our NNA trends. 
The one thing I'd point out, Darrin, that I think is really important is the cadence of those NNAs. Q1 was a good solid quarter for us. Q2 is always going to be the lowest quarter of the year because we did 21.4 million net new actives last year. Even though our churn rates are down, and that was one of the best cohorts we ever activated, it puts incremental pressure at the bottom of the funnel for Q2. And then we see really increasing amounts of NNAs as we go through the year. So in general, really strong on the NNA front, really strong on the engagement front. And hopefully, more of that to come."

I'll just add real quickly, Darrin. Like if you go back to a year ago or maybe 3 quarters ago, when you saw the record amount of net new actives that came in the second quarter, I mean I think that -- I mean, candidly probably surprised everybody, right? That was an enormous number. 
And then you think about it sort of like, ""Okay, well, now what?"" Because we've got to make sure that we're engaging these customers and they're using us in all the ways that they can. And we -- even going back to that point in time, a year ago, we knew that the second quarter this year was going to be our toughest comp from a net new active perspective. 
Even as Dan said, despite the improvements we've made in reducing churn, there's still a lot of pressure there. And so Q2 is going to be sort of the low point for the year for us. And then we expect 3Q and 4Q to see strengthening acceleration there. But the thing that I will say that sort of gives us confidence in this, and we've talked about this for a period of time, but we've consistently said that these have been our most engaged cohorts that we've ever seen. 
And we're continuing to see those trends. They haven't waned like what you might expect related to people returning to the physical world. And so that gives us the conviction around raising this and really what it bodes for the rest of our business as well."

To specifically ad",362,"So I think starting with the full year, you're right. The momentum that we're seeing in the business really has allowed us to overcome the headwinds that we're seeing from a more accelerated migration for eBay to its managed payments. 
To specifically address your question on Q1, there's actually a handful of things that, I think, performed differently than what we expected. Starting with January. 
So there was an extended holiday shopping period. Like the first couple of weeks of January, we saw much stronger e-commerce activity than normal. On sort of the other book end, getting to March, we saw a resumption in travel that happened quicker than -- more quickly than what we had estimated. And then sort of in between that, you've got the stimulus. And I don't want to overstate the effect of stimulus because we had assumed some of that in our forecast. I think it was pretty clear at that point in time that, that was going to happen. 
But I think fundamentally, if you step back and you think about these things that I described that maybe are more transitory, what has been I think a more permanent shift is what we're seeing around, call it, the displacement of cash. And you're just seeing more and more digital experiences that are replacing cash. So I'll give you one sort of silly example, Tien-Tsin, but last Saturday night, I went out to dinner. And a restaurant had reopened, I'm sitting inside. And when it gets time for me to get my check, I'm not handing off my credit card to the waiter for them to run and put it through the machine. They're printing a receipt with the QR code on it right there. 
That's a physical world experience that's happening digitally. And this is the transformation that is happening right in front of our eyes right now. We are on the threshold of this. And that's fundamentally, I think it's a small anecdote, but it's -- I think it's a good example of kind of what we're seeing in our business, where there's this convergence of online and off-line that is really benefiting our business."

If you think about, we did a 100-point raise in guidance for revenues, you had 200 incremental points of pressure from eBay. That's really, in effect, a 30-point raise on our core business. And that's because we are now seeing people living a digital life. 
And what used to be and for us as well, like 1 year, 1.5 years ago is there was a separate distinction between in-store or the physical world and e-commerce in the online world. And now what we're seeing is that it's just a digital world. Even as economies open, more and more of those payments are moving to digital. 
Think about it, like Uber would be a good example. As more and more rides start there, they're moving into a physical environment, but it's all done through a digital platform and digital payments. And so clearly, that is something that we see as a sustaining and growing trend going forward. 
And I think John mentioned cash is definitely being replaced. There's just a study done a week or 2 ago by one of the major networks that said anywhere between 60% to 70% of consumers are going to use cash less frequently, and that's moving to digital. It's moving to digital forms of payment, and it's moving to P2P. And by the way, when it moves to digital, it's moving predominantly to debit, which obviously is also great from a funding perspective on that. 
And so I think we have this portfolio of services right now, whether it be Zettle or Braintree or QR codes or just what's happening in the physical world that complements now what's happening in the online world with our more traditional products. And that's kind of a 1-, 2-punch that I don't think any of us really understood the extent of or the depth of the transition to a digital economy."

And that's why you see us not rolling through the entirety of that in terms of our EPS guidance because we think it's more important to invest right now, and that is clearly our bias.

I won't kind of obviously talk about the specifics of any of our conversations that we've had with them. What I would say is it is a conversation that is very much one of learning from each other, understanding the capabilities that each of us have, what some of the concerns that some of the central banks might have or governments, what some of the benefits of a platform like PayPal could do in various forms of how CBDCs could be issued. 
And I believe based on all my conversations that each country is going to go at different speeds. We're going to have different regulatory oversight in it. But there isn't one country around the world in which we've engaged in, where I don't think that they're envisioning a future that isn't one of a digitized Fiat currency. I think, obviously, there's a lot of synergy with digital wallets. There's a lot of interesting things as you think about next-generation technology that can add utility to payments, that can take down perhaps cost, the elimination of unnecessary intermediaries and certainly can speed the time in which somebody can access their money. 
So we've got a tremendous amount of really great results going on tactically with our cryptocurrency efforts right now. And we're excited about those. We're investing in those. But this whole idea around establishing a digital currency and blockchain business unit inside PayPal is to think about what is the financial system going to start to move towards? And how can we be a shaper of that, a leader within that and not a reactor to how that's happening. And that -- those conversations have been -- have gone well beyond my expectations in terms of the openness of governments and central banks to think about new ways of managing and moving money through the system."

I think there's a number of things there that we're observing. I think building on your question around debit, that's certainly something that stands out. We see a shift in funding towards more debit versus credit, and that's across our broad portfolio of products, but a good example is even like Buy Now, Pay Later, where in the previous quarter, about 78% of that was funded with debit. That moved up to 82% in the most recent quarter. 
And so clearly, we're seeing a shift there. And again, going back to an earlier answer, we believe some of that is the displacement of cash. 
In terms of overall kind of trends that we're seeing around reopening, certainly, travel has picked back up. And that happened a little bit earlier than what we had anticipated. Among the verticals that sort of stand out, fashion still is one of the single largest growth verticals in terms of overall volume for us. But in terms of the highest year-over-year growth rates, still food and groceries, and incidentally, even in markets where you've seen some reopening. So again, it just -- it really supports what consumers have been telling the world in surveys for 12 months now. 
Now we're seeing it in behaviors. And so again, this sort of plays into a lot of the themes that we're talking about here in terms of this convergence of the physical world and online and the need to have these omni experiences for your customers. But those will be a couple of things that I would call out that we're seeing."

So first of all, Venmo had another really strong quarter. TPV, up 63%. It's off to a great start in Q2 as well. 
One really interesting thing on that John and I were remarking on the other day, is if you look at the annualized TPV of Venmo right now, call it about $205 million, $210 billion of TPV. Think back when we went public, our TPV for the year was $285 billion. So you basically have another PayPal inside of PayPal when we went public a year ago. And there is such huge monetization opportunity on that. 
I think, obviously, we feel very confident in the $900 million, but that is scratching the surface of what Venmo can be. This is a huge base that's growing. And the great thing is that the team there is executing on all of their initiatives. Credit card, we knew is a great experience, but it's performing beyond our expectations, new sign-ups, transactions. That's what happens when you have a great value proposition consumer experience. Crypto launched at 1% ramp. It just went to 5% ramp. It will be 100% ramped by the end of this month, the end of May. And obviously, if you look at again surveys that have come out recently and you look at millennials, something like 74% of them anticipate that they're going to use crypto in the next year or 2 in some way. 
Business profiles growing above plan. We're going to be introducing things like goods and services by our protection. That's a huge revenue generator on the PayPal P2P side. That same thing will be happening on the Venmo side. 
Pay with Venmo, which by the way, is very little of this year's $900 million. But that Pay with Venmo is going to be the majority of revenues as you look out several years from now. And so we're really excited about that rolling out. And eventually, Venmo is going to move down the same path that the PayPal super app digital wallet is going down. It's going to become a super app itself, putting in more and more capabilities and services around, again, shopping and basic consumer financial services and payments. It has international expansion in front of it. 
And there's just so much opportunity. I think we've all been bullish on the potential of Venmo. We are now beginning to see it realized and we just think that -- just want to keep investing in that because the opportunity is quite large."

And because we have now 392 million customers on the platform, we know them. We know their behaviors. We have higher approval rates and less defaults than what we are seeing out in the Buy Now, Pay Later space. 
Just to give you a sense of results in front of that. Over $2 billion of TPV globally since launch. Over $1 billion in the U.S. Over 14 million loans have been done, over 5 million unique customers. We have over 500,000 unique merchants, more -- hundreds of LE customers, as I mentioned, 30,000 upstream, and that's growing every single day. 
And one of the great things we're seeing with customers that are engaging with Buy Now, Pay Later is there's a 15% halo lift in TPV on the platform. And because of funding it with debit, debit's increasing, there's like a 16% reduction in our cost per transaction. 
So it's a great proposition for merchants tons of conversations going on with all the leading merchants, big uptick with consumers, and we're going to expand into Australia by the end of Q2 and in much more of Europe by the end of the year."

So again, I want to repeat the number because it's a whopping number. 38% incremental operating margins in the quarter. That's -- it really demonstrates the scalability of our platform, particularly when you think about the level of investment that we've had internally, and you can look at some of the year-over-year comps in our expense line items and get an idea of that. 
But I think there's a number of different areas, but a couple that obviously stand out are the transaction-related operating expenses of transaction expense and transaction loss. To have record lows in both those, again, like the improvements that we've made in our risk capabilities to drive down transaction losses has just been tremendous. And we start talking about this probably 5 or 6 quarters ago. And look, I don't know if we're going to come in at 10 basis points every quarter. I certainly would hope so. But that is a performance that was really hard to imagine a couple of years ago. But the improvements there that we've made in terms of the capabilities are definitely sustainable. 
On transaction expense, look, I think you can pick at any one part of our P&L. And like -- take rate as an example. We saw declines there. Some of that's related to mix, like we're obviously doing, as an example, more bill payment right now, which carries a lower take rate. Well, at the same time, it carries a lower transaction expense. And so we've always focused on that margin between the 2. And again, to have a margin, a transaction margin approaching 60% this quarter, we're really pleased about it. 
And so the obvious question is where does that level out over time? Does it go down from 80 basis points, does it go up from 80 basis points. It's tough to tell, but I certainly don't think that we're going to see levels that we saw pre-pandemic. There may be some inflation. But I think all of the mix changes in our business and what we're seeing around the pull forward of e-commerce, we would expect transaction expense to remain at lower levels pre-pandemic, which, again, gives us the just amazing leverage that we have on this platform."

I'm pleased to say that on the heels of a record year, our Q2 results once again reflect some of the best performance in our history on both an absolute and a relative basis. It is now clear",1303,"Thanks, Gabrielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to say that on the heels of a record year, our Q2 results once again reflect some of the best performance in our history on both an absolute and a relative basis. 
It is now clear that customers around the world have embraced all forms of digital payments. Even in regions where in-person activities are returning towards pre-pandemic levels. In this new normal, PayPal serves as an essential and trusted platform for both consumers and merchants, across all forms of commerce, payments and basic financial services. 
As a result, we hit a new milestone in Q2 surpassing $300 billion of TPV for the first time in our history, growing 40% on a spot basis to $311 billion with an annualized run rate of approximately $1.25 trillion. This is even more notable given that eBay's TPV on our platform declined by 37%. eBay exited the quarter at under 4% of our volume and we expect their TPV will approach 2.5% of our total volumes by year-end. 
Excluding eBay, our volumes grew by a remarkable 48% on a spot basis. Our active accounts now exceed 400 million, up 16% and to 403 million. We added 11.4 million net new active accounts in the quarter, including an additional 1.5 million merchant accounts. That brings our total merchant count to 32 million. We still expect to end the year at the higher end of our previous guidance of 52 million to 55 million net new active accounts. 
Transactions in the quarter grew by 27% to $4.74 billion. And even as our net new actives continue to show strong growth, our transactions per active account accelerated 11% in the quarter to 43.5x as our consumers engage more frequently across our growing suite of services. We grew our revenues by 19% to $6.4 billion. This growth comes even as we lap strong results from last year and absorbed 811 basis points of revenue pressure from eBay, as their revenues on our platform declined 51% in Q2. 
Excluding eBay, our revenues grew at approximately 32%. We now expect that eBay will be essentially 100% complete with their migration to managed payments by the end of the third quarter. We are maintaining our full year guidance despite the fact that this accelerated ramp puts an additional 100 basis points of revenue pressure in 2021. The good news is that this pressure begins to ease in Q4 and obviously positions us for accelerated revenue growth in 2022. 
Finally, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.15, even as we continue to invest heavily in our growth initiatives. Venmo continued its strong performance in Q2 with $58 billion in TPV, up 58% year-over-year, with over 76 million active accounts. Revenue growth accelerated to almost 70% in Q2, our highest growth rate in the past year, fueled by Venmo's product diversification strategy. 
More than 500,000 customers have established new business profiles on Venmo with more than 300,000 created in Q2 alone. Pay with Venmo revenues grew by 183% year-over-year. We're also seeing strong adoption and trading of crypto on Venmo. In this quarter, we expanded the Venmo value proposition to allow merchants and consumers to pay for goods and services and receive buyer and seller protections for commerce transactions. 
This has been a very successful feature on PayPal's P2P services, and we expect it will be widely adopted on Venmo. I'm pleased to report that the initial version of our new consumer wallet super app is code complete, and we are now beginning to slowly ramp. In the next several months, we plan to be fully ramped in the U.S. with a host of products and services across payments, basic consumer financial services and commerce and shopping tools launching every quarter. 
New features will include high-yield savings, early access to direct deposit funds, new and improved bill pay functionality, messaging capabilities outside of P2P to enable family and friend communications as well as additional crypto capabilities and customized deals and offers. Each wallet will be unique, driven by our advanced AI and machine learning capabilities in order to enhance each customer's experiences and opportunities. 
As I previously mentioned, 32 million merchants now rely on PayPal. They trust that our scale, security, tools and resources will help them to grow their businesses in today's rapidly emerging digital economy. PayPal is the only payments company to offer features like global seller protection and fraud prevention services at no additional cost. We are 1 of a few payments companies to allow consumers to use cryptocurrency as a funding source to check out on our platform. 
Our Buy Now, Pay Later offering comes at no additional cost to merchants, while boosting their conversion rates and increasing cart sizes by 39%. And we continue to expand our product differentiation through recent acquisitions like Chargehound and Happy Returns that will drive additional value to both consumers and merchants post a sales transaction. Our announced pricing adjustments in the U.S. align our pricing with the value we deliver while giving us flexibility to aggressively compete in full stack processing and at point-of-sale checkout. 
We continue to see strong demand for our in-store services with approximately 1.3 million merchants now accepting our QR codes, and continued momentum and excitement across our large enterprise merchants. In fact, every 20 seconds, a new merchant signs up to use our QR codes. It's also very encouraging to see that consumers who use our QR codes, spend more TPV, in fact, 19% more TPV on the PayPal platform. 
Our in-store efforts will no doubt be a multiyear journey, but these trends reinforce our conviction to be a seamless omnichannel wallet. In Q2, our overall in-store efforts across QR and cards equaled $6.8 billion in TPV, up 39% year-over-year. Our in-store suite of services continues to expand with the launch of PayPal Zettel in the U.S. 
As in Europe, PayPal now offers small businesses in the U.S., an integrated commerce solution that not only helps them to accept payments in store with the Zettle card reader, but also helps them to manage sales and inventory across their various channels all in 1 place. Our Buy Now, Pay Later product continues its strong growth and is proving to be extremely popular for consumers and merchants alike. 
Since launch, we have processed over $3.5 billion in TPV with more than $1.5 billion of that TPV in Q2 alone. Approximately 650,000 merchants have customers who use our Buy Now, Pay Later capabilities and 40,000 have positioned Buy Now, Pay Later upstream on their product pages. 
Over 7 million consumers have transacted more than 20 million times with our Buy Now, Pay Later product. Australia is now fully deployed and off to a strong start with additional countries in Europe slated to roll out later this year. 
Our employees, customers and government officials expect PayPal to be a role model and a responsible corporate citizen. I am proud to say that we are delivering on our commitments to advance social justice and racial equality. Over the past year, we have committed all of the $535 million we pledge towards advancing racial economic equality. And we recently launched a new $100 million commitment focused on women's economic empowerment. 
These efforts are a direct reflection of our values and our belief that PayPal must be part of a solution that drives a better future for all of us. I'd like to thank our employees for their passion and their never-ending commitment towards shaping a new and inclusive financial services system. We are entering a new era, and we couldn't be more excited to help drive an emerging digital future where all small businesses and consumers can participate and thrive in a post-pandemic world. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to John."

Our results are indicative of the strength, diversification",2176,"Thanks, Dan. I'd like to start by thanking the entire PayPal team for their continued commitment to serve our customers and execute on our priorities. We're reporting another very strong quarter. Our results are indicative of the strength, diversification and breadth of our 2-sided global payments platform. 
PayPal sits at the intersection of digital transformation and e-commerce penetration. As the largest open platform for digital payments globally, we're uniquely positioned to address the opportunity that these secular tailwinds present. Over the past 6 quarters, our team's focus, collaboration and resilience have allowed us to innovate at scale and deliver our best performance in company history.  Globally, the pace and shape of the recovery varies. 
As the environment continues to evolve, we are evolving with it to serve the changing needs of our consumers and merchants. During the second quarter, restrictions started to relax across our core markets, and we saw the beginning of a return to normalcy in consumer behavior. Consumers are spending again in verticals that have been severely affected and have become more comfortable shopping in-person and dining out. 
Merchants are repositioning for the post-pandemic world. Relative to our expectations, which were for reopening spend to closely track vaccination rates, we've seen travel and events volumes return more rapidly. At the same time, in markets that have reopened, elevated e-commerce spending above pre-pandemic levels is ongoing and indicative of permanent shifts in consumer behavior. 
On a 2-year basis, our business performance is remarkably consistent and very strong. Our second quarter results last year were exceptional. We grew revenue 22%, delivered a 28.2% operating margin and grew non-GAAP EPS 49%. Both the operating margin and earnings growth were the best performance we've ever delivered. It's remarkable that in the second quarter this year, when we're lapping this explosive growth our business is continuing to perform at a very high level. 
Our results are even more impressive given the transitory headwinds we're facing from eBay. This year, as part of eBay's managed payments transition, we're absorbing a rapid migration of marketplaces volumes off of our platform. Further compounding this effect is that eBay benefited meaningfully from COVID last year, which makes the comparison this year even more difficult. 
For context, from 2016 to 2019, a the 3-year compound annual growth rate for eBay Marketplaces revenue on our platform was approximately 2%. And in 2020, this revenue grew 11%, approximately 5x faster. Also worth highlighting is that through this period as eBay's contribution to our revenue declined from 22% to 13%. We've expanded our operating margin 500 basis points. 
Given the accelerated pace of migration in 2021, there's a more pronounced effect on our operating margin and earnings growth profile this year. At the same time, this is truly a transitory effect on our results, which we now expect to be very largely contained to 2021 with much less of a tailwind to next year. And as we've discussed over the past several quarters, near-term forecasting continues to be complex given the global macroeconomic backdrop, varied stages of pandemic recovery and differing paths of reopening. 
It's with this orientation and mindset that we head into the back half of 2021. Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to highlight our second quarter performance. Total payment volume grew 40% at spot and 36% on a currency-neutral basis to $311 billion. Our Q2 TPV grew at a 2-year compound annual growth rate of 34%, accelerating from 33% in Q1 and indicative of the strong momentum in our business. 
Versus the second quarter last year, merchant services volume grew 43% currency neutral. A resurgence in travel in advance as well as core payment volumes contributed to this performance. This quarter, eBay had a much greater effect on our TPV than in the first quarter. In Q2, eBay Marketplaces volumes declined 41% currency neutral from last year. This is in comparison to a 3% decline last quarter. eBay represented 4% of our volume in Q2, down 512 basis points from last year. 
In addition to lapping elevated growth during the pandemic, we saw a faster ramp of the payments transition than what we had expected earlier this year, which resulted in a larger decline in Q2 volume. Given the speed at which we're seeing intermediation progress, our plans now contemplate nearly 100% completion of the merchant migration by the end of the third quarter. This accelerated time frame means that while we expect a similar drag to our volume, revenue and earnings growth in the third quarter, this impact lessens in Q4 and begins to tail off from there. 
As a result, we will have a much cleaner exit to 2021. Revenue increased 19% on a spot basis and 17% currency neutral to $6.24 billion. Transaction revenue grew 17% to $5.8 billion. And on a 2-year basis, transaction revenue grew 22.3% in Q2 versus 22.7% in Q1 of this year. In addition to the consistency of our results, this performance is even more remarkable, excluding eBay. 
In the second quarter, eBay Marketplaces revenue declined 51% in comparison to Q2 '20 and 27% sequentially. Our revenue, excluding eBay, grew 32%, an 11-point acceleration from last year's already strong second quarter. Other value-added services revenue grew 40% on a spot basis and 36% currency-neutral to $441 million. These results were driven by strengthening credit performance and portfolio growth, partially offset by lower interest income on customer balances. 
In the second quarter, transaction take rate was 1.86% and total take rate was 2.01%. The the mix effect of eBay contributed to more than 1/3 of the 37 basis point reduction in take rate. The blended take rate on eBay volumes this quarter was 3.22% in comparison to 4.1% in Q2 last year. The remainder of the decline was primarily driven by reduced currency volatility in the quarter, which resulted in a lower growth rate in foreign exchange fees, a decline of $122 million from foreign currency hedges recorded as international transaction revenue and growth in bill payment volumes. 
Bill Payment is a vertical characterized by both a lower take rate and an overall lower cost of funding than our e-commerce volumes. Q2 was another great quarter of volume-based expense performance. Transaction expense came in at 81 basis points as a rate of TPV this year relative to 83 basis points last year. Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was a record low 9 basis points versus 12 basis points in Q2 last year. The net effect of credit provisioning on credit losses in the quarter, inclusive of originations and reserve reversals resulted in a benefit of $104 million. 
In the quarter, we had an increase in loan origination activity and ended Q2 with $3.9 billion in gross receivables, reflecting sequential growth of 11%. Strong performance of our loan portfolio, improving macroeconomic trends and the mix of shorter duration originations from our installment pay products resulted in our reserve coverage ratio declining to 14.9% from 21.4% at the end of the first quarter. 
As a result, transaction margin dollars grew 19% in the second quarter and transaction margin reached 56.8%. 
I'd now like to cover our nontransaction-related operating expenses. Overall, these expenses increased 27% and represented 30% of revenue. These are higher growth rates than what we've incurred historically. But as I've suggested before, we believe that there has never been a more important time to invest in our business as the secular tailwinds in our business have perhaps never been stronger. In Q2, we again invested aggressively in product innovation and our go-to-market initiatives. Sales and marketing increased 68% in the quarter, and technology and development spend grew 23%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 11% to $1.65 billion, and our operating margin was 26.5%. This includes an approximately 12% or $360 million decline in transaction margin dollars from eBay Marketplaces. 
Normalizing for the reserve build last year and subsequent release this year, non-GAAP operating income declined 7% and operating margin was 23.9%. And on a 2-year basis, the compound annual growth rate for operating income is 29%. For the second quarter, non-GAAP EPS grew 8% to $1.15. This includes an approximate $0.27 per share headwind from the decline in eBay Marketplaces transaction margin dollars. 
Adjusting for our increased credit provisions last year and this year's release of reserves, EPS declined 9%. And on a 2-year basis, this represents 27% earnings growth annually. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.4 billion. And in addition, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow. 
I'd now like to discuss our outlook for the rest of 2021. Our business is performing exceedingly well, and overall, consistent with the outlook we provided on our last call. Given our strong year-to-date performance and our expectations for the back half, we're raising our TPV outlook and reiterating full year revenue and earnings. We now expect TPV growth to be in the range of 33% to 35% given the strong volume trends in our business. 
We continue to expect revenue for the year to be approximately $25.75 billion, representing 20% growth on a spot basis. In addition, we continue to expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $4.70 or growth of approximately 21%. We raised our 2021 revenue outlook by $250 million or approximately 1 point of growth when we reported our first quarter results in May. We're now absorbing more pressure from eBay than we had previously expected. 
Our current outlook contemplates an approximately 7-point negative impact to revenue growth for the year. This corresponds to an approximately $0.85 negative impact to non-GAAP EPS from reduced transaction margin dollars. We're pleased that the strength of our platform and the diversification of our business is allowing us to maintain this elevated outlook. 
In addition, we expect to generate more than $5 billion in free cash flow or approximately $0.20 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. 
Now turning to guidance for the third quarter. This quarter, we're up against our toughest revenue comparisons versus last year. In Q3 '20, we reported 25% revenue growth, our strongest performance for the year. As a result of this dynamic as well as eBay's managed payments transition, our plans had always assumed that in Q3, we would report our lowest level of quarterly revenue growth for the year. 
However, we're now planning for eBay's drag on our revenue growth to be greater than previously expected, resulting from both the accelerated pace of merchant migration in international markets as well as some additional core pressure which magnifies this result. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $6.15 billion to $6.25 billion. At the midpoint, this represents growth of approximately 14% at spot and includes about 8.5 points drag from eBay or approximately $465 million negative impact. On a 2-year basis, inclusive of this drag, our guidance represents 19% growth. We also expect non-GAAP diluted EPS and to be flat to last year or approximately $1.07, reflecting increased investments to support our growth initiatives and the pressure we're facing from eBay. 
Our financial performance over the first half of 2021 has been very strong and consistent with the guidance we've outlined at the outset of each quarter. At the same time, the environment in which we're operating, while more stable than a year ago, continues to be very dynamic and more challenging to predict than normal. Adding to the complexity is this exercise of predicting eBay's transition for which we have less than perfect visibility. Each quarter, we've tried to provide our best estimate of the level of performance that we believe we can deliver. 
Overall, our growth remains strong. And importantly, we continue to see the categories that benefited from quarantine measures and shelter-in-place activities last year maintain higher levels of e-commerce volumes in comparison to pre-COVID levels. Our conviction and our ability to drive sustainably strong performance and in the strength of our franchise, has never been greater. This year, we expect to process approximately $1.25 trillion of payments volume. We expect to grow revenue by 20% more than offsetting pressure to revenue growth of approximately 7 points from eBay and lapping our strongest year with 22% revenue growth. 
And given the momentum we have in development and innovation and the pace of scale of the new experiences we're bringing to our customers, we are investing in our business at record levels. 
Further, last year, we grew earnings 31%. On top of that performance, this year, we plan to grow our earnings by 21%. Importantly, our team has never been more focused or aligned around the shared goal of being the leading digital payments company in the world. Last year was a pivotal moment in our history. And this year, we're building on that foundation and continuing to realize our ambition for greater relevance, ubiquity and impact as a global payments leader. 
We look forward to sharing more of our progress with you. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

Look, third quarter has always been -- was going to be our toughest quarter from a year-over-year growth rate perspective for a lot of the reasons I outlined. 
There are a number of reasons that are contributing to the in the fourth quarter. But I think before I get into them, it's important to understand that if you look on a year-over-2-year basis, the revenue growth actually is very consistent in each quarter this year. And for the full year, we'll be growing in the neighborhood of 20%. But the items that are contributing to the growth in the fourth quarter, there's a few that I think are notable to call out. One is certainly less pressure from eBay that abates somewhat in the fourth quarter. 
We also have some benefit from the pricing changes that we announced that go into effect next month. And then we have a number of different initiatives that we're rolling out in the second half of the year in which we get most of the benefit or the full quarter's worth of benefit in the fourth quarter. And so all of those things tend to drive I think some acceleration in what we're seeing in revenue from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And then as usual, we always have some seasonality around the holiday shopping season, which we again expect this year."

And then as John mentioned, as we go into Q2, those headwinds that have been going against us on eBay turnaround and become tailwinds. So we had something like 850 basis points of pressure in Q3, as John mentioned. That drops to 600 basis points of pressure as we go into Q4. So that's a natural lift of about 2.5 points of revenue growth. And as we go into 2022, that continues to help our results. 
And I think if you look beyond the eBay impact and look at our adjusted results, you can see that the core business and the strength of our franchise has really never been performing better. I think John mentioned 1 thing that I think is worth highlighting that the elevated spend around online is continuing even as we see economies reopen. I mean you could see that in our growth rates of our volumes up 40%, 48% without eBay. 
But if you even look at things like our daily active users, our daily active users versus pre-pandemic levels are up 43% and they were up substantially last year, and they continue to grow as we go into this year. And so I think we have a lot of strength in the core. Some of that's being matched by eBay, but eBay is all about timing. We always see these revenues were moving away. It's just a matter of timing. And now we've got kind of what we think is the right case, 100% in third quarter. And then from there on in, those pressures abate."

But to start with, we've always known that 2021 was going to be the year where we had the most significant impact from eBay. And the fact that we're lapping what was tremendous growth last year and still performing at the level that we are this year in the face of that impact from eBay is really just quite phenomenal. 
But I'll give you an example that I think really tells the picture here. So last year, in the second quarter, we grew revenue 22%. And in that number, there was a benefit of 5 percentage points of growth from eBay. So 22% revenue growth of 5 percentage points of benefit from eBay. This year, in the second quarter, we grew revenue 19% and that number included 800 or 8 percentage points of headwind related to eBay's business. And so that really underscores the strength of the franchise and how well we're performing right now. 
And quite frankly, it's something that we're very excited about because this sets us up for, I think, much cleaner performance going forward and an acceleration in some of our growth rates when eBay is a much slower growing and smaller part of our business going forward."

Obviously, they remain a very close strategic partner for us. We still have about 60% share of checkout on eBay and obviously, eBay merchants and consumers want and desire to use PayPal. If you think about -- just to give perspective historic perspective, if you think about when we split from eBay 6 years ago, eBay's revenues as a percent of our total, were 26% of our total revenues. And we believe that they're going to end this year around 3% or so and that their TPV is going to be under 3% as a percent of our overall volumes. 
So this is, as I mentioned before, it's a timing issue. And frankly, the sooner eBay transitions the better it is for our future revenue growth. I'd also say just 1 other thing, we are making a lot of progress with a lot of other marketplaces coming out of the eBay restrictions. And we continue to see Alibaba continue to ramp. We're really pleased to watch the growth rates there. And we're making a lot of progress with a lot of other marketplaces that we'll talk about as we get along further in the year. 
So this eBay transition is behind us at the end of this quarter. The headwinds dissipate and we're glad to start to move forward. And as John said, we'll really be able to see the strength of the franchise start to shine as a result of that."

I think I'll start on this one, and then maybe John can can kick in. So first of all, clearly, pretty much every merchant, whether it's small, midsize or large, is envisioning a seamless omnichannel feature. And that's where physical and online kind of blur together that they now start to use that to digitally interact with their customers to basically tie in their loyalty programs, customize deals and offers to individual consumers. And that is moving well beyond just checkout. 
Before we were thinking QR codes and other forms of contactless payments were great because it was both fast and maybe more healthy in a pandemic environment, but all of our conversations have go beyond checkout. People are looking to drive loyalty and they're looking to drive rewards and coupons, more flexibility, how consumers like order, track, pay for their services, customized incentives. And so that's really the conversations that we're having, and that's why we're getting a ton of traction. 
By the way, I do think that this seamless omnichannel efforts by us is key to us doing everyday usage. And if I look at not just multiple millions of consumers that are using our QR codes, but what's happening is they also are spending 19% more TPV on the PayPal platform. And that halo effect is a big deal as we look forward, especially as we look towards the super app, which maybe somebody will talk about later. 
But the more and more of these services we put together, the more and more of that halo impact that occurs. And so we obviously are up to now 1.3 million merchants. Every 20 second merchants signing up for more QR codes with us. We have a lot of momentum with large enterprises right now. But the conversations have moved to how do we fully integrate their loyalty programs into our app, how do we drive customized deals for them. And so those are taking a little longer to go live to say, but they're much more integrated than we've ever seen before. 
And we're seeing with customers like CVS. Once you start to integrate that together, once you start to get a habituation, we saw CVS transactions go up 151% on month-over-month. And so we're really beginning to see some traction in the marketplace around all of these things. We're very excited about it. It's going to be a multiyear journey for us. But we know that both merchants and customers expect us to be fully omni."

We always knew that second quarter was going to be the low point of the year because we did '21 by 0.3 million or 0.4 million NNAs a year ago. And even though they're performing better than cohorts that we previously had historically, the churn is lower. It's still a ton of incremental turn versus traditional cohorts on the second quarter. 
And we're clearly beginning to see that dissipate already this year as I look at NNAs coming in. And so I feel really good about that guidance right now. Q4 is always our high point. of the year. And so you'll see it start to build from second quarter up into third quarter and then up again into fourth quarter. 
And then maybe if I can just if that answers your question on NNA. I'll go quickly into the super app. Yes, we made a really substantial milestone by being complete on this first iteration of the Super App. We're slowly ramping the first change we've done to the app since I've been here that we've done to the app. And so we want to kind of measure what the engagement levels are and the uptake of it. But this is going to be something where -- this isn't a big bang theory that this app in and of itself this version is the be all and handle. Obviously, is going to look across payments, basic financial services and shopping tools. You're going to see releases and enhanced functionality come out pretty much every single quarter. But early on, that's going to include things like high-yield savings, enhanced bill pay, which will do improved search and a better UX, more billers, aggregators. We're going to do 2-day early access to direct deposit, budgeting tools something we haven't talked about 2-way messaging. 
So if I P2P you $10 for whatever you're doing, and you want to message me right back without sending me a P2P, you can go do that. And we think that's going to drive a lot of engagement on the platform. You don't have to leave the platform to message back and forth. Obviously, the UX is being redesigned. We've got rewards and shopping. We've got a whole giving hub around crowdsourcing, giving the charities. And then obviously, Buy Now, Pay Later will be fully integrated into it. 
And by the way, as we go into next year, we got all -- the last time I counted, it was like 25 new capabilities that we were going to put into the super app. And so I don't want to dismiss at all what we've done right now, but it just continues to improve going forward. And the way that I'm looking at success with the super app is what kind of engagement levels do we get? I fully expect engagement to move up what's happening to our average revenue per active account. By the way, even with the new services we've recently launched, our average revenue per active account ex eBay, went up 13% this past quarter, and that's a really good sign. Along with the 11% improvement in TPA, which was really a record in the last 4 years or so. 
And so we've got a lot going on, I think, engagement, average revenue per active user, and then we'll look clearly at all the halo effect as well. But we're excited to be on the journey right now and be underway. And again, you'll just see it continue to improve quarter-over-quarter."

So look, it was a another terrific quarter. I mean, just in every way for Buy Now, Pay Later. As I mentioned, we did $1.5 billion of TPV in the quarter alone.

As I mentioned, we did $1.5 billion of TPV in the quarter alone. I had a $3.5 billion, but this is the amazing piece of a stat on that $1.5 billion. That's up 50% from Q1 sequentially. 
So you can really see that even if we had so much momentum in Q1, that momentum really accelerated in Q2. We've got a bunch more merchants using it now, 650,000 merchants. More and more of them are presenting at upstream on their product badges that obviously gives us a disproportionate share of checkout when that occurs. And you could tell by the 7 million customers doing 20 million-plus transactions that obviously, our repeat rates are extremely high. 
There's a lot of satisfaction with the product. It's still something like 70% are repeating within 6 months. And our halo effect is the same as it was last quarter, still a 15% halo effect in TPV, still a substantial reduction in our TE costs, about a 16% reduction. We're still seeing 80% plus of these funded through debit. And Australia, we put in place just a couple of weeks ago, and then it's off to a really strong start right away. 
So -- and part of the reason, Con,that we're getting such strong results is because we have 400 million customers. And when we put something in, it happens at scale, and we know those customers. So the approval rates are much higher. Returns are lower because we know the customer. And so a lot of the other Buy Now, Pay Later players don't necessarily know the consumer the way that we know the consumer in this. And so we're pretty pleased. We've got a ton on our road map ahead in terms of expanding internationally, the more and more functionality that we want to put on the product itself."

And so in the context of our $25-plus billion revenue base, I would say that for the year, these are relatively immaterial on our results. But I think very importantly, this provides a lot more transparency and clarity to our customer base around how we're pricing and really trying to price to the value that we provide for these customers. 
And we've demonstrated time and again where that value comes from, and just survey data on customers' willingness to buy when PayPal is presented at checkout that is exponentially greater than when it's not. So this is probably overdue. It's been the first time in 20 years, but made a change to our base pricing like this. But certainly, I think it puts us more in line with the market and really prices to the value that we're creating for our customer base."

I mean we obviously carefully review every 1 of our pricing changes up or down. We do extensive market research before we do any change. And as John said, we look at where we add value and we price in accordance with that. 
Clearly, on the branded side, we think we add a tremendous amount of value things that John talked about, buyer and seller protection, now palette at no incremental cost for protection, highest checkout conversion, et cetera. But we took that down rates for basic full-stack processing. That also was reduced somewhat substantially from the plus 30 to $2.59 plus $0.49. And that is going to enable us to aggressively compete for all of the payment processing of the merchants that do business with us. 
And you've heard us say time and time again, David, that we are going to move into the in-store space. We're going to move so aggressively in there. We rolled out settle in the U.S. is a really beautiful full package. It doesn't just include card reader, but inventory management, sales reads out and allows a merchant to seamlessly load inventory in both their online and in-store locations than across multiple channels as well. 
And so we're obviously going to be very aggressive on moving into in-store. And it's always been part of our strategy. And by the way, if a small merchant, does all of their business with us they can actually see their overall costs come down. And we want to encourage them to do all of their business with us because we are a trusted platform, they do turn to us -- And we price, we think, the right way. We finally have unbundled some of this branded and unbranded because that's how the market is playing and we know where we want to be aggressive, and we're going after that."

Well, we continue to be really pleased with the momentum we're seeing on crypto. And we're obviously adding incremental functionality into that, whether you probably saw increased limits to $100,000 a week. We're right in the middle of some open banking integration, which will increase the ability to fully integrate it into the ACH and do faster payments. 
We're going to launch, hopefully, maybe even next month in the U.K., open up trading there. We're working right now on transfers to third-party wallets, and we really want to make sure that we create a very seamless process for taxes and tax reporting. And so we're really looking at how do we integrate that into both the trading and the buy with crypto on our platform. 
But I will say this, like all of that is interesting, but it isn't the main course in terms of what we are trying to do with our blockchain and digital currency business unit. We are clearly thinking about what the next generation of the financial system looks like, how we can help shape that. We are working with regulatory agencies central banks across the world, the number of countries that are looking at CBDCs, Central Bank Issued Digital Currencies is increasing rapidly. You're like at 40 countries like 6 months a year ago, you're almost up to 100 countries looking at it right now. 
And clearly, there is an opportunity to think about a new infrastructure that can more efficiently read that to be a lower cost do transactions and also getting money to people much faster than happens today. I mean the other day, I sent NEFT from 1 bank to another bank. And that bank told me we're taking 3 days to access that money in the FTAs. That's crazy. It needs to be instantaneous. And there's a lot of desire by governments to really think how can you create a more efficient system using new technology to bring in more citizens, more underbanked, underserved citizens into the financial system because they disproportionately pay a higher take rate than those who are fully banked or higher income levels. 
And there's a lot of connections between digital wallets and Central Bank issued digital currencies, Imagine not having to send out stimulus checks but sending those directly into a digital wallet where you instantaneously receive it, and you don't have to go and to check and exchange that and get charged for that exchange. There's just so many benefits to that as well as just plain utility to payments. How can we use smart contracts more efficiently? How can we digitize assets and open those up to consumers that may not have had access to that before. There are some interesting DFI applications as well. 
And so we are working really hard. And by the way, you probably have seen we are trying to pick off the very best talent in the ecosystem to come weaker at PayPal. We have a list of names and phone numbers and we are slowly but surely building a team that I think is going to really shape the thought process around this, and I'm really pleased with at least the early returns on that. Hopefully, that helps you."

But the second area, and this sort of gets into the second part of your question as well, but we're also investing aggressively in our business. I would argue that there's never been a more important time in our business to invest right now, to invest for a future where we believe in the primacy of digital wallets. We believe in the permanent pull forward of e-commerce. We believe in the ubiquity of digital payments and to we want to help shape that outcome. We want to be a leader in that space. 
Now what happens that the structural nature of our business, our margins want to go up. And by the way, they will to be very clear about that. But at the same time, we don't want to be a prisoner to expanding operating margin 1 quarter to the next because we want to be able to appropriately invest in our business to create the most shareholder value that we can over the long term and become the company that we all believe that we can be. 
And so close out, our margins will go up. We said this year that we expect to have a flat to maybe some marginal improvement in our margins. But as we noted at our Investor Day earlier this year, our margins will go up over time, but we want to invest for growth and invest to be that leading digital company payments company that we know we can be."

I'm pleased to say that on the heels of a record year, our Q2 results once again reflect some of the best performance in our history on both an absolute and a relative basis.It is now clear",1303,"Thanks, Gabrielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to say that on the heels of a record year, our Q2 results once again reflect some of the best performance in our history on both an absolute and a relative basis.
It is now clear that customers around the world have embraced all forms of digital payments. Even in regions where in-person activities are returning towards pre-pandemic levels, in this new normal, PayPal serves as an essential and trusted platform for both consumers and merchants, across all forms of commerce, payments and basic financial services.
As a result, we hit a new milestone in Q2 surpassing $300 billion of TPV for the first time in our history, growing 40% on a spot basis to $311 billion with an annualized run rate of approximately $1.25 trillion. This is even more notable given that eBay's TPV on our platform declined by 37%. eBay exited the quarter at under 4% of our volume, and we expect their TPV will approach 2.5% of our total volumes by year-end.
Excluding eBay, our volumes grew by a remarkable 48% on a spot basis. Our active accounts now exceed 400 million, up 16% and to 403 million. We added 11.4 million net new active accounts in the quarter, including an additional 1.5 million merchant accounts. That brings our total merchant count to 32 million. We still expect to end the year at the higher end of our previous guidance of 52 million to 55 million net new active accounts.
Transactions in the quarter grew by 27% to $4.74 billion. And even as our net new actives continue to show strong growth, our transactions per active account accelerated 11% in the quarter to 43.5x as our consumers engage more frequently across our growing suite of services. We grew our revenues by 19% to $6.4 billion. This growth comes even as we lap strong results from last year and absorbed 811 basis points of revenue pressure from eBay, as their revenues on our platform declined 51% in Q2.
Excluding eBay, our revenues grew at approximately 32%. We now expect that eBay will be essentially 100% complete with their migration to managed payments by the end of the third quarter. We are maintaining our full year guidance despite the fact that this accelerated ramp puts an additional 100 basis points of revenue pressure in 2021. The good news is that this pressure begins to ease in Q4 and obviously positions us for accelerated revenue growth in 2022. Finally, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.15, even as we continue to invest heavily in our growth initiatives. 
Venmo continued its strong performance in Q2 with $58 billion in TPV, up 58% year-over-year, with over 76 million active accounts. Revenue growth accelerated to almost 70% in Q2, our highest growth rate in the past year, fueled by Venmo's product diversification strategy.
More than 500,000 customers have established new business profiles on Venmo with more than 300,000 created in Q2 alone. Pay with Venmo revenues grew by 183% year-over-year. We're also seeing strong adoption and trading of crypto on Venmo. In this quarter, we expanded the Venmo value proposition to allow merchants and consumers to pay for goods and services and receive buyer and seller protections for commerce transactions. This has been a very successful feature on PayPal's P2P services, and we expect it will be widely adopted on Venmo.
I'm pleased to report that the initial version of our new consumer wallet super app is code complete, and we are now beginning to slowly ramp. In the next several months, we plan to be fully ramped in the U.S. with a host of products and services across payments, basic consumer financial services and commerce and shopping tools launching every quarter. New features will include high-yield savings, early access to direct deposit funds, new and improved bill pay functionality, messaging capabilities outside of P2P to enable family and friend communications as well as additional crypto capabilities and customized deals and offers. Each wallet will be unique, driven by our advanced AI and machine learning capabilities in order to enhance each customer's experiences and opportunities.
As I previously mentioned, 32 million merchants now rely on PayPal. They trust that our scale, security, tools and resources will help them to grow their businesses in today's rapidly emerging digital economy. PayPal is the only payments company to offer features like global seller protection and fraud prevention services at no additional cost. We are one of a few payments companies to allow consumers to use cryptocurrency as a funding source to check out on our platform.
Our Buy Now, Pay Later offering comes at no additional cost to merchants, while boosting their conversion rates and increasing cart sizes by 39%. And we continue to expand our product differentiation through recent acquisitions like Chargehound and Happy Returns that will drive additional value to both consumers and merchants post a sales transaction. Our announced pricing adjustments in the U.S. align our pricing with the value we deliver while giving us flexibility to aggressively compete in full stack processing and at point-of-sale checkout.
We continue to see strong demand for our in-store services with approximately 1.3 million merchants now accepting our QR codes and continued momentum and excitement across our large enterprise merchants. In fact, every 20 seconds, a new merchant signs up to use our QR codes. It's also very encouraging to see that consumers who use our QR codes, spend more TPV, in fact, 19% more TPV on the PayPal platform.
Our in-store efforts will no doubt be a multiyear journey, but these trends reinforce our conviction to be a seamless omni-channel wallet. In Q2, our overall in-store efforts across QR and cards equaled $6.8 billion in TPV, up 39% year-over-year.
Our in-store suite of services continues to expand with the launch of PayPal Zettle in the U.S. As in Europe, PayPal now offers small businesses in the U.S., an integrated commerce solution that not only helps them to accept payments in store with the Zettle card reader but also helps them to manage sales and inventory across their various channels all in one place.
Our Buy Now, Pay Later product continues its strong growth and is proving to be extremely popular for consumers and merchants alike. Since launch, we have processed over $3.5 billion in TPV with more than $1.5 billion of that TPV in Q2 alone. Approximately 650,000 merchants have customers who use our Buy Now, Pay Later capabilities, and 40,000 have positioned Buy Now, Pay Later upstream on their product pages.
Over 7 million consumers have transacted more than 20 million times with our Buy Now, Pay Later product. Australia is now fully deployed and off to a strong start with additional countries in Europe slated to roll out later this year.
Our employees, customers and government officials expect PayPal to be a role model and a responsible corporate citizen. I am proud to say that we are delivering on our commitments to advance social justice and racial equity. Over the past year, we have committed all of the $535 million we pledged towards advancing racial economic equality. And we recently launched a new $100 million commitment focused on women's economic empowerment. These efforts are a direct reflection of our values and our belief that PayPal must be part of a solution that drives a better future for all of us.
I'd like to thank our employees for their passion and their never-ending commitment towards shaping a new and inclusive financial services system. We are entering a new era, and we couldn't be more excited to help drive an emerging digital future where all small businesses and consumers can participate and thrive in a post-pandemic world.
And with that, let me turn the call over to John."

I'd like to start by thanking the entire PayPal team for their continued commitment to serve our customers and execute on our priorities. We're reporting another very strong quarter. Our results are indicative of the strength, diversification",2175,"Thanks, Dan. I'd like to start by thanking the entire PayPal team for their continued commitment to serve our customers and execute on our priorities. We're reporting another very strong quarter. Our results are indicative of the strength, diversification and breadth of our 2-sided global payments platform.
PayPal sits at the intersection of digital transformation and e-commerce penetration. As the largest open platform for digital payments globally, we're uniquely positioned to address the opportunity that these secular tailwinds present. Over the past 6 quarters, our team's focus, collaboration and resilience have allowed us to innovate at scale and deliver our best performance in company history.  Globally, the pace and shape of the recovery varies. As the environment continues to evolve, we are evolving with it to serve the changing needs of our consumers and merchants. 
During the second quarter, restrictions started to relax across our core markets, and we saw the beginning of a return to normalcy in consumer behavior. Consumers are spending again in verticals that have been severely affected and have become more comfortable shopping in-person and dining out.
Merchants are repositioning for the post-pandemic world. Relative to our expectations, which were for reopening spend to closely track vaccination rates, we've seen travel and events volumes return more rapidly. At the same time, in markets that have reopened, elevated e-commerce spending above pre-pandemic levels is ongoing and indicative of permanent shifts in consumer behavior.
On a 2-year basis, our business performance is remarkably consistent and very strong. Our second quarter results last year were exceptional. We grew revenue 22%, delivered a 28.2% operating margin and grew non-GAAP EPS 49%. Both the operating margin and earnings growth were the best performance we've ever delivered. It's remarkable that, in the second quarter this year when we're lapping this explosive growth, our business is continuing to perform at a very high level.
Our results are even more impressive given the transitory headwinds we're facing from eBay. This year, as part of eBay's managed payments transition, we're absorbing a rapid migration of marketplaces volumes off of our platform. Further compounding this effect is that eBay benefited meaningfully from COVID last year, which makes the comparison this year even more difficult.
For context, from 2016 to 2019, the 3-year compound annual growth rate for eBay Marketplaces revenue on our platform was approximately 2%. And in 2020, this revenue grew 11%, approximately 5x faster. Also worth highlighting is that through this period, as eBay's contribution to our revenue declined from 22% to 13%, we've expanded our operating margin 500 basis points.
Given the accelerated pace of migration in 2021, there's a more pronounced effect on our operating margin and earnings growth profile this year. At the same time, this is truly a transitory effect on our results, which we now expect to be very largely contained to 2021 with much less of a tailwind to next year. And as we've discussed over the past several quarters, near-term forecasting continues to be complex given the global macroeconomic backdrop, varied stages of pandemic recovery and differing paths of reopening. It's with this orientation and mindset that we head into the back half of 2021.
Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to highlight our second quarter performance. Total payment volume grew 40% at spot and 36% on a currency-neutral basis to $311 billion. Our Q2 TPV grew at a 2-year compound annual growth rate of 34%, accelerating from 33% in Q1 and indicative of the strong momentum in our business. Versus the second quarter last year, merchant services volume grew 43% currency neutral. A resurgence in travel and events as well as core payment volumes contributed to this performance. 
This quarter, eBay had a much greater effect on our TPV than in the first quarter. In Q2, eBay Marketplaces volumes declined 41% currency neutral from last year. This is in comparison to a 3% decline last quarter. eBay represented 4% of our volume in Q2, down 512 basis points from last year.
In addition to lapping elevated growth during the pandemic, we saw a faster ramp of the payments transition than what we had expected earlier this year, which resulted in a larger decline in Q2 volume. Given the speed at which we're seeing intermediation progress, our plans now contemplate nearly 100% completion of the merchant migration by the end of the third quarter. This accelerated time frame means that while we expect a similar drag to our volume, revenue and earnings growth in the third quarter, this impact lessens in Q4 and begins to tail off from there. As a result, we will have a much cleaner exit to 2021.
Revenue increased 19% on a spot basis and 17% currency neutral to $6.24 billion. Transaction revenue grew 17% to $5.8 billion; and on a 2-year basis, transaction revenue grew 22.3% in Q2 versus 22.7% in Q1 of this year. In addition to the consistency of our results, this performance is even more remarkable, excluding eBay.
In the second quarter, eBay Marketplaces revenue declined 51% in comparison to Q2 '20 and 27% sequentially. Our revenue, excluding eBay, grew 32%, an 11-point acceleration from last year's already strong second quarter. Other value-added services revenue grew 40% on a spot basis and 36% currency neutral to $441 million. These results were driven by strengthening credit performance and portfolio growth, partially offset by lower interest income on customer balances.
In the second quarter, transaction take rate was 1.86% and total take rate was 2.01%. The mix effect of eBay contributed to more than 1/3 of the 37 basis point reduction in take rate. The blended take rate on eBay volumes this quarter was 3.22% in comparison to 4.1% in Q2 last year. The remainder of the decline was primarily driven by reduced currency volatility in the quarter, which resulted in a lower growth rate in foreign exchange fees, a decline of $122 million from foreign currency hedges recorded as international transaction revenue and growth in bill payment volumes. Bill payment is a vertical characterized by both a lower take rate and an overall lower cost of funding than our e-commerce volumes.
Q2 was another great quarter of volume-based expense performance. Transaction expense came in at 81 basis points as a rate of TPV this year relative to 83 basis points last year. Transaction loss as a rate of TPV was a record low 9 basis points versus 12 basis points in Q2 last year. The net effect of credit provisioning on credit losses in the quarter inclusive of originations and reserve reversals resulted in a benefit of $104 million.
In the quarter, we had an increase in loan origination activity and ended Q2 with $3.9 billion in gross receivables, reflecting sequential growth of 11%. Strong performance of our loan portfolio, improving macroeconomic trends and the mix of shorter duration originations from our installment pay products resulted in our reserve coverage ratio declining to 14.9% from 21.4% at the end of the first quarter. As a result, transaction margin dollars grew 19% in the second quarter and transaction margin reached 56.8%.
I'd now like to cover our nontransaction-related operating expenses. Overall, these expenses increased 27% and represented 30% of revenue. These are higher growth rates than what we've incurred historically, but as I suggested before, we believe that there has never been a more important time to invest in our business as the secular tailwinds in our business have perhaps never been stronger.
In Q2, we again invested aggressively in product innovation and our go-to-market initiatives. Sales and marketing increased 68% in the quarter, and technology and development spend grew 23%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 11% to $1.65 billion, and our operating margin was 26.5%. This includes an approximately 12% or $360 million decline in transaction margin dollars from eBay Marketplaces.
Normalizing for the reserve build last year and subsequent release this year, non-GAAP operating income declined 7% and operating margin was 23.9%. And on a 2-year basis, the compound annual growth rate for operating income is 29%. 
For the second quarter, non-GAAP EPS grew 8% to $1.15. This includes an approximate $0.27 per share headwind from the decline in eBay Marketplaces transaction margin dollars. Adjusting for our increased credit provisions last year and this year's release of reserves, EPS declined 9%. And on a 2-year basis, this represents 27% earnings growth annually.
We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $19.4 billion. And in addition, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow.
I'd now like to discuss our outlook for the rest of 2021. Our business is performing exceedingly well and overall, consistent with the outlook we provided on our last call. Given our strong year-to-date performance and our expectations for the back half, we're raising our TPV outlook and reiterating full year revenue and earnings. We now expect TPV growth to be in the range of 33% to 35% given the strong volume trends in our business.
We continue to expect revenue for the year to be approximately $25.75 billion, representing 20% growth on a spot basis. In addition, we continue to expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $4.70 or growth of approximately 21%. We raised our 2021 revenue outlook by $250 million or approximately 1 point of growth when we reported our first quarter results in May. We're now absorbing more pressure from eBay than we had previously expected.
Our current outlook contemplates an approximately 7-point negative impact to revenue growth for the year. This corresponds to an approximately $0.85 negative impact to non-GAAP EPS from reduced transaction margin dollars. We're pleased that the strength of our platform and the diversification of our business is allowing us to maintain this elevated outlook. In addition, we expect to generate more than $5 billion in free cash flow or approximately $0.20 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue.
Now turning to guidance for the third quarter. This quarter, we're up against our toughest revenue comparisons versus last year. In Q3 '20, we reported 25% revenue growth, our strongest performance for the year. As a result of this dynamic as well as eBay's managed payments transition, our plans had always assumed that, in Q3, we would report our lowest level of quarterly revenue growth for the year. However, we're now planning for eBay's drag on our revenue growth to be greater than previously expected, resulting from both the accelerated pace of merchant migration in international markets as well as some additional core pressure, which magnifies this result.
For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $6.15 billion to $6.25 billion. At the midpoint, this represents growth of approximately 14% at spot and includes about 8.5 points drag from eBay or approximately $465 million negative impact. On a 2-year basis, inclusive of this drag, our guidance represents 19% growth. We also expect non-GAAP diluted EPS and to be flat to last year or approximately $1.07, reflecting increased investments to support our growth initiatives and the pressure we're facing from eBay.
Our financial performance over the first half of 2021 has been very strong and consistent with the guidance we've outlined at the outset of each quarter. At the same time, the environment in which we're operating, while more stable than a year ago, continues to be very dynamic and more challenging to predict than normal. Adding to the complexity is this exercise of predicting eBay's transition for which we have less than perfect visibility. Each quarter, we've tried to provide our best estimate of the level of performance that we believe we can deliver.
Overall, our growth remains strong. And importantly, we continue to see the categories that benefited from quarantine measures and shelter-in-place activities last year maintain higher levels of e-commerce volumes in comparison to pre-COVID levels. Our conviction and our ability to drive sustainably strong performance and in the strength of our franchise has never been greater.
This year, we expect to process approximately $1.25 trillion of payments volume. We expect to grow revenue by 20%, more than offsetting pressure to revenue growth of approximately 7 points from eBay and lapping our strongest year with 22% revenue growth. And given the momentum we have in development and innovation, and the pace of scale of the new experiences we're bringing to our customers, we are investing in our business at record levels. Further, last year, we grew earnings 31%. On top of that performance, this year, we plan to grow our earnings by 21%.
Importantly, our team has never been more focused or aligned around the shared goal of being the leading digital payments company in the world. Last year was a pivotal moment in our history; and this year, we're building on that foundation and continuing to realize our ambition for greater relevance, ubiquity and impact as a global payments leader.  
We look forward to sharing more of our progress with you. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

I'll start there. Look, third quarter has always been -- was going to be our toughest quarter from a year-over-year growth rate perspective for a lot of the reasons I outlined.
There are a number of reasons that are contributing to the growth in the fourth quarter, but I think before I get into them, it's important to understand that if you look on a year-over-2-year basis, the revenue growth actually is very consistent in each quarter this year. And for the full year, we'll be growing in the neighborhood of 20%. 
But of the items that are contributing to the growth in the fourth quarter, there's a few that I think are notable to call out. One is certainly less pressure from eBay. That abates somewhat in the fourth quarter. We also have some benefit from the pricing changes that we announced that go into effect next month. And then we have a number of different initiatives that we're rolling out in the second half of the year in which we get most of the benefit or a full quarter's worth of benefit in the fourth quarter.
And so all of those things tend to drive, I think, some acceleration in what we're seeing in revenue from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And then as usual, we always have some seasonality around the holiday shopping season, which we again expect this year."

And then as John mentioned, as we go into Q2, those headwinds that have been going against us on eBay turnaround and become tailwinds. So we have something like 850 basis points of pressure in Q3, as John mentioned. That drops to 600 basis points of pressure as we go into Q4, so that's a natural lift of about 2.5 points of revenue growth. And as we go into 2022, that continues to help our results.
And I think if you look beyond the eBay impact and look at our adjusted results, you can see that the core business and the strength of our franchise has really never been performing better. I think John mentioned one thing that I think is worth highlighting, that the elevated spend around online is continuing even as we see economies reopen. I mean you could see that in our growth rates of our volumes up 40%, 48% without eBay. But if you even look at things like our daily active users, our daily active users versus pre-pandemic levels are up 43%. They were up substantially last year, and they continue to grow as we go into this year.
And so I think we have a lot of strength in the core. Some of that's being matched by eBay, but eBay is all about timing. We always knew these revenues were moving away. It's just a matter of timing. And now we've got kind of what we think is the right case, 100% in third quarter, and then from there on in, those pressures abate."

But to start with, we've always known that 2021 was going to be the year where we had the most significant impact from eBay. And the fact that we're lapping what was tremendous growth last year and still performing at the level that we are this year in the face of that impact from eBay is really just quite phenomenal.
But I'll give you an example that I think really tells the picture here. So last year, in the second quarter, we grew revenue 22%. And in that number, there was a benefit of 5 percentage points of growth from eBay. So 22% revenue growth with 5 percentage points of benefit from eBay. This year, in the second quarter, we grew revenue 19%, and that number included 800 or 8 percentage points of headwind related to eBay's business. And so that really underscores the strength of the franchise and how well we're performing right now.
And quite frankly, it's something that we're very excited about because this sets us up for, I think, much cleaner performance going forward and an acceleration in some of our growth rates when eBay is a much slower growing and smaller part of our business going forward."

Obviously, they remain a very close strategic partner for us. We still have about 60% share of checkout on eBay and obviously, eBay merchants and consumers want and desire to use PayPal. If you think about -- just to give perspective, historic perspective, if you think about when we split from eBay 6 years ago, eBay's revenues as a percent of our total were 26% of our total revenues. And we believe that they're going to end this year around 3% or so and that their TPV is going to be under 3% as a percent of our overall volumes.
And so this is, as I mentioned before, it's a timing issue. And frankly, the sooner eBay transitions, the better it is for our future revenue growth. I'd also say just one other thing. We are making a lot of progress with a lot of other marketplaces coming out of the eBay restrictions, and we continue to see Alibaba continue to ramp. We're really pleased to watch the growth rates there. And we're making a lot of progress with a lot of other marketplaces that we'll talk about as we get along further in the year.
So this eBay transition is behind us at the end of this quarter. The headwinds dissipate, and we're glad to start to move forward. And as John said, we'll really be able to see the strength of the franchise start to shine as a result of that."

I think I'll start on this one, and then maybe John can kick in. So first of all, clearly, pretty much every merchant, whether it's small, mid-size or large, is envisioning a seamless omni-channel feature. And that's where physical and online kind of blur together that they now start to use that to digitally interact with their customers to basically tie in their loyalty programs, customize deals and offers to individual consumers. And that is moving well beyond just checkout.
Before, we were thinking QR codes and other forms of contactless payments were great because it was both fast and maybe more healthy in a pandemic environment, but all of our conversations have -- go beyond checkout. People are looking to drive loyalty. They're looking to drive rewards and coupons, more flexibility, how consumers like order, track, pay for their services, customized incentives. And so that's really the conversations that we're having, and that's why we're getting a ton of traction.
By the way, I do think that this seamless omni-channel efforts by us is key to us doing everyday usage. And if I look at not just multiple millions of consumers that are using our QR codes, but what's happening is they also are spending 19% more TPV on the PayPal platform. And that halo effect is a big deal as we look forward, especially as we look towards the super app, which maybe somebody will talk about later.
But the more and more of these services we put together, the more and more of that halo impact that occurs. And so we obviously are up to now 1.3 million merchants. Every 20 second, a merchant's signing up for more QR codes with us. We have a lot of momentum with large enterprises right now, but the conversations have moved to how do we fully integrate their loyalty programs into our app, how do we drive customized deals for them. And so those are taking a little longer to go live to site, but they're much more integrated than we've ever seen before.
And we're seeing with customers like CVS, once you start to integrate that together, once you start to get a habituation, we saw CVS transactions go up 151% on month-over-month. And so we're really beginning to see some traction in the marketplace around all of these things. Very excited about it. It's going to be a multiyear journey for us, but we know that both merchants and customers expect us to be fully omni.
Yes. By the way, James, one other thing. You talked about Fiserv Clover. I forgot about that. So that is rolling out this quarter. We are a default funding instrument on Clover. It's a very close partnership that we have with Fiserv and looking forward to reporting more on that as the quarters go on."

We always knew that second quarter was going to be the low point of the year because we did '21 like 0.3 million or 0.4 million NNAs a year ago. And even though they're performing better than cohorts that we",597,"Yes, sure. I'll start right with that quickly. We always knew that second quarter was going to be the low point of the year because we did '21 like 0.3 million or 0.4 million NNAs a year ago. And even though they're performing better than cohorts that we previously had historically, their churn is lower, it's still a ton of incremental churn versus traditional cohorts on the second quarter.
And we're clearly beginning to see that dissipate already this year as I look at NNAs coming in, and so I feel really good about that guidance right now. Q4 is always our high point of the year, and so you'll see it start to build from second quarter up into third quarter and then up again into fourth quarter.
And then maybe if I can just -- if that answers your question on NNA, I'll go quickly into the super app. We made a really substantial milestone by being code complete on this first iteration of the super app. We're slowly ramping. This is the first change we've done to the app since I've been here, that we've done to the app. And so we want to kind of measure what the engagement levels are and the uptake of it. 
But this is going to be something where -- this isn't a Big Bang theory that this app in and of itself, this version is the be-all and end-all. It, obviously, is going to look across payments, basic financial services and shopping tools. You're going to see releases and enhanced functionality come out pretty much every single quarter; but early on, that's going to include things like high-yield savings, enhanced bill pay, which will do improved search and a better UX, more billers, aggregators. We're going to do 2-day early access to direct deposit, budgeting tools, something we haven't talked about, 2-way messaging.
So if I P2P you $10 for whatever you're doing and you want to message me right back without sending me a P2P, you can go do that. And we think that's going to drive a lot of engagement on the platform. You don't have to leave the platform to message back and forth.
Obviously, the UX is being redesigned. We've got rewards and shopping. We've got a whole giving hub around crowdsourcing, giving to charities. And then obviously Buy Now, Pay Later will be fully integrated into it.
And by the way, as we go into next year, we got all -- the last time I counted, it was like 25 new capabilities that we were going to put into the super app. And so I don't want to dismiss at all what we've done right now, but it just continues to improve going forward. 
And the way that I'm looking at success with the super app is what kind of engagement levels do we get. I fully expect engagement to move up. What's happening to our average revenue per active account? By the way, even with the new services we've recently launched, our average revenue per active account ex eBay went up 13% this past quarter, and that's a really good sign, along with the 11% improvement in TPA, which was really a record in the last 4 years or so.
And so we've got a lot going on, I think, engagement, average revenue per active user, and then we'll look clearly at all the halo effect as well. But we're excited to be on the journey right now and be underway. And again, you'll just see it continue to improve quarter-over-quarter."

As I mentioned, we did $1.5 billion of TPV in the quarter alone. That's not a $3.5 billion, but this is the amazing piece of stat on that $1.5 billion. That's up 50% from Q1 sequentially, so you can really see that even if we had so much momentum in Q1, that momentum really accelerated in Q2.
We've got a bunch more merchants using it now, 650,000 merchants. More and more of them are presenting it upstream on their product pages. That obviously gives us a disproportionate share of checkout when that occurs. And you could tell by the 7 million customers doing 20 million-plus transactions that, obviously, our repeat rates are extremely high.
There's a lot of satisfaction with the product. It's still something like 70% are repeating within 6 months. And our halo effect is the same as it was last quarter, still a 15% halo effect in TPV, still a substantial reduction in our TE costs, about a 16% reduction. We're still seeing 80% plus of these funded through debit. And Australia, we put in place just a couple of weeks ago, and bam, it's off to a really strong start right away.
So -- and part of the reason that we're getting such strong results is because we have 400 million customers. And when we put something in, it happens at scale. And we know those customers, so the approval rates are much higher. Returns are lower because we know the customer. And so a lot of the other Buy Now, Pay Later players don't necessarily know the consumer the way that we know the consumer in this.
And so we're pretty pleased. We've got a ton on our road map ahead in terms of expanding internationally, the more and more functionality that we want to put on the product itself."

And so in the context of our $25-plus billion revenue base, I would say that for the year these are relatively immaterial on our results. But I think very importantly, this provides a lot more transparency and clarity to our customer base around how we're pricing and really trying to price to the value that we provide for these customers.
And we've demonstrated time and again where that value comes from and just survey data on customers' willingness to buy when PayPal is presented at checkout that is exponentially greater than when it's not. So this is probably overdue. It's been the first time in 20 years that we've made a change to our base pricing like this. But certainly, I think it puts us more in line with the market and really prices to the value that we're creating for our customer base."

I mean we obviously carefully review every one of our pricing changes up or down. We do extensive market research before we do any change. And as John said, we look at where we add value and we price in accordance with that.
Clearly, on the branded side, we think we add a tremendous amount of value, things that John talked about, buyer and seller protection, Buy Now, Pay Later at no incremental cost, fraud protection, highest checkout conversion, et cetera. But we took down rates for basic full-stack processing. That also was reduced somewhat substantially from the 2.9%, plus $0.30 to 2.59%, plus $0.49. And that is going to enable us to aggressively compete for all of the payment processing of the merchants that do business with us.
And you've heard us say time and time again, David, that we were going to move into the in-store space. We're going to move so aggressively in there. We rolled out Zettle in the U.S., is a really beautiful full package. It doesn't just include card reader but inventory management, sales reads out and allows a merchant to seamlessly load inventory in both their online and in-store locations and then across multiple channels as well.
And so we're obviously going to be very aggressive on moving into in-store, and it's always been part of our strategy. And by the way, if a small merchant does all of their business with us, they can actually see their overall costs come down. And we want to encourage them to do all of their business with us because we are a trusted platform. They do turn to us, and we price, we think, the right way. We finally have unbundled some of this branded and unbranded because that's how the market is playing. And we know where we want to be aggressive, and we're going after that."

Well, we continue to be really pleased with the momentum we're seeing on crypto. And we're obviously adding incremental functionality into that whether -- you probably saw increased limits to $100,000 a week. We're right in the middle of some open banking integration, which will increase the ability to fully integrate it into ACH and do faster payments.
We're going to launch, hopefully, maybe even next month in the U.K., open up trading there. We're working right now on transfers to third-party wallets, and we really want to make sure that we create a very seamless process for taxes and tax reporting. And so we're really looking at how do we integrate that into both the trading and the buy with crypto on our platform.
But I will say this, like all of that is interesting, but it isn't the main course in terms of what we are trying to do with our blockchain and digital currency business unit. We are clearly thinking about what the next generation of the financial system looks like, how we can help shape that. We are working with regulatory agencies, central banks across the world, the number of countries that are looking at CBDCs. Central-bank-issued digital currencies is increasing rapidly. You're like at 40 countries like 6 months, a year ago. You're almost up to 100 countries looking at it right now.
And clearly, there is an opportunity to think about a new infrastructure that can more efficiently read that to be a lower cost, do transactions and also getting money to people much faster than happens today. I mean the other day, I sent an EFT from 1 bank to another bank, and that bank told me we're taking 3 days to access that money on the EFT I sent. That's crazy. It needs to be instantaneous. And there's a lot of desire by governments to really think how can you create a more efficient system using new technology to bring in more citizens, more underbanked, underserved citizens into the financial system because they disproportionately pay a higher take rate than those who are fully banked or higher income levels.
And there's a lot of connections between digital wallets And central-bank-issued digital currencies. Imagine not having to send out stimulus checks but sending those directly into a digital wallet where you instantaneously receive it, and you don't have to go and -- to a check cash-in location and exchange that and get charged for that exchange. There's just so many benefits to that as well as just plain utility to payments. How can we use smart contracts more efficiently? How can we digitize assets and open those up to consumers that may not have had access to that before? There are some interesting DFI applications as well.
And so we are working really hard. And by the way, as you probably have seen, we are trying to pick off the very best talent in the ecosystem to come work here at PayPal. We have a list of names and phone numbers, and we are slowly but surely building a team that I think is going to really shape the thought process around this. And I'm really pleased with at least the early returns on that. Hopefully, that helps you."

But the second area, and this sort of gets into the second part of your question as well, but we're also investing aggressively in our business. I would argue that there's never been a more important time in our business to invest right now, to invest for a future where we believe in the primacy of digital wallets. We believe in the permanent pull forward of e-commerce. We believe in the ubiquity of digital payments and to -- we want to help shape that outcome. We want to be a leader in that space.
Now it happens that the structural nature of our business, our margins want to go up. And by the way, they will to be very clear about that. But at the same time, we don't want to be a prisoner to expanding operating margin 1 quarter to the next because we want to be able to appropriately invest in our business to create the most shareholder value that we can over the long term and become the company that we all believe that we can be.
And so close out, our margins will go up. We said this year that we expect to have a flat to maybe some marginal improvement in our margins. But as we noted at our Investor Day earlier this year, our margins will go up over time, but we want to invest for growth and invest to be that leading digital company -- payments company that we know we can be."

Well, the big news today is that for the first time, we are teaming up with Amazon to enable customers in the U.S. to pay with Venmo at checkout. Starting next year, customers will be able to make purchases on amazon.com and the Amazon Mobile Shopping app using their Venmo accounts. This is obviously a very significant moment in our Venmo monetization efforts and marks the beginning of an exciting journey with Amazon. Now that we are no longer constrained by the contractual obligations of the eBay operating agreement. 
The increasing scale and brand trust associated with our 2-sided platform continues to set us apart from the rest of the market and enables us to expand our footprint with existing merchants and attract new partners. 
And now to our results. Our overall Q3 results were generally in line with our expectations. Our total payment volume grew 26% on a spot basis to $310 billion. This comes even as eBay's TPV declined by 45% in the quarter and is now approximately 3% of our overall TPV. Excluding eBay, our volumes grew by 31% on a spot basis with an annualized run rate of $1.2 trillion. Our active accounts were up 15% year-over-year, reaching 416 million. We added 13.3 million net new active accounts in the quarter including another 1.2 million merchant accounts, bringing our total merchant count to 33 million, and we remain on track to deliver more than 52 million NNAs for the year. 
Importantly, our diverse suite of products and services drove double-digit growth in our transactions per active account, up 10% to 44.2x. Revenues in the quarter grew to $6.182 billion, growing 13% on a spot basis. This was slightly below our expectations as back-to-school sales and travel were weaker than we expected. But even so, excluding eBay, our revenues grew by 25% in Q3. eBay now represents less than 4% of our total revenues. And we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.11 even as we continue to invest heavily in our growth initiatives. 
Our platform continues to drive substantial value for our merchants. PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet with more than 75% of the top 1,500 largest global merchants utilizing PayPal at checkout. And on average, our PayPal checkout conversion is 34% higher than other checkout options. 
In addition to our Amazon news, we are very pleased to say that Walmart now presents PayPal as a checkout option for both their grocery and marketplace business, and GoFundMe me added PayPal to their checkout flow with Venmo to follow in the coming months. Valero and Phillips 66 are adding our QR codes to their thousands of gas stations across the U.S. and United Airlines recently launched PayPal QR payments in-flight. As Checkout evolves from pay now to pay on your own terms, we've seen rapid adoption of our buy now, pay later capabilities in the U.S., Germany France, U.K. and Australia. 
In Q4, we will expand Buy Now, Pay Later to Italy and Spain. Also in this quarter, we eliminated consumer late fees to ensure we deliver the very best value proposition to our consumers while delivering on our mission to build an inclusive digital economy. Since our Buy Now, Pay Later launch, we have processed approximately $5.4 billion in TPV with more than $2 billion of that TPV in Q3 alone. Approximately 950,000 merchants have customers who use our Buy Now, Pay Later capabilities and more than 65,000 have positioned, by now, pay later upstream on their product pages. And over 9.5 million consumers have transacted more than 33 million times with our Buy Now, Pay Later products. We will expand our global pay later portfolio in the first half of 2022 to include longer-term installment plans, allowing consumers to spread higher price purchases over longer periods of time. This is already available in Germany, where we are seeing great initial success. 
We completed our acquisition of Paidy, a fast-growing 2-sided payments platform and provider of buy now, pay later solutions in Japan. This will accelerate our momentum in Japan, a strategically important market and one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world. We are seeing very positive trends on our new PayPal app, which has now ramped to 100% globally. Consumers are engaging with the app and discovering the breadth of our new value proposition. 
Although it's still early, initial results show that the new app has driven a 25x lift in consumers exploring our deals and offer staff, a 15% increase in first-time users transacting with crypto, and it has also driven a 35% lift in our cash card enrollments. And the average revenue per account from digital wallet users is twice that of checkout-only users. We expect to launch more features next year, including equity investing capabilities. 
It's quite exciting to see the initial positive reaction to our app, and we will continue to refine and expand its functionality to help consumers navigate an increasingly digital and connected lifestyle. Venmo continues to achieve milestones and break records and is on track to deliver $900 million in revenue this year, with more than 80 million customers and $240 billion in run rate TPV, Venmo's scale is on par with PayPal's entire U.S. franchise in 2016. Then most customers are adopting more and more products, and we are seeing accelerating momentum with our new product introductions. 
Even with all these growth and these impressive accomplishments, we are just at the start of Venmo's commerce journey, and we could not be more pleased about joining forces with Amazon. We expect Venmo to be transaction margin positive this year, while still growing its P2P business at very healthy rates. 
The back half of 2021 was always going to be the low point of our revenue growth this year, and we are appropriately cautious as we enter Q4 and as we think about 2022. We are seeing the impact of global supply chain shortages in our merchant base. Consumer confidence has weakened with the absence of stimulus payments. And with the economy reopening, more people may be likely to do their holiday shopping in-store as confidence in delivery logistics is depressed from last year. And of course, we still feel the impacts of eBay's managed payments migration over the next few quarters, although at a lessening rate. Almost all of these issues are temporal. And consequently, we expect our revenues will accelerate throughout next year, and we remain confident in our medium-term guidance. 
I'd like to spend a few moments on the recent rumors that made their way through the news. We participate in a rapidly moving industry. It's quite clear that consumers and merchants prefer a more connected digital lifestyle that encompasses financial services, shopping, payments and commerce. Our market research and that of others strongly supports the vision of a more connected economy. And PayPal clearly has the brand trust, regulatory relationships and scale to be a meaningful leader in the digital economy. Exploring all potential opportunities to enhance shareholder value is our responsibility. But obviously, only a select few deals will meet our very strict financial, strategic and capital allocation criteria. We are fortunate to be a market leader in an environment with so many potential opportunities and operate in an industry with a number of favorable tailwinds. We -- We will continue to execute against our game plan and responsibly explore the options in our rapidly evolving ecosystem, so that we remain the leader we are today in tomorrow's world. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to John."

I'd like to start by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver a solid quarter. We're now reporting our results for the seventh quarter since the pandemic began, and it's remarkable to take a step back and reflect on everything that we've accomplished during this dynamic and unprecedented time. There's been a profound and enduring shift in global commerce and consumer behavior, which has significantly expanded our addressable opportunity. The powerful and accelerating secular tailwinds of increasing e-commerce penetration and cash displacement have helped to advance our leadership position in payments. To give you a better sense of the scale of growth we've experienced, it took 20 years for PayPal to reach $600 billion in annual payment volume, which occurred in 2019. Only 2 years later, we crossed $1.2 trillion. Relative to 2019, we've seen significant growth across our key performance indicators, including active accounts, engagement, TPV, revenue, EPS and free cash flow. At the same time, we're operating in a complex environment. The macroeconomic landscape is currently characterized by varying rates of reopening activity globally and influenced by short-term supply chain challenges, inflationary pressures and concerns related to consumer sentiment. These factors contribute to a backdrop that continues to make forecasting more challenging. 
Our third quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our diversified platform, our global reach and the scalability of our business. Notably, we delivered these results against tough year-over-year comparisons. And in the quarter, where we face the most acute pressure from eBay's payments transition. 
For the quarter, we're reporting revenue of $6.2 billion, representing growth of 13% on both a spot and currency-neutral basis. eBay Marketplaces revenue declined 67% to $235 million and contributed less than 4% of total revenue versus approximately 13% last year. Excluding eBay, revenue grew 25% year-over-year and 26% on average for the last 2 years. This 2-year compound annual growth rate is particularly notable. Throughout 2021, this growth rate has been consistently strong at 25% and 26% in the first and second quarters, respectively. 
I would also like to provide some context for our performance relative to our expectations when we provided third quarter guidance in late July. First, travel volumes strengthened in June and July. This trend then reversed in August and September due to concerns related to the Delta variant. Second, back-to-school spending was somewhat softer than we had expected. While our overall performance was well within our guidance, we saw moderation towards the tail end of the quarter and exited at a lower growth rate than we had predicted. 
In third quarter, transaction revenue grew 10% to $5.6 billion. This growth rate reflects the steep decline in eBay revenue in the quarter. Excluding eBay, transaction revenue grew 23%. Other value-added services revenue grew 50% to $575 million. This performance was driven by increased revenue from Synchrony and accelerated recognition of loan servicing fees from the PPP program. 
In the third quarter, total take rate was 1.99%, consistent with the second quarter and a decline of 22 basis points from last year. The mix effect of eBay contributed to approximately 55% of this decline. The blended take rate on eBay volumes this quarter was 2.43% compared to 4% in Q3 last year. The remainder of the decline was primarily driven by reduced currency volatility in the quarter, which resulted in a lower growth rate in foreign exchange fees as well as merchant mix and growth in bill payment volumes. The 25 basis point decline in transaction take rate was driven by these same factors. 
The third quarter was another strong quarter for volume-based expense performance. Transaction expense as a rate of TPV was 83 basis points, an increase of 1 basis point versus last year. Transaction losses improved 4 basis points and represented 9 basis points as a rate of TPV. This level of loss performance is consistent with last quarter, matching the lowest transaction loss rate in our history. 
In the quarter, loan origination activity increased and we ended Q3 with $3.7 billion in net receivables, representing sequential growth of 13% and 43% growth relative to last year. Growth in our short-term installment pay portfolio was the primary driver of this increase. Strong performance of our loan portfolio, more stability in macroeconomic trends and the mix of shorter duration originations from our installment pay products resulted in our reserve coverage ratio declining to 11.6% from 14.9% at the end of the second quarter. 
The net effect of credit provisioning on credit losses in the quarter, inclusive of originations and reserve releases resulted in a benefit of $25 million. And year-to-date, we released $300 million in reserves. Overall, volume-based expenses grew 20% and represented 46% of revenue, resulting in a transaction margin of 54.2%. 
I'd now like to cover our nontransaction-related operating expenses. These expenses increased 17%, representing 30% of revenue. In the third quarter, our rapid pace of innovation continued. We had an exciting cadence of product introductions, including our new digital wallet apps for both PayPal and Venmo, the launch of crypto by wholesale in the U.K., our goods and services P2P experience in Venmo and cash back to crypto with the Venmo credit card. 
To support and advance our key initiatives we continue to invest aggressively in technology and development and sales and marketing, including increased spending on customer acquisition and engagement strategies. These expense buckets drove 70% of the increase in nontransaction-related operating expenses. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was essentially flat to last year and our operating margin was 23.8%. And on a 2-year basis, the compound annual growth rate for operating income was 20%. 
For the quarter, non-GAAP EPS grew 4% to $1.11. This includes an approximate $0.29 per share headwind from the decline in eBay Marketplaces' transaction margin dollars. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $20 billion. In addition, free cash flow grew 20% to $1.3 billion, representing 21% of revenue. 
I'd now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2021 as well as our preliminary thoughts for 2022. For 2021, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $25.3 billion to $25.4 billion, an increase of approximately 18% from last year. This represents a 2-year compound annual growth rate of 19%. And excluding eBay, we now expect 2021 revenue to grow 28%. We expect our operating margin to be in line to last year, which was the highest in our history. This performance reflects our strategic investment spend throughout the year as well as the negative transaction margin dynamics resulting from eBay, offset by the benefit from the release of reserves. We now expect non-GAAP EPS for the year to be approximately $4.60, a 19% increase on top of the 31% growth last year. And on a 2-year basis, this is 25% growth. In addition, we expect to generate approximately $5.2 billion in free cash flow, representing $0.21 of free cash flow for every $1 of revenue we earn. As a result of this update to our full year guidance, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $6.85 billion to $6.95 billion. This represents approximately 13% growth at the midpoint. We also expect $1.12 in non-GAAP EPS, representing 4% growth. While the impact from eBay's payments migration came in consistent with our expectations for the quarter, Relative to the beginning of the year, the headwind increased significantly. Until recently, we believe we could absorb this additional pressure and still deliver on our prior guidance. And while we came within our revenue expectations for the third quarter, the contributors to our revenue growth were somewhat different than what we had expected going into the quarter. 
Toward the end of the quarter, we also began to see growth rates come in a little lower than planned. We're off to a solid start in the fourth quarter, but growth rates still remain slightly below our prior expectations. In addition, retail supply chain and labor market concerns, which may impact the important holiday season, have led us to adopt a more cautious stance for the fourth quarter. That said, in recent days, we've seen improvement. 
At this point in time, it's difficult to say definitively whether these stronger turns will persist throughout the quarter or if this improvement is a pull forward of consumer holiday activity. Relative to the guidance provided at the start of 2021, we now expect revenue to be about 0.5% lower for the year, despite much more pressure from eBay than we had initially expected. Adjusting for the additional pressure to revenue growth from eBay, our revised 2021 guidance is actually ahead of the outlook we provided at the start of the year. 
In providing quarterly and annual guidance since July of last year, our goal has been to responsibly balance transparency with reliability and certainty. At the same time, we've also tried to emphasize the complexity of forecasting in this environment. We are taking what we view to be a prudent step in adjusting our outlook. But let me be very clear. Our key strategic initiatives are on track and performing very well. The initial response to our new digital wallet experiences has been very strong, and the implementation of our new headline pricing in the U.S. has been successful with no discernible impact to merchant activity. 
The underlying strength, diversification and resilience of our business on an absolute level and relative to prepandemic are unassailable and position us to remain on offense regardless of short-term headwinds. Our ability to sustainably deliver strong growth at our scale is indicative of the network effects of our business and our competitive positioning as a global leader in digital payments at the intersection of the powerful secular tailwinds of e-commerce penetration and cash displacement has never been stronger. 
As it relates to our expectations for 2022, we'd like to share some of our initial thoughts and the assumptions we're making for internal planning purposes. We are currently in the midst of our budget resource and investment planning process for next year. In addition, how we exit the year as well as the status of some of the exogenous factors that Dan and I have already discussed, are also important inputs for the year ahead. 
On a preliminary basis, for 2022, we expect revenue growth in the high teens. If we had to put a point on it today, we'd likely anchor it at about 18%. It's also important to appreciate our expected trajectory of revenue growth. Due to the cadence of eBay's Payments migration, as well as the stimulus measures earlier this year, we expect the first quarter next year to have more difficult comps and be our lowest growth quarter. 
Our plans are for revenue growth to then accelerate through the year, and to exit 2022 at a revenue growth rate in line with or ahead of our medium-term guidance. Similar to 2021, we expect that our growth rates will exceed industry growth rates by a healthy margin. Given the ongoing planning that we're still doing, we will guide EPS growth when we report Q4 results early next year. 
That said, I'd like to provide some color on how we're thinking about it. We see significant investment opportunities across our key priorities. In the past 2 years, we've accelerated our pace of product innovation to better serve our growing network of more than 400 million consumer and merchant accounts. We are investing to advance our product road map, increase our relevance for customers and drive daily engagement. And to support these initiatives, we expect our non-transaction-related expenses to grow in the high single digits in 2022 on a base that will grow 20% this year. 
It's also important to note 2 factors that will have an impact on our EPS growth next year. First, we will lap the benefit we realized from the release of the credit reserve this year. And second, we expect our effective tax rate to increase from the lapping of onetime favorable tax adjustments. We expect these 2 items to result in an approximate 10-point headwind to non-GAAP earnings growth in 2022. That said, we remain very confident in the medium-term guidance we provided at our Investor Day earlier this year. We're witnessing the pull forward of e-commerce and displacement of cash continuing at an undiminished pace even as reopening the curves. It's also true that the most difficult year in the transition away from eBay will be largely behind us as we move into 2022, and we expect our revenue and TPV growth rates to accelerate. We believe that investing in our business is more important than ever before given the opportunities we see in front of us.  And while we certainly expect our margins to increase over the long term, we don't want to be so overly focused on that from 1 quarter or 1 year to the next, then we don't invest appropriately. 
We are playing in this space to win. We are well positioned to capture the immense opportunity ahead and see a clear path to achieving our financial and strategic objectives. Our powerful 2-sided platform focused on execution and mission-driven culture backed by the tailwinds of digital commerce set us up for success now and in the years to come. Before I turn it back over to the operator for Q&A, I would like to spend a moment discussing our approach to capital allocation. Our business is characterized by its very powerful cash flow generation. 
Since separation, we generated approximately $22 billion in free cash flow. We've returned nearly $10.5 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and allocated approximately $13 billion in cash to acquisitions and investments. We remain committed to both disciplined capital allocation and to balancing organic and inorganic growth investing to drive shareholder value creation. 
Inorganic opportunities are accelerating through our growth plans and to achieving our long-term aspirations. It's important to note that our medium-term outlook does not rely on acquisitions. At the same time, we will continue to be opportunistic in executing our strategic priorities, shaping the future of payments and advancing our leadership position. 
With that, I will turn it back to the operator. Operator, please go ahead."

Let me just take 1 step back, and start a little bit with the big picture because that may help put everything into context. Look, we're obviously focused on becoming an essential everyday app for consumers. And that's on the consumer side. And on the merchant side, we want to provide a comprehensive platform for merchants to participate in the digital economy. And that includes everything from consumers engaging at the beginning of their shopping journey to purchase and post purchase. And if you look at all of the acquisitions that we've done, over the past 5 years, they kind of play into that overall strategy, whether it be what we've done internally with the PayPal app or QR codes, acquisitions like Honey, which have been essential to our shopping deals cab fully integrated now into the PayPal app, happy returns, charge down their part of our post purchase process that will integrate into our app and put into our platform for merchants: iZettle, Hyperwallet, now is our payouts product going forward. So I'm very pleased with all the acquisitions we've done. They fit into our strategy. 
They are executing many of them well above what we initially thought. Some were delayed in terms of their integration for various reasons. But overall, really I'm pleased with the way our acquisition and acquisition strategy has gone and the integration into our strategy. 
The truth is we review hundreds of potential acquisitions every single year. And we put every single one of them through a very strict set of strategic financial integration filters. And we look at like, are we going to buy, build or partner? And John and I have been here now for -- well, I've been here a little over 7 years -- has been here closing in on that. And we've never done a large acquisition so far. And the reason for that -- and by the way, we look at a couple of those every year. There are very few that we look at, but we look at a couple every year, and they have a much higher hurdle rate than our smaller acquisitions. I mean we want to look, is it going to be a distraction? How tough is the integration? We fully understand what it means to do a large acquisition versus a smaller acquisition. And in 7 years, we haven't done a single large acquisition because they haven't met any of our hurdles. So I'm not saying that we might never ever do that, but it's not a likely event as we look forward. 
In our M&A philosophy, it remains the same. We're going to focus on high-quality assets that will accelerate our growth in areas that are more efficient than us doing it inorganically. And to your question specifically, we don't need to do something large to -- or small, frankly, to deliver on our medium-term guidance. All of our acquisitions are supplemental to our medium-term guidance. And clearly, we are going to be acquisitive going forward. 
I mean we've got an incredibly strong balance sheet, $20 billion of cash and cash-like investments on it. We're generating between $5 billion and $6 billion a year of free cash flow. But we are going to maintain the same strict and disciplined manner that we look at acquisitions and have looked at acquisitions over the last couple of years. John, anything that you..."

First of all, I'd say one of the things we talked about early on is being free of the restrictions of the eBay operating agreement. We're going to have the possibility to open us up to working with a number of marketplaces that we were previously prohibited from doing so. And you're seeing some of that, you're seeing what we're doing with Ali and Ali Express that continues to expand in terms of the volumes there. We are getting closer and closer with Walmart. And Amazon is the latest example of us being able to team up with obviously an extremely significant player in the e-commerce space. 
And what I really like about this is like eBay results are like a pig through the python right now. But these that we're talking about, right, are much more of a permanent nature. These are what will be with us going forward as eBay kind of is a temporal phenomenon working through our results. We're still working through the launch time frames. We're both eager to get this out into the marketplace, but we're still working those to. We obviously have large teams, each of us on this. 
It is the beginning of a journey of our 2 companies teaming together. I wouldn't venture at this moment as to where we'll go together. We're both very focused on the substantial opportunity that there is with Venmo at checkout. And we couldn't be more pleased to be able to team with Amazon on this. 
Obviously, if you think about the amount of market share that Amazon has in the U.S., this quite substantially is -- increases the addressable market for Pay with Venmo. And Pay with Venmo is one of the key revenue drivers for Venmo going forward. I just -- as I think about the journey that Venmo has been on, this obviously is a punctuation point for sure. But even this year, Venmo will be transaction margin positive. That is a major milestone for that team, right on track to deliver the $900 million and obviously exit the year at an accelerating growth rate. And this partnership with Amazon will no doubt take that to the next level."

So any time you put something substantial out into the market, and this is really the first giant revamp that we've done of our PayPal consumer app. And it's pretty massive, complete redesign. Typically on that, so what you find is you've got declines in engagement as people kind of like work their way through discovery of it. And then what you have is over time that, that really starts to accelerate at least that's your hope shot. This has been completely the opposite of that, which is, I guess, biggest delay, I'm not sure it's a surprise to me, but we are seeing really meaningful lifts in terms of discoverability of the breadth of our product and service line right now. We talked about PayPal shopping, the full integration of Honey into the PayPal app. Honey now is completely mobile and not just desktop and that's powering our whole tab of that. We've seen a 25x lift in people exploring that tab and starting to put deals into their wallets and that kind of thing. It's pretty amazing actually. 
And then on things like crypto, first-time user, once we did the app, went up by 15%. Our strongest week ever for first-time users was like last week. And we've had strong weeks for first-time user growth on that. But clearly, the new app is driving both discoverability and conversion on the crypto side. And then I'm quite excited about what's happening with cash card because cash card is kind of like a debit card, right? It links into the balance, and it can be used offline and obviously online. And this is a big part of our omni-strategic thrust and to see that go up, those enrollments go up by 35%. And remember, this is really early days, right? We fully ramped in the middle of October globally. So this is early on. And I usually think of early on as, okay, how do we start to claw back to where we were and then start to move forward as customers get it? This was a leap forward. 
Look, there are a lot of things that we're going to do to improve the customer experience. We are putting FIS now into our bill payment, expanding our bill payment quite dramatically, expanding the usability and kind of just the simplicity of it. But each and every one of the products and services, we are looking at the feedback we're getting and just making small little changes to keep increasing. This is going to be -- I didn't think it was going to be a big bang. It actually has turned out to be a relatively big bang on introduction, but I really think of this as evolutionary quarter by quarter by quarter. We will launch high-yield savings in the next several months that will begin to ramp. We'll start to put on things like equity investing. We anticipate doing that next year. And there'll be more and more products and services to help customers engage more and more. And that's why like that ARPA of wallet users versus checkout-only again, early, but to see that already leaping up to 2x that of checkout-only. Sly, John and I are quite excited about the impact of the initiatives that we're putting into place. And they are clearly going to drive a lot of growth for us as we look forward."

So you're right, actually, if you look at Q3, and let me just talk about revenue, TPV and maybe engagement as 3 metrics",476,"Okay. David, let me talk very quickly about Q3. And then I'm going to have John talk about our Q4 guidance and our confidence in 2022. So you're right, actually, if you look at Q3, and let me just talk about revenue, TPV and maybe engagement as 3 metrics on that. Look, on -- the way that I think about our business right now is what's happening on our MS business because eBay is a temporal thing. It's just going through the system right now. It's less than 3% of our TPV, it's less than 4% of our revenues and drop. And so really, our business is our MS business going forward. And if I look at revenue growth. I think this is really interesting because I've examined this quite carefully. If I go back 5 years, if you look at our MS revenue growth, in Q3 of 2017, it was 24%; in 2018, in Q3, it was 17%; 2019, it was 23%, then it jumps up to 26%. And in the middle of the pandemic, Q3 2020 and Q3 2021, this quarter, it's 25%. And so like people talk about like reopening stocks and all like that isn't us. 
Our MS business is going from strength to strength. We've seen a leap forward in digital, and that is continuing, if you look at it in our MS. And John, I'll talk about it in Q4 and as we look next year. Same thing on TPV. TPV in Q3 of 2018, MS, now I'm talking about MS was 27%. It jumped up to 29%. Then in Q3 2020 jumped to 40%. And over that 40%, we're growing this quarter at 31%. And so like these are all really, really strong numbers. And if I look at -- even like transactions, which I think is a really, really interesting, we did 4.9 billion transactions in Q3, this last quarter. If you go back a year ago, we did about 4 billion. We're almost up 1 billion transactions in a year in the quarter, and our transactions ex-eBay are up 31% year-over-year. Our TPA transactions for active double-digit growth for the second quarter in a row. Again, ex eBay in the third quarter, our TPA was up 18%. And so these are -- yes, of course, we get hit by some of these exogenous things that go on. But if I look at the strength of the core business, every single metric is way above even our forecast is way above our medium-term guidance. And that's kind of like what gives us just a ton of confidence. And we're obviously being, I think, appropriately cautious and conservative as we look forward at this time. But I feel like if I look at what the real part of our business is, every metric is trending pretty strongly right now."
112732,1685318483,2430104,"PayPal Holdings, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2021",2021-11-08,"Earnings Calls","PayPal Holdings, Inc.","Executives","David, let me hit a couple of points here regarding some of the assumptions about our outlook. So first, with respect to the reopening of the economy, our basic assumption is that, that's sort of a slow and steady pace similar to what we've seen here more",331,"David, let me hit a couple of points here regarding some of the assumptions about our outlook. So first, with respect to the reopening of the economy, our basic assumption is that, that's sort of a slow and steady pace similar to what we've seen here more recently. 
With respect to supply chain or labor shortages, look, I don't see a quick fix to that, so that could be with us for some period of time. And I think the pressure there is probably more acute on some of the SMB segment versus large enterprises. And so that is baked into our assumptions as well. We're also not going to have the benefit of stimulus next year or likely not based upon what we see today. 
And then the last point I'd make is around eBay. eBay, if you think about the high teens mark that we put out there for revenue growth, the impact of eBay year-over-year in terms of a headwind is about 200 basis points. If you just take what eBay represents in our business in 2021 compared to 2022. Said differently, though, if you were to exclude eBay in both years, the revenue growth is 22%. And so that's exceedingly strong. And I think the best proxy for how to think about our business going forward. 
And so wrapping all of that together and sort of tying it to where we stand right now with the guidance that we just gave today, if you go back to the beginning of the year and the guidance that we provided, 50 million net new actives, roughly $25.5 billion of revenue, we're effectively right there. And I think very, very importantly, that was the basis for the 5-year plan, the medium-term guidance that we laid out just a few weeks after that. And so that's a way of saying that we are right on track with what we laid out at the beginning of the year with our medium-term guidance."

So 13.3 million in the quarter, up about 2 million from last quarter, growing 15% year-over-year, unlike a lot of companies that experienced growth in the Optime and then are unwinding. Our growth remains incredibly strong on the M&A side. I mean think about it in the minute that we've been talking so far, Darren, we've got -- we put on about 100 consumers and 9 new merchants. We are putting on 1.5 consumers every second of the quarter, every 6 seconds we put on another merchant. It's really unbelievable. And if I look 5 years ago, and you remember this, 5 years ago, we put on 13 million net new actives for the year. This quarter alone, and we put on 110 million net new actives since January of 2020. And as we said, I think, in our press release, we expect to end the year north of 430 million actives on the platform. So obviously, continued strong growth. But as we look forward to that $750 million, Darren, there are 2 places that are net new actives come from. One is top of the funnel. And top of the funnel is actually pretty strong right now and remain so. It's a kind of a Mussat platform for merchants and consumers and scale begets scale in this business. But as you get bigger and bigger. The bottom of the funnel becomes equally -- it's not even more important. And so reduction in churn becomes a really important element of our ability to get to the 750 million. That's why we're so excited about what we're seeing in terms of our TPA numbers, again, normalize it ex eBay, up 18%. Last quarter, I think it was up 17%, double-digit growth even with eBay and at 2 quarters in a row, some of the things I was talking to Lisa about in terms of the engagement on the app. Those are things that the more people engaged, the more people get cash cards utilizing that service offline. We see halo effects inside the business. Buy Now, Pay Later, all of that actually affects churn rate. And if we can keep a consistent top of the funnel, maybe even improve that a little bit, but reduce our churn rate, you'll start to see net new actives actually accelerate going forward. And so we remain still quite confident in the 750 million, but that's what the drivers are of that, Darren."

Well, I'll start by saying that, and I would hope that people appreciate and agree with this, but I don't think there's ever been a more important time to invest in our business than right now. This is a precious opportunity that we have with some of the secular tailwinds. We're fortunate in that the margins in our business want to go up. We've demonstrated that we can scale at a very low marginal cost. We've got tremendous opportunities, some of which we talked about today, that give us confidence that over our planning horizon, our margins will go up. That's not something that I think we lose a ton of sleep about. Quite frankly, I think it's -- the more challenging dynamic is where to invest, where we can get that return that's expected. 
And if you think about the last couple of years being 2020 and this year 2021, our operating expenses have grown about 20% in each of those years. And that's not -- I would discourage you from thinking about that as sort of like onetime spend related to customer acquisition or something like that. There's a lot of engineering costs around people that are punching a keyboard to write code, and that's still with us today. So even as we talk about the high single-digit growth next year, that's on top of 2 years of 20% growth. But for us, it's also important not to spread ourselves too thin and to make sure that we are prioritizing appropriately and some of prioritizing involves say no to certain things as well. 
And so I think we've laid out a pretty clear plan over the next few years with our focus on things like the digital wallet, building out commerce capabilities, continue to monetize Venmo that give us ample opportunity to invest. But as I noted in my remarks, we don't manage the business to have margin expansion for the next quarter or frankly, even for the next year. We're looking at how we create a company over the next 5 years that can have the same type of market value appreciation that we've experienced over the last 5. And the decisions that we make really just line up with that much more so than trying to maximize for any particular time period. And so maybe not directly answering your question, but our margins are going to go up over the long term, and we're not going to be handcuffed to doing that from 1 period to the next at the expense of like creating shareholder value."

And then we thought we'd be towards the higher end of the $52 million to $55. At this point, we're just being consistent with kind of our revenue guide as well. We're going into the heart of the holiday, you're exactly right. If holiday season shapes up like it did last year, then we'll have more than $52 million organic because there'll be a lot more shopping. And if it doesn't, then we'll have a little bit less. So it's very consistent with kind of just being, I think, prudent and cautious given some of the trends that we're seeing and others are talking about, again, supply chain shortages, people can't shop in it. If consumer confidence is down, people do more in-store, we'll get less M&A than we typically might. 
If holiday season goes as it did last year, we'll get more than we're talking about right now. So I just think it's just very consistent with the guide that we gave. And again, as John mentioned, we've had a good start to the quarter. We've had a pretty strong last week with 4Q and -- but we're early on right now. And so we don't like it when we are at the midpoint of our guidance, it is or any of that kind of thing. We are used to being a company that puts out things and then beats what it puts out.

Well, the big news today is that for the first time, we are teaming up with Amazon to enable customers in the U.S. to pay with Venmo at checkout. Starting next year, customers will be able to make purchases on amazon.com and the Amazon Mobile Shopping app using their Venmo accounts. This is obviously a very significant moment in our Venmo monetization efforts and marks the beginning of an exciting journey with Amazon now that we are no longer constrained by the contractual obligations of the eBay operating agreement. The increasing scale and brand trust associated with our 2-sided platform continues to set us apart from the rest of the market and enables us to expand our footprint with existing merchants and attract new partners. 
And now to our results. Our overall Q3 results were generally in line with our expectations. Our total payment volume grew 26% on a spot basis to $310 billion. This comes even as eBay's TPV declined by 45% in the quarter and is now approximately 3% of our overall TPV. Excluding eBay, our volumes grew by 31% on a spot basis with an annualized run rate of $1.2 trillion. 
Our active accounts were up 15% year-over-year, reaching 416 million. We added 13.3 million net new active accounts in the quarter, including another 1.2 million merchant accounts, bringing our total merchant count to 33 million. And we remain on track to deliver more than 52 million NNAs for the year. Importantly, our diverse suite of products and services drove double-digit growth in our transactions per active account, up 10% to 44.2x. 
Revenues in the quarter grew to $6.182 billion, growing 13% on a spot basis. This was slightly below our expectations as back-to-school sales and travel were weaker than we expected. But even so, excluding eBay, our revenues grew by 25% in Q3. eBay now represents less than 4% of our total revenues. And we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.11 even as we continue to invest heavily in our growth initiatives. 
Our platform continues to drive substantial value for our merchants. PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet with more than 75% of the top 1,500 largest global merchants utilizing PayPal at checkout. And on average, our PayPal checkout conversion is 34% higher than other checkout options. 
In addition to our Amazon news, we are very pleased to say that Walmart now presents PayPal as a checkout option for both their grocery and marketplace business, and GoFundMe me added PayPal to their checkout flow with Venmo to follow in the coming months. Valero and Phillips 66 are adding our QR codes to their thousands of gas stations across the U.S., and United Airlines recently launched PayPal QR payments in-flight. 
As checkout evolves from pay now to pay on your own terms, we've seen rapid adoption of our Buy Now, Pay Later capabilities in the U.S., Germany, France, U.K. and Australia. In Q4, we will expand Buy Now, Pay Later to Italy and Spain. Also in this quarter, we eliminated consumer late fees to ensure we deliver the very best value proposition to our consumers while delivering on our mission to build an inclusive digital economy. Since our Buy Now, Pay Later launch, we have processed approximately $5.4 billion in TPV, with more than $2 billion of that TPV in Q3 alone. Approximately 950,000 merchants have customers who use our Buy Now, Pay Later capabilities and more than 65,000 have positioned Buy Now, Pay Later upstream on their product pages. And over 9.5 million consumers have transacted more than 33 million times with our Buy Now, Pay Later products. We will expand our global Pay Later portfolio in the first half of 2022 to include longer-term installment plans, allowing consumers to spread higher-price purchases over longer periods of time. This is already available in Germany where we are seeing great initial success. 
We completed our acquisition of Paidy, a fast-growing 2-sided payments platform and provider of Buy Now, Pay Later solutions in Japan. This will accelerate our momentum in Japan, a strategically important market and one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world. 
We are seeing very positive trends on our new PayPal app, which has now ramped to 100% globally. Consumers are engaging with the app and discovering the breadth of our new value proposition. Although it's still early, initial results show that the new app has driven a 25x lift in consumers exploring our deals and offer stack, a 15% increase in first-time users transacting with crypto, and it has also driven a 35% lift in our cash card enrollments. And the average revenue per account from digital wallet users is twice that of checkout-only users. We expect to launch more features next year, including equity investing capabilities. It's quite exciting to see the initial positive reaction to our app, and we will continue to refine and expand its functionality to help consumers navigate an increasingly digital and connected lifestyle. 
Venmo continues to achieve milestones and break records and is on track to deliver $900 million in revenue this year. With more than 80 million customers and $240 billion in run rate TPV, Venmo's scale is on par with PayPal's entire U.S. franchise in 2016. Venmo's customers are adopting more and more products, and we are seeing accelerating momentum with our new product introductions. 
Even with all these growth and these impressive accomplishments, we are just at the start of Venmo's commerce journey and we could not be more pleased about joining forces with Amazon. We expect Venmo to be transaction margin-positive this year, while still growing its P2P business at very healthy rates. 
The back half of 2021 was always going to be the low point of our revenue growth this year, and we are appropriately cautious as we enter Q4 and as we think about 2022. We are seeing the impact of global supply chain shortages in our merchant base. Consumer confidence has weakened with the absence of stimulus payments. And with the economy reopening, more people may be likely to do their holiday shopping in-store as confidence in delivery logistics is depressed from last year. And of course, we still feel the impacts of eBay's managed payments migration over the next few quarters, although at a lessening rate. 
Almost all of these issues are temporal. And consequently, we expect our revenues will accelerate throughout next year and we remain confident in our medium-term guidance. 
I'd like to spend a few moments on the recent rumors that made their way through the news. We participate in a rapidly moving industry. It's quite clear that consumers and merchants prefer a more connected digital lifestyle that encompasses financial services, shopping, payments and commerce. Our market research and that of others strongly supports the vision of a more connected economy. And PayPal clearly has the brand trust, regulatory relationships and scale to be a meaningful leader in the digital economy. 
Exploring all potential opportunities to enhance shareholder value is our responsibility. But obviously, only a select few deals will meet our very strict financial, strategic and capital allocation criteria. We are fortunate to be a market leader in an environment with so many potential opportunities and operate in an industry with a number of favorable tailwinds. We will continue to execute against our game plan and responsibly explore the options in our rapidly evolving ecosystem so that we remain the leader we are today in tomorrow's world. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to John."

I'd like to start by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver a solid quarter.

I'd like to start by thanking our customers, partners and employees for helping us deliver a solid quarter. We're now reporting our results for the seventh quarter since the pandemic began, and it's remarkable to take a step back and reflect on everything that we've accomplished during this dynamic and unprecedented time. 
There's been a profound and enduring shift in global commerce and consumer behavior, which has significantly expanded our addressable opportunity. The powerful and accelerating secular tailwinds of increasing e-commerce penetration and cash displacement have helped to advance our leadership position in payments. 
To give you a better sense of the scale of growth we've experienced, it took 20 years for PayPal to reach $600 billion in annual payment volume, which occurred in 2019. Only 2 years later, we crossed $1.2 trillion. Relative to 2019, we've seen significant growth across our key performance indicators, including active accounts, engagement, TPV, revenue, EPS and free cash flow. 
At the same time, we're operating in a complex environment. The macroeconomic landscape is currently characterized by varying rates of reopening activity globally and influenced by short-term supply chain challenges, inflationary pressures and concerns related to consumer sentiment. These factors contribute to a backdrop that continues to make forecasting more challenging. 
Our third quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our diversified platform, our global reach and the scalability of our business. Notably, we delivered these results against tough year-over-year comparisons, and in the quarter, where we face the most acute pressure from eBay's payments transition. 
For the quarter, we're reporting revenue of $6.2 billion, representing growth of 13% on both a spot and currency-neutral basis. eBay Marketplaces revenue declined 67% to $235 million and contributed less than 4% of total revenue versus approximately 13% last year. Excluding eBay, revenue grew 25% year-over-year and 26% on average for the last 2 years. This 2-year compound annual growth rate is particularly notable. Throughout 2021, this growth rate has been consistently strong at 25% and 26% in the first and second quarters, respectively. 
I would also like to provide some context for our performance relative to our expectations when we provided third quarter guidance in late July. First, travel volumes strengthened in June and July. This trend then reversed in August and September due to concerns related to the Delta variant. Second, back-to-school spending was somewhat softer than we had expected. While our overall performance was well within our guidance, we saw moderation towards the tail end of the quarter and exited at a lower growth rate than we had predicted. 
In the third quarter, transaction revenue grew 10% to $5.6 billion. This growth rate reflects the steep decline in eBay revenue in the quarter. Excluding eBay, transaction revenue grew 23%. 
Other value-added services revenue grew 50% to $575 million. This performance was driven by increased revenue from Synchrony and accelerated recognition of loan servicing fees from the PPP program. 
In the third quarter, total take rate was 1.99%, consistent with the second quarter and a decline of 22 basis points from last year. The mix effect of eBay contributed to approximately 55% of this decline. The blended take rate on eBay volumes this quarter was 2.43% compared to 4% in Q3 last year. The remainder of the decline was primarily driven by reduced currency volatility in the quarter, which resulted in a lower growth rate in foreign exchange fees as well as merchant mix and growth in bill payment volumes. The 25 basis point decline in transaction take rate was driven by these same factors. 
The third quarter was another strong quarter for volume-based expense performance. Transaction expense as a rate of TPV was 83 basis points, an increase of 1 basis point versus last year. Transaction losses improved 4 basis points and represented 9 basis points as a rate of TPV. This level of loss performance is consistent with last quarter, matching the lowest transaction loss rate in our history. 
In the quarter, loan origination activity increased and we ended Q3 with $3.7 billion in net receivables, representing sequential growth of 13% and 43% growth relative to last year. Growth in our short-term installment pay portfolio was the primary driver of this increase. Strong performance of our loan portfolio, more stability in macroeconomic trends and the mix of shorter duration originations from our installment pay products resulted in our reserve coverage ratio declining to 11.6% from 14.9% at the end of the second quarter. 
The net effect of credit provisioning on credit losses in the quarter, inclusive of originations and reserve releases, resulted in a benefit of $25 million. And year-to-date, we released $300 million in reserves. Overall, volume-based expenses grew 20% and represented 46% of revenue, resulting in a transaction margin of 54.2%. 
I'd now like to cover our non-transaction-related operating expenses. These expenses increased 17%, representing 30% of revenue. In the third quarter, our rapid pace of innovation continued. We had an exciting cadence of product introductions, including our new digital wallet apps for both PayPal and Venmo, the launch of crypto by wholesale in the U.K., our goods and services P2P experience in Venmo and Cash Back to Crypto with the Venmo credit card. 
To support and advance our key initiatives, we continue to invest aggressively in technology and development and sales and marketing, including increased spending on customer acquisition and engagement strategies. These expense buckets drove 70% of the increase in non-transaction-related operating expenses. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was essentially flat to last year and our operating margin was 23.8%. And on a 2-year basis, the compound annual growth rate for operating income was 20%. 
For the quarter, non-GAAP EPS grew 4% to $1.11. This includes an approximate $0.29 per share headwind from the decline in eBay Marketplaces' transaction margin dollars. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $20 billion. In addition, free cash flow grew 20% to $1.3 billion, representing 21% of revenue. 
I'd now like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2021 as well as our preliminary thoughts for 2022. For 2021, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $25.3 billion to $25.4 billion, an increase of approximately 18% from last year. This represents a 2-year compound annual growth rate of 19%. And excluding eBay, we now expect 2021 revenue to grow 28%. 
We expect our operating margin to be in line to last year, which was the highest in our history. This performance reflects our strategic investment spend throughout the year as well as the negative transaction margin dynamics resulting from eBay, offset by the benefit from the release of reserves. 
We now expect non-GAAP EPS for the year to be approximately $4.60, a 19% increase on top of the 31% growth last year. And on a 2-year basis, this is 25% growth. In addition, we expect to generate approximately $5.2 billion in free cash flow, representing $0.21 of free cash flow for every $1 of revenue we earn. 
As a result of this update to our full year guidance, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $6.85 billion to $6.95 billion. This represents approximately 13% growth at the midpoint. We also expect $1.12 in non-GAAP EPS, representing 4% growth. 
While the impact from eBay's payments migration came in consistent with our expectations for the quarter, relative to the beginning of the year, the headwind increased significantly. Until recently, we believe we could absorb this additional pressure and still deliver on our prior guidance. And while we came within our revenue expectations for the third quarter, the contributors to our revenue growth were somewhat different than what we had expected going into the quarter. 
Toward the end of the quarter, we also began to see growth rates come in a little lower than planned. We're off to a solid start in the fourth quarter, but growth rates still remain slightly below our prior expectations. In addition, retail supply chain and labor market concerns, which may impact the important holiday season, have led us to adopt a more cautious stance for the fourth quarter. That said, in recent days, we've seen improvement. 
At this point in time, it's difficult to say definitively whether these stronger turns will persist throughout the quarter or if this improvement is a pull forward of consumer holiday activity. Relative to the guidance provided at the start of 2021, we now expect revenue to be about 0.5% lower for the year despite much more pressure from eBay than we had initially expected. Adjusting for the additional pressure to revenue growth from eBay, our revised 2021 guidance is actually ahead of the outlook we provided at the start of the year. 
In providing quarterly and annual guidance since July of last year, our goal has been to responsibly balance transparency with reliability and certainty. At the same time, we've also tried to emphasize the complexity of forecasting in this environment. We are taking what we view to be a prudent step in adjusting our outlook. But let me be very clear, our key strategic initiatives are on track and performing very well. The initial response to our new digital wallet experiences has been very strong, and the implementation of our new headline pricing in the U.S. has been successful with no discernible impact to merchant activity. 
The underlying strength, diversification and resilience of our business on an absolute level and relative to pre-pandemic are unassailable and position us to remain on offense regardless of short-term headwinds. Our ability to sustainably deliver strong growth at our scale is indicative of the network effects of our business and our competitive positioning as a global leader in digital payments at the intersection of the powerful secular tailwinds of e-commerce penetration and cash displacement has never been stronger. 
As it relates to our expectations for 2022, we'd like to share some of our initial thoughts and the assumptions we're making for internal planning purposes. We are currently in the midst of our budget resource and investment planning process for next year. In addition, how we exit the year as well as the status of some of the exogenous factors that Dan and I have already discussed are also important inputs for the year ahead. 
On a preliminary basis, for 2022, we expect revenue growth in the high teens. If we had to put a point on it today, we'd likely anchor it at about 18%. It's also important to appreciate our expected trajectory of revenue growth. Due to the cadence of eBay's payments migration as well as the stimulus measures earlier this year, we expect the first quarter next year to have more difficult comps and be our lowest growth quarter. 
Our plans are for revenue growth to then accelerate through the year and to exit 2022 at a revenue growth rate in line with or ahead of our medium-term guidance. Similar to 2021, we expect that our growth rates will exceed industry growth rates by a healthy margin. Given the ongoing planning that we're still doing, we will guide EPS growth when we report Q4 results early next year. 
That said, I'd like to provide some color on how we're thinking about it. We see significant investment opportunities across our key priorities. In the past 2 years, we've accelerated our pace of product innovation to better serve our growing network of more than 400 million consumer and merchant accounts. We are investing to advance our product road map, increase our relevance for customers and drive daily engagement. And to support these initiatives, we expect our non-transaction-related expenses to grow in the high single digits in 2022 on a base that will grow 20% this year. 
It's also important to note 2 factors that will have an impact on our EPS growth next year. First, we will lap the benefit we realized from the release of the credit reserve this year. And second, we expect our effective tax rate to increase from the lapping of onetime favorable tax adjustments. We expect these 2 items to result in an approximate 10-point headwind to non-GAAP earnings growth in 2022. 
That said, we remain very confident in the medium-term guidance we provided at our Investor Day earlier this year. We're witnessing the pull forward of e-commerce and displacement of cash continuing at an undiminished pace even as reopening the curves. It's also true that the most difficult year in the transition away from eBay will be largely behind us as we move into 2022, and we expect our revenue and TPV growth rates to accelerate. We believe that investing in our business is more important than ever before given the opportunities we see in front of us.  And while we certainly expect our margins to increase over the long term, we don't want to be so overly focused on that from one quarter or one year to the next, then we don't invest appropriately. 
We are playing in this space to win. We are well positioned to capture the immense opportunity ahead and see a clear path to achieving our financial and strategic objectives. Our powerful 2-sided platform focused on execution and mission-driven culture backed by the tailwinds of digital commerce set us up for success now and in the years to come. 
Before I turn it back over to the operator for Q&A, I would like to spend a moment discussing our approach to capital allocation. Our business is characterized by its very powerful cash flow generation. Since separation, we generated approximately $22 billion in free cash flow. We've returned nearly $10.5 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and allocated approximately $13 billion in cash to acquisitions and investments. We remain committed to both disciplined capital allocation and to balancing organic and inorganic growth investing to drive shareholder value creation. Inorganic opportunities are accelerating through our growth plans and to achieving our long-term aspirations. It's important to note that our medium-term outlook does not rely on acquisitions. At the same time, we will continue to be opportunistic in executing our strategic priorities, shaping the future of payments and advancing our leadership position. 
With that, I will turn it back to the operator. Operator, please go ahead."

I'll start off on that and then John can chime in on this. Let me just take one step back and start a little bit with the big picture because that may help put everything into context. Look, we're obviously focused on becoming an essential everyday",580,"Yes. I'll start off on that and then John can chime in on this. Let me just take one step back and start a little bit with the big picture because that may help put everything into context. 
Look, we're obviously focused on becoming an essential everyday app for consumers, and that's on the consumer side. And on the merchant side, we want to provide a comprehensive platform for merchants to participate in the digital economy, and that includes everything from consumers engaging at the beginning of their shopping journey to purchase and post-purchase. 
And if you look at all of the acquisitions that we've done over the past 5 years, they kind of play into that overall strategy, whether it be what we've done internally with the PayPal app or QR codes; acquisitions like Honey, which have been essential to our shopping deals, tab fully integrated now into the PayPal app; Happy Returns, Chargehound, they're part of our post-purchase process that we'll integrate into our app and put into our platform for merchants; iZettle, Hyperwallet now is our payouts product going forward. 
So I'm very pleased with all the acquisitions we've done. They fit into our strategy. They are executing, many of them well above what we initially thought. Some were delayed in terms of their integration for various reasons. But overall really, I'm pleased with the way our acquisition and acquisition strategy has gone and the integration into our strategy. 
The truth is we review hundreds of potential acquisitions every single year, and we put every single one of them through a very strict set of strategic financial integration filters. And we look at like, are we going to buy, build or partner? And John and I have been here now for -- well, I've been here a little over 7 years, he's been here closing in on that -- and we've never done a large acquisition so far. 
And the reason for that -- and by the way, we look at a couple of those every year. There are very few that we look at, but we look at a couple every year, and they have a much higher hurdle rate than our smaller acquisitions. I mean, we want to look, is it going to be a distraction? How tough is the integration? We fully understand what it means to do a large acquisition versus a smaller acquisition. And in 7 years, we haven't done a single large acquisition because they haven't met any of our hurdles. So I'm not saying that we might never ever do that, but it's not a likely event as we look forward. 
In our M&A philosophy, it remains the same. We're going to focus on high-quality assets that will accelerate our growth in areas that are more efficient than us doing it inorganically. And to your question specifically, we don't need to do something large to -- or small, frankly -- to deliver on our medium-term guidance. All of our acquisitions are supplemental to our medium-term guidance. And clearly, we are going to be acquisitive going forward. 
I mean, we've got an incredibly strong balance sheet, $20 billion of cash and cash-like investments on it. We're generating between $5 billion and $6 billion a year of free cash flow. But we are going to maintain the same strict and disciplined manner that we look at acquisitions and have looked at acquisitions over the last couple of years.

But that said, we don't want to sit here on our hands and think that that's good enough. If there are opportunities that are out there that create even more value creation, it's our responsibility to look at those. And so that's where deals of this size may come in sometimes, but that's what we take capital allocation with is a very serious activity for us and arguably one of the most important. 
And so as Dan said, we have a lot of rigor around that. And thus far, nothing has met those rigorous hurdles for us. But I think -- and the management team shares a belief that we have the same opportunity over the next 5 years to create value that we just realized over the last 5 years.

First of all, I'd say one of the things we talked about early on is being free of the restrictions of the eBay operating agreement. We're going to have the possibility to open us up to working with a number of marketplaces that we were previously prohibited from doing so. And you're seeing some of that, you're seeing what we're doing with Ali and AliExpress, that continues to expand in terms of the volumes there. We are getting closer and closer with Walmart. And Amazon is the latest example of us being able to team up with obviously an extremely significant player in the e-commerce space. 
And what I really like about this is like eBay results are like a pig through the python right now, but these that we're talking about, right, are much more of a permanent nature. These are what will be with us going forward as eBay kind of is a temporal phenomenon working through our results. We're still working through the launch time frames. We're both eager to get this out into the marketplace, but we're still working those to. We obviously have large teams, each of us, on this. It is the beginning of a journey of our 2 companies teaming together. I wouldn't venture at this moment as to where we'll go together. We're both very focused on the substantial opportunity that there is with Venmo at checkout, and we couldn't be more pleased to be able to team with Amazon on this. 
Obviously, if you think about the amount of market share that Amazon has in the U.S., this quite substantially is -- increases the addressable market for Pay with Venmo. And Pay with Venmo is one of the key revenue drivers for Venmo going forward. I just -- as I think about the journey that Venmo has been on, this obviously is a punctuation point for sure. But even this year, Venmo will be transaction margin-positive. That is a major milestone for that team, right on track to deliver the $900 million and obviously exit the year at an accelerating growth rate. And this partnership with Amazon will no doubt take that to the next level."

So any time you put something substantial out into the market -- and this is really the first giant revamp that we've done of our PayPal consumer app, and it's pretty massive, complete redesign. Typically on that, so what you find is you've got declines in engagement as people kind of like work their way through discovery of it. And then what you have is over time, that, that really starts to accelerate, at least that's your hope. 
This has been completely the opposite of that, which is, I guess, biggest delay, I'm not sure it's a surprise to me, but we are seeing really meaningful lifts in terms of discoverability of the breadth of our product and service line right now. We talked about PayPal shopping, the full integration of Honey into the PayPal app. Honey now is completely mobile and not just desktop, and that's powering our whole tab of that. We've seen a 25x lift in people exploring that tab and starting to put deals into their wallets and that kind of thing. It's pretty amazing actually. 
And then on things like crypto, first-time user, once we did the app, went up by 15%. Our strongest week ever for first-time users was like last week. And we've had strong weeks for first-time user growth on that. But clearly, the new app is driving both discoverability and conversion on the crypto side. 
And then I'm quite excited about what's happening with cash card because cash card is kind of like a debit card, right? It links into the balance and it can be used offline and obviously online. And this is a big part of our omni-strategic thrust and to see that go up, those enrollments go up by 35%. And remember, this is really early days, right? We fully ramped in the middle of October globally, so this is early on. And I usually think of early on as, okay, how do we start to claw back to where we were and then start to move forward as customers get it? This was a leap forward. 
Look, there are a lot of things that we're going to do to improve the customer experience. We are putting FIS now into our bill payment, expanding our bill payment quite dramatically, expanding the usability and kind of just the simplicity of it. But each and every one of the products and services, we are looking at the feedback we're getting and just making small little changes to keep increasing. 
This is going to be -- I didn't think it was going to be a big bang. It actually has turned out to be a relatively big bang on introduction, but I really think of this as evolutionary quarter by quarter by quarter. 
We will launch high-yield savings in the next several months, that will begin to ramp. We'll start to put on things like equity investing. We anticipate doing that next year. And there'll be more and more products and services to help customers engage more and more. And that's why like that ARPA of wallet users versus checkout-only, again, early, but to see that already leaping up to 2x that of checkout-only. John and I are quite excited about the impact of the initiatives that we're putting into place. And they are clearly going to drive a lot of growth for us as we look forward."

So you're right, actually, if you look at Q3, and let me just talk about revenue, TPV and maybe engagement as 3 metric",475,"Okay. David, let me talk very quickly about Q3. And then I'm going to have John talk about our Q4 guidance and our confidence in 2022. 
So you're right, actually, if you look at Q3, and let me just talk about revenue, TPV and maybe engagement as 3 metrics on that. Look, on -- the way that I think about our business right now is what's happening on our MS business because eBay is a temporal thing. It's just going through the system right now. It's less than 3% of our TPV, it's less than 4% of our revenues and drop. And so really, our business is our MS business going forward. 
And if I look at revenue growth, I think this is really interesting because I've examined this quite carefully. If I go back 5 years, if you look at our MS revenue growth, in Q3 of 2017, it was 24%; in 2018, in Q3, it was 17%; 2019, it was 23% then it jumps up to 26%; and in the middle of the pandemic, Q3 2020 and Q3 2021, this quarter, it's 25%. And so like people talk about like reopening stocks and all, like that isn't us. 
Our MS business is going from strength to strength. We've seen a leap forward in digital, and that is continuing, if you look at it in our MS. And John will talk about it in Q4 and as we look next year. 
Same thing on TPV. TPV in Q3 of 2018, MS, now I'm talking about MS was 27%. It jumped up to 29%. Then in Q3 2020 jumped to 40%. And over that 40%, we're growing this quarter at 31%. 
And so like these are all really, really strong numbers. And if I look at -- even like transactions, which I think is a really, really interesting, we did 4.9 billion transactions in Q3, this last quarter. If you go back a year ago, we did about 4 billion. We're almost up 1 billion transactions in a year in the quarter, and our transactions ex-eBay are up 31% year-over-year. Our TPA transactions for active double-digit growth for the second quarter in a row. Again, ex-eBay in the third quarter, our TPA was up 18%. 
And so these are -- yes, of course, we get hit by some of these exogenous things that go on, but if I look at the strength of the core business, every single metric is way above even our forecast is way above our medium-term guidance. And that's kind of like what gives us just a ton of confidence. And we're obviously being, I think, appropriately cautious and conservative as we look forward at this time, but I feel like if I look at what the real part of our business is, every metric is trending pretty strongly right now."

So first, with respect to the reopening of the economy, our basic assumption is that, that's sort of a slow and steady pace similar to what we've seen here more recently. 
With respect to supply chain or labor shortages, look, I don't see a quick fix to that, so that could be with us for some period of time. And I think the pressure there is probably more acute on some of the SMB segment versus large enterprises, and so that is baked into our assumptions as well. We're also not going to have the benefit of stimulus next year or likely not based upon what we see today. 
And then the last point I'd make is around eBay. eBay, if you think about the high teens mark that we put out there for revenue growth, the impact of eBay year-over-year in terms of a headwind is about 200 basis points if you just take what eBay represents in our business in 2021 compared to 2022. Said differently, though, if you were to exclude eBay in both years, the revenue growth is 22%. And so that's exceedingly strong and I think the best proxy for how to think about our business going forward. 
And so wrapping all of that together and sort of tying it to where we stand right now with the guidance that we just gave today, if you go back to the beginning of the year and the guidance that we provided, 50 million net new actives, roughly $25.5 billion of revenue, we're effectively right there. And I think very, very importantly, that was the basis for the 5-year plan, the medium-term guidance that we laid out just a few weeks after that. And so that's a way of saying that we are right on track with what we laid out at the beginning of the year with our medium-term guidance."

So 13.3 million in the quarter, up about 2 million from last quarter, growing 15% year-over-year, unlike a lot of companies that experienced growth in the off time and then are unwinding. 
Our growth remains incredibly strong on the NNA side. I mean, think about it in the minute that we've been talking so far, Darren. We've got -- we put on about 100 consumers and 9 new merchants. We are putting on 1.5 consumers every second of the quarter, every 6 seconds we put on another merchant. It's really unbelievable. And if I look 5 years ago, and you remember this, 5 years ago, we put on 13 million net new actives for the year. This quarter alone, and we put on 110 million net new actives since January of 2020. And as we said, I think, in our press release, we expect to end the year north of 430 million actives on the platform. So obviously, continued strong growth. 
But as we look forward to that $750 million, Darren, there are 2 places that our net new actives come from. One is top of the funnel, and top of the funnel is actually pretty strong right now and remain so. It's a kind of a must-have platform for merchants and consumers, and scale begets scale in this business. But as you get bigger and bigger, the bottom of the funnel becomes equally -- it's not even more important. And so reduction in churn becomes a really important element of our ability to get to the 750 million. That's why we're so excited about what we're seeing in terms of our TPA numbers, again, normalize it ex-eBay, up 18%. Last quarter, I think it was up 17%, double-digit growth even with eBay. 
And at 2 quarters in a row, some of the things I was talking to Lisa about in terms of the engagement on the app, those are things that the more people engaged, the more people get cash cards utilizing that service offline. We see halo effects inside the business. Buy Now, Pay Later, all of that actually affects churn rate. And if we can keep a consistent top of the funnel, maybe even improve that a little bit, but reduce our churn rate, you'll start to see net new actives actually accelerate going forward. And so we remain still quite confident in the 750 million, but that's what the drivers are of that, Darren."

Well, I'll start by saying that, and I would hope that people appreciate and agree with this, but I don't think there's ever been a more important time to invest in our business than right now. This is a precious opportunity that we have with some of the secular tailwinds. We're fortunate in that the margins in our business want to go up. We've demonstrated that we can scale at a very low marginal cost. We've got tremendous opportunities, some of which we talked about today, that give us confidence that over our planning horizon, our margins will go up. That's not something that I think we lose a ton of sleep about. Quite frankly, I think it's -- the more challenging dynamic is where to invest, where we can get that return that's expected. 
And if you think about the last couple of years being 2020 and this year 2021, our operating expenses have grown about 20% in each of those years. And that's not -- I would discourage you from thinking about that as sort of like onetime spend related to customer acquisition or something like that. There's a lot of engineering costs around people that are punching a keyboard to write code, and that's still with us today. So even as we talk about the high single-digit growth next year, that's on top of 2 years of 20% growth. But for us, it's also important not to spread ourselves too thin and to make sure that we are prioritizing appropriately and some of prioritizing involves say no to certain things as well. 
And so I think we've laid out a pretty clear plan over the next few years with our focus on things like the digital wallet, building out commerce capabilities, continue to monetize Venmo that give us ample opportunity to invest. But as I noted in my remarks, we don't manage the business to have margin expansion for the next quarter or frankly, even for the next year. We're looking at how we create a company over the next 5 years that can have the same type of market value appreciation that we've experienced over the last 5. And the decisions that we make really just line up with that much more so than trying to maximize for any particular time period. And so maybe not directly answering your question, but our margins are going to go up over the long term, and we're not going to be handcuffed to doing that from one period to the next at the expense of like creating shareholder value."

If you remember, we started the year at $50 million, then we raised it $52 million to $55 million. And then we thought we'd be towards the higher end of the $52 million to $55. At this point, we're just being consistent with kind of our revenue guide as well. 
We're going into the heart of the holiday, you're exactly right. If holiday season shapes up like it did last year, then we'll have more than $52 million organic because there'll be a lot more shopping. And if it doesn't, then we'll have a little bit less. So it's very consistent with kind of just being, I think, prudent and cautious given some of the trends that we're seeing and others are talking about, again, supply chain shortages, people can't shop in it. If consumer confidence is down, people do more in-store, we'll get less M&A than we typically might. 
If holiday season goes as it did last year, we'll get more than we're talking about right now. So I just think it's just very consistent with the guide that we gave. And again, as John mentioned, we've had a good start to the quarter. We've had a pretty strong last week with 4Q and -- but we're early on right now. And so we don't like it when we are at the midpoint of our guidance, it is or any of that kind of thing. We are used to being a company that puts out things and then beats what it puts out. And we want to assure that what we say is appropriate and appropriately conservative on it. So that's how I think I would answer that question, Jason.
