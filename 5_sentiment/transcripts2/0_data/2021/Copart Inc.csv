We are pleased with our -- very pleased with our results for the second quarter and look forward to discussing the trends in our business throughout today's discussion",1200,"Thanks, John, and thank you for joining us, everyone, for our second quarter call here. We are pleased with our -- very pleased with our results for the second quarter and look forward to discussing the trends in our business throughout today's discussion. 
As an appropriate cap to a bizarre 12 months, we are now experiencing a major weather system in the U.S., of course, including here at headquarters in Dallas, where 4 inches of snow qualifies as a snowstorm of epic proportions. So we start by extending our well wishes to our team, our customers and their families. And a special thanks this week to the Copart's headquarters team, including our tech people, operations, finance and accounting, for keeping us in business to serve our customers and in this case, our investors today as well without disruption. 
The natural questions today will, of course, focus on the pandemic. Since our last call in November, we have all experienced firsthand the holiday season and therefore, the accelerating and now decelerating caseloads across the world. We've seen new viral strains. And of course, we are observing the emerging logistics challenges of the global vaccine distribution phenomenon as well. And therefore, we've seen mobility modulate up and down over the course of that time as well. We have, throughout, remain honored to be recognized an essential business, as an essential business in serving our customers in the communities in which we do business. 
The themes remain overwhelmingly consistent. We have observed reducing activity, offset by the substitution of driving for other forms of transit, including air travel, buses, trains and the like. We continue to [ observe ] frequency that remains higher than what would have historically been projected given recent driving trends. We've also observed higher total loss frequency in parts empowered by very strong returns at our auctions. 
If anything, our long-run views remain very much reinforced that the 40-year trend of rising total loss frequency remains the most important underlying driver of our business and has been a continuous trend despite some major macroeconomic disruptions over the course of the past 12 months. 
In part to reflect almost now a full year of pandemic life, I think we've remained incredibly true to our foundational principles. We continue to focus day-to-day on serving our customers exceptionally well in both good times and bad and snowstorms and otherwise. We've been flexible in accommodating their workflows. 
We have also noted the importance of auction liquidity, that being the flywheel of our marketplace business. At a time when others may well be retrenching, we continue to invest very substantial resources in growing our global buyer base. We continue to believe that physical capacity is a key enabler of our business as well and have invested accordingly, including making some opportunistic purchases in -- over the course of the past year or so. And we certainly have seen the power of deploying technology in every corner of our business to make ourselves more efficient, our customers more efficient and to drive superior returns as well in our auctions, in our member recruitment and retention efforts, in customer integration, in reporting, loan payoff tools, our vehicle valuation tools and on and on and on. There is no end to the power of technology, both past, present and future in Copart. 
Our people and culture have also been remarkably durable and essential despite the disruptions of various remote work requirements, quarantines for exposure to coronavirus. And otherwise, it is the durability of Copart's culture, I think, that has proven to be the strongest thread that keeps us together. 
We've invested substantial resources throughout the pandemic and all of the above in the face of massive economic disruption. We continue to make decisions all day, every day to support our customers for [ 20 years ]. That remains our horizon as we make day-to-day decisions. 
On our business specifically, we certainly did observe volume declines in the second quarter due to reduced driving activity and high car prices, of course, which, all else equal, would lead to fewer cars to being totaled, offset by higher-than-expected accident frequency, very strong auction written, therefore, [indiscernible] total loss frequency as well. Our global unit sales decreased by 13% for the quarter with a U.S. unit decrease of 13% and an international unit decline of approximately 15%. We've observed a slightly more pronounced international decline as certain countries in which [indiscernible] have implemented more severe shelter-in-place orders due to high COVID-19 case counts and population density as well. 
Within our U.S. noninsurance business, we continued the trend of seeing charities and wholesalers volumes contracting the most significantly, perhaps affected most directly by COVID-19. Excluding those 2 categories, our noninsurance volume continued its year-over-year growth trends. And in fact, our dealer business grew 10% year-over-year in unit volume compared to what we believe were significant declines for other whole car auction platforms. This is both a product of our auction liquidity, the flywheel I described a moment ago, and certainly a contributor to it as well. Every dealer car we earn the right to sell empowers us to serve our insurance customers still better with superior returns and vice versa. 
Our global inventory at the end of January decreased 1.1% versus a year ago. That is comprised of both a slight increase in U.S. inventory of 1% and a decline of 15% for international inventory primarily driven by those countries where we have experienced more severe COVID-19 lockdowns. 
On our average selling prices, they remain robust with substantial increases year-over-year. ASPs worldwide grew 35% for the quarter, with U.S. up 36%. And while there are various offsetting mix shift considerations for that U.S. number, our insurance ASPs are up 36% year-over-year in the U.S. as well. 
The natural question, of course, is how durable those are. We note that there are certainly favorable underlying drivers as well, including strong used car prices [indiscernible], folks like Manheim and NADA citing increases in values of 15% or thereabouts, substantial increases, but certainly shy of the mid-30% range that we've experienced firsthand. 
Our selling prices have grown, we think, as a reflection of our ongoing marketing member recruitment capabilities and broad global reach. With the exception of the 1 quarter at the beginning of the pandemic last year, we've now experienced 16 straight quarters of ASP increases year-over-year. 
International buyers, after experiencing a slight decline in terms of the mix of vehicles purchased at the height of the pandemic, are now purchasing cars again at a greater rate than before the pandemic despite logistics challenges and the headaches that might come with shipping cars in 2021, a reflection of the decades-long trends that we've discussed at great length previously. I think it's difficult to project any given month, any given quarter or year. But the secular trends for ASPs, including our international buyer recruitment and retention, total loss frequency certainly as well remain durable. We are grateful for our very strong financial performance this quarter, excited to continue investing in our customers' future and our own. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John North, to discuss the second quarter financial results."

I'll make a few brief comments on our operational results to provide a little more color, and then we'll open it up for some questions.

I'll make a few brief comments on our operational results to provide a little more color, and then we'll open it up for some questions. 
Global revenue increased $41.9 million or 7.3%, including a $2.2 million benefit due to currency. Global service revenue increased $22.6 million or 4.4% primarily due to higher ASPs. The U.S. service revenue grew 4%, and international experienced an increase of 7.2%. 
Purchased vehicle sales increased $19.3 million or 29.7% due to higher ASPs and increased volumes, partially offset by lower international volumes. U.S. purchased vehicle revenue was up 48.3% over the prior year, and international grew by [ 7.5% ]. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profit, defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales, increased by $3.6 million overall. Global gross profit increased by $47.6 million or 18.3%. 
And our gross margin percentage improved by approximately [ 160 ] basis points to 49.8%. U.S. margins improved from 47.6% to 52.2%, and international margins increased from 32.8% to 37.6%. Both segments margin was driven primarily through increased ASPs, but was partially offset due to volume declines over fixed cost components, leading to higher cost per unit processed. 
I'll now move to the discussion of G&A excluding stock compensation and depreciation expenses. We continue to believe that we can achieve additional operating leverage over the long term, and we encourage you to review [indiscernible] trend lines rather than a single quarter metric for a more accurate view of the business, particularly given the impact of COVID. 
With that said, our G&A spend was down $3.2 million from $39.2 million a year ago to $36.0 million in 2021. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 23% from $209.9 million to $258.2 million. We delivered over 500 basis points of operating margin improvement due to revenue growth from strong fees, outpacing the impact of a lower absolute volume of vehicles while controlling G&A costs. 
Net interest expense increased $400,000 or 8.6% year-over-year due to reduced interest income on collected cash balances given the current interest rate environment and an increased issuance cost and unused line of credit fees due to the [indiscernible] by 2020 revolver upsizing and amendment. Q2 income tax expense was $59 million at a 23.4 effective tax rate, reflecting a $2.2 million benefit to size of employee stock options, which has been adjusted out for purposes of non-GAAP earnings included in our earnings release. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would have been 24.2%. 
In summary, GAAP net income increased 14.7% from $168.7 million last year to $193.4 million this year. Adjusted to remove the effects of currency and the tax benefit on the excise of stock options, non-GAAP net income increased 24.8% from $153.5 million last year to $191.5 million in the first quarter of 2021 -- in the second quarter 2021, excuse me. 
For the first 6 months of fiscal '21, GAAP net income increased to $393.7 million. And non-GAAP net income increased 23.0% to $379.8 million. 
Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow highlights. As of January 31, 2021, we had $1.6 billion of liquidity, comprised of $616.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with capacity of over $1 billion. This is an increase of $138.7 million over July 31, 2020. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter decreased modestly by $10 million year-over-year to $134.5 million primarily driven by working capital changes. Sequentially, operating cash flow decreased $124 million from the first quarter of 2021 due to seasonal factors that should reverse later in the year. 
We invested $136.1 million in capital expenditures for the quarter, and [indiscernible] 85% of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion. This investment continues to ensure adequate capacity for additional business and creates an economic vote to potential market entrance given the difficulty in-sourcing appropriately zoned facilities. 
In conclusion, our conservative capital structure and strong and durable growth enable us to continue to make decisions for long-term interest of both our customers and our shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Victor, we're happy to open it up for some questions."

To the extent that it helps to bring salvage auction values up, that can then increase total loss frequency to some extent as well. 
But your question really is, to what extent are today's auction returns being incorporated by insurance companies into their total loss decisions. And I think the answer is partially so. But I don't think, broadly speaking, folks have fully accounted for today's auction returns in terms of the total loss frequency. 
You've seen the uptick in total loss frequency, but it's in the 1% kind of range. I think if and when these prices prove durable, I think we would see total loss frequency up meaningfully still."

And so we didn't have to figure it out on the fly. 
We have been a global online auction house for literally decades. So that's been the single biggest help during the pandemic. Otherwise, we certainly had to make real-time accommodations to a number of our customers who have their own evolving workflows that now they now wish to send fewer people to physical locations and so forth. So we have to find ways to accommodate that workflow and some mix of -- through some mix of business process and technology deployments on our part to keep our own people safe and to reduce density in our facilities. 
We've deployed tools that help our members, our employees and our sellers reduce congestion. So they can go to the facilities at the right times and wait in their cars instead of coming into the facility and waiting in line physically. We certainly had to accommodate work-from-home arrangements for folks who have been quarantined, exposed or in high case count areas where the restrictions are more severe.

But in the U.S., I think we believe that, that rising total loss frequency is a huge opportunity for us, not just as the passive beneficiaries of it, but because we affect those results to some extent through our auction technology, our member recruitments. Building that global liquidity base is everything. And as we drive returns upwards, we can for our customers continue to achieve better returns and therefore, earn the right to sell still more of those cars. So bringing us back to the total loss frequency thesis you described a moment ago. 
Therefore, also, we can continue to grow our business in the noninsurance realms as well, including among automotive dealers. As our auction values rise as sort of liquidity grows and builds upon itself, we are the right outlet for [indiscernible] more whole cars as well.

We've seen -- and these are all in small percentage point changes definitely to be fair. These aren't titanic shifts of any sort. But we've seen their buying power compressed by virtue of their currencies. 
Now sitting here in -- after this quarter, we've now seen international buyers purchasing the most cars on a percentage basis relative to our total units sold that they have bought since before pre -- since prepandemic levels.

But the underlying thesis is that the status quo today is a disservice to insurance carriers and to their policyholders both, both in economic terms and experiential ones. And at the Copart auction model, which we have deployed, as you know, at great scale in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Brazil and elsewhere, it generates better economic outcomes for everyone involved and better experiential outcomes as well. 
Our experience there, including during the pandemic, has done nothing but reinforced that. We are -- as noted a few calls ago, we are selling consigned vehicles on behalf of a number of the top insurance carriers in Germany. We are continuing to invest in our technology, our land, our people, our marketing efforts. 
Ultimately, we think it is our business process, our global buyer base and our technology which will ultimately allow us to prevail. We have the [indiscernible]. We are incredibly excited. 
As you might imagine, the pandemic itself is an interesting catalyst. It is -- it shakes up the status quo to some extent.

Our results -- our auction results there continue to demonstrate a superior outcome relative to the status quo, which ultimately benefits the insurance carriers and benefits the policyholders as well because they don't have an owner-retained vehicle and ultimately, because this will drive insurance rates down as well."

But the majority of what I think you're calling ARPU growth, which is the comparison of our revenue change relative to our units sold change, there is some principal mix in there as well. So principal mix can throw that math off in ways that overstate its economic importance, as you know.

And one reason we went ahead and proactively disclosed because I think the intuition is fair that if dealer volume is up 10% year-over-year and the ASPs are higher than those of your insurance cars, to what extent is it contributing to ASP growth. And the answer is, yes, it contributes, but it's offset by other mix effects as well. So that U.S. insurance ASPs are up 36% year-over-year, right? So it is not, by and large, the story for ASP change year-over-year for this quarter. 
Over time, it certainly could have that effect as well. As you know, the total of our noninsurance business is in the order of the 20% kind of range. So it won't. We will still be largely driven by insurance changes for the next X quarters and years. But over time, yes, they will continue to grow that dealer business, and it will nudge our ASPs upward as well."

We used to measure our export solely by registration address, but it became apparent that there were a number of folks who simply register in the U.S. but actually have their principal operations outside or are exporters by trade. And so that number, the more inclusive estimate for the share of our cars produced by non-U.S. buyers is circa 40% or thereabouts. It's an imperfect science.
There are international IP addresses that we know are for buyers who intend to export cars. There are international IP addresses that we know are not. They're literally for U.S. buyers who have outsourced or located their purchasing operations outside the U.S., and we purposely exclude them as well. So the output of that analysis is circa 40% of our units are purchased by those international buyers. Now I qualify that by saying that 90% plus of our cars are -- have their values affected by international buyers because they bid on many, many more cars still than they buy."

Insightful questions, some we can address more transparently than others. In short, the -- in short, we certainly believe that the -- as total loss frequency rises, as the character of the vehicles that we sell changes and that pool of liquidity evolves over time, but yes, still more of transacted vehicles become addressable through Copart's platform in short. 
As for the profitability or the mix thereof, the dealers are not the majority of it, but a very important portion of our noninsurance business. Of course, that business is profitable to us. We won't comment on relative fees paid by our customers, in part because the services we provide them also vary greatly as well. 
But it is a profitable business for us. It is important to us. It also, as I noted in the prepared remarks, also helps us serve insurance customers better as well. They are all mutually supportive of one another because of the liquidity phenomenon. 
When we win that dealer car, it attracts still more buyers who have been on insurance cars and vice versa. And so as we total -- as we help insurance carriers total cars that are more and more marginal from their point of view, that also attracts more buyers, which also, therefore, attracts more dealer cars as well as those other sources that you may have in mind."

And thank you for joining us, everyone, for our second quarter call here. 
We are pleased with our -- very pleased with our results for the second quarter and look forward to discussing the trends in our business throughout today's discussion.  
As an appropriate cap to a bizarre 12 months, we are now experiencing a major weather system in the U.S., of course, including here at headquarters in Dallas, where 4 inches of snow qualifies as a snowstorm of epic proportions. So we start by extending our well wishes to our team, our customers and their families. And a special thanks this week to the Copart's headquarters team, including our tech people, operations, finance and accounting, for keeping us in business to serve our customers and, in this case, our investors today as well without disruption.  
The natural questions today will, of course, focus on the pandemic. Since our last call in November, we have all experienced firsthand the holiday season and, therefore, the accelerating and now decelerating caseloads across the world. We've seen new viral strains. And of course, we are observing the emerging logistics challenges of the global vaccine distribution phenomenon as well. And therefore, we've seen mobility modulate up and down over the course of that time as well. We have, throughout, remained honored to be recognized an essential business -- as an essential business in serving our customers in the communities in which we do business.  
The themes remain overwhelmingly consistent. We have observed reducing activity, offset by the substitution of driving for other forms of transit, including air travel, buses, trains and the like. We continue to [ observe ] the same frequency that remains higher than what would have historically been projected given recent driving trends. We've also observed higher total loss frequency, in parts, empowered by very strong returns at our auctions.  
If anything, our long-run views remain very much reinforced that the 40-year trend of rising total loss frequency remains the most important underlying driver of our business and has been a continuous trend despite some major macroeconomic disruptions over the course of the past 12 months.  
In part and to reflect almost now a full year of pandemic life, I think we've remained incredibly true to our foundational principles. We continue to focus day to day on serving our customers exceptionally well in both good times and bad and snowstorms and otherwise. We've been flexible in accommodating their workflows.  
We have also noted the importance of auction liquidity, that being the flywheel of our marketplace business at a time when others may well be retrenching, we continue to invest very substantial resources in growing our global buyer base. We continue to believe that physical capacity is a key enabler of our business as well and have invested accordingly, including making some opportunistic purchases in -- over the course of the past year or so. 
And we certainly have seen the power of deploying technology in every corner of our business to make ourselves more efficient, our customers more efficient and to drive superior returns as well in our auctions, in our member recruitment and retention efforts, in customer integration, in reporting, loan payoff tools, our vehicle valuation tools and on and on and on. There is no end to the power of technology both past, present and future in Copart.  
Our people and culture have also been remarkably durable and essential despite the disruptions of various remote work requirements, quarantines or exposure to coronavirus. And otherwise, it is the durability of Copart's culture I think that has proven to be the strongest thread that keeps us together.  We've invested substantial resources throughout the pandemic in all of the above in the face of massive economic disruption. We continue to make decisions all day, every day to support our customers for 20 years. That remains our horizon as we make day-to-day decisions.  
On our business specifically, we certainly did observe volume declines in the second quarter due to reduced driving activity and high car prices, of course, which, all else equal, would leave fewer cars to being totaled, offset by higher-than-expected accident frequency, very strong auction and, therefore, a total loss frequency as well. 
Our global unit sales decreased by 13% for the quarter with a U.S. unit decrease of 13% and an international unit decline of approximately 15%. We've observed a slightly more pronounced international decline as certain countries in which [ we operate ] have implemented more severe shelter-in-place orders due to high COVID-19 case counts and population density as well.  
Within our U.S. noninsurance business, we continued the trend of seeing charities and wholesalers volumes contracting the most significantly, perhaps affected most directly by COVID-19. Excluding those 2 categories, our noninsurance volume continued its year-over-year growth trends. And in fact, our dealer business grew 10% year-over-year in unit volume compared to what we believe were significant declines for other whole car auction platforms. This is both a product of our auction liquidity, the flywheel I described a moment ago, and certainly a contributor to it as well. Every dealer car we earn the right to sell empowers us to serve our insurance customers still better with superior returns and vice versa.  
Our global inventory at the end of January decreased 1.1% versus a year ago. That is comprised of both a slight increase in U.S. inventory of 1% and a decline of 15% for international inventory primarily driven by those countries where we have experienced more severe COVID-19 lockdowns.  
On our average selling prices, they remain robust with substantial increases year-over-year. ASPs worldwide grew 35% for the quarter with U.S. ASPs up 36%. And while there are various offsetting mix shift considerations for that U.S. number, our insurance ASPs are up 36% year-over-year in the U.S. as well.  
The natural question, of course, is how durable those are. We note that there are certainly favorable underlying drivers as well, including strong used car prices, folks like Manheim and NADA citing increases in values of 15% or thereabouts, substantial increases, but certainly shy of the mid-30% range that we've experienced firsthand.  
Our selling prices have grown, we think, as a reflection of our ongoing marketing member recruitment capabilities and broad global reach. With the exception of the 1 quarter at the beginning of the pandemic last year, we've now experienced 16 straight quarters of ASP increases year-over-year.  
International buyers, after experiencing a slight decline in terms of the mix of vehicles purchased at the height of the pandemic, are now purchasing cars again at a greater rate than before the pandemic despite logistics challenges and the headaches that might come with shipping cars in 2021, a reflection of the decades-long trends that we've discussed at great length previously. 
I think it's difficult to project any given month, any given quarter or year, but the secular trends for ASPs, including our international buyer, recruitment and retention, total loss frequency certainly as well, remain durable. We are grateful for our very strong financial performance this quarter, excited to continue investing in our customers' future and our own.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John North, to discuss the second quarter financial results."

I'll make a few brief comments on our operational results to provide a little more color, and then we'll open it up for some questions.

I'll make a few brief comments on our operational results to provide a little more color, and then we'll open it up for some questions.  
Global revenue increased $41.9 million or 7.3%, including a $2.2 million benefit due to currency. Global service revenue increased $22.6 million or 4.4% primarily due to higher ASPs. The U.S. service revenue grew 4% and international experienced an increase of 7.2%.  
Purchased vehicle sales increased $19.3 million or 29.7% due to higher ASPs and increased volumes, partially offset by lower international volumes. U.S. purchased vehicle revenue was up 48.3% over the prior year and international grew by 7.5%. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profit, defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales, increased by $3.6 million overall. 
Global gross profit increased by $47.6 million or 18.3%.  And our gross margin percentage improved by approximately [ 460 ] basis points to 49.8%. U.S. margins improved from 47.6% to 52.2% and international margins increased from 32.8% to 37.6%. Both segments' margin was driven primarily through increased ASPs, but was partially offset due to volume declines over fixed cost components, leading to higher cost per unit processed.  
I'll now move to a discussion of G&A, excluding stock compensation and depreciation expenses. We continue to believe that we can achieve additional operating leverage over the long term, and we encourage you to review longer-dated trend lines rather than a single quarter metric for a more accurate view of the business, particularly given the impact of COVID.  
With that said, our G&A spend was down $3.2 million from $39.2 million a year ago to $36.0 million in 2021. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 23% from $209.9 million to $258.2 million. We delivered over 500 basis points of operating margin improvement due to revenue growth from strong ASPs outpacing the impact of a lower absolute volume of vehicles while controlling G&A costs. 
Net interest expense increased $400,000 or 8.6% year-over-year due to reduced interest income on collected cash balances given the current interest rate environment and an increased issuance costs and unused line of credit fees due to the July 2020 revolver upsizing and amendment. 
Q2 income tax expense was $59 million at a 23.4 effective tax rate, reflecting a $2.2 million benefit to size on the exercise of employee stock options, which has been adjusted out for purposes of non-GAAP earnings included in our earnings release. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would have been 24.2%. 
In summary, GAAP net income increased 14.7% from $168.7 million last year to $193.4 million this year. Adjusted to remove the effects of currency and the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options, non-GAAP net income increased 24.8% from $153.5 million last year to $191.5 million in the first quarter of 2021 -- in the second quarter of 2021, excuse me.  For the first 6 months of fiscal '21, GAAP net income increased to $393.7 million and non-GAAP net income increased 23.0% to $379.8 million. 
Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow highlights. As of January 31, 2021, we had $1.6 billion of liquidity comprised of $616.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with capacity of over $1 billion. This is an increase of $138.7 million over July 31, 2020. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter decreased modestly by $10 million year-over-year to $134.5 million primarily driven by working capital changes. Sequentially, operating cash flow decreased $124 million from the first quarter of 2021 due to seasonal factors that should reverse later in the year. We invested $136.1 million in capital expenditures for the quarter and 85% of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion. This investment continues to ensure adequate capacity for additional business and creates an economic moat to potential market entrants given the difficulty in-sourcing appropriately zoned facilities. 
In conclusion, our conservative capital structure and strong and durable growth enable us to continue to make decisions for long-term interest of both our customers and our shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Victor, we're happy to open it up for some questions."

So if you -- let's separate a bunch of different variables at the same. With used car prices being high, by itself, would lead to fewer cars being totaled. To the extent that it helps to bring salvage auction values up, that can then increase total loss frequency to some extent as well. 
But your question really is to what extent are today's auction returns being incorporated by insurance companies into their total loss decisions. And I think the answer is partially so. But I don't think, broadly speaking, folks have fully accounted for today's auction returns in terms of the total loss frequency. 
You've seen the uptick in total loss frequency, but it's in the 1% kind of range. I think if and when these prices prove durable, I think we would see total loss frequency up meaningfully still."

So we didn't have to figure it out on the fly.  
We have been a global online auction house for literally decades. So that's been the single biggest help during the pandemic. Otherwise, we certainly had to make real-time accommodations to a number of our customers who have their own evolving workflows that now -- they now wish to send fewer people to physical locations and so forth. 
So we have to find ways to accommodate that workflow and some mix of -- through some mix of business process and technology deployments. On our part to keep our own people safe and to reduce density in our facilities, we've deployed tools that help our members, our employees and our sellers reduce congestion, so they can go to the facilities at the right times and wait in their cars instead of coming into the facility and waiting in line physically. 
We certainly had to accommodate work-from-home arrangements for folks who have been quarantined, exposed or in high case count areas where the restrictions are more severe. But by and large, we have, I'd say, much more business as usual in actionable practice than not, in part, because we had already been a digital business beforehand."

Building that global liquidity base is everything.  And as we drive returns upwards, we can for our customers continue to achieve better returns and therefore, earn the right to sell still more of those cars.  So bringing us back to the total loss frequency thesis you described a moment ago. 
Therefore, also, we can continue to grow our business in the noninsurance realms as well, including among automotive dealers.

In Germany, I think our -- the economic thesis, which we described at great length in a couple of calls in 2019 -- or fiscal 2019, so certainly, we would direct others to go there. I know you've read it carefully. 
But the underlying thesis is that the status quo today is a disservice to insurance carriers and to their policyholders both. Both in economic terms and experiential ones. And at the Copart auction model, which we have deployed, as you know, at great scale in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Brazil and elsewhere, generates better economic outcomes for everyone involved and better experiential outcomes as well. 
Our experience there, including during the pandemic, has done nothing but reinforce that. We are -- as noted a few calls ago, we are selling consigned vehicles on behalf of a number of the top insurance carriers in Germany. We are continuing to invest in our technology, our land, our people, our marketing efforts.  Ultimately, we think it is our business process, our global buyer base and our technology, which will ultimately allow us to prevail. We have the [ votes ].  We are incredibly excited.  
As you might imagine, the pandemic itself is an interesting catalyst. It is -- it shakes up the status quo to some extent. But in other respects, it also can arrest meetings that otherwise might have happened in working sessions and so forth with insurance carriers. But the underlying thesis is as strong as ever. Our results -- our auction results there continue to demonstrate a superior outcome relative to the status quo, which ultimately benefits the insurance carriers and benefits the policyholders as well because they don't have an owner-retained wrecked vehicle and ultimately, because this will drive insurance rates down as well."

And one reason we went ahead and proactively disclosed because I think the intuition is fair that if dealer volume is up 10% year-over-year and the ASPs are higher than those of the insurance cars, to what extent is it contributing to ASP growth. And the answer is, yes, it contributes, but it's offset by other mix effects as well. So that U.S. insurance ASPs are up 36% year-over-year, right? So it is not, by and large, the story for ASP change year-over-year for this quarter. 
Over time, it certainly could have that effect as well. As you know, the total of our noninsurance business is in the order of the 20% kind of range. So it won't. It -- we will still be largely driven by insurance changes for the next X quarters and years.

You're describing the methodology, which we changed a few years  ago. We used to measure our exports solely by a registration address, but it became apparent that there were a number of folks who simply register in the U.S. but actually have their principal operations outside and, therefore, are exporters by trade. 
And so that number, the more inclusive estimate for the share of our cars produced by non-U.S. buyers is circa 40% or thereabouts. It's an imperfect science.  There are international IP addresses that we know are for buyers who intend to export cars. There are international IP addresses that we know are not. They're literally for U.S. buyers who have outsourced or located their purchasing operations outside the U.S., and we purposely exclude them as well. 
So the output of that analysis is circa 40% of our units are purchased by those international buyers. Now I qualify that by saying that 90% plus of our cars are -- have their values affected by international buyers because they bid on many, many more cars still than they buy."

So it's a fivefold increase in the past 40 years. I think that's an inexorable march to 30%, 40% and beyond. Whether there are near-term technical blips that caused it to change in a given quarter, I think it's totally plausible, but I think the 40-year trend is unassailable. 
To your other question about miles driven, unfortunately, I think we see tons of data. So I think since November, we have tons of data. I'm not sure we have tons of incremental insight there beyond what you and others would cite as well in the EIA's data, Google, Apple, INRIX, et cetera. We study those same trends. And I think underlying them are all the same questions about the proliferation of the vaccine: when the kids go back to school, when leisure travel resumes, air travel resumes. I think there are so many variables that are upstream of that question. Even driving activity, to say nothing of Copart volume, that's somewhat speculation on our part to give you any kind of number or even a range.

Cars were more readily repairable than they are today. And today, if a couple of sensors are knocked out, then the cars can be totaled much more readily in part because the returns are better on the back end as well.

And are whole cars more profitable vehicles for you to sell because they transact at higher prices?  Is there anything else to think about? Like, for example, on the sell fee side, like if there are smaller dealers selling the vehicles, maybe they don't get the volume discounts that your customers are selling tens of thousands of vehicles do, making it even more profitable. 
And then just finally, I'm curious if there are certain parts of the whole car market that you're targeting now, such as dealers, but maybe there are other segments or categories of sellers that you've not gotten into yet, which might offer future growth opportunities."

In short, the -- in short, we certainly believe that the -- as total loss frequency rises, as the character of the vehicles that we sell changes and that pool of liquidity evolves over time, but yes, still more of transacted vehicles become addressable through Copart's platform in short. 
As for the profitability or the mix thereof, the dealers are not the majority of, but a very important portion of our noninsurance business. Of course, that business is profitable to us. We won't comment on relative fees paid by our customers, in part, because the services we provide them also vary greatly as well. 
But it is a profitable business for us. It is important to us. It also -- as I noted in the prepared remarks, also helps us serve insurance customers better as well. They are all mutually supportive of one another because of the liquidity phenomenon. 
When we win that dealer car, it attracts still more buyers who have been on insurance cars and vice versa. And so as we total -- as we help insurance carriers total cars that are more and more marginal, from their point of view, that also attracts more buyers, which also, therefore, attracts more dealer cars as well as those other sources that you may have in mind."

And thank you for joining us, everyone, for our second quarter call here. 
We are pleased with our -- very pleased with our results for the second quarter and look forward to discussing the trends in our business throughout today's discussion.  
As an appropriate cap to a bizarre 12 months, we are now experiencing a major weather system in the U.S., of course, including here at headquarters in Dallas, where 4 inches of snow qualifies as a snowstorm of epic proportions. So we start by extending our well wishes to our team, our customers and their families. And a special thanks this week to the Copart's headquarters team, including our tech people, operations, finance and accounting, for keeping us in business to serve our customers and, in this case, our investors today as well without disruption.  
The natural questions today will, of course, focus on the pandemic. Since our last call in November, we have all experienced firsthand the holiday season and, therefore, the accelerating and now decelerating caseloads across the world. We've seen new viral strains. And of course, we are observing the emerging logistics challenges of the global vaccine distribution phenomenon as well. And therefore, we've seen mobility modulate up and down over the course of that time as well. We have, throughout, remained honored to be recognized an essential business -- as an essential business in serving our customers in the communities in which we do business.  
The themes remain overwhelmingly consistent. We have observed reducing activity, offset by the substitution of driving for other forms of transit, including air travel, buses, trains and the like. We continue to [ observe ] the frequency that remains higher than what would have historically been projected given recent driving trends. We've also observed higher total loss frequency, in part, empowered by very strong returns at our auctions.  
If anything, our long-run views remain very much reinforced that the 40-year trend of rising total loss frequency remains the most important underlying driver of our business and has been a continuous trend despite some major macroeconomic disruptions over the course of the past 12 months.  
In part and to reflect almost now a full year of pandemic life, I think we've remained incredibly true to our foundational principles. We continue to focus day to day on serving our customers exceptionally well in both good times and bad in snowstorms and otherwise. We've been flexible in accommodating their workflows.  
We have also noted the importance of auction liquidity, that being the flywheel of our marketplace business. At a time when others may well be retrenching, we continue to invest very substantial resources in growing our global buyer base. We continue to believe that physical capacity is a key enabler of our business as well and have invested accordingly, including making some opportunistic purchases in -- over the course of the past year or so. 
And we certainly have seen the power of deploying technology in every corner of our business to make ourselves more efficient, our customers more efficient and to drive superior returns as well in our auctions, in our member recruitment and retention efforts, in customer integration, in reporting, loan payoff tools, our vehicle valuation tools and on and on and on. There is no end to the power of technology both past, present and future in Copart.  
Our people and culture have also been remarkably durable and essential despite the disruptions of various remote work requirements, quarantines or exposure to coronavirus. And otherwise, it is the durability of Copart's culture I think that has proven to be the strongest thread that keeps us together.  We've invested substantial resources throughout the pandemic in all of the above in the face of massive economic disruption. We continue to make decisions all day, every day to support our customers for 20 years. That remains our horizon as we make day-to-day decisions.  
On our business specifically, we certainly did observe volume declines in the second quarter due to reduced driving activity and high car prices, of course, which, all else equal, would lead to fewer cars to being totaled, offset by higher-than-expected accident frequency, very strong auction and, therefore, a total loss frequency as well. 
Our global unit sales decreased by 13% for the quarter with a U.S. unit decrease of 13% and an international unit decline of approximately 15%. We've observed a slightly more pronounced international decline as certain countries in which [ we operate ] have implemented more severe shelter-in-place orders due to high COVID-19 case counts and population density as well.  
Within our U.S. noninsurance business, we continued the trend of seeing charities and wholesalers volumes contracting the most significantly, perhaps affected most directly by COVID-19. Excluding those 2 categories, our noninsurance volume continued its year-over-year growth trends. And in fact, our dealer business grew 10% year-over-year in unit volume compared to what we believe were significant declines for other whole car auction platforms. This is both a product of our auction liquidity, the flywheel I described a moment ago, and certainly a contributor to it as well. Every dealer car we earn the right to sell empowers us to serve our insurance customers still better with superior returns and vice versa.  
Our global inventory at the end of January decreased 1.1% versus a year ago. That is comprised of both a slight increase in U.S. inventory of 1% and a decline of 15% for international inventory primarily driven by those countries where we have experienced more severe COVID-19 lockdowns.  
On our average selling prices, they remain robust with substantial increases year-over-year. ASPs worldwide grew 35% for the quarter with U.S. ASPs up 36%. And while there are various offsetting mix shift considerations for that U.S. number, our insurance ASPs are up 36% year-over-year in the U.S. as well.  
The natural question, of course, is how durable those are. We note that there are certainly favorable underlying drivers as well, including strong used car prices, folks like Manheim and NADA citing increases in values of 15% or thereabouts, substantial increases, but certainly shy of the mid-30% range that we've experienced firsthand.  
Our selling prices have grown, we think, as a reflection of our ongoing marketing member recruitment capabilities and broad global reach. With the exception of the 1 quarter at the beginning of the pandemic last year, we've now experienced 16 straight quarters of ASP increases year-over-year.  
International buyers, after experiencing a slight decline in terms of the mix of vehicles purchased at the height of the pandemic, are now purchasing cars again at a greater rate than before the pandemic despite logistics challenges and the headaches that might come with shipping cars in 2021, a reflection of the decades-long trends that we've discussed at great length previously. 
I think it's difficult to project any given month, any given quarter or year, but the secular trends for ASPs, including our international buyer, recruitment and retention, total loss frequency certainly as well, remain durable. We are grateful for our very strong financial performance this quarter, excited to continue investing in our customers' future and our own.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John North, to discuss the second quarter financial results."

I'll make a few brief comments on our operational results to provide a little more color, and then we'll open it up for some questions.  
Global revenue increased $41.9 million or 7.3%, including a $2.2 million benefit due to currency. Global service revenue increased $22.6 million or 4.4% primarily due to higher ASPs. The U.S. service revenue grew 4% and international experienced an increase of 7.2%.  
Purchased vehicle sales increased $19.3 million or 29.7% due to higher ASPs and increased volumes, partially offset by lower international volumes. U.S. purchased vehicle revenue was up 48.3% over the prior year and international grew by 7.5%. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profit, defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales, increased by $3.6 million overall. 
Global gross profit increased by $47.6 million or 18.3%.  And our gross margin percentage improved by approximately [ 460 ] basis points to 49.8%. U.S. margins improved from 47.6% to 52.2% and international margins increased from 32.8% to 37.6%. Both segments' margin was driven primarily through increased ASPs, but was partially offset due to volume declines over fixed cost components, leading to higher cost per unit processed.  
I'll now move to a discussion of G&A, excluding stock compensation and depreciation expenses. We continue to believe that we can achieve additional operating leverage over the long term, and we encourage you to review longer-dated trend lines rather than a single quarter metric for a more accurate view of the business, particularly given the impact of COVID.  
With that said, our G&A spend was down $3.2 million from $39.2 million a year ago to $36.0 million in 2021. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 23% from $209.9 million to $258.2 million. We delivered over 500 basis points of operating margin improvement due to revenue growth from strong ASPs outpacing the impact of a lower absolute volume of vehicles while controlling G&A costs. 
Net interest expense increased $400,000 or 8.6% year-over-year due to reduced interest income on collected cash balances given the current interest rate environment and an increased issuance costs and unused line of credit fees due to the July 2020 revolver upsizing and amendment. 
Q2 income tax expense was $59 million at a 23.4 effective tax rate, reflecting a $2.2 million benefit due to exercise of employee stock options, which has been adjusted out for purposes of non-GAAP earnings included in our earnings release. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would have been 24.2%. 
In summary, GAAP net income increased 14.7% from $168.7 million last year to $193.4 million this year. Adjusted to remove the effects of currency and the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options, non-GAAP net income increased 24.8% from $153.5 million last year to $191.5 million in the first quarter of 2021 -- in the second quarter of 2021, excuse me.  For the first 6 months of fiscal '21, GAAP net income increased to $393.7 million and non-GAAP net income increased 23.0% to $379.8 million. 
Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow highlights. As of January 31, 2021, we had $1.6 billion of liquidity comprised of $616.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with capacity of over $1 billion. This is an increase of $138.7 million over July 31, 2020. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter decreased modestly by $10 million year-over-year to $134.5 million primarily driven by working capital changes. Sequentially, operating cash flow decreased $124 million from the first quarter of 2021 due to seasonal factors that should reverse later in the year. We invested $136.1 million in capital expenditures for the quarter and 85% of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion. This investment continues to ensure adequate capacity for additional business and creates an economic moat to potential market entrants given the difficulty in-sourcing appropriately zoned facilities. 
In conclusion, our conservative capital structure and strong and durable growth enable us to continue to make decisions for long-term interest of both our customers and our shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Victor, we're happy to open it up for some questions."

So if you -- let's separate a bunch of different variables at the same time. With used car prices being high, by itself, would lead to fewer cars being totaled. To the extent that it helps to bring salvage auction values up, that can then increase total loss frequency to some extent as well. 
But your question really is to what extent are today's auction returns being incorporated by insurance companies into their total loss decisions. And I think the answer is partially so. But I don't think, broadly speaking, folks have fully accounted for today's auction returns in terms of the total loss frequency. 
You've seen the uptick in total loss frequency, but it's in the 1% kind of range. I think if and when these prices prove durable, I think we would see total loss frequency up meaningfully still."

We have been a global online auction house for literally decades. So that's been the single biggest help during the pandemic. Otherwise, we certainly had to make real-time accommodations to a number of our customers who have their own evolving workflows that now -- they now wish to send fewer people to physical locations and so forth. 
So we have to find ways to accommodate that workflow and some mix of -- through some mix of business process and technology deployments. On our part to keep our own people safe and to reduce density in our facilities, we've deployed tools that help our members, our employees and our sellers reduce congestion, so they can go to the facilities at the right times and wait in their cars instead of coming into the facility and waiting in line physically. 
We certainly had to accommodate work-from-home arrangements for folks who have been quarantined, exposed or in high case count areas where the restrictions are more severe. But by and large, we have, I'd say, much more business as usual in actionable practice than not, in part, because we had already been a digital business beforehand."

But we're certainly excited about our core business being the -- I think you were citing our incumbent market specifically.  
But in the U.S., I think we believe that, that rising total loss frequency is a huge opportunity for us not just as the passive beneficiaries of it, but because we affect those results to some extent through our auction technology, our member recruitments. Building that global liquidity base is everything.  And as we drive returns upwards, we can for our customers continue to achieve better returns and therefore, earn the right to sell still more of those cars.  So bringing us back to the total loss frequency thesis you described a moment ago. 
Therefore, also, we can continue to grow our business in the noninsurance realms as well, including among automotive dealers. As our auction values rise, as our liquidity grows and builds upon itself, we are the right outlet for more whole cars as well. And that also is a large and substantial opportunity for us here in the U.S."

Now sitting here in -- after this quarter, we've now seen international buyers purchasing the most cars on a percentage basis relative to our total units sold that they have bought since before -- since pre-pandemic levels.  So I think it's a reflection of ongoing demand, more of the 40-year trends, more that our wrecked cars are incredibly valuable as drivable cars to many other countries around the world.

In Germany, I think our -- the economic thesis, which we described at great length in a couple of calls in 2019 -- or fiscal 2019, so certainly, we would direct others to go there. I know you've read it carefully. 
But the underlying thesis is that the status quo today is a disservice to insurance carriers and to their policyholders both. Both in economic terms and experiential ones. And at the Copart auction model, which we have deployed, as you know, at great scale in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Brazil and elsewhere, generates better economic outcomes for everyone involved and better experiential outcomes as well. 
Our experience there, including during the pandemic, has done nothing but reinforce that. We are -- as noted a few calls ago, we are selling consigned vehicles on behalf of a number of the top insurance carriers in Germany. We are continuing to invest in our technology, our land, our people, our marketing efforts.  Ultimately, we think it is our business process, our global buyer base and our technology, which will ultimately allow us to prevail. We have the [ votes ].  We are incredibly excited.  
As you might imagine, the pandemic itself is an interesting catalyst. It is -- it shakes up the status quo to some extent. But in other respects, it also can arrest meetings that otherwise might have happened in working sessions and so forth with insurance carriers. But the underlying thesis is as strong as ever. Our results -- our auction results there continue to demonstrate a superior outcome relative to the status quo, which ultimately benefits the insurance carriers and benefits the policyholders as well because they don't have an owner-retained wrecked vehicle and ultimately, because this will drive insurance rates down as well."

Over time, it certainly could have that effect as well. As you know, the total of our noninsurance business is in the order of the 20% kind of range. So it won't. It -- we will still be largely driven by insurance changes for the next X quarters and years.

We used to measure our exports solely by a registration address, but it became apparent that there were a number of folks who simply register in the U.S. but actually have their principal operations outside and, therefore, are exporters by trade. 
And so that number, the more inclusive estimate for the share of our cars produced by non-U.S. buyers is circa 40% or thereabouts. It's an imperfect science.  There are international IP addresses that we know are for buyers who intend to export cars. There are international IP addresses that we know are not. They're literally for U.S. buyers who have outsourced or located their purchasing operations outside the U.S., and we purposely exclude them as well. 
So the output of that analysis is circa 40% of our units are purchased by those international buyers. Now I qualify that by saying that 90% plus of our cars are -- have their values affected by international buyers because they bid on many, many more cars still than they buy."

To your other question about miles driven, unfortunately, I think we see tons of data. So I think since November, we have tons of data. I'm not sure we have tons of incremental insight there beyond what you and others would cite as well in the EIA's data, Google, Apple, INRIX, et cetera. We study those same trends.

Like, for example, on the sell fee side, like if there are smaller dealers selling the vehicles, maybe they don't get the volume discounts that your customers are selling tens of thousands of vehicles do, making it even more profitable. 
And then just finally, I'm curious if there are certain parts of the whole car market that you're targeting now, such as dealers, but maybe there are other segments or categories of sellers that you've not gotten into yet, which might offer future growth opportunities."

As for the profitability or the mix thereof, the dealers are not the majority of, but a very important portion of our noninsurance business. Of course, that business is profitable to us. We won't comment on relative fees paid by our customers, in part, because the services we provide them also vary greatly as well. 
But it is a profitable business for us. It is important to us. It also -- as I noted in the prepared remarks, also helps us serve insurance customers better as well. They are all mutually supportive of one another because of the liquidity phenomenon. 
When we win that dealer car, it attracts still more buyers who have been on insurance cars and vice versa. And so as we total -- as we help insurance carriers total cars that are more and more marginal, from their point of view, that also attracts more buyers, which also, therefore, attracts more dealer cars as well as those other sources that you may have in mind."

We're pleased to report our record financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021.

We're pleased to report our record financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. I wanted to start first with -- by extending a thank you to our team in the field around the world and here at headquarters for their resilience and agility over the past 14 months for over a year now. We face the challenge of providing excellent service to our customers while keeping our people and communities safe. And I'm grateful and proud for our team for having delivered on both. We take very seriously our responsibility as an essential business in keeping our roads and support infrastructure clear for the movement of people and things. 
I'll start with some of the key statistics that we share each quarter, and I'll close with some remarks about the future before turning it over to John for a review of the financial results specifically. For the quarter, we experienced global unit sales increase of 3% for the quarter with a U.S. increase of 4.5% and an international decline of 5%. We have observed more pronounced shutdowns internationally in certain countries in which we operate, and they are likewise adopting more protracted reopening plans than we're experiencing here in the U.S. 
Our insurance business specifically, was slightly below the third quarter 2020 volumes, down approximately 3%, but effectively flat with 2019. This is the product of lower driving activity, of course, as driving activity remains suppressed relative to the norm. And also decreased claims frequency, offset by increases in total loss frequency and share gain. 
Our U.S. noninsurance business grew approximately 30% in unit volume year-over-year. This is also a reflection of strong used vehicle price -- a strong used vehicle price environment combined with our auction liquidity and sales efforts across noninsurance categories. 
Our dealer business, in particular, increased 26% in unit volume year-over-year, compared to what we believe were significant declines for other whole car auction platforms that serve dealers. This is a reflection of the flywheel effect we've talked about on earnings calls. Previously, our growing auction liquidity enables us to serve an expanding set of vehicles. And then those additional vehicles, of course, further enhance our liquidity as well. 
Our global inventory at the end of April increased 16% versus a year ago. That's comprised of a year-over-year increase of 21% for U.S. inventory and a decline of 13% for international inventory, a reflection of the dynamics described a moment ago. 
On average selling prices, our ASPs increased worldwide, 48% year-over-year for the quarter. Our ASP strength is a reflection of both of market dynamics as well as our own member recruitment, and member recruitment and retention efforts as we cultivate more buyers worldwide. We'll comment more on that in a moment as well. 
The ASP increase is not primarily due to mix shift effects. Our insurance ASPs in the U.S., for example, were up more than 50% year-over-year. And while growth in used car prices have, of course, contributed to our ASP growth, our selling price growth has far exceeded the overall used car price environment, reflection again of our marketing and member recruitment capabilities and our broad global reach to emerging economies who are increasing the buyers of vehicles from our markets. 
Our auction liquidity itself also continues to grow as we observed sequentially and year-over-year, more domestic and international bidders and bids per unit, a reflection of both of supply growth, of course, as well as our active cultivation of those buyers. 
The natural questions that we would all pose would be what the aftermath of the pandemic might be to our business. It's certainly challenging to separate signal from noise, given the abundance of confounding and extreme variables at the moment. My comments will largely be U.S.-centric, but will apply, by and large, to the rest of our markets as well. 
I thought I'd take a minute to talk about some of our long-term assumptions and how they may have been affected or not by the pandemic. First, on driving activity. It does appear to be rebounding, but certainly still suppressed relative to pre-pandemic levels, in particular with commuting traffic still down 25% to 30% or more based on sources like Google Maps, among others. Due to increasing vaccine availability, there is certainly line of sight to reopening more fully here in the U.S. and our other markets appear to be 3 to 6 months or thereabouts behind the reopening sequence of the U.S. 
Longer term, we continue to expect modest increases in per capita driving as we've observed over the past 50 years. Mobility remains essential for employment, education, health care, leisure and every other aspect of our existence. We do anticipate perhaps some increase in virtual work arrangements, but offset by a shift from various forms of other mass transit in favor of driving. 
Accident and claims frequency have declined during the pandemic, as you know, though, with increasing severity due to higher speed driving and increasing distracted driving. Long term, we expect a continuation of a decade-long trend to a very modest decline in accident frequency over time due to the gradual penetration of safety technologies and new car shipments, which then in turn, eventually make their way to the operating fleet. We do, however, expect an increasing severity over time as well as those safety technologies also become more expensive to repair as well. 
On the question of our average selling prices, I would note the longer-term trends in favor of higher ASPs. Certainly, there have been near-term pandemic effects. But over time, say, over 10-years plus, it has been demand from emerging economies for REC vehicles from our markets, from the U.S., from U.K., Canada, Germany, Spain, the Middle East and Finland and elsewhere, combined with our member cultivation efforts that have driven ASP growth over time. 
I'd acknowledge that we're seeing an unusual historic moment for used car valuations given the supply shortage for new cars. But we have experienced with the exception of the third quarter of last year, the very beginning of the pandemic, we've now experienced year-over-year increases in prices for 17 straight quarters. So we think that there are elements of the selling prices, certainly that will prove much more durable over time. 
Our operating and strategic decisions are predicated on the expectation of a volume recovery post pandemic, as well as long-term growth post pandemic, largely consistent thematically with what we've experienced over the past 4 years. We're grateful for our strong financial performance this quarter and excited to continue investing in our customers' future and our own. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John North."

And then we'll be happy to take a few questions this morning. 
Global revenue increased $184 million or 33%, including an $8 million benefit due to currency. Global service revenue increased $132 million or 27%, primarily due to higher ASPs. The U.S. service revenue grew 27% and international experienced an increase of 23%. 
Purchased vehicle sales increased $51 million or 87% due to higher ASPs and increased volumes. U.S. purchased vehicle revenue was up 103% over the prior year, and international grew by 64%. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profit, defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales, increased by almost $11 million overall. 
Global gross profit increased by $138 million or 57%, and our gross margin percentage improved by approximately 788 basis points to 52%. U.S. margins improved from 46% to 55%, and international margins increased from 32% to 37%. Both segments margin improvement was driven primarily by higher ASPs. 
Moving to G&A expenditures, excluding stock compensation and G&A and depreciation expense, our spend increased $2.2 million from $37 million a year ago to $39 million in 2021. We anticipate G&A will be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but will continue to improve as a percentage of revenue over time as we grow. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 68% from $195 million to $328 million, we delivered 926 basis points of operating margin improvement due to revenue growth from strong ASPs and controlling costs. 
Net interest expense decreased $0.2 million or 4% year-over-year, primarily due to lapping last year's decision to draw on our revolver in the initial days of the pandemic to ensure adequate liquidity. Q3 income tax expense was $36.7 million, an 11.4% effective tax rate, reflecting a $20 million tax benefit from the effect of certain discrete income tax items and a $5 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options, both of which have been adjusted out for purposes of the non-GAAP earnings included in our earnings release.  On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would have been 19%. 
In summary, GAAP net income increased 95% from $147 million last year to $267 million this year. Adjusted to remove the effects of currency and the tax benefits described above, non-GAAP net income increased $89.8 million from $138 million last year to $262 million in the third quarter of '21. For the first 9 months of fiscal '21, GAAP net income increased 27% from $534 million last year to $681 million this year, and non-GAAP net income increased 44% from $447 million last year to $642 million this year. 
Now to briefly highlight our liquidity and cash flow. As of April 30, we had $2 billion of liquidity comprised of $912 million of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with capacity of over $1 billion. This is an increase of $434 million over July 31, 2020. Operating cash flow for the quarter increased by $75 million year-over-year to $369 million, primarily driven by stronger earnings that were partially offset by working capital consumed by building consignment on inventory. 
We invested $81.2 million in capital expenditures for the quarter, approximately 95% of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion. This investment continues to ensure adequate capacity for additional business and creates a wider economic moat for defense to market entrants given the difficulty in sourcing appropriately zoned facilities. 
In conclusion, our conservative capital structure and strong durable cash flow enable us to continue to make decisions for the long-term interest of both our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, is the end of the prepared remarks. We're happy to take some questions."

So certainly for a given buyer, they would tap that at some point. 
I think the reason, however, that our international demand has grown so much is that that's not a static buyer. The number of countries and the population share of that country, which has access to an automobile and will want access to an automobile is what drives international demand over time. So it's that there are more countries with more of a desire for U.S., U.K., Canadian, Middle East used cars, that's what drives the growth over time, not a specific buyer per se. But there are more countries. 
And countries grow wealthier, as you well know, the U.S. and Western Europe have the richest economies and certainly, China, Japan and Asian countries as well. But in many -- in most cases, the wealthiest countries per capita have the most cars per capita, also have the slowest GDP growth rates as well. So the faster-growing economies with an appetite for vehicles that you and I and everyone on this call takes for granted, very much wants access to a vehicle for education, for employment, for health care, leisure, all the reasons we cited a moment ago.

Every quarter, year-over-year increases in ASPs. I think the total loss frequency dynamic is the most important driver of our business long term, and it naturally drives ASPs upward as insurance carriers find it more economically rational -- more economically favorable to total more cars over time. 
Those marginal cars are better and better vehicles, less damaged, they are ones with cameras and sensors taken out, not drivetrains. And those have a very wide-ranging set of buyers who want those vehicles. So I think there's a lot to our ASP growth over the years, which is secular. 
There certainly are cyclical factors. 5 years ago, we used to talk about scrap metal prices, which are obviously less relevant today. Today, we're talking about used car prices. Clearly relevant to us, but I think there are secular portions of this ASP growth, which will prove more durable. 
How exactly, I think, is -- what is exactly attributable to either, I think, is obviously a difficult intellectual exercise to isolate those variables."

We haven't seen a dramatic shift either. It's more a continuation of the many decade-long trend that I think you're well aware of, Ali, as well. 
If we were in 1980, at total loss frequency of 4%. Today, north of 20% -- total loss recency over 40 years has grown fivefold. I'd say, over the course of the past year, we've seen a continuation of that trend, not a dramatic shift. 
The reason for that is that, of course, the used car price environment has been strong as well. And as you know, the higher the value of the intact car before the accident, the more prone the carriers are to repair it. So we have had the offsetting effect of very strong salvage returns, which would otherwise, all else equal, drive more volume to total loss. 
We've also had increasing used car values themselves, which all else equal, would drive more cars to repair. The net effect of that, I think, is a gradual continuation of the favorable trend we've seen for 4 years."

So just wanted to get your sense of what might be happening with the value of your land, given that you've been out there in the marketplace so much in recent years, buying land. I would think that you would have a good sense of the value of your existing properties, too. So what is happening with the value of the land? And given that it doesn't get captured into the P&L., how are you thinking about -- or are you thinking about any actions to ensure that increased value gets reflected into the equity value of the company? 
I know you have historically preferred to be conservatively capitalized, but would you ever consider maybe like sale leasebacks to raise capital for shareholder-friendly actions?

We're pleased to report our record financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021.

We're pleased to report our record financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. I wanted to start first with -- by extending a thank you to our team in the field around the world and here at headquarters for their resilience and agility over the past 14 months. For over a year now, we faced the challenge of providing excellent service to our customers while keeping our people and communities safe. And I'm grateful and proud for our team for having delivered on both. We take very seriously our responsibility as an essential business in keeping our roads and support infrastructure clear for the movement of people and things.  
I'll start with some of the key statistics that we share each quarter, and I'll close with some remarks about the future before turning it over to John for a review of the financial results specifically. For the quarter, we experienced global unit sales increase of 3% for the quarter with a U.S. increase of 4.5% and an international decline of 5%. We have observed more pronounced shutdowns internationally in certain countries in which we operate, and they are likewise adopting more protracted reopening plans than we're experiencing here in the U.S.  
Our insurance business, specifically, was slightly below the third quarter 2020 volumes, down approximately 3%, but effectively flat with 2019. This is the product of lower driving activity, of course, as driving activity remains suppressed relative to the norm, and also decreased claims frequency, offset by increases in total loss frequency and share gain.  
Our U.S. noninsurance business grew approximately 30% in unit volume year-over-year. This is also a reflection of strong used vehicle price -- a strong used vehicle price environment combined with our auction liquidity and sales efforts across noninsurance categories.  
Our dealer business, in particular, increased 26% in unit volume year-over-year, compared to what we believe were significant declines for other whole car auction platforms that serve dealers. This is a reflection of the flywheel effect we've talked about on earnings calls. Previously, our growing auction liquidity enables us to serve an expanding set of vehicles. And then those additional vehicles, of course, further enhance our liquidity as well.  
Our global inventory at the end of April increased 16% versus a year ago. That's comprised of a year-over-year increase of 21% for U.S. inventory and a decline of 13% for international inventory, a reflection of the dynamics described a moment ago.  
On average selling prices, our ASPs increased worldwide, 48% year-over-year for the quarter. Our ASP strength is a reflection of both of market dynamics as well as our own member recruitment, and -- member recruitment and retention efforts as we cultivate more buyers worldwide. We'll comment more on that in a moment as well.  
The ASP increase is not primarily due to mix shift effects. Our insurance ASPs in the U.S., for example, were up more than 50% year-over-year. 
And while growth in used car prices have, of course, contributed to our ASP growth, our selling price growth has far exceeded the overall used car price environment, reflection, again, of our marketing and member recruitment capabilities and our broad global reach to emerging economies who are increasingly buyers of vehicles from our markets.  
Our auction liquidity itself also continues to grow as we observed sequentially and year-over-year, more domestic and international bidders and bids per unit, a reflection of both of supply growth, of course, as well as our active cultivation of those buyers.  
The natural questions that we would all pose would be what the aftermath of the pandemic might be to our business. It's certainly challenging to separate signal from noise given the abundance of confounding and extreme variables at the moment. My comments will largely be U.S.-centric, but will apply, by and large, to the rest of our markets as well.  
I thought I'd take a minute to talk about some of our long-term assumptions and how they may have been affected or not by the pandemic. 
First, on driving activity. It does appear to be rebounding, but certainly still suppressed relative to pre-pandemic levels, in particular with commuting traffic still down 25% to 30% or more based on sources like Google Maps, among others. Due to increasing vaccine availability, there is certainly line of sight to reopening more fully here in the U.S. and our other markets appear to be 3 to 6 months or thereabouts behind the reopening sequence of the U.S.  
Longer term, we continue to expect modest increases in per capita driving as we've observed over the past 50 years. Mobility remains essential for employment, education, health care, leisure and every other aspect of our existence. We do anticipate perhaps some increase in virtual work arrangements, but offset by a shift from various forms of other mass transit in favor of driving.  
Accident and claims frequency have declined during the pandemic, as you know, though, with increasing severity due to higher speed driving and increasing distracted driving. Long term, we expect a continuation of a decade-long trend to a very modest decline in accident frequency over time due to the gradual penetration of safety technologies and new car shipments, which then in turn, eventually make their way to the operating fleet. We do, however, expect an increasing severity over time as well as those safety technologies also become more expensive to repair as well.  
On the question of our average selling prices, I would note the longer-term trends in favor of higher ASPs. Certainly, there have been near-term pandemic effects. But over time, say, over 10-years plus, it has been demand from emerging economies for wrecked vehicles from our markets, from the U.S., from U.K., Canada, Germany, Spain, the Middle East and Finland and elsewhere, combined with our member cultivation efforts that have driven ASP growth over time.  
I'd acknowledge that we're seeing an unusual historic moment for used car valuations given the supply shortage for new cars. But we have experienced, with the exception of the third quarter of last year, the very beginning of the pandemic, we've now experienced year-over-year increases in prices for 17 straight quarters. So we think that there are elements of the selling prices, certainly that will prove much more durable over time.  
Our operating and strategic decisions are predicated on the expectation of a volume recovery post pandemic, as well as long-term growth post pandemic, largely consistent thematically with what we've experienced over the past 4 years. We're grateful for our strong financial performance this quarter and excited to continue investing in our customers' future and our own.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John North."

As we mentioned, I'll make a few brief comments on our results to provide a little more color on the earlier remarks. And then we'll be happy to take a few questions this morning.

And then we'll be happy to take a few questions this morning.  
Global revenue increased $184 million or 33%, including an $8 million benefit due to currency. Global service revenue increased $132 million or 27%, primarily due to higher ASPs. The U.S. service revenue grew 27% and international experienced an increase of 23%.  
Purchased vehicle sales increased $51 million or 87% due to higher ASPs and increased volumes. U.S. purchased vehicle revenue was up 103% over the prior year, and international grew by 64%. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profit, defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales, increased by almost $11 million overall.  
Global gross profit increased by $138 million or 57%, and our gross margin percentage improved by approximately 788 basis points to 52%. U.S. margins improved from 46% to 55%, and international margins increased from 32% to 37%. Both segment's margin improvement was driven primarily by higher ASPs.  
Moving to G&A expenditures, excluding stock compensation and G&A and depreciation expense, our spend increased $2.2 million from $37 million a year ago to $39 million in 2021. We anticipate G&A will be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but will continue to improve as a percentage of revenue over time as we grow. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 68% from $195 million to $328 million, we delivered 926 basis points of operating margin improvement due to revenue growth from strong ASPs and controlling costs.  
Net interest expense decreased $0.2 million or 4% year-over-year, primarily due to lapping last year's decision to draw on our revolver in the initial days of the pandemic to ensure adequate liquidity. Q3 income tax expense was $36.7 million at an 11.4% effective tax rate, reflecting a $20 million tax benefit from the effect of certain discrete income tax items and a $5 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options, both of which have been adjusted out for purposes of the non-GAAP earnings included in our earnings release.  On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would have been 19%.  
In summary, GAAP net income increased 95% from $147 million last year to $267 million this year. Adjusted to remove the effects of currency and the tax benefits described above, non-GAAP net income increased $89.8 million from $138 million last year to $262 million in the third quarter of '21. For the first 9 months of fiscal '21, GAAP net income increased 27% from $534 million last year to $681 million this year, and non-GAAP net income increased 44% from $447 million last year to $642 million this year.  
Now to briefly highlight our liquidity and cash flow. As of April 30, we had $2 billion of liquidity comprised of $912 million of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with capacity of over $1 billion. This is an increase of $434 million over July 31, 2020. Operating cash flow for the quarter increased by $75 million year-over-year to $369 million, primarily driven by stronger earnings that were partially offset by working capital consumed by building consignment on inventory. 
We invested $81.2 million in capital expenditures for the quarter, approximately 95% of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion. This investment continues to ensure adequate capacity for additional business and creates a wider economic moat for defense to market entrants given the difficulty in sourcing appropriately zoned facilities.  
In conclusion, our conservative capital structure and strong durable cash flow enable us to continue to make decisions for the long-term interest of both our customers and our shareholders.  
And with that is the end of the prepared remarks. We're happy to take some questions."

So certainly for a given buyer, they would tap out at some point. 
I think the reason, however, that our international demand has grown so much is that, that's not a static buyer. The number of countries and the population share of that country, which has access to an automobile and will want access to an automobile is what drives international demand over time. So it's that there are more countries with more of a desire for U.S., U.K., Canadian, Middle East used cars, that's what drives the growth over time, not a specific buyer per se. But there are more countries. 
And countries grow wealthier, as you well know, the U.S. and Western Europe have the richest economies and certainly, China, Japan and Asian countries as well. But in many -- in most cases, the wealthiest countries per capita have the most cars per capita, also have the slowest GDP growth rates as well. So the faster-growing economies with an appetite for vehicles that you and I and everyone on this call takes for granted, very much wants access to a vehicle for education, for employment, for health care, leisure, all the reasons we cited a moment ago.

Every quarter, year-over-year increases in ASPs. I think the total loss frequency dynamic is the most important driver of our business long term, and it naturally drives ASPs upward as insurance carriers find it more economically rational -- more economically favorable to total more cars over time. Those marginal cars are better and better vehicles, less damaged. They are ones with cameras and sensors taken out, not drivetrains. And those have a very wide-ranging set of buyers who want those vehicles. So I think there's a lot to our ASP growth over the years, which is secular. There certainly are cyclical factors.
5 years ago, we used to talk about scrap metal prices, which are obviously less relevant today. Today, we're talking about used car prices. Clearly relevant to us, but I think there are secular portions of this ASP growth, which will prove more durable. How exactly, I think, is -- what is exactly attributable to either, I think, is obviously a difficult intellectual exercise to isolate those variables."

We haven't seen a dramatic shift either. It's more a continuation of the many decade-long trend that I think you're well aware of, Ali, as well. 
If we were in 1980, at total loss frequency of 4%; today, north of 20% -- total loss recency over 40 years has grown fivefold. I'd say, over the course of the past year, we've seen a continuation of that trend, not a dramatic shift. 
The reason for that is that, of course, the used car price environment has been strong as well. And as you know, the higher the value of the intact car before the accident, the more prone the carriers are to repair it. So we have had the offsetting effect of very strong salvage returns, which would otherwise, all else equal, drive more volume to total loss. We've also had increasing used car values themselves, which all else equal, would drive more cars to repair. The net effect of that, I think, is a gradual continuation of the favorable trend we've seen for 4 years."

So I've been seeing these headlines about how the average price of a home has risen by an incredible, like 16.2% year-over-year in April. And haven't really seen or done much research into what the price of, say, undeveloped land or land generally has done. But I've seen some other articles recently about big increases in the value of farmland, et cetera. 
So just wanted to get your sense of what might be happening with the value of your land, given that you've been out there in the marketplace so much in recent years, buying land, I would think that you would have a good sense of the value of your existing properties, too. So what is happening with the value of the land? 
And given that it doesn't get captured into the P&L., how are you thinking about -- or are you thinking about any actions to ensure that increased value gets reflected into the equity value of the company? I know you have historically preferred to be conservatively capitalized. But would you ever consider maybe like sale leasebacks to raise capital for shareholder-friendly actions? Or any other kind of actions to try to tap into the value of that land? Or even just put some estimates out there for shareholders to see so that they could better appreciate any increase in the value that you might have captured here?"

And that we own the land, we control it, we are the stewards of that facility, that capacity on behalf of the insurance industry for the next 50 years-plus. So that, to me, is overwhelmingly the default approach that we would take. 
As to your question, your IR question more narrowly about how to ensure that, that value is reflected in our stock price, I think to some extent, that's academic for us. We own it. We use it. We have virtually never repurposed land that have been permitted for Copart use in part because it's so hard to achieve that. We don't repurpose it for other uses. We will -- we are there today and tomorrow to serve the insurance carriers and to serve our expanding noninsurance sellers as well. 
So I think -- unfortunately, I think the intention, I know your question is good, but the outcome is effectively academic for us. That land is there to serve our customers."

It is against that backdrop that we continued to grow that dealer business, healthy double-digit rates for years now. So I think that speaks to the power of auction liquidity as well.

With money, I'm not sure you can replicate auction liquidity and many thousands of bidders and buyers attending online auctions globally, right?

Perhaps didn't have collision, didn't want to fund the money to repair the car himself or herself, ended up at a dealer, sold for cash and traded in for another car.

So in many cases, they total more easily. But the returns we generate at auction are some of the highest that we achieved for any kinds of vehicles we sell. So I think the total loss proposition is promising there. I think repairs are difficult, so severity tends to be high. Our repair infrastructure, the handful of public companies, you know, as well as the extensive mom-and-pop network around the U.S. The insurance carriers rely on, the U.S., U.K., Canada, everywhere, that the insurance carriers rely on, in most cases, are well equipped to manage repairs of combustion engine vehicles, not yet so for electric cars.

We're pleased with the results for the year, another record-setting quarter on multiple dimensions. We look forward to discussing some of the underlying factors in the business with you as well. 
The big news, of course, since we last spoke with you in May, has been the emergence of the Delta variant of COVID-19. Nevertheless, we've seen ongoing recovery across the industry, including key measures such as vehicle miles traveled published by the Department of Transportation, gasoline consumption and the like. So we're beginning to see the return to normal driving activity, accident volumes, et cetera though we note it's still likely down on an apples-to-apples basis versus 2 years ago. 
Given the growth in our business, nonetheless, our inventory levels, we'll talk about in a bit, are up meaningfully year-over-year and up double digits versus July 2019 as well. And due to several drivers, we'll discuss later on the call as well, our average selling prices, the value we generate for our customers remain elevated and are in fact at all-time highs. 
Before we dig in, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the Copart cat team, which has had an active and productive few weeks, certainly. As many have projected over the years, we're seeing more severe weather events with each passing year and just recently have observed flooding and other severe weather in Germany, in Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and now, of course, Hurricane Ida in the Northeastern United States. 
We're wishing all of those affected in those communities, including our employees, our own team members the very best in a speedy recovery. Hundreds of us, myself included, who were in the Northeast over the weekend and we have still more Copart team members headed there leading the charge from here forward. 
We'll discuss the financial implications of these events -- of these recent weather events in future quarters, but the first order of business, as always, is to serve our customers and to take care of our own people. I wanted to start with a couple of statistics that we provide every quarter and close with a handful of remarks about the future as well. 
Our global unit sales for the quarter increased 25% year-over-year with a U.S. increase of 26% and an international increase of 18.5% year-over-year. We continue to see more aggressive COVID-19 measures in many of our international markets than we have here in the U.S., which has caused more of a volume reduction or less volume growth in those markets. 
Within the U.S., our insurance business grew significantly year-over-year versus the fourth quarter of 2020. That is the net effect of lower driving activity -- well, increased driving activity year-over-year, still slightly lower driving activity, but on a 2-year basis, but increasing claims frequency and increasing to loss frequency as well. 
Our noninsurance business, which we talk about each quarter includes dealer consignments, wholesales and charities business, our Cohort Direct business in which we buy cars from consumers and institutional volume as well. We've historically provided the unit growth, in particular, excluding wholesalers and charities. And on that basis, our U.S. noninsurance business grew 17% year-over-year, including solid growth for our dealer consignment business despite inventory shortages, of course, throughout the automotive industry. 
Our strong used car prices or used vehicle prices are driving strong returns and therefore, consignment growth across these noninsurance categories. Our global inventory at the end of July increased 21.7% compared to a year ago and double-digit growth on a 2-year basis as well. That's comprised of a year-over-year increase of 28% for U.S. inventory and a decline of 13% for international inventory attributable to the COVID-19 measures I described a few moments ago. 
We are especially proud of the record average selling prices that we're delivering for our customers. The ASP strength is a reflection in part, of course, of market dynamics for used vehicles, but it's also a byproduct of our member recruitment and retention efforts. ASP's worldwide grew 20.7% for the quarter with U.S. fees -- U.S. ASPs up 20.6%. 
The question we often get is how much of that is attributable to mix shift and it's not. So our insurance ASPs are up comparable levels or even up more still than that. While growth in used car prices have, of course, contributed to our ASP growth, our selling prices throughout the pandemic and prior to it as well, has generally grown at a rate in excess of that of used car prices as well. That being a reflection of the marketing and member recruitment efforts I mentioned a moment ago. 
The Manheim Index, which is one of those third-party indices we do track is at 194.5 for the month of August, an increase of 18.8% year-over-year. We track other indices as well, which would provide similar directional guidance. Our average selling prices are certainly the ultimate output metric for auction liquidity, but the underlying figures that support that notion, the notion of the flywheel effects certainly continue as well. 
In the fourth quarter, we noted more bids per unit, more domestic bids per unit, more international bids per unit, all compared to a year ago. Our auction liquidity is stronger than it has ever been. The natural questions, of course, will continue to be about what happens after the pandemic after the pandemic goes away.  We certainly hold an appropriate level of humility given the once-in-a-lifetime nature of the event and our comments will largely be U.S.-centric. 
But I think it's worth revisiting some of these longer-term assumptions we've talked about on prior calls and how they've been affected by the pandemic. Driving activity certainly is rebounding by the measures we have seen gasoline consumption and vehicle miles traveled but not yet back to 2019 levels. We continue to believe that longer term, mobility will continue to grow at miles per person in the U.S., but certainly in our emerging markets in many of the countries they're buying our highest value vehicles will grow significantly. 
The -- we saw accidents and claims frequency declined somewhat during the pandemic, but it actually increased relative to miles driven. That is a new learning for us in the pandemic to see. I think the historical conventional wisdom has always been that if there are fewer vehicle miles traveled, that accident frequency per miles traveled will decrease. But in effect or in actual practice, we've seen arguably more distracted driving certainly higher speed driving and therefore, accident frequency can, in some respects, be inversely related to vehicle miles traveled -- accident frequency per miles driven. 
On total loss frequency, the most important driver of our business long term that we've talked about at length in the past. We've seen that increase during the pandemic as well, and I wanted to offer 1 addendum to that in a moment. On the durability of ASPs, we note the longer-term trends in favor of ASPs. We continue to see increasing demand from emerging economies for the rec vehicles from the U.S., U.K., Canada, other mature economies. These emerging economies are especially eager to purchase our vehicles, which are rect and total vehicles become their drivable fleet. That trend has been a 30-, 40-year trend that we think will be so for the foreseeable future. 
I wanted to know 1 important consideration that I think can be easily overlooked. The natural questions are about when the selling prices -- when the selling prices could face weakness in light of an eventual recovery in semiconductors and new cars and the like. What I think is sometimes misunderstood is that all else equal, high ACVs or high preaccident values actually reduce total loss frequency. The higher -- the more a car is worth before it all else equal, the more prone it is to be repaired. And so eventually, certainly, if there is a decline in ASPs or a decline in vehicle values, the offsetting consideration is that we would see higher total loss frequency and therefore, higher consignment volume. 
We continue to make our operating and strategic decisions predicated on the expectation of long-term growth post pandemic, consistent certainly with what we've communicated over the years. We're grateful for the strong financial performance this quarter against the backdrop of a pandemic and now severe weather events all over the world. It can feel awkward to sell with a congratulatory tone on the call. But nonetheless, we're certainly pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, excited about the year ahead. Our business is stronger than it has ever been, the quality of our team, the sophistication of our technology stack and the depth of our auction liquidity, we think, is yielding better results than ever for our customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to our CFO, John North."

Global gross profit in the fourth quarter increased by $107.1 million or 43%, and our gross margin percentage increased by approximately 11 basis points to 48%. 
U.S. margins improved from 50% to 51%, driven primarily by higher ASPs and international margins decreased from 34% to 30% due to a higher purchased vehicle mix at lower margins, partially offset by higher ASPs and cost leverage. 
I'll now move to a discussion of G&A expenditures, excluding stock compensation and depreciation expense. G&A spend increased $5 million from $34.6 million a year ago to $39.7 million in 2021, but decreased from 6.6% of revenue to 5.3% of revenue this year, an improvement of 130 basis points. 
We anticipate G&A to continue to improve as a percentage of revenue in future years. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 47% from $205.7 million to $301.5 million. We delivered 114 basis points of operating margin improvement due to revenue growth from strong ASPs and leveraging volume. 
Net interest expense increased $0.2 million or 5% year-over-year, primarily due to our upsize of revolving credit facility, which we upsized in July of last year. Q4 income tax expense was $43.1 million at a 14.4% effective tax rate reflecting an $11 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options, which have been adjusted for purposes of the non-GAAP earnings included in our release. 
On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would have been 17.6% and our full year rate would have been a normalized 20.8%. Fourth quarter GAAP net income increased 55% from $165.5 million last year to $256 million this year. Adjusted to remove the effects of currency, acquisition-related costs and the tax benefit on the exercise stock options. Non-GAAP net income increased 51% from $163.4 million last year to $247.3 million in the fourth quarter of this year. 
For the fiscal year '21 on a quarter basis, global revenue increased $486.9 million or 22% including a $31.6 million benefit due to currency. Global gross profit increased $335.3 million or 33%, and our gross margin percentage increased by 419 basis points to 50%. Operating income increased 39% to $320.3 million and operating margin improved by 521 basis points. 
Finally, GAAP net income increased 33% -- 34%, excuse me from $699.9 million last year to $936.5 million this year and non-GAAP net income increased 45.7% from $610.5 million last year to $889.7 million this year. 
Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow highlights as of July 31, 2021. We had $2.1 billion of liquidity comprised of over $1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with a capacity of over $1 billion. This is an increase of $570.5 million over July 31 of last year. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter decreased by $38.2 million year-over-year to $228.7 million, primarily driven by working capital investments as we increased inventory levels, which Jeff spoke about a few moments ago. We invested $98.6 million in capital expenditures for the quarter and approximately 76% of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion. For the year, we invested $463 million in CapEx of which approximately 85% was associated with capacity expansion. 
We continue to prioritize investing in physical infrastructure above other choices and believe this continued investment is creating a durable advantage in our ability to handle increasing numbers of total loss vehicles and adjacent opportunities in the whole car marketplace. 
We continue our relentless focus on investing for the future in both capacity and technology while maintaining a conservative capital structure that allows operational flexibility regardless of economic changes or transitory market dynamics. And that will conclude our prepared remarks this morning, and we're happy to open it up for some questions."

So I wanted to start, obviously, really, really strong sales growth. And you talked about inventory a little bit, too.

Is that all inventory build? And is that kind of -- is inventory seasonally building at this point? Or are there other factors behind it?

On driving activity, we look to the same few might, which is the DOT data, the gas consumption data.

That's been true forever, as you know.  That, therefore, has cultivated a different buyer base, different member base who's looking for a drivable car and that, in turn, that liquidity has benefited us on the dealer side. That trend certainly continues. 
And I think if you visited some of our yards, you'd be astonished by some of the high-value Range Rovers and European vehicles that you would see on the lots that at least on their surface, look perfectly good and perfectly functional, in many cases are.

The significant catastrophic activity had largely occurred after the quarter. So in the United States, in particular, we did experience some flooding in the U.S. and in Germany prior compared to catastrophic events of in the past, these events were relatively modest in absolute size. 
In terms of catastrophic readiness, I think you posed the question, we have invested massively in this anticipating more severe weather over the years to come. In a catastrophe, the key questions are, do we have the technology to support the suddenly accelerated volume of activity? The answer is yes, and we are continuing to invest behind it. Do we have the land to store the vehicles until we can process the titles and sell them on behalf of our insurance company clients? The answer to that is yes. We have bought and built catastrophic yards that, in many cases, run idle, simply awaiting a catastrophic event to service our customers again. 
We certainly depending on where the cat event might be also then lease land on a temporary basis as well to expand our capacity. And then towing and trucking is certainly an important variable as well. We pick up, of course, millions of cars a year on behalf of our customers and have, again, a more acute need in the middle of a catastrophe. We have, therefore, invested in a fairly sizable fleet of our own, which we expect to continue to invest in as well to support those efforts. So these are folks day-to-day who are deployed in their home yards, but in a crisis are asked to join us on the ground where the need is most acute. So those are all ways for us to address the -- to be more ready in anticipation of the weather events rather than scrambling last minute. Those have been investments that we've made very consistently and continue to grow year after year."

And certainly, the challenge of land acquisition and development is universal. It varies and it certainly varies by degrees, even here in the United States, depending on what which city and state we're talking about, it then varies across countries as well and within those countries as well. 
So it's difficult to provide a thoughtful nuance answer there. But yes, the challenges are similar. We do have the capacity we need to support the business we have, and we have built for growth. But certainly, we would expect to invest more over the years to come to support our ongoing growth there. 
There is lead time to do so. So you've heard us tell the stories here in the U.S. in the past, in which we would buy a parcel of land in California, for example, that we've been pursuing for 20 years. We don't expect that severe lead time in these markets, but it does take time to identify to permit and to develop the land before we can operate on it."

We're comfortable we can manage that inflation and continue to deliver operating leverage in our business. So in short, tolling costs are a significant portion of our our cost at the yard level. So they certainly do matter to us.

So the latter 2, I would describe as durable long-term secular forces. The first, I think, is an open question. I think that all 3 have mattered a lot over the course of the past year. The first question on to what extent the vehicle values are cyclical or reflections of more secular structural forces, I think, is a fair question. I don't know that we have, and especially in light of the respective on that. I think some of it, for sure, is here to stay.

As for the distribution of driving hours, I think we've seen a change both in when people drive and where they drive to. So less commuting, much more retail, much more recreation that they, in some cases, as folks have avoided airlines and such. Now the -- that has frankly yielded in the end, higher accident frequency than I think has been predicted going into the pandemic. If you told folks that vehicle miles traveled would go down by X percent, I think the commentinal wisdom is at accidents, the number of accidents and the absolute would go down by more than X percent. And in fact, it has gone down by significantly less than x percent a reflection of higher speed driving, more distracted driving and the like.

The issue with a forward prognosis is this is a dynamic question. It's a reflection of what we see in volume growth, share gain, growth of our noninsurance business, cycle times, et cetera.

During today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which include adjustments to reverse the effect of certain discrete income tax items, acquisition-related integration charges, foreign currency-related gains and losses, certain income tax benefits and payroll taxes related to accounting for stock option exercises.
We provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our Investor Relations website and in our press release issued yesterday. We believe these non-GAAP measures, together with our corresponding GAAP measures, are relevant in analyzing our results and assessing our business trends and performance.
In addition, our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including management's current views with respect to trends, opportunities and uncertainties in our markets, including the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
For more detail on the risks associated with our business, we refer you to the section titled Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2020, and each of our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we have no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
So now that we've got the safe harbor language out of the way, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Liaw, President."

We're pleased with the results for the year, another record-setting quarter on multiple dimensions. We look forward to discussing some",1485,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for a review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021. We're pleased with the results for the year, another record-setting quarter on multiple dimensions. We look forward to discussing some of the underlying factors in the business with you as well.
The big news, of course, since we last spoke with you in May, has been the emergence of the Delta variant of COVID-19. Nevertheless, we've seen ongoing recovery across the industry, including key measures such as vehicle miles traveled published by the Department of Transportation, gasoline consumption and the like. So we're beginning to see the return to normal driving activity, accident volumes, et cetera, though we note it's still likely down on an apples-to-apples basis versus 2 years ago.
Given the growth in our business, nonetheless, our inventory levels, we'll talk about in a bit, are up meaningfully year-over-year and up double digits versus July 2019 as well. And due to several drivers, we'll discuss later on the call as well, our average selling prices, the values we generate for our customers remain elevated and are in fact at all-time highs.
Before we dig in, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the Copart team, which has had an active and productive few weeks, certainly. As many have projected over the years, we're seeing more severe weather events with each passing year and just recently have observed flooding and other severe weather in Germany, in Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and now, of course, Hurricane Ida in the Northeastern United States.
We're wishing all of those affected in those communities, including our employees, our own team members the very best in a speedy recovery. Hundreds of us, myself included, who were in the Northeast over the weekend and we have still more Copart team members headed there leading the charge from here forward.
We'll discuss the financial implications of these events -- of these recent weather events in future quarters, but the first order of business, as always, is to serve our customers and to take care of our own people. I wanted to start with a couple of statistics that we provide every quarter and close with a handful of remarks about the future as well.
Our global unit sales for the quarter increased 25% year-over-year with a U.S. increase of 26% and an international increase of 18.5% year-over-year. We continued to see more aggressive COVID-19 measures in many of our international markets than we had here in the U.S., which has caused more of a volume reduction or less volume growth in those markets.
Within the U.S., our insurance business grew significantly year-over-year versus the fourth quarter of 2020. That is the net effect of lower driving activity -- well, increased driving activity year-over-year, still slightly lower driving activity on a 2-year basis, but increasing claims frequency and increasing total loss frequency as well.
Our noninsurance business, which we talk about each quarter, includes dealer consignments, wholesales and charities business, our Copart Direct business in which we buy cars from consumers and institutional volume as well. We've historically provided the unit growth, in particular, excluding wholesalers and charities. And on that basis, our U.S. noninsurance business grew 17% year-over-year, including solid growth for our dealer consignment business despite inventory shortages, of course, throughout the automotive industry.
Our strong used car prices or used vehicle prices are driving strong returns and therefore, consignment growth across these noninsurance categories. Our global inventory at the end of July increased 21.7% compared to a year ago and double-digit growth on a 2-year basis as well. That's comprised of a year-over-year increase of 28% for U.S. inventory and a decline of 13% for international inventory attributable to the COVID-19 measures I described a few moments ago.
We are especially proud of the record average selling prices that we're delivering for our customers. The ASP strength is a reflection in part, of course, of market dynamics for used vehicles, but it's also a byproduct of our member recruitment and retention efforts. ASPs worldwide grew 20.7% for the quarter with USPs -- U.S. ASPs up 20.6%.
The question we often get is how much of that is attributable to mixed shift and it's not. So our insurance ASPs are up, comparable levels are even up more still than that. While growth in used car prices have, of course, contributed to our ASP growth, our selling prices throughout the pandemic and prior to it as well have generally grown at a rate in excess of that of used car prices as well. That being a reflection of the marketing and member recruitment efforts I mentioned a moment ago.
The Manheim Index, which is one of those third-party indices we do track, is at 194.5 for the month of August, an increase of 18.8% year-over-year. We track other indices as well, which would provide similar directional guidance.
Our average selling prices are certainly the ultimate output metric for auction liquidity, but the underlying figures that support that notion, the notion of the flywheel effects, certainly continue as well. In the fourth quarter, we noted more bids per unit, more domestic bids per unit, more international bids per unit, all compared to a year ago. Our auction liquidity is stronger than it has ever been.
The natural questions, of course, will continue to be about what happens after the pandemic goes away. I think we certainly hold an appropriate level of humility given the once-in-a-lifetime nature of the event and our comments will largely be U.S.-centric. But I think it's worth revisiting some of these longer term assumptions we've talked about on prior calls and how they've been affected by the pandemic.
Driving activity certainly is rebounding by the measures we have seen, gasoline consumption and vehicle miles traveled, but not yet back to 2019 levels. We continue to believe that longer term, mobility will continue to grow at miles per person in the U.S., but certainly in our emerging markets, in many of the countries they're buying our highest value vehicles, will grow significantly.
The -- we saw accidents and claims frequency decline somewhat during the pandemic, but it actually increased relative to miles driven. That is a new learning for us in the pandemic to see. I think the historical -- conventional wisdom has always been that if there are fewer vehicle miles traveled, that accident frequency per miles traveled will decrease. But in effect or in actual practice, we've seen arguably more distracted driving, certainly higher speed driving and therefore, accident frequency can, in some respects, be inversely related to vehicle miles traveled -- accident frequency per miles driven.
On total loss frequency, the most important driver of our business long term that we've talked about at length in the past, we've seen that increase during the pandemic as well. And I wanted to offer 1 addendum to that in a moment. On the durability of ASPs, we note the longer term trends in favor of ASPs. We continue to see increasing demand from emerging economies for the wrecked vehicles from the U.S., U.K., Canada, other mature economies. These emerging economies are especially eager to purchase our vehicles, which -- our wrecked and totaled vehicles become their drivable fleet. That trend has been a 30-, 40-year trend that we think will be so for the foreseeable future.
I wanted to know 1 important consideration that I think can be easily overlooked. The natural questions are about when the selling prices could face weakness in light of an eventual recovery in semiconductors and new cars and the like. What I think is sometimes misunderstood is that all else equal, high ACVs or high pre-accident values actually reduce total loss frequency. The higher -- the more a car is worth before the accident, all else equal, the more prone it is to be repaired. And so eventually, certainly, if there is a decline in ASPs or a decline in vehicle values, the offsetting consideration is that we would see higher total loss frequency and therefore, higher consignment volume.
We continue to make our operating and strategic decisions predicated on the expectation of long-term growth post pandemic, consistent certainly with what we've communicated over the years. We're grateful for the strong financial performance this quarter against the backdrop of a pandemic and now severe weather events all over the world. It can feel awkward to sound with a congratulatory tone on the call.
But nonetheless, we're certainly pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, excited about the year ahead. Our business is stronger than it has ever been. The quality of our team, the sophistication of our technology stack and the depth of our auction liquidity, we think, is yielding better results than ever for our customers.
With that, let me turn it over to our CFO, John North."

I'll make a few comments on more of our operational results, and then we can open up some questions. For the fourth quarter, global revenue increased $223 million, or 42%, including a $12 million benefit due to currency. Global service revenue increased $162.4 million, or 36%, primarily due to higher average selling prices. U.S. service revenue grew 36% and international experienced an increase of 29%.
Purchased vehicle sales increased $60.6 million, or 89%, due to higher ASPs and increased volumes. U.S. purchased vehicle revenue was up 99% over the prior year, and international grew 73%. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profit, defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales, increased by $1.6 million overall.
Global gross profit in the fourth quarter increased by $107.1 million or 43%, and our gross margin percentage increased by approximately 11 basis points to 48%. U.S. margins improved from 50% to 51%, driven primarily by higher ASPs, and international margins decreased from 34% to 30% due to a higher purchased vehicle mix at lower margins, partially offset by higher ASPs and cost leverage.
I'll now move to a discussion of G&A expenditures, excluding stock compensation and depreciation expense. G&A spend increased $5 million from $34.6 million a year ago to $39.7 million in 2021, but decreased from 6.6% of revenue to 5.3% of revenue this year, an improvement of 130 basis points. We anticipate G&A to continue to improve as a percentage of revenue in future years.
As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 47% from $205.7 million to $301.5 million. We delivered 114 basis points of operating margin improvement due to revenue growth from strong ASPs and leveraging volume.
Net interest expense increased $0.2 million, or 5%, year-over-year, primarily due to our upsized revolving credit facility, which we upsized in July of last year. Q4 income tax expense was $43.1 million at a 14.4% effective tax rate, reflecting an $11 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options, which have been adjusted for purposes of the non-GAAP earnings included in our release. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate would have been 17.6% and our full year rate would have been a normalized 20.8%.
Fourth quarter GAAP net income increased 55% from $165.5 million last year to $256 million this year. Adjusted to remove the effects of currency, acquisition-related costs and the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options, non-GAAP net income increased 51% from $163.4 million last year to $247.3 million in the fourth quarter of this year.
For the fiscal year '21, on a full year basis, global revenue increased $486.9 million, or 22%, including a $31.6 million benefit due to currency. Global gross profit increased $335.3 million, or 33%, and our gross margin percentage increased by 419 basis points to 50%. Operating income increased 39% to $320.3 million and operating margin improved by 521 basis points.
Finally, GAAP net income increased 33% -- 34%, excuse me, from $699.9 million last year to $936.5 million this year. And non-GAAP net income increased 45.7% from $610.5 million last year to $889.7 million this year.
Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow highlights as of July 31, 2021. We had $2.1 billion of liquidity comprised of over $1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with a capacity of over $1 billion. This is an increase of $570.5 million over July 31 of last year. Operating cash flow for the quarter decreased by $38.2 million year-over-year to $228.7 million, primarily driven by working capital investments as we increased inventory levels, which Jeff spoke about a few moments ago.
We invested $98.6 million in capital expenditures for the quarter and approximately 76% of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion. For the year, we invested $463 million in CapEx of which approximately 85% was associated with capacity expansion. We continue to prioritize investing in physical infrastructure above other choices and believe this continued investment is creating a durable advantage in our ability to handle increasing numbers of total loss vehicles and adjacent opportunities in the whole car marketplace.
We continue our relentless focus on investing for the future in both capacity and technology while maintaining a conservative capital structure that allows operational flexibility regardless of economic changes or transitory market dynamics. And that will conclude our prepared remarks this morning, and we're happy to open it up for some questions."

The fourth quarter is usually a quarter in which we are liberating inventory and preparing for the seasons ahead.

So I think that the forecast is, I don't know that we would have a more insightful perspective about the unwinding of COVID-19 that others might.
On driving activity, we look to the same metrics you might, which is the DOT data, the gas consumption data. We have certainly information from our insurance company clients as well, which would suggest huge growth versus the fourth quarter of last year but not yet back to fourth quarter 2019 levels.

That, therefore, has cultivated a different buyer base, different member base who's looking for a drivable car and that, in turn, that liquidity has benefited us on the dealer side.
That trend certainly continues. And I think if you visited some of our yards, you'd be astonished by some of the high-value Range Rovers and European vehicles that you would see on the lots that, at least on their surface, look perfectly good and perfectly functional, in many cases are.

So in the United States, in particular, we did experience some flooding in the U.S. and in Germany prior. Compared to catastrophic events of -- in the past, these events were relatively modest in absolute size.
In terms of catastrophic readiness, I think you posed the question, Stephanie, we have invested massively in this anticipating more severe weather over the years to come. In a catastrophe, the key questions are, do we have the technology to support the suddenly accelerated volumes of activity? The answer is yes, and we are continuing to invest behind it. Do we have the land to store the vehicles until we can process the titles and sell them on behalf of our insurance company clients? The answer to that is yes. We have bought and built catastrophic yards that, in many cases, run idle, simply awaiting a catastrophic event to service our customers again.
We certainly, depending on where the cat event might be, also then lease land on a temporary basis as well to expand our capacity. And then towing and trucking is certainly an important variable as well. We pick up, of course, millions of cars a year on behalf of our customers and have, again, a more acute need in the middle of a catastrophe. We have, therefore, invested in a fairly sizable fleet of our own, which we expect to continue to invest in as well to support those efforts. So these are folks day-to-day who are deployed in their home yards, but in a crisis are asked to join us on the ground where the need is most acute.
So those are all ways for us to address the -- to be more ready in anticipation of the weather events rather than scrambling last minute. Those have been investments that we've made very consistently and continue to grow year after year."

So it's difficult to provide a thoughtful nuance answer there. But yes, the challenges are similar. We do have the capacity in Germany to support the business we have, and we have built for growth. But certainly, we would expect to invest more over the years to come to support our ongoing growth there.
There is lead time to do so. So you've heard us tell the stories here in the U.S. in the past, in which we would buy a parcel of land in California, for example, that we've been pursuing for 20 years.

As for the distribution of driving hours, I think we've seen a change both in when people drive and where they drive to. So less commuting, much more retail, much more recreation that they, in some cases, as folks have avoided airlines and such. Now the -- that has frankly yielded, in the end, higher accident frequency than I think had been predicted going into the pandemic.
If you told folks that vehicle miles traveled would go down by X percent, I think the conventional wisdom is that accidents -- the number of accidents and the absolute would go down by more than X percent.

And this is -- the logic is a little bit circular, but it is the growth -- the quality of our cars, the vehicles that we earn the right to sell from dealers then brings additional members on board. The increasing total loss frequency brings more members on board. The increasing members who are on board then brings more consignments from dealers and insurance companies. So it certainly is circular. So it very much works in both directions.
In terms of the actual active measures we take on member recruitment, it very much varies by country, by market, by type of buyer. It can include things as mundane as the trade show attendance, physical media, certainly social media and the like, but it -- radio ads, et cetera, it's all over the map, and we try to have a sophisticated market-specific approach to each of our major member buying countries.
It's also a major to do of ours to anticipate the next country which has the characteristics of one that should be a major Copart buyer and to invest proactively in that. And then once they're in the funnel, it's -- we view the member experience is paramount as well, not just the registration and becoming eligible to bid and participate at Copart auctions, but really the lifetime journey with Copart, what it means to buy a car, pay for it, pick it up and so on and so forth.

Now every catastrophic event is unique. In the East Coast, it's very different from Louisiana, which is in turn very different from Houston, Texas, which is certainly in turn different from Germany as well.
So it's a matter of investing proactively. It's partially a question of cost because it allows us to clip the extremes of the supply curve. But it's largely about service too. The reason we own trucks and land and have a catastrophic team already assigned here at Copart who is ready to deploy at a moment's notice, that's as much about customer service as it is about cost. But yes, all else equal, the margin effects would be more muted today than they otherwise would have been, but the priority really is providing excellent service to our customers."

Good morning and thanks for joining us for the first quarter. We're pleased to report a strong first quarter for fiscal 2022 against the backdrop of various extremes, a persistent and evolving pandemic, changing global traffic pat",1400,"Excellent. Thanks, John. Good morning and thanks for joining us for the first quarter. We're pleased to report a strong first quarter for fiscal 2022 against the backdrop of various extremes, a persistent and evolving pandemic, changing global traffic patterns, supply chain disruptions, a strong used car price environment and an active storm season, to name a few. We continue to serve our customers successfully to enhance auction liquidity and to continue our long-term trend of profitable growth.
I'll elaborate on a handful of key themes for the quarter, and John will provide additional perspective. My comments will center around Hurricane Ida, a brief commentary there; secondly, the health of our auctions; third, the implications of the used car price environment; and fourth, our institutional commitment to sustainability.
First, on Hurricane Ida. Hurricane Ida struck the Gulf states on August 29 and the Northeast region on September 1 and 2. This represents our most substantial storm since Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and our largest storm in the Northeast region since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Having learned from those experiences and a litany of catastrophic events between then and now, we were better prepared for this event than any in our history due to our very substantial investment over the years in land, in technology, in company-owned trucks, company-employed drivers, heavy equipment, and most importantly, our dedicated CAT team we deployed at a moment's notice.
Hundreds of us from around the country spent our Labor Day weekend on the ground and many weeks thereafter, managing the retrieval of vehicles, receiving and imaging them and navigating the vehicles through the titling process to their eventual sale. As is often the case with major storms, we experienced an operating loss from the event in the quarter of a few million dollars. We view our pre-storm prep and our robust response to catastrophic events as investments in the strong and durable partnerships we have with our insurance sellers.
Our storm-related costs, as you know, from prior experiences include lease expense for temporary storage facilities, premiums for towing, labor costs and overtime for our people, travel expenses and lodging, among others. These expenses are, of course, offset by revenue from incremental unit volume. Financially speaking, the impact of the storm in the quarter was approximately 100 to 150 basis points of gross and operating margin rate compression.
You'll know we haven't provided further specifics in our press release or included adjustments in our non-GAAP earnings schedule for the catastrophe. We believe that providing excellent service in difficult times is an intrinsic aspect of our value proposition to our customers and that these storms will become -- will increase in frequency and severity over time.
The second thing I wanted to tackle is our unit volume growth and our auction liquidity. We experienced global unit sales increase of 21% year-over-year, of which approximately 2 points was explained by the hurricane itself; a U.S. increase of almost 24%, and again, 2 or 3 points of that growth explained by Hurricane Ida. We grew our international unit sales by just shy of 8%. The COVID responses in countries outside the U.S., as a general matter, continues to be more aggressive and more pronounced than what we've experienced here stateside.
Our insurance business grew relative to the first quarter of last year at 23%. We are observing certainly continued increases in total loss frequency, I'll comment more about that in a moment, and benefit from share gain as well. Driving activity itself continues to rebound relative to last year very significantly, but still just shy on measures such as gasoline consumption of what we experienced in the year prior.
Total loss frequency has increased steadily, including during the pandemic. Though all else equal, as many folks on the phone already know, the strong used car price environment almost certainly is an inhibitor to assignment volume, all else equal, to Copart auctions.
Turning to our noninsurance volume. When we exclude lower-value cars, such as wholesalers and charities, our noninsurance business grew 7.5% year-over-year with our dealer unit volume up slightly, approximately 1% versus last year and strong growth in our Copart Direct business.
I'll note, and you'll note, that this represents solid absolute performance, but arguably the strongest relative performance in our history to other vehicle marketplaces given what is the pronounced shortage of available supply in the industry. We think this is a testament to the power of Copart's marketplace. And we've said it before, but it's worth reiterating: the cars we earn the right to sell on behalf of insurance companies, along with rising total loss frequency, enable us to achieve superior returns for progressively more noninsurance cars as well. And it's also true in reverse. The dealer rental car fleet, bank and consumer cars we earn the right to sell drive still more insurance volume and higher total loss frequency as the years go by.
The next theme I wanted to address is prices themselves. So we are experiencing, of course, high used vehicle prices across the world and certainly strong ASP at Copart auctions as well. Our ASPs worldwide grew 11% for the year -- year-over-year for the quarter with U.S. ASPs up 10% year-over-year as well. The Manheim Index as one industry proxy is at all-time highs with a November mid-month reading of 234.8.
The durability-based fees is, of course, a natural question. There certainly are longer-term trends in favor of higher ASPs, including our auction liquidity, total loss frequency and the like as well as growing demand from emerging economies for rec vehicles from our origin countries. We also continue to invest significant resources in member registration -- member recruitment registration, retention and the like.
But of course, we should acknowledge the technical forces as well. There remains a chip shortage, which is affecting the production of new vehicles and driving higher prices for used vehicles around the world. Our perspective doesn't diverge from the industry consensus, which indicates that this chip shortage will persist well into 2022 and likely into 2023 as well.
The important note here is that if and when used car prices do fall, we expect a corresponding increase in assignment volumes. As total loss frequency is negatively correlated with used car prices, the more a car is worth before the accident, the more prone it is to being repaired.
The last theme I wanted to tackle before handing it to John is the notion of sustainability. As a long-standing cultural matter, we at Copart have always asked to be judged on our actions and results, not our words or our PowerPoint presentations. But we recognize that we're at a moment in history in which companies are being challenge to articulate their ESG position more clearly, and I'll spend a few minutes on that theme.
Copart plays a critical role in the automotive circular economy, enabling the reuse, recycling and responsible disposal of vehicles around the world. We sell well over 3 million vehicles per year. And by matching those vehicles with their optimal owners, we enable the return to service of automobiles that would otherwise have been scrapped, the reuse of parts that otherwise would have ended up in landfills.
As a result, the reuse and recycling that Copart enables displaces what otherwise would have been de novo resource extraction and energy-consuming manufacturing as well. As climate events themselves increase in frequency and severity, Copart will play a growing role in assisting communities and recovering from them, as we have in our past, by removing vehicles from roadways, storage facilities and repair shops, enabling the free flow of people and goods and services in the economies in which we do business.
And finally, because so many of our vehicles are ultimately purchased by buyers outside the U.S., our auctions contribute to the physical and economic mobility of residents and countries of emerging economies, including in Central and South America, the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe.
If you haven't read it already, please do see our annual shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website, where we expound further on these themes, among others, including diversity and inclusion. We'll offer more substance in the coming days in the form of a sustainability report as well.
And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John North, to talk about the fourth quarter's financial -- the first quarter's financial results."

Before I get into the numbers, I'd like to begin by also acknowledging our team's effort relative to Hurricane Ida and thank them for their dedication and sacrifice. Being relatively new to the Copart family, this is my first opportunity to see us in action and to observe firsthand the tremendous sense of ownership we take to ensure a positive outcome in the face of both disaster and tragedy. Our people and our culture have always been and will continue to be the key to our success.
Now I'll make a few comments on our operational results, and then we'll open it up for questions. For the first quarter, global revenue increased $217 million or 37%, including a nearly $4 million benefit to currency. Global service revenue increased $152 million or 30%, primarily due to higher average selling prices and increased volume. U.S. service revenue was up 31%, and international experienced an increase of 18%.
Purchased vehicle sales increased $65 million or 84% due to higher ASPs and increased volume. U.S. purchased vehicle revenue was up 87% over the prior year, and international grew 79%. As a result, purchase vehicle gross profit, defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales, increased by $2.7 million overall. As Jeff mentioned, we had significant relative growth in our purchased vehicle volume, resulting in gross and operating margin rate contraction of approximately 150 to 200 basis points.
Global gross profit in the first quarter increased by $88 million or 30%, and our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately 250 basis points to 47.5%. U.S. margins declined from 52.6% to 50.3%, and international margins decreased from 37% to $33.1% due to a higher purchased vehicle mix at lower margins, partially offset by higher ASPs globally.
I'll now move to a discussion of G&A expenditures excluding stock compensation and depreciation expense. G&A spend increased million from $35.2 million a year ago to $41.1 million in 2022, yet is lower from 5.9% of revenue to 5.1% of revenue this year. We anticipate G&A to continue to improve as a percentage of revenue as we grow our business. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 33% from $248.6 million to $330.1 million.
First quarter income tax expense was $65.5 million at a 20.1% effective tax rate, which reflected a $3 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options. Adjusting those to a non-GAAP measure included in our earnings release changed our effective tax rate to 21%. First quarter GAAP net income increased from 30% from $200 million last year to $260 million this year. Adjusted to remove the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options, non-GAAP net income increased 37% from $188.5 million last year to $257.4 million in the first quarter of 2022.
Our global inventory at the end of October increased 12% from last year. This is comprised of a year-over-year increase of 14% for U.S. inventory and a decline of 3% for international inventory. This increase in inventory is largely a function of U.S. accident frequency and miles driven returning to normal, supplemented with the effects of Ida and share gains, partially offset by a decline in international driven by countries with longer-duration lockdowns as a response to COVID.
Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow. As of the end of the quarter, we had $2.3 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with capacity of over $1 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter increased by $54 million year-over-year to $312.5 million, driven by stronger earnings. We invested $65 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Approximately 70% of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion. We are continuing to prioritize investments in physical infrastructure above other choices and believe this continued investment is helping to create durable advantages in our ability to handle increasing numbers of total loss vehicles and adjacent opportunities in the whole car marketplace. We're continuing to focus on investing for the future in both capacity and technology while maintaining a conservative capital structure that allows operational flexibility regardless of economic changes or transitory market dynamics.
And with that, we're happy to open up the call for some questions."

So it's -- we are seeing and experiencing those things.
I would note that inflation, though certainly more pronounced today, it's not a brand-new phenomenon. For years, we've experienced very meaningful inflation in health care costs, for example. Land has continued to grow in value. Capital equipment, the loaders we buy, for example, are more expensive than they were 5 and 10 years ago as well. So inflation is more pronounced today, but it's not a radically new phenomenon. So we do have experience in managing through that, with productivity being the most important long-term lever."

For them, they care a lot about speed and execution. They care about auction returns. They care about policyholder experience. And on all dimensions, we are investing. There are different nuances to each.
I think what you mentioned a moment ago about cycle times and the public notice you mentioned a moment ago about our partnership with Commerzbank, for example, those are investments to address cycle times, in particular, for cars with outstanding liens on them, which also have derivative effects on the policyholder settlement time lines in some cases. So we certainly are investing there. Lienholder cars are, in particular, some of the most challenging vehicles in terms of cycle times, and we invest all the time in initiatives like that. But anyway, the point of all that was there are many dimensions to that, and we invest across those dimensions as well."

So I guess my question is, are repair costs up as much in terms of dollars as used car prices? I can't imagine that's true. Or are insurers adjusting their total loss calculation kind of real time to the current salvage your recovery rates that you're getting? Or is it something else? Because if it's dynamic insurance calculations, if they're changing it with used car prices much faster than they have in the past, would that potentially suggest that as used car prices fall, then total loss frequency wouldn't rise fast as anticipated?

And the total loss frequency, I think, has been impaired, all else equal, because of high used car prices. And your question as to then what is balance -- what tips the balance in the other direction. I think it is a combination of repair costs as well as rental car costs. The repair path, so to speak, for an insurance carrier is also onerous and -- is onerous and expensive today relative to what it was 2 years ago.
I think there's also just the long-term secular trends in this direction. Anyway, Bob, as you know, which is the accident section and avoidance systems and the vehicle complexity substrate mix change from steel to aluminum and carbon and the like, electric vehicles, et cetera. So I think those are all contributing to the net effect the total loss frequency is rising when this one variable in isolation would suggest that it shouldn't.
Now the other variable which is worth mentioning, Bob, is it's the mix between -- it's the tension between the 2 as well in terms of what the used car prices are, but also our auction returns. Our auction returns are up I think more than pre-accident vehicle prices have been over that same period. So we have also helped to close that gap with the auction results as well."

Cycle times have improved, but there's plenty of complexity in the ecosystem as well. So there are many examples, case studies, in which cycle times are increasing. And today, arguably, the very strong used car prices are making lean settlements faster than they otherwise would be relative to an environment in which you had a bunch of underwater loans, for example, Bob, as you know.
So I think in practice, we will continue to invest in land for years to come, and probably very substantially. So that said, as you noted, overcapitalized, Bob, is more editorializing perhaps than I offer. But nonetheless, I think to the point that we are -- have a very robust balance sheet today. But the answer over the next 10 years is for sure that we'll buy stock back, as we always have. You know from our share count ex the split that we have contracted the open market share part, the shares outstanding over the years, and we'll continue to do so.

I'd argue we can achieve a very strong result there, too. But there are certainly many cars and an increasing number of cars for which we are the obvious answer. I don't think we are yet the obvious answer for $75,000 Audis.
But there's no ceiling per se. Probably the same conceptually, Daniel, when Peaks asked, what is the ceiling for total loss frequency? Can it get to 25%? Can you get to 30%? I think this is a dynamic picture, and we'll see that evolution over time. But there's no reason there's a hard asymptote."

And so there will be a 50-year trend of more of our used rec damaged vehicles moving overseas, where they are meaningful contributors to economic and physical mobility there. So that theme isn't going away anytime soon.
As for tactically how we pursue individual countries, we do both. So we are responsive when we see activity from countries that previously didn't buy. And we'll invest in online and physical marketing. In some cases, we'll invest in physical resources on the ground there as well to cultivate that new buyer base.

The principal business -- for example, in the U.K., when we entered in 2007, it was largely principal-oriented. And today, we shifted the strong majority over to a consignment basis instead, which we think is a better long-term alignment of our incentives with those of our sellers, right? As opposed to being principles to trade against them, we are on the same side rooting for the highest possible sale price for those cars.
Now the realms in which we do have more principal activities tend to be places where we are less established as a known brand and a known quantity. So today, we are not yet a prominent consumer brand. So it's tough to ask Bret Jordan to consign his car through us and assume that we'll get a good return for you. Instead, we can offer you a compelling price. You sell the car to us, and we sell it in turn as a principle.
And ditto in U.K. in the early days. Today, that's no longer necessary because we certainly are a well-established brand among the insurance industry and otherwise in the U.K. So the point being, all long term as liquidity grows as our recognition grows in those subsections of the marketplace, so to speak, will migrate to a consignment model."

There are sources of friction and distortion, of course, in comparing those trends, whether it's tariffs or shipping or otherwise, that can introduce discontinuities in that comparison. But by and large, I think of a vehicle business as being a global one in nature.
In terms of the long-term trends -- short-term trends, I think we certainly can't be affected by currency in any given auction, any given week, any given quarter, maybe any given year. But I think the long-term trends of our cars being in higher demand in other countries still than they are in the U.S., that's not going away.

Good morning and thanks for joining us for the first quarter. We're pleased to report a strong first quarter for fiscal 2022 against the backdrop of various extremes, a persistent and evolving pandemic, changing global traffic pat",1400,"Excellent. Thanks, John. Good morning and thanks for joining us for the first quarter. We're pleased to report a strong first quarter for fiscal 2022 against the backdrop of various extremes, a persistent and evolving pandemic, changing global traffic patterns, supply chain disruptions, a strong used car price environment and an active storm season, to name a few. We continue to serve our customers successfully to enhance auction liquidity and to continue our long-term trend of profitable growth. 
I'll elaborate on a handful of key themes for the quarter, and John will provide additional perspective. My comments will center around Hurricane Ida, a brief commentary there; secondly, the health of our auctions; third, the implications of the used car price environment; and fourth, our institutional commitment to sustainability. 
First, on Hurricane Ida. Hurricane Ida struck the Gulf states on August 29 and the Northeast region on September 1 and 2. This represents our most substantial storm since Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and our largest storm in the Northeast region since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Having learned from those experiences and a litany of catastrophic events between then and now, we were better prepared for this event than any in our history due to our very substantial investment over the years in land, in technology, in company-owned trucks, company-employed drivers, heavy equipment, and most importantly, our dedicated CAT team we deployed at a moment's notice. 
Hundreds of us from around the country spent our Labor Day weekend on the ground and many weeks thereafter, managing the retrieval of vehicles, receiving and imaging them and navigating the vehicles through the titling process to their eventual sale. As is often the case with major storms, we experienced an operating loss from the event in the quarter of a few million dollars. We view our pre-storm prep and our robust response to catastrophic events as investments in the strong and durable partnerships we have with our insurance sellers. 
Our storm-related costs, as you know, from prior experiences include lease expense for temporary storage facilities, premiums for towing, labor costs and overtime for our people, travel expenses and lodging, among others. These expenses are, of course, offset by revenue from incremental unit volume. Financially speaking, the impact of the storm in the quarter was approximately 100 to 150 basis points of gross and operating margin rate compression. 
You'll know we haven't provided further specifics in our press release or included adjustments in our non-GAAP earnings schedule for the catastrophe. We believe that providing excellent service in difficult times is an intrinsic aspect of our value proposition to our customers and that these storms will become -- will increase in frequency and severity over time. 
The second thing I wanted to tackle is our unit volume growth and our auction liquidity. We experienced global unit sales increase of 21% year-over-year, of which approximately 2 points was explained by the hurricane itself; a U.S. increase of almost 24%, and again, 2 or 3 points of that growth explained by Hurricane Ida. We grew our international unit sales by just shy of 8%. The COVID responses in countries outside the U.S., as a general matter, continues to be more aggressive and more pronounced than what we've experienced here stateside. 
Our insurance business grew relative to the first quarter of last year at 23%. We are observing certainly continued increases in total loss frequency. I'll comment more about that in a moment, and benefit from share gain as well. Driving activity itself continues to rebound relative to last year very significantly, but still just shy on measures such as gasoline consumption of what we experienced in the year prior. 
Total loss frequency has increased steadily, including during the pandemic. Though all else equal, as many folks on the phone already know, the strong used car price environment almost certainly is an inhibitor to assignment volume, all else equal, to Copart auctions. 
Turning to our noninsurance volume. When we exclude lower-value cars, such as wholesalers and charities, our noninsurance business grew 7.5% year-over-year with our dealer unit volume up slightly, approximately 1% versus last year and strong growth in our Copart Direct business. 
I'll note, and you'll note, that this represents solid absolute performance, but arguably the strongest relative performance in our history to other vehicle marketplaces given what is the pronounced shortage of available supply in the industry. We think this is a testament to the power of Copart's marketplace. And we've said it before, but it's worth reiterating: the cars we earn the right to sell on behalf of insurance companies, along with rising total loss frequency, enable us to achieve superior returns for progressively more noninsurance cars as well. And it's also true in reverse. The dealer rental car fleet, bank and consumer cars we earn the right to sell drive still more insurance volume and higher total loss frequency as the years go by. 
The next theme I wanted to address is prices themselves. So we are experiencing, of course, high used vehicle prices across the world and certainly strong ASP at Copart auctions as well. Our ASPs worldwide grew 11% for the year -- year-over-year for the quarter with U.S. ASPs up 10% year-over-year as well. The Manheim Index as one industry proxy is at all-time highs with a November mid-month reading of 234.8. 
The durability-based fees is, of course, a natural question. There certainly are longer-term trends in favor of higher ASPs, including our auction liquidity, total loss frequency and the like as well as growing demand from emerging economies for wrecked vehicles from our origin countries. We also continue to invest significant resources in member registration -- member recruitment registration, retention and the like. 
But of course, we should acknowledge the technical forces as well. There remains a chip shortage, which is affecting the production of new vehicles and driving higher prices for used vehicles around the world. Our perspective doesn't diverge from the industry consensus, which indicates that this chip shortage will persist well into 2022 and likely into 2023 as well. 
The important note here is that if and when used car prices do fall, we expect a corresponding increase in assignment volumes as total loss frequency is negatively correlated with used car prices, the more a car is worth before the accident, the more prone it is to being repaired. 
The last theme I wanted to tackle before handing it to John is the notion of sustainability. As a long-standing cultural matter, we at Copart have always asked to be judged on our actions and results, not our words or our PowerPoint presentations. But we recognize that we're at a moment in history in which companies are being challenge to articulate their ESG position more clearly, and I'll spend a few minutes on that theme. 
Copart plays a critical role in the automotive circular economy, enabling the reuse, recycling and responsible disposal of vehicles around the world. We sell well over 3 million vehicles per year. And by matching those vehicles with their optimal owners, we enable the return to service of automobiles that would otherwise have been scrapped, the reuse of parts that otherwise would have ended up in landfills. 
As a result, the reuse and recycling that Copart enables displaces what otherwise would have been de novo resource extraction and energy-consuming manufacturing as well. As climate events themselves increase in frequency and severity, Copart will play a growing role in assisting communities and recovering from them, as we have in our past, by removing vehicles from roadways, storage facilities and repair shops, enabling the free flow of people and goods and services in the economies in which we do business. 
And finally, because so many of our vehicles are ultimately purchased by buyers outside the U.S., our auctions contribute to the physical and economic mobility of residents and countries of emerging economies, including in Central and South America, the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe. 
If you haven't read it already, please do see our annual shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website, where we expound further on these themes, among others, including diversity and inclusion. We'll offer more substance in the coming days in the form of a sustainability report as well. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John North, to talk about the fourth quarter's financial -- the first quarter's financial results."

Before I get into the numbers, I'd like to begin by also acknowledging our team's effort relative to Hurricane Ida and thank them for their dedication and sacrifice. Being relatively new to the Copart family, this is my first opportunity to see us in action and to observe firsthand the tremendous sense of ownership we take to ensure a positive outcome in the face of both disaster and tragedy. Our people and our culture have always been and will continue to be the key to our success. 
Now I'll make a few comments on our operational results, and then we'll open it up for questions. For the first quarter, global revenue increased $217 million or 37%, including a nearly $4 million benefit due to currency. Global service revenue increased $152 million or 30%, primarily due to higher average selling prices and increased volume. U.S. service revenue was up 31%, and international experienced an increase of 18%. 
Purchased vehicle sales increased $65 million or 84% due to higher ASPs and increased volume. U.S. purchased vehicle revenue was up 87% over the prior year, and international grew 79%. As a result, purchased vehicle gross profit, defined as vehicle sales less cost of vehicle sales, increased by $2.7 million overall. As Jeff mentioned, we had significant relative growth in our purchased vehicle volume, resulting in gross and operating margin rate contraction of approximately 150 to 200 basis points. 
Global gross profit in the first quarter increased by $88 million or 30%, and our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately 250 basis points to 47.5%. U.S. margins declined from 52.6% to 50.3%, and international margins decreased from 37% to $33.1% due to a higher purchased vehicle mix at lower margins, partially offset by higher ASPs globally. 
I'll now move to a discussion of G&A expenditures excluding stock compensation and depreciation expense. G&A spend increased $5.9 million from $35.2 million a year ago to $41.1 million in 2022, yet is lower from 5.9% of revenue to 5.1% of revenue this year. We anticipate G&A to continue to improve as a percentage of revenue as we grow our business. As a result, our GAAP operating income increased by 33% from $248.6 million to $330.1 million. 
First quarter income tax expense was $65.5 million at a 20.1% effective tax rate, which reflected a $3 million tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options. Adjusting those to a non-GAAP measure included in our earnings release changed our effective tax rate to 21%. First quarter GAAP net income increased from 30% from $200 million last year to $260 million this year. Adjusted to remove the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options, non-GAAP net income increased 37% from $188.5 million last year to $257.4 million in the first quarter of 2022. 
Our global inventory at the end of October increased 12% from last year. This is comprised of a year-over-year increase of 14% for U.S. inventory and a decline of 3% for international inventory. This increase in inventory is largely a function of U.S. accident frequency and miles driven returning to normal, supplemented with the effects of Ida and share gains, partially offset by a decline in international, driven by countries with longer-duration lockdowns as a response to COVID. 
Now to briefly update our liquidity and cash flow. As of the end of the quarter, we had $2.3 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn revolving credit facility with capacity of over $1 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter increased by $54 million year-over-year to $312.5 million, driven by stronger earnings. We invested $65 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Approximately 70% of this amount was attributable to capacity expansion. 
We are continuing to prioritize investments in physical infrastructure above other choices and believe this continued investment is helping to create durable advantage in our ability to handle increasing numbers of total loss vehicles and adjacent opportunity in the whole car marketplace. We're continuing to focus on investing for the future in both capacity and technology while maintaining a conservative capital structure that allows operational flexibility regardless of economic changes or transitory market dynamics. 
And with that, we're happy to open up the call for some questions."

So it's -- we are seeing and experiencing those things. 
I would note that inflation, though certainly more pronounced today, it's not a brand-new phenomenon. For years, we've experienced very meaningful inflation in health care costs, for example. Land has continued to grow in value. Capital equipment, the loaders we buy, for example, are more expensive than they were 5 and 10 years ago as well. So inflation is more pronounced today, but it's not a radically new phenomenon. So we do have experience in managing through that, with productivity being the most important long-term lever."

For them, they care a lot about speed and execution. They care about auction returns. They care about policyholder experience. And on all dimensions, we are investing. 
There are different nuances to each, I think what you mentioned a moment ago about cycle times and the public notice you mentioned a moment ago about our partnership with Commerce Bank, for example, those are investments to address cycle times, in particular, for cars with outstanding liens on them, which also have derivative effects on the policyholder settlement time lines in some cases. So we certainly are investing there. Lienholder cars are, in particular, some of the most challenging vehicles in terms of cycle times, and we invest all the time in initiatives like that.

If you had said 2 years ago, used car prices would rise 40%, now 60% or 70% over a 2-year period, I would have incorrectly said total loss frequency would crater unless repair costs went up equally to offset it. 
So I guess my question is, are repair costs up as much in terms of dollars as used car prices? I can't imagine that's true. Or are insurers adjusting their total loss calculation kind of real time to the current salvage your recovery rates that you're getting? Or is it something else? Because if it's dynamic insurance calculations, if they're changing it with used car prices much faster than they have in the past, would that potentially suggest that as used car prices fall, then total loss frequency wouldn't rise fast as anticipated?

And the total loss frequency, I think, has been impaired, all else equal, because of high used car prices. And your question as to then what tips the balance in the other direction. I think it is a combination of repair costs as well as rental car costs. The repair path, so to speak, for an insurance carrier is also onerous and -- is onerous and expensive today relative to what it was 2 years ago.
I think there's also just the long-term secular trends in this direction. Anyway, Bob, as you know, which is the accident section and avoidance systems and the vehicle complexity substrate mix change from steel to aluminum and carbon and the like, electric vehicles, et cetera. So I think those are all contributing to the net effect, the total loss frequency is rising when this one variable in isolation would suggest that it shouldn't.
Now the other variable, which is worth mentioning, Bob, is it's the mix between -- it's the tension between the two as well in terms of what the used car prices are, but also our auction returns. Our auction returns are up I think more than pre-accident vehicle prices have been over that same period. So we have also helped to close that gap with the auction results as well."

So just curious as to like when thinking about your overcapitalized balance sheet and the liquidity that you have, what are the primary uses of that liquidity as you run out of more land to buy or if cycle times pick up enough you need less land at the same time?

And today, arguably, the very strong used car prices are making lean settlements faster than they otherwise would be relative to an environment in which you had a bunch of underwater loans, for example, Bob, as you know.
So I think in practice, we will continue to invest in land for years to come, and probably very substantially. So that said, as you noted, overcapitalized, Bob, is more editorializing perhaps than I offer. But nonetheless, I think to the point that we are -- have a very robust balance sheet today. But the answer over the next 10 years is for sure that we'll buy stock back, as we always have. You know from our share count ex the split that we have contracted the open market share part, the shares outstanding over the years, and we'll continue to do so.

I'd argue we can achieve a very strong result there, too. But there are certainly many cars and an increasing number of cars for which we are the obvious answer. I don't think we are yet the obvious answer for $75,000 Audis.
But there's no ceiling per se. Probably the same conceptually, Daniel, when people -- folks ask what is the ceiling for total loss frequency? Can it get to 25%? Can you get to 30%?

But what do you do with those towing vehicles when you're not in a cat, right, the other 365 short days of the year? How do you use those towing trucks in other parts of the year?

Medium, long term, I think there is -- there may well be an opportunity to invest further still here. Historically, we have done very well with a third-party contractor model. They tend to be very resourceful and productive, and it's a good alignment of interest as they want to grow and support their own businesses and to work productively for us. But that's always -- it's an evolving mix and one we continue to evaluate over time.
During the catastrophic event, and certainly even -- and afterwards as well, we are certainly happy that we have those trucks and those drivers employed in-house. They have been very productive members of our team."

The principal business -- for example, in the U.K., when we entered in 2007, it was largely principal-oriented. And today, we shifted the strong majority over to a consignment basis instead, which we think is a better long-term alignment of our incentives with those of our sellers, right? As opposed to being principals who trade against them, we are on the same side rooting for the highest possible sale price for those cars.
Now the realms in which we do have more principal activities tend to be places where we are less established as a known brand and a known quantity. So today, we are not yet a prominent consumer brand. So it's tough to ask Bret Jordan to consign his car through us and assume that we'll get a good return for you. Instead, we can offer you a compelling price. You sell the car to us, and we sell it in turn as a principal.
And ditto in U.K. in the early days. Today, that's no longer necessary because we certainly are a well-established brand among the insurance industry and otherwise in the U.K. So the point being, all long term as liquidity grows as our recognition grows in those subsections of the marketplace, so to speak, will migrate to a consignment model."

There are sources of friction and distortion, of course, in comparing those trends, whether it's tariffs or shipping or otherwise, that can introduce discontinuities in that comparison. But by and large, I think of a vehicle business as being a global one in nature.
In terms of the long-term trends -- short-term trends, I think we certainly can't be affected by currency in any given auction, any given week, any given quarter, maybe any given year.
