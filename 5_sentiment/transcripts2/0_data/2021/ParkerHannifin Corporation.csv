Thanks for your participation today. Now before I move to Slide 4, I want to make a few opening comments. Calendar 2020 was an extremely difficult year to say the least, for all of us, both professionally and",1610,"Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for your participation today. Now before I move to Slide 4, I want to make a few opening comments. Calendar 2020 was an extremely difficult year to say the least, for all of us, both professionally and personally, and I hope all of you are staying safe.
Our global team has come together like no other time in our history and has responded to this combination of a health and economic crisis. We've rallied around our purpose, in the Win Strategy. And we've showed that Parker is an exceptional performer even in the most difficult of environments. I'd like to take this opportunity beginning here to thank our global team for just great performance. And you're going to see evidence of that over the next couple of slides.
If you go to Slide 4. One of our key competitive advantages are breadth of motion control technologies. We're now up to 2/3 of our revenue. This -- you heard me talk about this as a struggle of 1 60 percent. We now to 2/3 of our revenue comes from customers who buy from 4 or more of these technologies. As these interconnected technologies that enable us to create even more value for our customers and create a distinct competitive advantage versus our competitors.
If you move to Slide 5, we just had outstanding performance in the quarter when running through some of the highlights. Top quartile safety performance, we had a 23% reduction of recordable incidents. This now makes 75% reduction for the last 5 years, which has been phenomenal.
Sales decline was 2.5% year-over-year. You can see it was a little over 6% from an organic standpoint. This was significantly better than our guidance. And about a 50%-plus improvement from where we were in Q1. Q2 was a record net income at $447 million. The EBITDA margin was a little over 23% as reported, or 20.8% adjusted. You can see the significant improvement versus prior 230 basis points. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was a record at 20.4% of sales. And then the table to bottom there has got segment operating margin both as reported and adjusted basis, I'd call your attention to the adjusted row, 20.4% segment operating margin adjusted. And again, a giant increase versus prior, plus 250 basis points.
So there's a lot of numbers on this page. We have a lot of companies to track. So the easy way to remember this is just the quarter we put up 3 20s. And we happen to highlight that in gold. So greater than 20% EBITDA margin, CFA margin and segment ARPU volume. So we're pretty proud of that, and those are all great results during a pandemic. So just a fantastic job on the whole team.
If you go to Slide 6, we're going to talk about cash flow. Big cash flow quarter, paid down $767 million of debt in the quarter. If you look at the last 14 months, it's $2.8 billion of debt. This is a little over half of the acquisition that we took on with lower excise, which is great progress there. You see the ratios in the middle of the page there. Of significance, if we go back a year ago, we were 4.0 and now we're at 2.7% on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis. And we've now reinstated effective in this quarter of Q3, our 10b5-1 share repurchase program.
So I'll move to the next slide, which is our transformation of the company. And hopefully, just the last 2 slides are indicative of how the company is transformed. But I'd like to give a little more color and context as to what we're doing. So if you move to Slide 8. This is our strategy summary on a page, and it's flanked on the left side with why we win, which you've heard me talk about this in the past, this is a list of our competitive advantages, and I've highlighted them. So I'm not going to talk about them this earlier today.
But there are historical success factors that will continue on into the future. I want to focus most of the time for my next couple of slides on where we're going. And I've got a slide on each one of these pullets. And the output of really this historical success factors and where we're going is that we want to be a top quartile company, and we want to stand out in the crowd, and we think we're doing that.
So if you go to Slide 9. The Win Strategy, and this is 3.0. This is our business system. Pound for pound, this has been the most impactful change we've made to date to the Win Strategy. And it's going to be Win 3.0 in our purpose statement, they're going to be the powerhouse behind our future performance.
Go to 10. You've seen our purpose statement, enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. This is a statement that everybody has really rallied around. It found very expirational within the company, has enabled everyone to connect their efforts to this higher calling, this higher purpose of life. And really it helps answer the question, how can we help through our customers, create a better tomorrow.
And I think given what's going on with the coronavirus and the vaccine, Slide 11, is probably a great highlight of our purpose and action and just how essential we are to the vaccine value chain. And the way to read this slide to go left to right and go in a clockwise fashion was turning upper left-hand corner. So we're in a development and production phase of these vaccines, mixing, purification, filtration and dispensing. Then you got to get the product moved around. So we are in sterile transfer containers, especially designed. And then all of our motion control technologies are in both air and ground transportation to move the product around the world. We need to be able to store it locally and that requires low-temperature refrigeration. So how our refrigeration technologies are in play there. Then when you administer to the patient, again, you need on-premise refrigeration, and then stoppers and trim seals as part of our Engineered materials offering. So we're very proud to be part of this value chain. And through our customers helping to create the better tomorrow than all of us, as I start this call are striving for as we try to exit the pandemic and deliver billions of vaccines to people around the world over the next quarters and years.
So if you move to Slide 12. My last slide for my opening comments, want to focus on our strategies to grow faster in the market. And our proxy for the market is global industrial production growth, which is skipping that acronym.
So on the left-hand side, it's a series of portfolio of things that you've seen us make transforming a portfolio of the company buying 3 great companies, $3 billion of acquired revenue that were all accretive on growth, cash and margins. As a matter of fact, as an example, LORD grew mid-single digits last quarter, while the rest of the company, total company grew minus 6%.
On the right-hand side, is a list of organic growth strategies. And what's interesting about this list with the exception of international distribution, these are all new with Win Strategy 3.0. So I'm going to make a quick comment on each one. So strategic positioning is really our effort to focus on stronger divisional strategies. And we have a cadence with every division. We do 3 a month, and these are extremely productive conversations with our general managers to how they're going to position their division to win versus the competition.
Second, both in our innovation. We made 2 big changes. One is a metric PBI, which is product vitality index. It's a measure of new products as a percent of sales, looking at a 5-year period for new products. And then new product blueprinting, which is that NPP, acronym there, is really a change to our ideation process to create better ideas coming into the innovation funnel. The output of what we're trying to do here is that we want our PBI context, a percent of sales, to grow by 600 basis points over the next 5 years, a more innovative portfolio, better chances to grow, better margins, et cetera.
And then simplify design, I've talked a lot about that. It's a speed initiative. It's a cost initiative. It's a customer experience initiative. It's a recognition that 70% of your costs are tied up in how you design a product. And simple by design is all about focusing on design excellence. So when you put together design excellence with operational excellence, it's a dynamic pairing. International distribution is going to continue from the success we've had with 2.0.
Digital leadership is really a 4-pronged attack, digital customer experience, digital products, digital operations and digital productivity. And digital productivities where we have a concerted effort on artificial intelligence and debt analytics. And then lastly, a new incentive plan, our annual cash incentive plan acronym, ACIP, and that's going to focus our divisions and the whole company on driving growth cash and earnings.
So it's this combination. And it's this combination that's helped us performed better on the top line organically, particularly in the current downturn, and it will be our catapult to growing fast in the market as we go forward.
So with that, I'm going to hand it back to Todd with more details for the quarter."
295170,702236820,2192003,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Parker-Hannifin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. I'd like to direct everyone to Slide 14, and I'll just begin summarizing our strong second quarter results. This slide displays as reported and adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter and I'll focus on adjusted earnings per share.",1909,"Thanks, Tom. I'd like to direct everyone to Slide 14, and I'll just begin summarizing our strong second quarter results. This slide displays as reported and adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter and I'll focus on adjusted earnings per share. We generated $3.44 this quarter, and that compares to $2.98 last year. If you look at the breakdown of the adjustments for the FY '22 -- or excuse me, FY '21 as reported numbers, it netted to $0.03 this quarter. And that is made up in the following bucket: Business realignment expenses of $0.14; integration cost to achieve of $0.02; acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.62; and as we communicated last quarter, we are adjusting out the gain on the sale of land that amounted to $0.77. And all in, the net tax impact of all of those adjustments is $0.02.
Last year, our second quarter earnings per share were adjusted by $1.41. The details of which are included in the reconciliation tables for non-GAAP financial measures.
If you move to Slide 15, this is just a walk from the $2.98 to $3.44 for the quarter. And despite organic sales declining 6% and total sales declining 2.5%, adjusted segment operating income increased by $70 million or $0.11. That equated to $0.42 per share. So a very strong operating beat for the quarter.
Decremental margins on a year over basis are favorable, demonstrating the excellent operational execution, robust cost containment by our team members really in every segment and every region.
If you continue on the slide, we had a slight headwind from higher corporate G&A, just $0.02 that was a result of market-based adjustments to investment tied to deferred comp. And as Tom mentioned, our strong cash flow allowed us to pay off a significant portion of debt on a year-over-year basis that reduced our interest expense that equated to $0.12 for the quarter. And then if you look at the remaining items, other expense was just $0.01 slightly higher. We had a higher effective tax rate that impacted us by $0.03. And finally, slightly higher diluted shares resulted in a $0.02 impact, that's how we get to the $3.44.
If you move to Slide 16, this is a savings from our cost out actions. I know there's been a lot of questions on this, just from some of the early reports. Just a reminder, these represent savings recognized in the year as a result of our discretionary actions in response to the pandemic and volume declines, plus the savings we realized from our permanent reliant actions taken in FY '20 and also in FY '21.
So if you look at this, our second quarter discretionary savings exceeded our forecast and now amount to $190 million on a year-to-date basis. We are now forecasting for the full year that discretionary total will increase to $225 million or an increase of $50 million. The majority of that increase was recognized in the second quarter and roughly amounts to $35 million above our forecast.
Just a reminder, as demand continues to increase and our team's pivot to support growth, we expect these discretionary savings to be lower in the second half.
Permanent actions remain on track. There's no changes to what we have communicated previously. Our full year forecast will generate savings of $250 million, and that will be $210 million incremental. And we believe that this will help us generate the strong incremental margin that we have in our guide for the second half.
If we move to Slide 17, this is just a walk of the total results for the company, sales and segment operating margin. And as Tom mentioned, organic sales did decline by 6.1% this year. The decline was partially offset by the contributions from acquisitions, that was 2.6%, and currency impact of 1%.
And again, despite these lower sales, total adjusted segment operating margins improved to 20.4% versus 17.9% last year. This 250 basis point improvement reflects all the positive impacts from our Win Strategy initiatives, the hard work and dedication to cost containment and productivity improvements as well as savings from those realignment activities I just spoke of and really performance of the recent acquisition. So strong execution really across the entire company to get these results.
If we jump into the segments, if you go to Slide 18, looking at diversified industrial North America. Sales there declined by 5.9%, acquisitions were a plus of 3.1% and currency only slightly negatively impacted sales. But again, even with these lower sales, our operating margin for the second quarter on an adjusted basis increased sizably to 21.3%. Last year, it was 18.2%. So again, another impressive 310 basis point improvement focused on our long-term initiatives around Win Strategy, along with the productivity improvements, diligent cost containment actions and really some increased synergies we're seeing out of the LORD acquisition.
So if we go to the next slide, Slide 19, for Diversified industrial International. Organic sales for the quarter increased by 3.1%, acquisitions added 3.2% and currency accounted for 3.5%. Again, strong operating performance here. For the quarter, we reached 20.3% of sales versus 16% in the prior year. And again, same story, Win strategy initiatives, strong synergy growth and really our teams around the world rally together in light of the pandemic.
If we go to Slide 20 and talk about Aerospace Systems segment. And again, what we'll see here is a decline of 20.9% for the quarter, acquisitions helped us by 0.4%. And again, a small currency impact of 0.1%. Really, declines in the commercial businesses, both in the OEM and aftermarket end markets were the main impact, these were partially offset by higher sales in both military OEM and military aftermarket sales.
Operating margins for the second quarter was 18% versus last year's 20.2%. This resulted in a decremental margin of 28.8%, which is in line with our expectations and really the result of all the previous actions we've taken to realign the Aerospace business to current market conditions, along with strong cost controls and really helping to offset the pandemic composed of a mix that we're seeing from the commercial and military businesses.
Slide 21 is just some highlights on cash flow. Tom already mentioned this, but our operating cash flow activities increased 64% year-over-year to a record of $1.35 billion of cash. This is an impressive 20.4% of sales. Our global teams are really focused on this, very disciplined in managing our working capital across the world, and we're really focused on delivering strong cash flow generation.
If you look at free cash flow, year-to-date, we now move to 19%. That's an increase of 78% versus prior year, and our cash flow conversion is now 1.64% versus 130% last year. So just strong cash flow performance from the team, very impressive results.
If we wanted to just focus on orders real quick. Moving to Slide 22. Our orders came in at flat this year or this quarter, I should say, and that was really driven by plus 1 in our industrial North American businesses, plus 10 in our diversified industrial businesses and minus 18 on a 12-month basis in aerospace. So all in, we came in flat. And that's the first time in 7 quarters, I believe that members have been not negative.
If we move to Slide 23 and the guidance, obviously, we have a pretty large guidance increase. We are now providing this on an as-reported and an adjusted basis. And based on the strong performance we just spoke of in the first half, all the current indicators that we see right now, we've increased our total outlook for sales to a year-over-year increase of 1.7 at the midpoint. This includes a forecasted organic decline of 3.4%, offset by increases from acquisitions of 2.9% and currency of 2.2%. And again, just a reminder, we've calculated the impact of currency to spot rates based on the quarter ending December 30, and we held those rates steady as we look through the second half of our fiscal year.
In respect to margins, for adjusted operating margins by segment. At the midpoint, we are now forecasting to increase margins 150 basis points year-over-year, and that range is expected to be 20.2% to 20.4% for the full year. And if you note for items below segment operating income, there is a fairly significant difference between the as-reported estimate of $388 million, and the adjusted forecast of $487 million. The difference is that land sale that we spoke about, that's $101 million pretax, $76 million after tax. That was recognized as other income in Q2. And since that's an unusual onetime item, we are going to adjust that from -- we have adjusted that from our results.
Full year effective tax rate, no change. We still expect that to be 23%. And for the full year, the guidance range for earnings per share on an as-reported basis is now $11.90 to $12.40 or $12.15 at the midpoint. And on an adjusted per share basis, the range is now $13.65 to $14.15 or $13.9 at the midpoint.
Adjustments to the as-reported forecast made in this guidance at a pretax level, include business realignment expenses of approximately $60 million for the year associated with savings projected from those actions to be $50 million in the current year. And acquisition and integration costs to achieve $50 million of expense. Synergy savings for the LORD acquisition are now projected to reach $100 million. That is an increase of $20 million from our prior stated numbers of $80 million, and that is included in our guidance. Exotic synergies remain and expected to be $2 million for the full year.
Just a reminder, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense is forecasted to be $322 million for the year. And some assumptions that we have baked into the guidance here. At the midpoint, our sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half. And both adjusted segment operating income and adjusted EPS is split 47% first half, 53% second half.
For the third quarter of FY '21, we are forecasting adjusted earnings per share to be $3.54 at the midpoint. And that excludes $0.57 or $97 million of acquisition-related amortization expense, the business realignment expense and integration costs to achieve for the quarter.
So if you look at -- move to Slide 24, this is really just a walk from our previous guide to our revised guide. We had guided at $12 per share last quarter, based on the strong second quarter performance, we exceeded our estimates by $1.06. And we mentioned this, but the improving demand environment, along with the strong operational performance, some additional extended discretionary savings, the permanent restructuring savings and increased LORD synergies, we feel confident in raising our forecasted margins, which adds $0.85 of segment operating income over the next 2 quarters for the remainder of the fiscal year. So the majority of this increase is based on operational performance.
This calculates to an estimated incremental margin of 41% for the second half. And then some other minor adjustments to the below segment operating income lines are a negative impact of $0.01. And that's a net of interest expense income tax. So that's how we get to the $13.90. That is approximately a 16% increase from our prior guide.
So if I can direct you to Slide 25, I'll turn it back over to Tom for some comments."

We talked about the portfolio. It's a big competitive advantage of us at interconnectivity, a transformation on the 3 acquisitions and the fact that they're outgrowing and generating more cash and margins than legacy Parker. Our performance over the cycle, but I would just reflect in the last 5 years and just use round numbers, our margins or up 500 basis points. In a 5-year period of time, it was not necessarily the easiest 5-year period of time for industrial companies.
And then our 1 strategy, at 3.0, in particular and the purpose statement, are going to be the powerhouse behind exerting our performance into the future. So I give my thanks to everybody for all their hard work and the great results. And to you, Jane, I will hand it back to you for start the Q&A."

On the orders show, we saw if you look at total Parker from minus 12 to 0 in North America to minues 11 to plus 1; international for plus 4 -- minus 4 to plus 10. And then Aerospace get improved from minus 25 to minus 18. Pretty much North America a",385,"Sure. On the orders show, we saw if you look at total Parker from minus 12 to 0 in North America to minues 11 to plus 1; international for plus 4 -- minus 4 to plus 10. And then Aerospace get improved from minus 25 to minus 18. Pretty much North America and International improved throughout the whole quarter. And from our view, it looks like Aerospace is finding bottom. International piece, in particular, if you look at that plus 10, that was EMEA, plus 7; Asia, plus 13 and Latin America plus 27. So pretty strong rebound across all of the particular regions internationally.
When I look at some of the higher level subsegments, so the major buckets outside of Aerospace, distribution get better, it was minus 14 the prior quarter to minus 6 this quarter. Industrial, things are stationary, went from minus 7 to plus 1.5. And mobile saw the biggest improvement from minus 13 to plus 2.5.
So we saw all the subsegments improved nicely with the largest recovery being at mobile. And when you look at our end markets in the 4 phases of growth, we have roughly about 30% of our end markets are in accelerating growth and about 2/3 are in decelerating in decline. So we continue to move all the various end markets into either bottoming out. And you saw our decline starting to turn for accelerating growth. And maybe I'll pause to, I don't know if you want me to go through all the end markets, but that's the color we saw.
In distribution, we saw an entity, which was encouraging. Our distributors, I would say, cautiously optimistic. They are being careful. There is some uncertainty, obviously, in the next 6 months. And what we're seeing from distribution is selective restocking, in particular, focusing on those longer lead time type of products that they can get ahead of demand and position themselves to take share, which we're happy to help them with that. And in general, what we're seeing from distribution, in some cases, with some of the OEMs is placing a little larger stockholders with scheduled releases over the next several quarters, which are all indicators of people I think trying to plan as a few things are turning and start to get ahead of things."

That's why we increased the discretionary expenses for the remainder of the year. Just based on the current situation that we see in the world right now. But we do see that returning.

So if I take the top line and maybe to help with the guide for the full year. So we reduced the guide on decline on organic for minus 7.5% to minus 3.5%. But I think what's probably the most interest to analysts and shareholders",506,"Yes, Nicole, this is Tom. So if I take the top line and maybe to help with the guide for the full year. So we reduced the guide on decline on organic for minus 7.5% to minus 3.5%. But I think what's probably the most interest to analysts and shareholders is what do we think the second half is going to be. So the second half, our assumptions in the guide is North America and International, both in that kind of that 6% to 7% positive organic growth. And Aerospace at around minus 11% for the for the second half. When we look at Q3, I'm going to focus on the top, and I'll come back to the decrementals and incrementals.
In Q3, we're going to see a slight improvement in the industrial portion of the company, about 100 basis points as there's still some uncertainty. And those orders I referred to earlier on, have scheduled releases are going out multiple quarters. We see Aerospace about the same as we had in Q2. And when we get to Q4, we've got North America in that upper teens, International of around plus 10% and aerospace getting to flat. And that puts total Parker in Q4 in the low teens for Q4. So again, Industrials for the second half, that plus 6% to 7% range. And in Aerospace at minus 11%.
So when we think about the margin side of things, Q3 margins are going to be slightly less than Q2. And that's mainly from the reasons that Todd was describing, we're going to have less discretionary savings in Q2 than we had in Q3. Q3 is going to be around $25 million, and Q2 was $65 million. So you got $40 million less of discretionary savings going into Q3.
We'll still have a favorable MROS, and then people aren't familiar with what that term is that's basically you have less sales and you get more earnings. So you can't really calculate an incremental, but it's favorable.
And when we get to Q4, we've got approximate 30% MROS. I would just make the comment for Q4, really for the first half of FY '22, that the incremental MROS are going to be a tough comp for us. So the plus 30 this is, again, remember in Q4 prior period, we had the gargantuan discretionary cost out, all the big wage reductions at that time. If you were to make it like-for-like and take out discretionary actions from both periods. This would be greater than 60% incremental. And so it's -- the business is performing at a very high level, you'll see margins get a little better into Q4. That will be our highest margin quarter. And if you just look at for the second half, we go from 20.1%. That's the first half total company to $20.7 million in the second half. So continued improvement and we're not going to stop there. Obviously, we -- our goal is to keep driving this as we go into FY '22."

We've been able to keep up with demand, keep up with our lead times.
And if you look at us historically, obviously, a pandemic is a unique phenomena, but we have periods of increased demand, we outservice our competitors. It's something we've proven time in and time out. I would look for us to have the opportunity to take share because our lead times and our customer experience will be better than our competitors. So I feel very good.
And on the supply chain side, we purposely laid out a strategy years ago to be local for local. So we make buy and sell in the region for the region. So that supply chain strategy, that operational strategy allows us to be very flexible based on what's happening, do not have all our eggs in 1 basket in 1 particular region to be overly exposed on trade tariffs and those type of things.

And our next corporate bond is not due to September of '22, and it's a nominal amount of $300 million. So we are going to be in a position with a much stronger balance sheet to look at capital deployment across all the veins.
Now in particular, you talked about M&A. So the lesson learned for us historically, is to never stop working the M&A pipeline. And so we're continuing to build those relationships. We are building those relationships with across a couple of big themes. We want to be the consolidated choice within our space. We think we are the best -- we're the leader in the space, we think we're the best home, which means we'd like to be looking at anything within our space. In particular, though, if we only had a certain amount of money and all 8 of the technologies that I referred to earlier on roll on the table, we like to focus on filtration, engineered materials, instrumentation and aerospace. We think those -- you've seen us focus on those to date.
But I would tell you, we like the entire portfolio and what we've been working on is what you saw us do with the last 3 deals, buy companies that within very quickly or within a reasonable period of time and with synergies. Can outgrow, can outpace margins, can outpace cash flow for the base business. And that's what we did, and that's going to be the flavor you're going to see as we go forward.

The current climate is finding bottom, and it's going to be a slow turn coming back up. But my view over the next several years is going to gradually show improvement.
Now what is that pace of improvement? I think it's going to mirror the pace of vaccine deliveries and the comfort that travelers feel. And I think you'll see resident -- personal travel come back much more aggressively. The business travel will come back, but we'll probably plateau at a certain level based on just the efficiencies of digital tools. But we're positioned to win right now with the kind of op margins in this current climate, and it's only going to get better going forward.
So with respect to M&A, I actually think this is a good time to look at M&A in the Aerospace arena, depending on the right property and direct pricing, obviously. But I think the future is bright. Now it's going to be -- it's a long-cycle business, so it will turn slower than industrial turn would be.

But I will come back to the very first thing and this is -- what I always remind the Board and I'll remind shareholders, we want to be the consolidated choice within our space. So those 8 motion control technologies that, I believe, was on Slide 4, is the space we play in it. And we have a big advantage that we're not disparate pieces of businesses. With now 2/3 of this revenue come from people that buy from these -- all these technologies for 4 or more, we like all those technologies.
I think the thing you're going to see us look for is -- and the theme that you've seen with the last 3 deals is within a period of time depending on the synergies, they're going to be growth accretive, margin accretive and cash accretive. And that's a different strategy, I think, for the company.
Our tendency, we would prefer to buy things that are not ultra small. But if you just look at the histogram of the targets, it's more in the midsized category just because of the lay of the land. There's fewer of these really super large targets that you can look at. We will look at them, obviously. When I say midsize, what's changed for us versus the past is our mid-size is now bigger. A midsized target for us would be envision an exotic like deal, which, historically, would have been the largest deal in the history of the company for LORD and CLARCOR. So our appetite is there.
If I could go back, David, to a comment you made about the ism, which I thought was a thoughtful comment. The power of this portfolio, besides being interconnected, is that the cycle is somewhat balance each other. So yes, we will see some near term, and we'll see how long near-term turns out to be on the industrial portion of the company that's going to have much more robust macro conditions. But then following that, the Aerospace business is going to start to be healing. And I think sequentially, that those time periods are going to be complementary to each other. The other part is that this 5-year period that I envision going forward, is going to be, I think, much easier for industrial companies in the last 5-year period because we went through 2 industrial recessions and a pandemic. I'm not going on wood here. I guess it's possible to have that happen again. But the odds are low that it would repeat. So I think it's a much better time. And we have enough self-help for all those people that I'd like you to encourage. We are no longer a short-cycle bet. We are bet over the cycle. And we have all kinds of room, Win Strategy 3.0 just started. And those FY '23 targets are not an endpoint. They're a mild market we're going to blow past."

I think you will continue to see us perform very well on converting on the incremental side. Just I would caution people incrementals for Q4 this year, and for the first half of next year are going to be tough comps. We're going to try to flatten the field when we give you the results. So you'll be able to see the real incrementals of the company. But I think you would expect to see us north of 40% in the first couple of quarters and we glide down in the 30s. But we're going to be in a much -- that stair-step slide that I've showed for the last couple of quarters. Our intention is to keep raising the ceiling and raising the floor. So this next ceiling, this next cycle, our expectation is going to be higher the last ceiling. We're doing it right now. This isn't even really a necessarily good period right now, and we're breaking records on margins.
So I'm bullish because there's a lot of positive factors. If you just look at interest rates and what's happening with global industrial production forecast. In my view, of pent-up need for CapEx, given that there's been 2 industrial recessions in the last number of years. And Aerospace cycle that will follow an industrial cycle that you get the benefit of those not being right on top of each other. And just a tremendous amount of self help. A lot of what you've seen has propelled these margins to date as prior period restructuring in Win Strategy 2.0. Win Strategy 3.0, and I mentioned not just being biased because I'm a part author, but it's better than 2.0, hands down, and you've only seen about a year of that in play. And so 3.0 is going to get -- has tremendous legs, so we have still a portfolio of self-help. And the big thing is that we're back in the capital deployment gain. So it will be a steady diet of dividends, share repurchase and acquisitions. And obviously, that formula, we're going to raise, I can assure all the shareholders listening. There will be a Q4 increase to the dividend. We're not going to break our track record. And then we'll continue to do what we've always done is look at the acquisitions purchase, share repurchase and try to make the best decision of happy shareholders for what is the best long-term return for them."

Our gross margin might look different than you compare to other companies because we embed a fair amount of SG&A and/or our cost of goods sold. So our gross part has some of that in their versus other people might be booking their SG&A in different categories. But your question is stepping higher levels really, can margins continue to grow higher? It absolutely can. If you look at what I was referring to earlier on about early days of Win Strategy 3.0 and all the initiatives we have underneath there, I feel very good about our potential there and just very strong legs of what the future can hold. You put that in place with maybe a little better macro environment, you can have a little more volume induced leverage. And then we're coming into a period of time where we have a stronger balance sheet, so we can put that to work as well.
So what I've told people before, maybe I'll close on this. If you like what's happened in the last 6 years in the environment we had with basically no macro help, the next several years are going to be fantastic.

Calendar 2020 was an extremely difficult year to say the least, for all of us, both professionally and",1611,"Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for your participation today. Now before I move to Slide 4, I want to make a few opening comments. Calendar 2020 was an extremely difficult year to say the least, for all of us, both professionally and personally, and I hope all of you are staying safe. Our global team has come together like no other time in our history and has responded to this combination of a health and economic crisis. We've rallied around our purpose, in The Win Strategy. We've showed that Parker is an exceptional performer even in the most difficult of environments. 
I'd like to take this opportunity at the beginning here to thank our global team for this great performance. You're going to see evidence of that over the next couple of slides. 
If you go to Slide 4. One of our key competitive advantages are breadth of motion control technologies. We're now up to 2/3 of our revenue. This -- you heard me talk about this historically it was 60%. But now up to 2/3 of our revenue comes from customers who buy from 4 or more of these technologies. It's these interconnected technologies that enable us to create even more value for our customers and create a distinct competitive advantage versus our competitors. 
If you move to Slide 5, we just had outstanding performance in the quarter when running through some of the highlights. Top quartile safety performance, we had a 23% reduction of recordable incidents. This now makes 75% reduction for the last 5 years, which has been phenomenal. 
Sales decline was 2.5% year-over-year. You can see it was a little over 6% from an organic standpoint. This was significantly better than our guidance. 
And about a 50% plus improvement from where we were in Q1. Q2 was a record net income at $447 million. The EBITDA margin was a little over 23% as reported, or 20.8% adjusted. You can see the significant improvement versus prior 230 basis points. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was a record at 20.4% of sales. And then the table at the bottom there has got segment operating margin both as reported and adjusted basis, so I'd call your attention to the adjusted row, 20.4% segment operating margin adjusted. And again, a giant increase versus prior, plus 250 basis points. 
So there's a lot of numbers on this page. We have a lot of companies to track. So the easy way to remember this is just in the quarter we put up 3 20s. And we happen to highlight that in gold. So greater than 20% EBITDA margin, CFOA margin and segment operating margin. So we're pretty proud of that, and those are all great results during a pandemic. So just a fantastic job by the whole team. 
If you go to Slide 6, we're going to talk about cash flow. Big cash flow quarter, paid down $767 million of debt in the quarter. If you look at the last 14 months, it's $2.8 billion of debt. This is a little over half of the acquisition dip that we took on with authority and exercise, just great progress there. You see the ratios in the middle of the page there. Of significance, if we go back a year ago, we were 4.0 and now we're at 2.7 on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis. And we've now reinstated effective in this quarter Q3, our 10b5-1 share repurchase program. 
So I'll move to the next slide, which is our transformation of the company. And hopefully, just the last 2 slides are indicative of how the company has transformed. But I'd like to give a little more color and context as to what we're doing. So if you move to Slide 8. This is our strategy summary page, and it's flanked on the left side with why we win, which you've heard me talk about this in the past, this is a list of our competitive advantages and I've highlighted them. So I'm not going to talk about them necessarily today. 
But there are historical success factors that will continue on into the future. I want to focus most of the time for my next couple of slides on where we're going. And I've got a slide on each one of these bullets. And the output of really this historical success factors and where we're going is that we want to be a top quartile company, and we want to stand out in the crowd, and we think we're doing that. So if you go to Slide 9. The Win Strategy, and this is 3.0. This is our business system. Pound for pound, this has been the most impactful change we've made to date to The Win Strategy. And it's going to be Win 3.0 in our purpose statement, they're going to be the powerhouse behind our future performance. 
Go to 10. You've seen our purpose statement, enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. This is a statement that everybody has really rallied around and found very inspirational within the company, has enabled everyone to connect their efforts to this higher calling, this higher purpose of life. And really it helps answer the question, how can we help through our customers, create a better tomorrow. 
And then given what's going on with the coronavirus and the vaccine, Slide 11, is probably a great highlight of our purpose and action and just how essential we are to the vaccine value chain. And the way to read this slide to go left to right and go in a clockwise fashion. I'll start in the upper left-hand corner. So we're in a development and production phase of these vaccines, mixing, purification, filtration and dispensing. Then you got to get the product moved around. So we are in sterile transport containers, especially designed. 
And then all of our motion control technologies are in both air and ground transportation to move the product around the world. You need to be able to store it locally and that requires low-temperature refrigeration. So our refrigeration technologies are at play there. Then when you administer to the patient, again, you need on-premise refrigeration, and then stoppers and trim seals as part of our engineered materials offering. 
So we're very proud to be part of this value chain and through our customers helping to create the better tomorrow that all of us, as I start this call, are striving for as we try to exit the pandemic and deliver billions of vaccines to people around the world over the next quarters and years. 
So if you move to Slide 12. My last slide for my opening comments, want to focus on our strategies to grow faster in the market. And our proxy for the market is global industrial production growth, which is GIPI that acronym. 
So on the left-hand side, it's a series of portfolio of things that you've seen us make transforming a portfolio of the company buying 3 great companies, $3 billion of acquired revenue that were all accretive on growth, cash and margins. As a matter of fact, as an example, LORD grew mid-single digits last quarter, while the rest of the company, total company grew minus 6%. On the right-hand side, is a list of organic growth strategies. And what's interesting about this list with the exception of international distribution, these are all new with Win Strategy 3.0. So I'm going to make a quick comment on each one. So strategic positioning is really our effort to focus on stronger divisional strategies. And we have a cadence with every division. We do 3 a month, and these are extremely productive conversations with our general managers to how they're going to position their division to win versus the competition. 
Second bullet, our innovation. We made 2 big changes. One is a metric PVI, which is product vitality index. It's a measure of new products as a percent of sales, looking at a 5-year period for new products. And then new product, blueprinting, which is that NPB acronym there, is really a change to our ideation process to create better ideas coming into the Winovation funnel. The output of what we're trying to do here is that we want our PVI context, the percent of sales, to grow by 600 basis points over the next 5 years. A more innovative portfolio, better chances to grow, better margins, et cetera. 
And then Simple by Design, I've talked a lot about that. It's a speed initiative. It's a cost initiative. It's a customer experience initiative. It's a recognition that 70% of your costs are tied up in how you design a product. And Simple by Design is all about focusing on design excellence. So when you put together design excellence with operational excellence, it's a dynamite pairing. International distribution is going to continue from the success we've had with 2.0. 
Digital leadership is really a 4-pronged attack. Digital customer experience, digital products, digital operations and digital productivity. And digital productivity is where we have a concerted effort on artificial intelligence and data analytics. 
And then lastly, a new incentive plan, our annual cash incentive plan. Our acronym, ACIP. And that's going to focus our divisions and the whole company on driving growth, cash and earnings. 
So it's this combination. And it's this combination that's helped us performed better on the top line organically, particularly in the current downturn, and it will be our catapult to growing fast in the market as we go forward. 
So with that, I'm going to hand it back to Todd with more details for the quarter."

If you look at the breakdown of the adjustments for the FY '22 -- or excuse me, FY '21 as reported numbers, it netted to $0.03 this quarter. And that is made up in the following buckets: Business realignment expenses of $0.14; integration cost to achieve of $0.02; acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.62. And as we communicated last quarter, we are adjusting out the gain on the sale of land that amounted to $0.77. And all in, the net tax impact of all of those adjustments is $0.02. 
Last year, our second quarter earnings per share were adjusted by $1.41. The details of which are included in the reconciliation tables for non-GAAP financial measures. 
If you move to Slide 15, this is just a walk from the $2.98 to $3.44 for the quarter. And despite organic sales declining 6% and total sales declining 2.5%, adjusted segment operating income increased by $70 million or $0.11. That equated to $0.42 per share. So a very strong operating beat for the quarter. 
Decremental margins on a year-over basis are favorable, demonstrating the excellent operational execution, robust cost containment by our team members really in every segment and every region. 
If you continue on the slide, we had a slight headwind from higher corporate G&A, just $0.02 that was a result of market-based adjustments to investment tied to deferred comp. And as Tom mentioned, our strong cash flow allowed us to pay off a significant portion of debt on a year-over-year basis that reduced our interest expense that equated to $0.12 for the quarter. 
And then if you look at the remaining items, other expense was just $0.01 slightly higher. We had a higher effective tax rate that impacted us by $0.03. And finally, slightly higher diluted shares resulted in a $0.02 impact, that's how we get to the $3.44. 
If you move to Slide 16, this is a savings from our cost out actions. I know there's been a lot of questions on this, just from some of the early reports. Just a reminder, these represent savings recognized in the year as a result of our discretionary actions in response to the pandemic and volume declines, plus the savings we realized from our permanent realignment actions taken in FY '20 and also in FY '21. 
So if you look at this, our second quarter discretionary savings exceeded our forecast and now amount to $190 million on a year-to-date basis. We are now forecasting for the full year that discretionary total will increase to $225 million or an increase of $50 million. The majority of that increase was recognized in the second quarter and roughly amounts to $35 million above our forecast. 
Just a reminder, as demand continues to increase and our team's pivot to support growth, we expect these discretionary savings to be lower in the second half. 
Permanent actions remain on track. There's no changes to what we have communicated previously. Our full year forecast will generate savings of $250 million, and that will be $210 million incremental. And we believe that this will help us generate the strong incremental margin that we have in our guide for the second half. 
If we move to Slide 17, this is just a walk of the total results for the company, sales and segment operating margin. And as Tom mentioned, organic sales did decline by 6.1% this year. The decline was partially offset by the contributions from acquisitions, that was 2.6%. And currency impact of 1%. And again, despite these lower sales, total adjusted segment operating margins improved to 20.4% versus 17.9% last year. This 250 basis point improvement reflects all the positive impacts from our Win Strategy initiatives, the hard work and dedication to cost containment and productivity improvements as well as savings from those realignment activities I just spoke of and really performance of the recent acquisition. So strong execution really across the entire company to get these results. 
If we jump into the segments, if you go to Slide 18, looking at diversified industrial North America, sales there declined by 5.9%, acquisitions were a plus of 3.1% and currency only slightly negatively impacted sales. But again, even with these lower sales, our operating margin for the second quarter on an adjusted basis increased sizably to 21.3%. Last year, it was 18.2%. So again, another impressive 310 basis point improvement focused on our long-term initiatives around Win Strategy, along with the productivity improvements, diligent cost containment actions and really some increased synergies we're seeing out of the LORD acquisition. 
So if we go to the next slide, Slide 19, for Diversified industrial international. Organic sales for the quarter increased by 3.1%, acquisitions added 3.2% and currency accounted for 3.5%. 
Again, strong operating performance here. For the quarter, we reached 20.3% of sales versus 16% in the prior year. And again, same story, Win Strategy initiatives, strong synergy growth and really our teams around the world rallying together in light of the pandemic. 
If we go to Slide 20 and talk about Aerospace Systems segment. And again, what we'll see here is a decline of 20.9% for the quarter, acquisitions helped us by 0.4%. And again, a small currency impact of 0.1%. Really, declines in the commercial businesses, both in the OEM and aftermarkets. End markets were the main impact, these were partially offset by higher sales in both military OEM and military aftermarket sales. 
Operating margins for the second quarter was 18% versus last year's 20.2%. This resulted in a decremental margin of 28.8%, which is in line with our expectations and really the result of all the previous actions we've taken to realign the Aerospace business to current market conditions, along with strong cost controls and really helping to offset the pandemic composed of a mix that we're seeing from the commercial and military businesses. 
Slide 21 is just some highlights on cash flow. Tom already mentioned this, but our operating cash flow activities increased 64% year-over-year to a record of $1.35 billion of cash. This is an impressive 20.4% of sales. Our global teams are really focused on this, very disciplined in managing our working capital across the world, and we're really focused on delivering strong cash flow generation. 
If you look at free cash flow, year-to-date, we now move to 19%. That's an increase of 78% versus prior year, and our cash flow conversion is now 164% versus 130% last year. So just strong cash flow performance from the team, very impressive results. 
If -- we wanted to just focus on orders real quick. Moving to Slide 22. Our orders came in at flat this year or this quarter, I should say, and that was really driven by plus 1% in our industrial North American businesses, plus 10% in our diversified industrial businesses and minus 18% on a 12-month basis in Aerospace. So all in, we came in flat. And that's the first time in 7 quarters, I believe, that numbers have been not negative. 
If we move to Slide 23 and the guidance, obviously, we have a pretty large guidance increase. We are now providing this on an as-reported and an adjusted basis. And based on the strong performance we just spoke of in the first half, all the current indicators that we see right now, we've increased our total outlook for sales to a year-over-year increase of 1.7% at the midpoint. 
This includes a forecasted organic decline of 3.4%, offset by increases from acquisitions of 2.9% and currency of 2.2%. And again, just a reminder, we've calculated the impact of currency to spot rates based on the quarter ending December 30, and we've held those rates steady as we look through the second half of our fiscal year.
In respect to margins, for adjusted operating margins by segment. At the midpoint, we are now forecasting to increase margins 150 basis points year-over-year, and that range is expected to be 20.2% to 20.4% for the full year. And if you note for items below segment operating income, there is a fairly significant difference between the as-reported estimate of $388 million, and the adjusted forecast of $487 million. The difference is that land sale that we spoke about, that's $101 million pretax, $76 million after tax. That was recognized as other income in Q2. And since that's an unusual onetime item, we are going to adjust that from -- we have adjusted that from our results.
Full year effective tax rate, no change. We still expect that to be 23%. And for the full year, the guidance range for earnings per share on an as-reported basis is now $11.90 to $12.40 or $12.15 at the midpoint. And on an adjusted per share basis, the guidance range is now $13.65 to $14.15 or $13.9 at the midpoint.
Adjustments to the as-reported forecast made in this guidance at a pretax level, include business realignment expenses of approximately $60 million for the year associated with savings projected from those actions to be $50 million in the current year. And acquisition and integration costs to achieve $50 million of expense. Synergy savings for the LORD acquisition are now projected to reach $100 million. That is an increase of $20 million from our prior stated numbers of $80 million, and that is included in our guidance. Exotic synergies remain and expected to be $2 million for the full year.
Just a reminder, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense is forecasted to be $322 million for the year. And some assumptions that we have baked into the guidance here. At the midpoint, our sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half. And both adjusted segment operating income and adjusted EPS is split 47% first half, 53% second half.
For the third quarter of FY '21, we are forecasting adjusted earnings per share to be $3.54 at the midpoint. And that excludes $0.57 or $97 million of acquisition-related amortization expense, the business realignment expense and integration costs to achieve for the quarter.
So if you look at -- move to Slide 24, this is really just a walk from our previous guide to our revised guide. We had guided at $12 per share last quarter, based on the strong second quarter performance, we exceeded our estimates by $1.06. And we mentioned this, but the improving demand environment, along with the strong operational performance, some additional extended discretionary savings, the permanent restructuring savings and increased LORD synergies, we feel confident in raising our forecasted margins, which adds $0.85 of segment operating income over the next 2 quarters for the remainder of the fiscal year. So the majority of this increase is based on operational performance.
This calculates to an estimated incremental margin of 41% for the second half. And then some other minor adjustments to the below segment operating income lines are a negative impact of $0.01. And that's a net of interest expense and income tax. So that's how we get to the $13.90. That is approximately a 16% increase from our prior guide.
So if I can direct you to Slide 25, I'll turn it back over to Tom for some comments."

We talked about the portfolio. It's a big competitive advantage of us at interconnectivity, a transformation on the 3 acquisitions and the fact that they're outgrowing and generating more cash and margins than legacy Parker. Our performance over the cycle, but I would just reflect in the last 5 years and just use round numbers, our margins are up 500 basis points. In a 5-year period of time, it was not necessarily the easiest 5-year period of time for industrial companies.
And then our Win Strategy 3.0 in particular and the purpose statement, are going to be the powerhouse behind exerting our performance into the future. So I give my thanks to everybody for all their hard work and the great results. And Gigi, I will hand it back to you for -- start the Q&A."

And then Aerospace get an improved from minus 25% to minus 18%. Pretty much North America and international improved throughout the whole quarter. And from our view, it looks like Aerospace is finding bottom. International piece, in particular, if you look at that plus 10%, that was EMEA, plus 7%; Asia, plus 13% and Latin America plus 27%. So pretty strong rebound across all of the particular regions internationally.
When I look at some of the higher level subsegments, so the major buckets outside of Aerospace, distribution get better, it was minus 14% the prior quarter to minus 6% this quarter. Industrial, things are stationary, went from minus 7% to plus 1.5%. And mobile saw the biggest improvement from minus 13% to plus 2.5%.
So we saw all the subsegments improved nicely with the largest recovery being at mobile. And when you look at our end markets in the 4 phases of growth, we have roughly about 30% of our end markets are in accelerating growth and about 2/3 are in decelerating, in decline. So we continue to move all the various end markets into either bottoming out and you saw our decline starting to turn for accelerating growth. And maybe I'll pause, Joe, I don't know if you want me to go through all the end markets, but that's the color we saw.
In distribution, we saw an entity stocking, which was encouraging. Our distributors, I would say, cautiously optimistic. They are being careful. There is some uncertainty, obviously, in the next 6 months. And what we're seeing from distribution is selective restocking, in particular, focusing on those longer lead time type of products that they can get ahead of demand and position themselves to take share, which we're happy to help them with that. And in general, what we're seeing from distribution, in some cases, with some of the OEMs is placing a little larger stock orders with scheduled releases over the next several quarters, which are all indicators of people, I think, trying to plan as a few things are turning and start to get ahead of things."

This has been based on our focus on kaizen for a long time. Many elements of our Win Strategy initiatives have helped drive that. 
But there's been strict cost containment by our teams really around the globe. What did surprise us a little bit was lower travel and lower discretionary expenses. That's why we increased the discretionary expenses for the remainder of the year. Just based on the current situation that we see in the world right now. But we do see that returning. Nowhere will it go back to the levels that we've seen in the past, but we do see it going up from where we're at now."

So we reduced the guide decline on organic for minus 7.5% to minus 3.5%. But I think what's probably the most interest to analysts and shareholders is what do we think the second half is going to be. 
So the second half, our assumptions in the guide is North America and international, both in that kind of that 6% to 7% positive organic growth. And Aerospace at around minus 11% for the second half. When we look at Q3, I'm going to focus on the top line, I'll come back to the decrementals and incrementals.
In Q3, we're going to see a slight improvement in the industrial portion of the company, about 100 basis points as there's still some uncertainty. And those orders I referred to earlier on, our scheduled releases are going out multiple quarters. We see Aerospace about the same as we had in Q2. And when we get to Q4, we've got North America in that upper teens, international of around plus 10% and Aerospace getting to flat. And that puts total Parker in Q4 in the low teens for Q4. So again, industrials for the second half in that plus 6% to 7% range. And Aerospace at minus 11%.
So when we think about the margin side of things, Q3 margins are going to be slightly less than Q2. And that's mainly from the reasons that Todd was describing, we're going to have less discretionary savings in Q2 than we had in Q3. Q3 is going to be around $25 million, and Q2 was $65 million. So you got $40 million less of discretionary savings going into Q3.
We'll still have a favorable MROS, and if people aren't familiar with what that term is that's basically you have less sales and you get more earnings. So you can't really calculate an incremental, but it's favorable.
And when we get to Q4, we've got approximate 30% MROS. I would just make the comment for Q4, really for the first half of FY '22, that the incremental MROS are going to be a tough comp for us. So the plus 30% this is, again, remember in Q4 prior period, we had the gargantuan discretionary cost out, all the big wage reductions at that time. 
If you were to make it like-for-like and take out discretionary actions from both periods. This would be greater than 60% incremental. And so it's -- the business is performing at a very high level, you'll see margins get a little better into Q4. That will be our highest margin quarter. And if you just look at for the second half, we go from 20.1%, that's the first half total company to 20.7% in the second half. So continued improvement and we're not going to stop there. Obviously, we -- our goal is to keep driving this as we go into FY '22."

We've been able to keep up with demand, keep up with our lead times.
And if you look at us historically, obviously, a pandemic is a unique phenomena. When we have periods of increased demand, we outservice our competitors. It's something we've proven time in and time out. I would love for us to have the opportunity to take share because our lead times and our customer experience will be better than our competitors. So I feel very good.
And on the supply chain side, we purposely laid out a strategy years ago to be local for local. So we make, buy and sell in the region for the region. So that supply chain strategy, that operational strategy allows us to be very flexible based on what's happening, to not have all our eggs in one basket in one particular region, to be overly exposed on trade tariffs and those type of things.

And our next corporate bond is not due till September of '22, and it's a nominal amount of $300 million. So we are going to be in a position with a much stronger balance sheet to look at capital deployment across all the veins.
Now in particular, you talked about M&A. So the lesson learned for us historically, is to never stop working the M&A pipeline. And so we're continuing to build those relationships. We are building those relationships across a couple of big themes. We want to be the consolidated choice within our space. We think we are the best -- we're the leader in the space, we think we're the best home, which means we'd like to be looking at anything within our space. 
In particular, though, if we only had a certain amount of money and all 8 of the technologies that I referred to earlier on were all on the table, we like to focus on filtration, engineered materials, instrumentation and aerospace. We think those -- you've seen us focus on those to date.
But I would tell you, we like the entire portfolio and what we've been working on is what you saw us do with the last 3 deals, buy companies that within very quickly or within a reasonable period of time with synergies can outgrow, can outpace margins, can outpace cash flow for the base business. And that's what we did, and that's going to be the flavor you're going to see as we go forward.

There's -- obviously, there's lessons learned that we've learned over the years and how to organize the project management office, what you're going to do on day 1. And there's really 2 big kind of veins that you're looking at, you're looking at all the integration tasks, those basic tasks of putting the businesses together and then your synergy task. 
We've learned to make sure you've got a dedicated integration team and you put the best and brightest people in those various leadership positions, put a great integration manager. But the key thing to remember is we're buying great companies. And they're bringing good things to us, and we're trying to bring good things to them as we become one team, and it's the concept of 1 plus 1 equals 3. 
So we're going to take the best of the acquisition and the best of Parker. And obviously, we work the Win Strategy. But we do give some latitude within the respective acquisitions to how they want to implement the Win Strategy. There's no -- it's not an option that you're going to implement it, but we give them latitude as to how they want to phase it in because, obviously, certain parts might be more applicable faster for respective acquisitions. We have a real robust cadence as far as review. And frankly, I think we've gotten pretty good at this and something we want to keep doing."

And we have the breadth of our technology. So we go to compete. And again, that's a distinguishing characteristic that we have around the world. We're not just competing as a Chinese fitting company or a Chinese hose company, we can put the whole portfolio technology to get in -- that discussion with the customer, they can't beat us when we're having a discussion around cost of ownership or the weight of the product or reliability, the ease of assembly, all those type of things that you can do when you're a multi technology.

The current climate is finding bottom, and it's going to be a slow turn coming back up. But my view over the next several years this is going to gradually show improvement.
Now what is that pace of improvement? I think it's going to mirror the pace of vaccine deliveries and the comfort that travelers feel. And I think you'll see resident -- personal travel come back much more aggressively. The business travel will come back, but will probably plateau at a certain level based on just the efficiencies of digital tools. But we're positioned to win right now with the kind of up margins in this current climate, and it's only going to get better going forward.
So with respect to M&A, I actually think this is a good time to look at M&A in the aerospace arena, depending on the right property and the right pricing, obviously. But I think the future is bright. Now it's going to be -- it's a long-cycle business, so it will turn slower than industrial turn would be. But again, if you're positioned to win now and you're going to have a gradual upturn, it speaks to nice incrementals and nice positive year-over-year changes for you over the next several years."

And the timing of the M&A, I think it's important to balance that -- those 2 crowds.
And not to get inside your M&A department here. But when you listed those 4 categories, can you just give us some sense of -- if you had your druthers, identical kind of assets, when you think of where you're positioned, your size, the competitive landscape and then obviously, how you view the cycle playing out.

But I want to come back to the very first thing and this is -- what I always remind the Board and I'll remind shareholders, we want to be able to consolidate our choice within our space. So those 8 motion control technologies that, I believe, was on Slide 4, is the space we play in. And we have a big advantage that we're not disparate pieces of businesses. With now 2/3 of this revenue come from people that buy from these -- all these technologies for 4 or more, we like all those technologies.
I think the thing you're going to see us look for is -- and the theme that you've seen with the last 3 deals is within a period of time depending on the synergies, they're going to be growth accretive, margin accretive and cash accretive. And that's a different strategy, I think, for the company.
Our tendency, we would prefer to buy things that are not ultra small. But if you just look at the histogram of the targets, it's more in the midsized category just because of the lay of the land. There's fewer of these really super large targets that you can look at. We will look at them, obviously. When I say midsize, what's changed for us versus the past is our midsize is now bigger. 
A midsized target for us would be envision an Exotic like deal, which, historically, would have been the largest deal in the history of the company before LORD and CLARCOR. So our appetite is there.
If I could go back, David, to a comment you made about the ISM, which I thought was a thoughtful comment. The power of this portfolio, besides being interconnected, is that the cycle is somewhat balance each other. 
So yes, we will see some near term, and we'll see how long near term turns out to be on the industrial portion of the company that's going to have much more robust macro conditions. But then following that, the Aerospace business is going to start to be healing. And I think sequentially, those time periods are going to be complementary to each other. The other part is that this 5-year period that I envision going forward, is going to be, I think, much easier for industrial companies in the last 5-year period because we went through 2 industrial recessions and a pandemic. I'm not knocking on wood here. I guess it's possible to have that happen again. But the odds are low that it would repeat. So I think it's a much better time. And we have enough self-help for all those people that I'd like you to encourage. We are no longer a short-cycle bet. We are bet over the cycle. And we have all kinds of room, Win Strategy 3.0 just started. And those FY '23 targets are not an endpoint. They're a mild market we're going to blow past."

I think you will continue to see us perform very well on converting on the incremental side. But just I would caution people incrementals for Q4 this year and for the first half of next year are going to be tough comps. 
We're going to try to flatten the field when we give you the results. So you'll be able to see the real incrementals of the company. But I think you would expect to see us north of 40% in the first couple of quarters and we glide down in the 30s. But we're going to be in a much -- that stair-step slide that I've showed for the last couple of quarters. Our intention is to keep raising the ceiling and raising the floor. So this next ceiling, this next cycle, our expectation is going to be higher than the last ceiling. We're doing it right now. This isn't even really a necessarily good period right now and we're breaking records on margins.
So I'm bullish because there's a lot of positive factors. If you just look at interest rates and what's happening with global industrial production forecast. In my view, a pent-up need for CapEx, given that there's been 2 industrial recessions in the last number of years. And aerospace cycle that will follow an industrial cycle so you get the benefit of those not being right on top of each other. And just a tremendous amount of self-help. 
A lot of what you've seen has propelled these margins to date as prior period restructuring in Win Strategy 2.0., Win Strategy 3.0, and I'm not just being biased because I'm a part author of it, it's better than 2.0, hands down. And you've only seen about a year of that in play. And so 3.0 is going to get -- has tremendous legs, so we have still a portfolio of self-help. And the big thing is that we're back in the capital deployment gain. 
So it will be a steady diet of dividends, share repurchase and acquisitions. And obviously, that formula, we're going to raise, I can assure all the shareholders listening. There will be a Q4 increase to the dividend. We're not going to break our track record. And then we'll continue to do what we've always done is look at the acquisitions versus share repurchase and try to make the best decision on behalf of shareholders for what is the best long-term return for them."

But I would just characterize, I feel better about this next several years than I do about what happened in the last 6 years at least in my time leading the company. Because I just think about, we went through a natural resource recession, we went through the most current recession and we had the pandemic. And so I think there is a need for industrial and infrastructure type of activities. I think aerospace will return longer term. So I just think there's a better, potentially more stable macro environment in the next couple of years."

And I guess just kind of related to that, all the while bringing up the segment operating margins within striking distance of your target even with arrow still on its back. At what point does gross margin become a limiter and you need to find yourself mixing higher on that front because the distance between the 2 is narrower than we see in most of our coverage. So at what point does that -- I mean, more differentiated growth or M&A mix like what you had with the award of Exotic, just any observation you would make on what it takes to get to the steps beyond?"

Our gross margin might look different than you compare to other companies because we embed a fair amount of SG&A into our cost of goods sold. So our gross probably has some of that in their versus other people might be booking their SG&A in different categories. 
But your question is stepping higher levels really, can margins continue to grow higher? And absolutely they can. If you look at what I was referring to earlier on about early days of Win Strategy 3.0 and all the initiatives we have underneath there, I feel very good about our potential there and just very strong legs of what the future can hold. You put that in place with maybe a little better macro environment, yes, you can have a little more volume induced leverage. And then we're coming into a period of time where we have a stronger balance sheet, so we can put that to work as well.
So well, I've told people before, maybe I'll close on this. If you like what's happened in the last 6 years in the environment we had with basically no macro help, the next several years are going to be fantastic.

Now before I move to Slide 4, I want to make a few opening comments. Calendar 2020 was an extremely difficult year to say the least, for all of us, both professionally and personally, and I hope all of you are staying safe. Our global team has come together like no other time in our history and has responded to this combination of a health and economic crisis. We've rallied around our purpose, in the Win Strategy. We've showed that Parker is an exceptional performer even in the most difficult of environments. 
I'd like to take this opportunity at the beginning here to thank our global team for this great performance. You're going to see evidence of that over the next couple of slides. 
If you go to Slide 4. One of our key competitive advantages are breadth of motion control technologies. We're now up to 2/3 of our revenue. This -- you heard me talk about this historically it was 60%. But now up to 2/3 of our revenue comes from customers who buy from 4 or more of these technologies. It's these interconnected technologies that enable us to create even more value for our customers and create a distinct competitive advantage versus our competitors. 
If you move to Slide 5, we just had outstanding performance in the quarter when running through some of the highlights. Top quartile safety performance, we had a 23% reduction of recordable incidents. This now makes 75% reduction for the last 5 years, which has been phenomenal. 
Sales decline was 2.5% year-over-year. You can see it was a little over 6% from an organic standpoint. This was significantly better than our guidance. And about a 50% plus improvement from where we were in Q1. Q2 was a record net income at $447 million. The EBITDA margin was a little over 23% as reported, or 20.8% adjusted. You can see the significant improvement versus prior 230 basis points. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was a record at 20.4% of sales. And then the table at the bottom there has got segment operating margin both as reported and adjusted basis, so I'd call your attention to the adjusted row, 20.4% segment operating margin adjusted. And again, a giant increase versus prior, plus 250 basis points. 
So there's a lot of numbers on this page. You have a lot of companies to track. So the easy way to remember this is this is the quarter we put up three 20s. And we happen to highlight that in gold. So greater than 20% EBITDA margin, CFOA margin and segment operating margin. So we're pretty proud of that, and those are all great results during a pandemic. So just a fantastic job by the whole team. 
If you go to Slide 6, we're going to talk about cash flow. Big cash flow quarter, paid down $767 million of debt in the quarter. If you look at the last 14 months, it's $2.8 billion of debt. This is a little over half of the acquisition debt that we took on with LORD and Exotic, just great progress there. You see the ratios in the middle of the page there. Of significance, if we go back a year ago, we were 4.0 and now we're at 2.7 on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis. And we've now reinstated effective in this quarter Q3, our 10b5-1 share repurchase program. 
So I'll move to the next slide, which is our transformation of the company. And hopefully, just the last 2 slides are indicative of how the company has transformed. But I'd like to give a little more color and context as to what we're doing. So if you move to Slide 8. This is our strategy summary page, and it's flanked on the left side with why we win, which you've heard me talk about this in the past, this is a list of our competitive advantages and I've highlighted them. So I'm not going to talk about them necessarily today. 
But there are historical success factors that will continue on into the future. I want to focus most of the time for my next couple of slides on where we're going. And I've got a slide on each one of these bullets. And the output of really this historical success factors and where we're going is that we want to be a top quartile company, and we want to stand out in the crowd, and we think we're doing that. So if you go to Slide 9. The Win Strategy, and this is 3.0. This is our business system. Pound for pound, this has been the most impactful change we've made to date, the Win Strategy. And it's going to be Win 3.0 in our purpose statement, they're going to be the powerhouse behind our future performance. 
Go to 10. You've seen our purpose statement, enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. This is a statement that everybody has really rallied around and found very inspirational within the company, has enabled everyone to connect their efforts to this higher calling, this higher purpose in life. And really it helps answer the question, how can we help through our customers, create a better tomorrow. 
And then given what's going on with the coronavirus and the vaccine, Slide 11, is probably a great highlight of our purpose in action and just how essential we are to the vaccine value chain. And the way to read this slide to go left to right and go in a clockwise fashion. I'll start in the upper left-hand corner. So we're in a development and production phase of these vaccines, mixing, purification, filtration and dispensing. Then you got to get the product moved around. So we are in sterile transport containers, specially designed. 
And then all of our motion control technologies are in both air and ground transportation to move the product around the world. You need to be able to store it locally and that requires low-temperature refrigeration. So our refrigeration technologies are at play there. Then when you administer to the patient, again, you need on-premise refrigeration, and then stoppers and syringe seals as part of our engineered materials offering. 
So we're very proud to be part of this value chain and through our customers helping to create the better tomorrow that all of us, as I start this call, are striving for as we try to exit the pandemic and deliver billions of vaccines to people around the world over the next quarters and years. 
So if you move to Slide 12. My last slide for my opening comments, want to focus on our strategies to grow faster in the market. And our proxy for the market is global industrial production growth, which is GIPI that acronym. 
So on the left-hand side, it's a series of portfolio of things that you've seen us make, transforming the portfolio of the company buying 3 great companies, $3 billion of acquired revenue that were all accretive on growth, cash and margins. As a matter of fact, as an example, LORD grew mid-single digits last quarter, while the rest of the company, total company grew minus 6%. On the right-hand side, is a list of organic growth strategies. And what's interesting about this list with the exception of international distribution, these are all new with Win Strategy 3.0. So I'm going to make a quick comment on each one. So strategic positioning is really our effort to focus on stronger divisional strategies. And we have a cadence with every division. We do 3 a month, and these are extremely productive conversations with our general managers to how they're going to position their division to win versus the competition. 
Second bullet, our innovation. We made 2 big changes. One is a metric PVI, which is product vitality index. It's a measure of new products as a percent of sales, looking at a 5-year period for new products. And then new product, blueprinting, which is that NPB acronym there, is really a change to our ideation process to create better ideas coming into the Winovation funnel. The output of what we're trying to do here is that we want our PVI context, the percent of sales, to grow by 600 basis points over the next 5 years. A more innovative portfolio, better chances to grow, better margins, et cetera. 
And then Simple by Design, I've talked a lot about that. It's a speed initiative. It's a cost initiative. It's a customer experience initiative. It's a recognition that 70% of your costs are tied up in how you design a product. And Simple by Design is all about focusing on design excellence. So when you put together design excellence with operational excellence, it's a dynamite pairing. International distribution is going to continue from the success we've had with 2.0. 
Digital leadership is really a 4-pronged attack. Digital customer experience, digital products, digital operations and digital productivity. And digital productivity is where we have a concerted effort on artificial intelligence and data analytics. 
And then lastly, a new incentive plan, our annual cash incentive plan. Our acronym, ACIP. And that's going to focus our divisions and the whole company on driving growth, cash and earnings. 
So it's this combination. And it's this combination that's helped us performed better on the top line organically, particularly in the current downturn, and it will be our catapult to growing fast in the market as we go forward. 
So with that, I'm going to hand it back to Todd with more details for the quarter."
295170,702236820,2240543,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Parker-Hannifin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. I'd like to direct everyone to Slide 14, and I'll just begin summarizing our strong second quarter results. This slide displays as reported and adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter and I'll focus on adjusted earnings per share.",1911,"Thanks, Tom. I'd like to direct everyone to Slide 14, and I'll just begin summarizing our strong second quarter results. This slide displays as reported and adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter and I'll focus on adjusted earnings per share. We generated $3.44 this quarter, and that compares to $2.98 last year. If you look at the breakdown of the adjustments for the FY '22 -- or excuse me, FY '21 as reported numbers, it netted to $0.03 this quarter. And that is made up in the following buckets: Business realignment expenses of $0.14; integration cost to achieve of $0.02; acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.62. And as we communicated last quarter, we are adjusting out the gain on the sale of land that amounted to $0.77. And all in, the net tax impact of all of those adjustments is $0.02. 
Last year, our second quarter earnings per share were adjusted by $1.41. The details of which are included in the reconciliation tables for non-GAAP financial measures. 
If you move to Slide 15, this is just a walk from the $2.98 to $3.44 for the quarter. And despite organic sales declining 6% and total sales declining 2.5%, adjusted segment operating income increased by $70 million or $0.11. That equated to $0.42 per share. So a very strong operating beat for the quarter. 
Decremental margins on a year-over basis are favorable, demonstrating the excellent operational execution, robust cost containment by our team members really in every segment and every region. 
If you continue on the slide, we had a slight headwind from higher corporate G&A, just $0.02 that was a result of market-based adjustments to investment tied to deferred comp. And as Tom mentioned, our strong cash flow allowed us to pay off a significant portion of debt on a year-over-year basis that reduced our interest expense that equated to $0.12 for the quarter. 
And then if you look at the remaining items, other expense was just $0.01 slightly higher. We had a higher effective tax rate that impacted us by $0.03. And finally, slightly higher diluted shares resulted in a $0.02 impact, that's how we get to the $3.44. 
If you move to Slide 16, this is a savings from our cost out actions. I know there's been a lot of questions on this, just from some of the early reports. Just a reminder, these represent savings recognized in the year as a result of our discretionary actions in response to the pandemic and volume declines, plus the savings we realized from our permanent realignment actions taken in FY '20 and also in FY '21. 
So if you look at this, our second quarter discretionary savings exceeded our forecast and now amount to $190 million on a year-to-date basis. We are now forecasting for the full year that discretionary total will increase to $225 million or an increase of $50 million. The majority of that increase was recognized in the second quarter and roughly amounts to $35 million above our forecast. 
Just a reminder, as demand continues to increase and our teams pivot to support growth, we expect these discretionary savings to be lower in the second half. 
Permanent actions remain on track. There's no changes to what we have communicated previously. Our full year forecast will generate savings of $250 million, and that will be $210 million incremental. And we believe that this will help us generate the strong incremental margin that we have in our guide for the second half. 
If we move to Slide 17, this is just a walk of the total results for the company, sales and segment operating margin. And as Tom mentioned, organic sales did decline by 6.1% this year. The decline was partially offset by the contributions from acquisitions, that was 2.6%. And currency impact of 1%. And again, despite these lower sales, total adjusted segment operating margins improved to 20.4% versus 17.9% last year. This 250 basis point improvement reflects all the positive impacts from our Win Strategy initiatives, the hard work and dedication to cost containment and productivity improvements as well as savings from those realignment activities I just spoke of and really performance of the recent acquisition. So strong execution really across the entire company to get these results. 
If we jump into the segments, if you go to Slide 18, looking at diversified industrial North America, sales there declined by 5.9%, acquisitions were a plus of 3.1% and currency only slightly negatively impacted sales. But again, even with these lower sales, our operating margin for the second quarter on an adjusted basis increased sizably to 21.3%. Last year, it was 18.2%. So again, another impressive 310 basis point improvement focused on our long-term initiatives around Win Strategy, along with the productivity improvements, diligent cost containment actions and really some increased synergies we're seeing out of the LORD acquisition. 
So if we go to the next slide, Slide 19, for Diversified Industrial International. Organic sales for the quarter increased by 3.1%, acquisitions added 3.2% and currency accounted for 3.5%.  Again, strong operating performance here. For the quarter, we reached 20.3% of sales versus 16% in the prior year. And again, same story, Win Strategy initiatives, strong synergy growth and really our teams around the world rallying together in light of the pandemic. 
If we go to Slide 20 and talk about Aerospace Systems segment. And again, what we'll see here is a decline of 20.9% for the quarter, acquisitions helped us by 0.4%. And again, a small currency impact of 0.1%. Really, declines in the commercial businesses, both in the OEM and aftermarkets. End markets were the main impact, these were partially offset by higher sales in both military OEM and military aftermarket sales. 
Operating margins for the second quarter was 18% versus last year's 20.2%. This resulted in a decremental margin of 28.8%, which is in line with our expectations and really the result of all the previous actions we've taken to realign the Aerospace business to current market conditions, along with strong cost controls and really helping to offset the pandemic composed of a mix that we're seeing from the commercial and military businesses. 
Slide 21 is just some highlights on cash flow. Tom already mentioned this, but our operating cash flow activities increased 64% year-over-year to a record of $1.35 billion of cash. This is an impressive 20.4% of sales. Our global teams are really focused on this, very disciplined in managing our working capital across the world, and we're really focused on delivering strong cash flow generation. 
If you look at free cash flow, year-to-date, we now move to 19%. That's an increase of 78% versus prior year, and our cash flow conversion is now 164% versus 130% last year. So just strong cash flow performance from the team, very impressive results. 
If -- we wanted to just focus on orders real quick. Moving to Slide 22. Our orders came in at flat this year or this quarter, I should say, and that was really driven by plus 1% in our industrial North American businesses, plus 10% in our diversified industrial businesses and minus 18% on a 12-month basis in Aerospace. So all in, we came in flat. And that's the first time in 7 quarters, I believe, that numbers have been not negative. 
If we move to Slide 23 and the guidance, obviously, we have a pretty large guidance increase. We are now providing this on an as-reported and an adjusted basis. And based on the strong performance we just spoke of in the first half, all the current indicators that we see right now, we've increased our total outlook for sales to a year-over-year increase of 1.7% at the midpoint. 
This includes a forecasted organic decline of 3.4%, offset by increases from acquisitions of 2.9% and currency of 2.2%. And again, just a reminder, we've calculated the impact of currency to spot rates based on the quarter ending December 30, and we've held those rates steady as we look through the second half of our fiscal year.
In respect to margins, for adjusted operating margins by segment. At the midpoint, we are now forecasting to increase margins 150 basis points year-over-year, and that range is expected to be 20.2% to 20.4% for the full year. And if you note for items below segment operating income, there is a fairly significant difference between the as-reported estimate of $388 million, and the adjusted forecast of $487 million. The difference is that land sale that we spoke about, that's $101 million pretax, $76 million after tax. That was recognized as other income in Q2. And since that's an unusual onetime item, we are going to adjust that from -- we have adjusted that from our results.
Full year effective tax rate, no change. We still expect that to be 23%. And for the full year, the guidance range for earnings per share on an as-reported basis is now $11.90 to $12.40 or $12.15 at the midpoint. And on an adjusted per share basis, the guidance range is now $13.65 to $14.15 or $13.9 at the midpoint.
Adjustments to the as-reported forecast made in this guidance at a pretax level, include business realignment expenses of approximately $60 million for the year associated with savings projected from those actions to be $50 million in the current year. And acquisition and integration costs to achieve $50 million of expense. Synergy savings for the LORD acquisition are now projected to reach $100 million. That is an increase of $20 million from our prior stated numbers of $80 million, and that is included in our guidance. Exotic synergies remain and expected to be $2 million for the full year.
Just a reminder, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense is forecasted to be $322 million for the year. And some assumptions that we have baked into the guidance here. At the midpoint, our sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half. And both adjusted segment operating income and adjusted EPS is split 47% first half, 53% second half.
For the third quarter of FY '21, we are forecasting adjusted earnings per share to be $3.54 at the midpoint. And that excludes $0.57 or $97 million of acquisition-related amortization expense, the business realignment expense and integration costs we achieved for the quarter.
So if you look at -- move to Slide 24, this is really just a walk from our previous guide to our revised guide. We had guided at $12 per share last quarter, based on the strong second quarter performance, we exceeded our estimates by $1.06. And we mentioned this, but the improving demand environment, along with the strong operational performance, some additional extended discretionary savings, the permanent restructuring savings and increased LORD synergies, we feel confident in raising our forecasted margins, which adds $0.85 of segment operating income over the next 2 quarters for the remainder of the fiscal year. So the majority of this increase is based on operational performance.
This calculates to an estimated incremental margin of 41% for the second half. And then some other minor adjustments to the below segment operating income lines are a negative impact of $0.01. And that's a net of interest expense and income tax. So that's how we get to the $13.90. That is approximately a 16% increase from our prior guide.
So if I can direct you to Slide 25, I'll turn it back over to Tom for some comments."

We talked about the portfolio. It's a big competitive advantage of us at interconnectivity, a transformation on the 3 acquisitions and the fact that they're outgrowing and generating more cash and margins than legacy Parker. Our performance over the cycle, but I would just reflect in the last 5 years and just use round numbers, our margins are up 500 basis points. In a 5-year period of time, it was not necessarily the easiest 5-year period of time for industrial companies.
And then our Win Strategy 3.0 in particular and the purpose statement, are going to be the powerhouse behind extending our performance into the future. So I give my thanks to everybody for all their hard work and the great results. And Gigi, I will hand it back to you for -- start the Q&A."

On the orders, Joe, we saw if you look at total Parker from minus 12% to 0% in North America to minus 11% to plus 1%. International from plus 4% -- minus 4% to plus 10%. And then Aerospace got an improvement from minus 25% to minus 18%. Pretty much North America and international improved throughout the whole quarter. And from our view, it looks like Aerospace is finding bottom. International piece, in particular, if you look at that plus 10%, that was EMEA, plus 7%; Asia, plus 13% and Latin America plus 27%. So pretty strong rebound across all of the particular regions internationally.
When I look at some of the higher level subsegments, so the major buckets outside of Aerospace, distribution got better, it was minus 14% the prior quarter to minus 6% this quarter. Industrial, things are stationary, went from minus 7% to plus 1.5%. And mobile saw the biggest improvement from minus 13% to plus 2.5%.
So we saw all the subsegments improved nicely with the largest recovery being at mobile. And when you look at our end markets in the 4 phases of growth, we have roughly about 30% of our end markets are in accelerating growth and about 2/3 are in decelerating, in decline. So we continue to move all the various end markets into either bottoming out and you saw our decline starting to turn for accelerating growth. And maybe I'll pause, Joe, I don't know if you want me to go through all the end markets, but that's the color we saw.
In distribution, we saw an entity stocking, which was encouraging. Our distributors, I would say, cautiously optimistic. They are being careful. There is some uncertainty, obviously, in the next 6 months. And what we're seeing from distribution is selective restocking, in particular, focusing on those longer lead time type of products that they can get ahead of demand and position themselves to take share, which we're happy to help them with that. And in general, what we're seeing from distribution, in some cases, with some of the OEMs is placing a little larger stock orders with scheduled releases over the next several quarters, which are all indicators of people, I think, trying to plan as a few things are turning and start to get ahead of things."

This has been based on our focus on kaizen for a long time. Many elements of our Win Strategy initiatives have helped drive that. 
But there's been strict cost containment by our teams really around the globe. What did surprise us a little bit was lower travel and lower discretionary expenses. That's why we increased the discretionary expenses for the remainder of the year. Just based on the current situation that we see in the world right now. But we do see that returning. Nowhere will it go back to the levels that we've seen in the past, but we do see it going up from where we're at now."

So we reduced the guide decline on organic for minus 7.5% to minus 3.5%. But I think what's probably of most interest to analysts and shareholders is what do we think the second half is going to be. 
So the second half, our assumptions in the guide is North America and international, both in that kind of that 6% to 7% positive organic growth. And Aerospace at around minus 11% for the second half. When we look at Q3, I'm going to focus on the top line, I'll come back to the decrementals and incrementals.
In Q3, we're going to see a slight improvement in the industrial portion of the company, about 100 basis points as there's still some uncertainty. And those orders I referred to earlier on, our scheduled releases are going out multiple quarters. We see Aerospace about the same as we had in Q2. And when we get to Q4, we've got North America in that upper teens, international of around plus 10% and Aerospace getting to flat. And that puts total Parker in Q4 in the low teens for Q4. So again, industrials for the second half in that plus 6% to 7% range. And Aerospace at minus 11%.
So when we think about the margin side of things, Q3 margins are going to be slightly less than Q2. And that's mainly from the reasons that Todd was describing, we're going to have less discretionary savings in Q2 than we had in Q3. Q3 is going to be around $25 million, and Q2 was $65 million. So you got $40 million less of discretionary savings going into Q3.
We'll still have a favorable MROS, and if people aren't familiar with what that term is that's basically you have less sales and you get more earnings. So you can't really calculate an incremental, but it's favorable.
And when we get to Q4, we've got approximate 30% MROS. I would just make the comment for Q4, really for the first half of FY '22, that the incremental MROS are going to be a tough comp for us. So the plus 30% this is, again, remember in Q4 prior period, we had the gargantuan discretionary cost out, all the big wage reductions at that time. 
If you were to make it like-for-like and take out discretionary actions from both periods, this would be greater than 60% incremental. And so it's -- the business is performing at a very high level, you'll see margins get a little better into Q4. That will be our highest margin quarter. And if you just look at for the second half, we go from 20.1%, that's the first half total company to 20.7% in the second half. So continued improvement and we're not going to stop there. Obviously, we -- our goal is to keep driving this as we go into FY '22."

We've done a great job of, I would say, almost exclusively, our cases originated from outside of work. And we've tried to take the position, we want people to be safe at home and safe at work. But we like them to be the safest possible they could be when they're at work. We're not immune to absenteeism type of things related to this. But it's not been a material impact to us. We've been able to keep up with demand, keep up with our lead times.
And if you look at us historically, obviously, a pandemic is a unique phenomena. When we have periods of increased demand, we outservice our competitors. It's something we've proven time in and time out. I would love for us to have the opportunity to take share because our lead times and our customer experience will be better than our competitors. So I feel very good.
And on the supply chain side, we purposely laid out a strategy years ago to be local for local. So we make, buy and sell in the region for the region. So that supply chain strategy, that operational strategy allows us to be very flexible based on what's happening, to not have all our eggs in one basket in one particular region, to be overly exposed on trade tariffs and those type of things. So we feel very good about where we are in supply chain."

Thank you for your comment and the recognition of progress it doesn't go unnoticed, and we do appreciate that. 
On the M&A side, what's been interesting and we're really happy about the cash flow and the ability to pay down debt is clearly ahead of schedule. And we're going to be in a position to come into this fiscal year, where all of our serviceable debt, the term loans and the CP that we took out for these acquisitions will be all paid off. And our next corporate bond is not due till September of '22, and it's a nominal amount of $300 million. So we are going to be in a position with a much stronger balance sheet to look at capital deployment across all the veins.
Now in particular, you talked about M&A. So the lesson learned for us historically, is to never stop working the M&A pipeline. And so we're continuing to build those relationships. We are building those relationships across a couple of big themes. We want to be the consolidated choice within our space. We think we are the best -- we're the leader in the space, we think we're the best home, which means we'd like to be looking at anything within our space. 
In particular, though, if we only had a certain amount of money and all 8 of the technologies that I referred to earlier on were all on the table, we like to focus on filtration, engineered materials, instrumentation and aerospace. We think those -- you've seen us focus on those to date.
But I would tell you, we like the entire portfolio and what we've been working on is what you saw us do with the last 3 deals, buy companies that within very quickly or within a reasonable period of time with synergies can outgrow, can outpace margins, can outpace cash flow for the base business. And that's what we did, and that's going to be the flavor you're going to see as we go forward. And if we don't find the right properties, we think we're a great investment, and we're going to invest in Parker and buy our shares."

But the key thing to remember is we're buying great companies. And they're bringing good things to us, and we're trying to bring good things to them as we become one team, and it's the concept of 1 plus 1 equals 3. 
So we're going to take the best of the acquisition and the best of Parker. And obviously, we work the Win Strategy. But we do give some latitude within the respective acquisitions to how they want to implement the Win Strategy. There's no -- it's not an option that you're going to implement it, but we give them latitude as to how they want to phase it in because, obviously, certain parts might be more applicable faster for respective acquisitions.

We're going to things that fly because there are stationary and things that have wheels under them. And the way we look at Aerospace is that we have its size to win in the current climate. The current climate is finding bottom, and it's going to be a slow turn coming back up. But my view over the next several years this is going to gradually show improvement.
Now what is that pace of improvement? I think it's going to mirror the pace of vaccine deliveries and the comfort that travelers feel. And I think you'll see resident -- personal travel come back much more aggressively. The business travel will come back, but will probably plateau at a certain level based on just the efficiencies of digital tools. But we're positioned to win right now with the kind of [ op ] margins in this current climate, and it's only going to get better going forward.
So with respect to M&A, I actually think this is a good time to look at M&A in the aerospace arena, depending on the right property and the right pricing, obviously. But I think the future is bright. Now it's going to be -- it's a long-cycle business, so it will turn slower than industrial turn would be. But again, if you're positioned to win now and you're going to have a gradual upturn, it speaks to nice incrementals and nice positive year-over-year changes for you over the next several years."

While the compounded crowd looks at your cash flow, the deleveraging and say, look, we can definitely move the ball forward here. This is not just an old ISM play. And the timing of the M&A, I think it's important to balance that -- those 2 crowds.
And not to get inside your M&A department here. But when you listed those 4 categories, can you just give us some sense of -- if you had your druthers, identical kind of assets, when you think of where you're positioned, your size, the competitive landscape and then obviously, how you view the cycle playing out. Of those, I mean would you prioritize them at all between filtration, engineered materials, filtration in aerospace?"

But I want to come back to the very first thing and this is -- what I always remind the Board and I'll remind shareholders, we want to be the consolidator of choice within our space. So those 8 motion control technologies that, I believe, was on Slide 4, is the space we play in. And we have a big advantage that we're not disparate pieces of businesses. With now 2/3 of this revenue come from people that buy from these -- all these technologies for 4 or more, we like all those technologies.
I think the thing you're going to see us look for is -- and the theme that you've seen with the last 3 deals is within a period of time depending on the synergies, they're going to be growth accretive, margin accretive and cash accretive. And that's a different strategy, I think, for the company.
Our tendency, we would prefer to buy things that are not ultra small. But if you just look at the histogram of the targets, it's more in the midsized category just because of the lay of the land. There's fewer of these really super large targets that you can look at. We will look at them, obviously. When I say midsize, what's changed for us versus the past is our midsize is now bigger. 
A midsized target for us would be envision an Exotic like deal, which, historically, would have been the largest deal in the history of the company before LORD and CLARCOR. So our appetite is there.
If I could go back, David, to a comment you made about the ISM, which I thought was a thoughtful comment. The power of this portfolio, besides being interconnected, is that the cycles somewhat balance each other. 
So yes, we will see some near term, and we'll see how long near term turns out to be on the industrial portion of the company that's going to have much more robust macro conditions. But then following that, the Aerospace business is going to start to be healing. And I think sequentially, those time periods are going to be complementary to each other. The other part is that this 5-year period that I envision going forward, is going to be, I think, much easier for industrial companies than the last 5-year period because we went through 2 industrial recessions and a pandemic. I'm not knocking on wood here. I guess it's possible to have that happen again. But the odds are low that it would repeat. So I think it's a much better time. And we have enough self-help for all those people that I'd like you to encourage. We are no longer a short-cycle bet. We are bet over the cycle. And we have all kinds of room, Win Strategy 3.0 just started. And those FY '23 targets are not an endpoint. They're a mile marker we're going to blow past."

I think you will continue to see us perform very well on converting on the incremental side. But just I would caution people incrementals for Q4 this year and for the first half of next year are going to be tough comps. 
We're going to try to flatten the field when we give you the results. So you'll be able to see the real incrementals of the company. But I think you would expect to see us north of 40% in the first couple of quarters and it may glide down in the 30s. But we're going to be in a much -- that stair-step slide that I've showed for the last couple of quarters. Our intention is to keep raising the ceiling and raising the floor. So this next ceiling, this next cycle, our expectation is going to be higher than the last ceiling. We're doing it right now. This isn't even really a necessarily good period right now and we're breaking records on margins.
So I'm bullish because there's a lot of positive factors. If you just look at interest rates and what's happening with global industrial production forecast. In my view, a pent-up need for CapEx, given that there's been 2 industrial recessions in the last number of years. And aerospace cycle that will follow an industrial cycle so you get the benefit of those not being right on top of each other. And just a tremendous amount of self-help. 
A lot of what you've seen that's propelled these margins to date is prior period restructuring in Win Strategy 2.0. Win Strategy 3.0, and I'm not just being biased because I'm a part author of it, it's better than 2.0, hands down. And you've only seen about a year of that in play. And so 3.0 is going to get -- has tremendous legs, so we have still a portfolio of self-help. And the big thing is that we're back in the capital deployment game. 
So it will be a steady diet of dividends, share repurchase and acquisitions. And obviously, that formula, we're going to raise, I can assure all the shareholders listening. There will be a Q4 increase to the dividend. We're not going to break our track record. And then we'll continue to do what we've always done is look at the acquisitions versus share repurchase and try to make the best decision on behalf of shareholders for what is the best long-term return for them."

But your question is stepping higher levels really, can margins continue to grow higher? And absolutely they can. If you look at what I was referring to earlier on about early days of Win Strategy 3.0 and all the initiatives we have underneath there, I feel very good about our potential there and just very strong legs of what the future can hold. You put that in place with maybe a little better macro environment, yes, you can have a little more volume induced leverage. And then we're coming into a period of time where we have a stronger balance sheet, so we can put that to work as well.

Now before I move to Slide 4, I want to make a few opening comments. Calendar 2020 was an extremely difficult year to say the least, for all of us, both professionally and personally, and I hope all of you are staying safe. Our global team has come together like no other time in our history and has responded to this combination of a health and economic crisis. We've rallied around our purpose, in the Win Strategy. We've showed that Parker is an exceptional performer even in the most difficult of environments. 
I'd like to take this opportunity at the beginning here to thank our global team for this great performance. You're going to see evidence of that over the next couple of slides. 
If you go to Slide 4. One of our key competitive advantages are breadth of motion control technologies. We're now up to 2/3 of our revenue. This -- you heard me talk about this historically it was 60%. But now up to 2/3 of our revenue comes from customers who buy from 4 or more of these technologies. It's these interconnected technologies that enable us to create even more value for our customers and create a distinct competitive advantage versus our competitors. 
If you move to Slide 5, we just had outstanding performance in the quarter when running through some of the highlights. Top quartile safety performance, we had a 23% reduction of recordable incidents. This now makes 75% reduction for the last 5 years, which has been phenomenal. 
Sales decline was 2.5% year-over-year. You can see it was a little over 6% from an organic standpoint. This was significantly better than our guidance. And about a 50% plus improvement from where we were in Q1. Q2 was a record net income at $447 million. The EBITDA margin was a little over 23% as reported, or 20.8% adjusted. You can see the significant improvement versus prior 230 basis points. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was a record at 20.4% of sales. And then the table at the bottom there has got segment operating margin both as reported and adjusted basis, so I'd call your attention to the adjusted row, 20.4% segment operating margin adjusted. And again, a giant increase versus prior, plus 250 basis points. 
So there's a lot of numbers on this page. You have a lot of companies to track. So the easy way to remember this is this is the quarter we put up three 20s. And we happen to highlight that in gold. So greater than 20% EBITDA margin, CFOA margin and segment operating margin. So we're pretty proud of that, and those are all great results during a pandemic. So just a fantastic job by the whole team. 
If you go to Slide 6, we're going to talk about cash flow. Big cash flow quarter, paid down $767 million of debt in the quarter. If you look at the last 14 months, it's $2.8 billion of debt. This is a little over half of the acquisition debt that we took on with LORD and Exotic, just great progress there. You see the ratios in the middle of the page there. Of significance, if we go back a year ago, we were 4.0 and now we're at 2.7 on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis. And we've now reinstated effective in this quarter Q3, our 10b5-1 share repurchase program. 
So I'll move to the next slide, which is our transformation of the company. And hopefully, just the last 2 slides are indicative of how the company has transformed. But I'd like to give a little more color and context as to what we're doing. So if you move to Slide 8. This is our strategy summary page, and it's flanked on the left side with why we win, which you've heard me talk about this in the past, this is a list of our competitive advantages and I've highlighted them. So I'm not going to talk about them necessarily today. 
But there are historical success factors that will continue on into the future. I want to focus most of the time for my next couple of slides on where we're going. And I've got a slide on each one of these bullets. And the output of really this historical success factors and where we're going is that we want to be a top quartile company, and we want to stand out in the crowd, and we think we're doing that. So if you go to Slide 9. The Win Strategy, and this is 3.0. This is our business system. Pound for pound, this has been the most impactful change we've made to date, the Win Strategy. And it's going to be Win 3.0 in our purpose statement, they're going to be the powerhouse behind our future performance. 
Go to 10. You've seen our purpose statement, enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. This is a statement that everybody has really rallied around and found very inspirational within the company, has enabled everyone to connect their efforts to this higher calling, this higher purpose in life. And really it helps answer the question, how can we help through our customers, create a better tomorrow. 
And then given what's going on with the coronavirus and the vaccine, Slide 11, is probably a great highlight of our purpose in action and just how essential we are to the vaccine value chain. And the way to read this slide to go left to right and go in a clockwise fashion. I'll start in the upper left-hand corner. So we're in a development and production phase of these vaccines, mixing, purification, filtration and dispensing. Then you got to get the product moved around. So we are in sterile transport containers, specially designed. 
And then all of our motion control technologies are in both air and ground transportation to move the product around the world. You need to be able to store it locally and that requires low-temperature refrigeration. So our refrigeration technologies are at play there. Then when you administer to the patient, again, you need on-premise refrigeration, and then stoppers and syringe seals as part of our engineered materials offering. 
So we're very proud to be part of this value chain and through our customers helping to create the better tomorrow that all of us, as I start this call, are striving for as we try to exit the pandemic and deliver billions of vaccines to people around the world over the next quarters and years. 
So if you move to Slide 12. My last slide for my opening comments, want to focus on our strategies to grow faster in the market. And our proxy for the market is global industrial production growth, which is GIPI that acronym. 
So on the left-hand side, it's a series of portfolio of things that you've seen us make, transforming the portfolio of the company buying 3 great companies, $3 billion of acquired revenue that were all accretive on growth, cash and margins. As a matter of fact, as an example, LORD grew mid-single digits last quarter, while the rest of the company, total company grew minus 6%. On the right-hand side, is a list of organic growth strategies. And what's interesting about this list with the exception of international distribution, these are all new with Win Strategy 3.0. So I'm going to make a quick comment on each one. So strategic positioning is really our effort to focus on stronger divisional strategies. And we have a cadence with every division. We do 3 a month, and these are extremely productive conversations with our general managers to how they're going to position their division to win versus the competition. 
Second bullet, our innovation. We made 2 big changes. One is a metric PVI, which is product vitality index. It's a measure of new products as a percent of sales, looking at a 5-year period for new products. And then new product, blueprinting, which is that NPB acronym there, is really a change to our ideation process to create better ideas coming into the Winovation funnel. The output of what we're trying to do here is that we want our PVI context, the percent of sales, to grow by 600 basis points over the next 5 years. A more innovative portfolio, better chances to grow, better margins, et cetera. 
And then Simple by Design, I've talked a lot about that. It's a speed initiative. It's a cost initiative. It's a customer experience initiative. It's a recognition that 70% of your costs are tied up in how you design a product. And Simple by Design is all about focusing on design excellence. So when you put together design excellence with operational excellence, it's a dynamite pairing. International distribution is going to continue from the success we've had with 2.0. 
Digital leadership is really a 4-pronged attack. Digital customer experience, digital products, digital operations and digital productivity. And digital productivity is where we have a concerted effort on artificial intelligence and data analytics. 
And then lastly, a new incentive plan, our annual cash incentive plan. Our acronym, ACIP. And that's going to focus our divisions and the whole company on driving growth, cash and earnings. 
So it's this combination. And it's this combination that's helped us performed better on the top line organically, particularly in the current downturn, and it will be our catapult to growing fast in the market as we go forward. 
So with that, I'm going to hand it back to Todd with more details for the quarter."
295170,702236820,2240618,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Parker-Hannifin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. I'd like to direct everyone to Slide 14, and I'll just begin summarizing our strong second quarter results. This slide displays as reported and adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter and I'll focus on adjusted earnings per share.",1911,"Thanks, Tom. I'd like to direct everyone to Slide 14, and I'll just begin summarizing our strong second quarter results. This slide displays as reported and adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter and I'll focus on adjusted earnings per share. We generated $3.44 this quarter, and that compares to $2.98 last year. If you look at the breakdown of the adjustments for the FY '22 -- or excuse me, FY '21 as reported numbers, it netted to $0.03 this quarter. And that is made up in the following buckets: Business realignment expenses of $0.14; integration cost to achieve of $0.02; acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.62. And as we communicated last quarter, we are adjusting out the gain on the sale of land that amounted to $0.77. And all in, the net tax impact of all of those adjustments is $0.02. 
Last year, our second quarter earnings per share were adjusted by $1.41. The details of which are included in the reconciliation tables for non-GAAP financial measures. 
If you move to Slide 15, this is just a walk from the $2.98 to $3.44 for the quarter. And despite organic sales declining 6% and total sales declining 2.5%, adjusted segment operating income increased by $70 million or $0.11. That equated to $0.42 per share. So a very strong operating beat for the quarter. 
Decremental margins on a year-over basis are favorable, demonstrating the excellent operational execution, robust cost containment by our team members really in every segment and every region. 
If you continue on the slide, we had a slight headwind from higher corporate G&A, just $0.02 that was a result of market-based adjustments to investment tied to deferred comp. And as Tom mentioned, our strong cash flow allowed us to pay off a significant portion of debt on a year-over-year basis that reduced our interest expense that equated to $0.12 for the quarter. 
And then if you look at the remaining items, other expense was just $0.01 slightly higher. We had a higher effective tax rate that impacted us by $0.03. And finally, slightly higher diluted shares resulted in a $0.02 impact, that's how we get to the $3.44. 
If you move to Slide 16, this is a savings from our cost out actions. I know there's been a lot of questions on this, just from some of the early reports. Just a reminder, these represent savings recognized in the year as a result of our discretionary actions in response to the pandemic and volume declines, plus the savings we realized from our permanent realignment actions taken in FY '20 and also in FY '21. 
So if you look at this, our second quarter discretionary savings exceeded our forecast and now amount to $190 million on a year-to-date basis. We are now forecasting for the full year that discretionary total will increase to $225 million or an increase of $50 million. The majority of that increase was recognized in the second quarter and roughly amounts to $35 million above our forecast. 
Just a reminder, as demand continues to increase and our teams pivot to support growth, we expect these discretionary savings to be lower in the second half. 
Permanent actions remain on track. There's no changes to what we have communicated previously. Our full year forecast will generate savings of $250 million, and that will be $210 million incremental. And we believe that this will help us generate the strong incremental margin that we have in our guide for the second half. 
If we move to Slide 17, this is just a walk of the total results for the company, sales and segment operating margin. And as Tom mentioned, organic sales did decline by 6.1% this year. The decline was partially offset by the contributions from acquisitions, that was 2.6%. And currency impact of 1%. And again, despite these lower sales, total adjusted segment operating margins improved to 20.4% versus 17.9% last year. This 250 basis point improvement reflects all the positive impacts from our Win Strategy initiatives, the hard work and dedication to cost containment and productivity improvements as well as savings from those realignment activities I just spoke of and really performance of the recent acquisition. So strong execution really across the entire company to get these results. 
If we jump into the segments, if you go to Slide 18, looking at diversified industrial North America, sales there declined by 5.9%, acquisitions were a plus of 3.1% and currency only slightly negatively impacted sales. But again, even with these lower sales, our operating margin for the second quarter on an adjusted basis increased sizably to 21.3%. Last year, it was 18.2%. So again, another impressive 310 basis point improvement focused on our long-term initiatives around Win Strategy, along with the productivity improvements, diligent cost containment actions and really some increased synergies we're seeing out of the LORD acquisition. 
So if we go to the next slide, Slide 19, for Diversified Industrial International. Organic sales for the quarter increased by 3.1%, acquisitions added 3.2% and currency accounted for 3.5%.  Again, strong operating performance here. For the quarter, we reached 20.3% of sales versus 16% in the prior year. And again, same story, Win Strategy initiatives, strong synergy growth and really our teams around the world rallying together in light of the pandemic. 
If we go to Slide 20 and talk about Aerospace Systems segment. And again, what we'll see here is a decline of 20.9% for the quarter, acquisitions helped us by 0.4%. And again, a small currency impact of 0.1%. Really, declines in the commercial businesses, both in the OEM and aftermarkets. End markets were the main impact, these were partially offset by higher sales in both military OEM and military aftermarket sales. 
Operating margins for the second quarter was 18% versus last year's 20.2%. This resulted in a decremental margin of 28.8%, which is in line with our expectations and really the result of all the previous actions we've taken to realign the Aerospace business to current market conditions, along with strong cost controls and really helping to offset the pandemic composed of a mix that we're seeing from the commercial and military businesses. 
Slide 21 is just some highlights on cash flow. Tom already mentioned this, but our operating cash flow activities increased 64% year-over-year to a record of $1.35 billion of cash. This is an impressive 20.4% of sales. Our global teams are really focused on this, very disciplined in managing our working capital across the world, and we're really focused on delivering strong cash flow generation. 
If you look at free cash flow, year-to-date, we now move to 19%. That's an increase of 78% versus prior year, and our cash flow conversion is now 164% versus 130% last year. So just strong cash flow performance from the team, very impressive results. 
If -- we wanted to just focus on orders real quick. Moving to Slide 22. Our orders came in at flat this year or this quarter, I should say, and that was really driven by plus 1% in our industrial North American businesses, plus 10% in our diversified industrial businesses and minus 18% on a 12-month basis in Aerospace. So all in, we came in flat. And that's the first time in 7 quarters, I believe, that numbers have been not negative. 
If we move to Slide 23 and the guidance, obviously, we have a pretty large guidance increase. We are now providing this on an as-reported and an adjusted basis. And based on the strong performance we just spoke of in the first half, all the current indicators that we see right now, we've increased our total outlook for sales to a year-over-year increase of 1.7% at the midpoint. 
This includes a forecasted organic decline of 3.4%, offset by increases from acquisitions of 2.9% and currency of 2.2%. And again, just a reminder, we've calculated the impact of currency to spot rates based on the quarter ending December 30, and we've held those rates steady as we look through the second half of our fiscal year.
In respect to margins, for adjusted operating margins by segment. At the midpoint, we are now forecasting to increase margins 150 basis points year-over-year, and that range is expected to be 20.2% to 20.4% for the full year. And if you note for items below segment operating income, there is a fairly significant difference between the as-reported estimate of $388 million, and the adjusted forecast of $487 million. The difference is that land sale that we spoke about, that's $101 million pretax, $76 million after tax. That was recognized as other income in Q2. And since that's an unusual onetime item, we are going to adjust that from -- we have adjusted that from our results.
Full year effective tax rate, no change. We still expect that to be 23%. And for the full year, the guidance range for earnings per share on an as-reported basis is now $11.90 to $12.40 or $12.15 at the midpoint. And on an adjusted per share basis, the guidance range is now $13.65 to $14.15 or $13.9 at the midpoint.
Adjustments to the as-reported forecast made in this guidance at a pretax level, include business realignment expenses of approximately $60 million for the year associated with savings projected from those actions to be $50 million in the current year. And acquisition and integration costs to achieve $50 million of expense. Synergy savings for the LORD acquisition are now projected to reach $100 million. That is an increase of $20 million from our prior stated numbers of $80 million, and that is included in our guidance. Exotic synergies remain and expected to be $2 million for the full year.
Just a reminder, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense is forecasted to be $322 million for the year. And some assumptions that we have baked into the guidance here. At the midpoint, our sales are divided 48% first half, 52% second half. And both adjusted segment operating income and adjusted EPS is split 47% first half, 53% second half.
For the third quarter of FY '21, we are forecasting adjusted earnings per share to be $3.54 at the midpoint. And that excludes $0.57 or $97 million of acquisition-related amortization expense, the business realignment expense and integration costs we achieved for the quarter.
So if you look at -- move to Slide 24, this is really just a walk from our previous guide to our revised guide. We had guided at $12 per share last quarter, based on the strong second quarter performance, we exceeded our estimates by $1.06. And we mentioned this, but the improving demand environment, along with the strong operational performance, some additional extended discretionary savings, the permanent restructuring savings and increased LORD synergies, we feel confident in raising our forecasted margins, which adds $0.85 of segment operating income over the next 2 quarters for the remainder of the fiscal year. So the majority of this increase is based on operational performance.
This calculates to an estimated incremental margin of 41% for the second half. And then some other minor adjustments to the below segment operating income lines are a negative impact of $0.01. And that's a net of interest expense and income tax. So that's how we get to the $13.90. That is approximately a 16% increase from our prior guide.
So if I can direct you to Slide 25, I'll turn it back over to Tom for some comments."

We talked about the portfolio. It's a big competitive advantage of us at interconnectivity, a transformation on the 3 acquisitions and the fact that they're outgrowing and generating more cash and margins than legacy Parker. Our performance over the cycle, but I would just reflect in the last 5 years and just use round numbers, our margins are up 500 basis points. In a 5-year period of time, it was not necessarily the easiest 5-year period of time for industrial companies.
And then our Win Strategy 3.0 in particular and the purpose statement, are going to be the powerhouse behind extending our performance into the future. So I give my thanks to everybody for all their hard work and the great results. And Gigi, I will hand it back to you for -- start the Q&A."

On the orders, Joe, we saw if you look at total Parker from minus 12% to 0% in North America to minus 11% to plus 1%. International from plus 4% -- minus 4% to plus 10%. And then Aerospace got an improvement from minus 25% to minus 18%. Pretty much North America and international improved throughout the whole quarter. And from our view, it looks like Aerospace is finding bottom. International piece, in particular, if you look at that plus 10%, that was EMEA, plus 7%; Asia, plus 13% and Latin America plus 27%. So pretty strong rebound across all of the particular regions internationally.
When I look at some of the higher level subsegments, so the major buckets outside of Aerospace, distribution got better, it was minus 14% the prior quarter to minus 6% this quarter. Industrial, things are stationary, went from minus 7% to plus 1.5%. And mobile saw the biggest improvement from minus 13% to plus 2.5%.
So we saw all the subsegments improved nicely with the largest recovery being at mobile. And when you look at our end markets in the 4 phases of growth, we have roughly about 30% of our end markets are in accelerating growth and about 2/3 are in decelerating, in decline. So we continue to move all the various end markets into either bottoming out and you saw our decline starting to turn for accelerating growth. And maybe I'll pause, Joe, I don't know if you want me to go through all the end markets, but that's the color we saw.
In distribution, we saw an entity stocking, which was encouraging. Our distributors, I would say, cautiously optimistic. They are being careful. There is some uncertainty, obviously, in the next 6 months. And what we're seeing from distribution is selective restocking, in particular, focusing on those longer lead time type of products that they can get ahead of demand and position themselves to take share, which we're happy to help them with that. And in general, what we're seeing from distribution, in some cases, with some of the OEMs is placing a little larger stock orders with scheduled releases over the next several quarters, which are all indicators of people, I think, trying to plan as a few things are turning and start to get ahead of things."

This has been based on our focus on kaizen for a long time. Many elements of our Win Strategy initiatives have helped drive that. 
But there's been strict cost containment by our teams really around the globe. What did surprise us a little bit was lower travel and lower discretionary expenses. That's why we increased the discretionary expenses for the remainder of the year. Just based on the current situation that we see in the world right now. But we do see that returning. Nowhere will it go back to the levels that we've seen in the past, but we do see it going up from where we're at now."

So we reduced the guide decline on organic for minus 7.5% to minus 3.5%. But I think what's probably of most interest to analysts and shareholders is what do we think the second half is going to be. 
So the second half, our assumptions in the guide is North America and international, both in that kind of that 6% to 7% positive organic growth. And Aerospace at around minus 11% for the second half. When we look at Q3, I'm going to focus on the top line, I'll come back to the decrementals and incrementals.
In Q3, we're going to see a slight improvement in the industrial portion of the company, about 100 basis points as there's still some uncertainty. And those orders I referred to earlier on, our scheduled releases are going out multiple quarters. We see Aerospace about the same as we had in Q2. And when we get to Q4, we've got North America in that upper teens, international of around plus 10% and Aerospace getting to flat. And that puts total Parker in Q4 in the low teens for Q4. So again, industrials for the second half in that plus 6% to 7% range. And Aerospace at minus 11%.
So when we think about the margin side of things, Q3 margins are going to be slightly less than Q2. And that's mainly from the reasons that Todd was describing, we're going to have less discretionary savings in Q2 than we had in Q3. Q3 is going to be around $25 million, and Q2 was $65 million. So you got $40 million less of discretionary savings going into Q3.
We'll still have a favorable MROS, and if people aren't familiar with what that term is that's basically you have less sales and you get more earnings. So you can't really calculate an incremental, but it's favorable.
And when we get to Q4, we've got approximate 30% MROS. I would just make the comment for Q4, really for the first half of FY '22, that the incremental MROS are going to be a tough comp for us. So the plus 30% this is, again, remember in Q4 prior period, we had the gargantuan discretionary cost out, all the big wage reductions at that time. 
If you were to make it like-for-like and take out discretionary actions from both periods, this would be greater than 60% incremental. And so it's -- the business is performing at a very high level, you'll see margins get a little better into Q4. That will be our highest margin quarter. And if you just look at for the second half, we go from 20.1%, that's the first half total company to 20.7% in the second half. So continued improvement and we're not going to stop there. Obviously, we -- our goal is to keep driving this as we go into FY '22."

When we look at COVID and its impact, we're mirroring case rates in the local communities that we're at. We've done a great job of, I would say, almost exclusively, our cases originated from outside of work. And we've tried to take the position, we want people to be safe at home and safe at work. But we like them to be the safest possible they could be when they're at work. We're not immune to absenteeism type of things related to this. But it's not been a material impact to us. We've been able to keep up with demand, keep up with our lead times.
And if you look at us historically, obviously, a pandemic is a unique phenomena. When we have periods of increased demand, we outservice our competitors. It's something we've proven time in and time out. I would love for us to have the opportunity to take share because our lead times and our customer experience will be better than our competitors. So I feel very good.
And on the supply chain side, we purposely laid out a strategy years ago to be local for local. So we make, buy and sell in the region for the region. So that supply chain strategy, that operational strategy allows us to be very flexible based on what's happening, to not have all our eggs in one basket in one particular region, to be overly exposed on trade tariffs and those type of things. So we feel very good about where we are in supply chain."

Thank you for your comment and the recognition of progress it doesn't go unnoticed, and we do appreciate that. 
On the M&A side, what's been interesting and we're really happy about the cash flow and the ability to pay down debt is clearly ahead of schedule. And we're going to be in a position to come into this fiscal year, where all of our serviceable debt, the term loans and the CP that we took out for these acquisitions will be all paid off. And our next corporate bond is not due till September of '22, and it's a nominal amount of $300 million. So we are going to be in a position with a much stronger balance sheet to look at capital deployment across all the veins.
Now in particular, you talked about M&A. So the lesson learned for us historically, is to never stop working the M&A pipeline. And so we're continuing to build those relationships. We are building those relationships across a couple of big themes. We want to be the consolidated choice within our space. We think we are the best -- we're the leader in the space, we think we're the best home, which means we'd like to be looking at anything within our space. 
In particular, though, if we only had a certain amount of money and all 8 of the technologies that I referred to earlier on were all on the table, we like to focus on filtration, engineered materials, instrumentation and aerospace. We think those -- you've seen us focus on those to date.
But I would tell you, we like the entire portfolio and what we've been working on is what you saw us do with the last 3 deals, buy companies that within very quickly or within a reasonable period of time with synergies can outgrow, can outpace margins, can outpace cash flow for the base business. And that's what we did, and that's going to be the flavor you're going to see as we go forward. And if we don't find the right properties, we think we're a great investment, and we're going to invest in Parker and buy our shares."

So we're going to take the best of the acquisition and the best of Parker. And obviously, we work the Win Strategy. But we do give some latitude within the respective acquisitions to how they want to implement the Win Strategy. There's no -- it's not an option that you're going to implement it, but we give them latitude as to how they want to phase it in because, obviously, certain parts might be more applicable faster for respective acquisitions.

The current climate is finding bottom, and it's going to be a slow turn coming back up. But my view over the next several years this is going to gradually show improvement.
Now what is that pace of improvement? I think it's going to mirror the pace of vaccine deliveries and the comfort that travelers feel. And I think you'll see resident -- personal travel come back much more aggressively. The business travel will come back, but will probably plateau at a certain level based on just the efficiencies of digital tools. But we're positioned to win right now with the kind of [ op ] margins in this current climate, and it's only going to get better going forward.
So with respect to M&A, I actually think this is a good time to look at M&A in the aerospace arena, depending on the right property and the right pricing, obviously. But I think the future is bright. Now it's going to be -- it's a long-cycle business, so it will turn slower than industrial turn would be.

But I want to come back to the very first thing and this is -- what I always remind the Board and I'll remind shareholders, we want to be the consolidator of choice within our space. So those 8 motion control technologies that, I believe, was on Slide 4, is the space we play in. And we have a big advantage that we're not disparate pieces of businesses. With now 2/3 of this revenue come from people that buy from these -- all these technologies for 4 or more, we like all those technologies.
I think the thing you're going to see us look for is -- and the theme that you've seen with the last 3 deals is within a period of time depending on the synergies, they're going to be growth accretive, margin accretive and cash accretive. And that's a different strategy, I think, for the company.
Our tendency, we would prefer to buy things that are not ultra small. But if you just look at the histogram of the targets, it's more in the midsized category just because of the lay of the land. There's fewer of these really super large targets that you can look at. We will look at them, obviously. When I say midsize, what's changed for us versus the past is our midsize is now bigger. 
A midsized target for us would be envision an Exotic like deal, which, historically, would have been the largest deal in the history of the company before LORD and CLARCOR. So our appetite is there.
If I could go back, David, to a comment you made about the ISM, which I thought was a thoughtful comment. The power of this portfolio, besides being interconnected, is that the cycles somewhat balance each other. 
So yes, we will see some near term, and we'll see how long near term turns out to be on the industrial portion of the company that's going to have much more robust macro conditions. But then following that, the Aerospace business is going to start to be healing. And I think sequentially, those time periods are going to be complementary to each other. The other part is that this 5-year period that I envision going forward, is going to be, I think, much easier for industrial companies than the last 5-year period because we went through 2 industrial recessions and a pandemic. I'm not knocking on wood here. I guess it's possible to have that happen again. But the odds are low that it would repeat. So I think it's a much better time. And we have enough self-help for all those people that I'd like you to encourage. We are no longer a short-cycle bet. We are bet over the cycle. And we have all kinds of room, Win Strategy 3.0 just started. And those FY '23 targets are not an endpoint. They're a mile marker we're going to blow past."

I think you will continue to see us perform very well on converting on the incremental side. But just I would caution people incrementals for Q4 this year and for the first half of next year are going to be tough comps. 
We're going to try to flatten the field when we give you the results. So you'll be able to see the real incrementals of the company. But I think you would expect to see us north of 40% in the first couple of quarters and it may glide down in the 30s. But we're going to be in a much -- that stair-step slide that I've showed for the last couple of quarters. Our intention is to keep raising the ceiling and raising the floor. So this next ceiling, this next cycle, our expectation is going to be higher than the last ceiling. We're doing it right now. This isn't even really a necessarily good period right now and we're breaking records on margins.
So I'm bullish because there's a lot of positive factors. If you just look at interest rates and what's happening with global industrial production forecast. In my view, a pent-up need for CapEx, given that there's been 2 industrial recessions in the last number of years. And aerospace cycle that will follow an industrial cycle so you get the benefit of those not being right on top of each other. And just a tremendous amount of self-help. 
A lot of what you've seen that's propelled these margins to date is prior period restructuring in Win Strategy 2.0. Win Strategy 3.0, and I'm not just being biased because I'm a part author of it, it's better than 2.0, hands down. And you've only seen about a year of that in play. And so 3.0 is going to get -- has tremendous legs, so we have still a portfolio of self-help. And the big thing is that we're back in the capital deployment game. 
So it will be a steady diet of dividends, share repurchase and acquisitions. And obviously, that formula, we're going to raise, I can assure all the shareholders listening. There will be a Q4 increase to the dividend. We're not going to break our track record. And then we'll continue to do what we've always done is look at the acquisitions versus share repurchase and try to make the best decision on behalf of shareholders for what is the best long-term return for them."

So our gross probably has some of that in there versus other people might be booking their SG&A in different categories. 
But your question is stepping higher levels really, can margins continue to grow higher? And absolutely they can. If you look at what I was referring to earlier on about early days of Win Strategy 3.0 and all the initiatives we have underneath there, I feel very good about our potential there and just very strong legs of what the future can hold. You put that in place with maybe a little better macro environment, yes, you can have a little more volume induced leverage. And then we're coming into a period of time where we have a stronger balance sheet, so we can put that to work as well.
So well, I've told people before, maybe I'll close on this. If you like what's happened in the last 6 years in the environment we had with basically no macro help, the next several years are going to be fantastic.

Before I jump into Slide 3 and the quarter, I want to say thank you to all the Parker team members around the world for an outstanding quarter. It's really more than just this quarter, it's really been the w",1505,"Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everybody. 
Before I jump into Slide 3 and the quarter, I want to say thank you to all the Parker team members around the world for an outstanding quarter. It's really more than just this quarter, it's really been the whole year and the performance to the pandemic and also the transformation of the company into a top quartile diversified industrial company. These results are all because of your efforts. 
So let's look at the quarter on top of Slide 3. Starting with safety, as we always do, we had a 33% reduction in record incidents. We're still in the top quartile. The combination of safety, lean, our high-performance team structure in Kaizen, were all driving high engagement and high performance, you see that show up in our results. 
Sales grew about 1%. The organic decline was minus 1%, but in particular, if you take out aerospace and look at the industrial only, industrial segment grew organically almost 4%, so that was significant. We had 5 all-time quarterly records. You can see the net income, EPS, and the segment registered for Parker, North America and international. EBITDA margin was very strong at 21.6% as reported, 21.8% adjusted a huge increase versus prior 250 basis points year-to-date cash flow was an all-time record of $1.9 billion and 18 -- a little over 18% of sales. If you go to the very last row of this page, you see segment operating margin on an adjusted basis, 21.4% and again, a significant improvement versus prior, plus 240 basis points. So a terrific quarter and really tough conditions. 
If you go to the next slide. I want to talk about the transformation of the company. The old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words, and so I want to take you to Slide 5, and this is really the picture that speaks to the transformation of the company. 
Let me explain the chart here for a minute. So you've got in gold Bars, the adjusted EPS. The blue line is global PMI plotted on a quarterly basis. If you look at the last 6 years and look at that dotted green line, and compare that to the blue global PMI line, you see they are much less correlated effect there divergent. And there's been a step change in performance. The EPS over this time period is more than doubled from $7 to our guidance of $14.80, so approaching $15 and was propelled that over that time period as an EBITDA margin that's grown 600 basis points. So you might ask how, how that happened? It's really that blue takeaway at the bottom of the page, it's our people. That focus the alignment, the engagement that comes when you have people think and act like an owner. The portfolio, which is a combination of our interconnected technologies and the value they bring and the capital deployment we've done buying some great companies that have added to the strength of the company. Then our performance, which really sits with the strategy of the company, Win Strategy 2.0, at the kind of the beginning of this journey and then The Win Strategy 3.0 most recently in FY '20. 
So this combination is really transformed the company. You see that as evidenced in this slide, and we're very proud of it. But if you go to Slide 6. So that's what's kind of in the rearview mirror. But going forward, we're equally excited about where the company is going to go. And I call this a convergence of positive inflection point. So on the left-hand side is kind of those external inflection points. You're familiar with a lot of these, the macro environment industrial momentum, you see that in our positive orders and positive organic growth industrial we showed in this quarter. Aerospace is going to recover, question is just what the trajectory will be and the timing. Vaccines are making progress around the world. There's going to be a significant amount of climate investment. And if you put all that on top of it, I didn't write all these down, but low interest rates pent-up CapEx demand and fiscal spending, you have a very attractive environment for industrials for the next several years. 
On the right-hand side is really the internal things we've been doing, Win Strategy 3.0, in particular, but that last slide that I just went through, spoke to all those internal actions because that's what's been propelling us. Remember that last period -- last 6 years, really had very little help from a macro standpoint. So you look at the 3 major things I highlight here, performance becoming top quartile strategies to grow faster in the market. You've seen our margin expansion, great cash flow generation consistently over the cycle. Portfolio, we've added 3 great companies, all accretive on growth cash and margins. 
And with the rapid debt paydown that we've done, we're positioned to do future capital deployment, which is very exciting. 
The technology, I'll get into in the next slide, but the interconnected technologies really is distinctive for us. And then with a climate investment, we are very well positioned with our suite of clean technologies to take advantage of that. So I would tell you that my view and the team's view this is about as good an environment as we've seen in a number of years. 
Go to Slide 7. You've heard me talk about this page. The power of this interconnectedness technology brings the value accretion for customers what I want to do today in light of the clean technology discussion is give you 4 examples of how this suite of technologies helps with a more clean environment, clean technology world. So the first would be electrification. And we've got a full portfolio of technologies here, hydraulic, electrohydraulic, pneumatic, electromechanical, no competitors got that breadth of technologies. And we formed about 4 years ago, the Motion Technology center, which put the best and brightest of engineers to Motion technologies, things that fly as well as things with wheels underneath them. So we put the motion and the aerospace teams together. And this team has come up with a great listing of products around motors, inverters and controllers. But there's also in addition to the typical motion opportunities, there's other challenges around electrification like lightweighting, thermal management, shielding, structural adhesives and noise vibration, all these to accomplish what we have a legacy engineered materials and with the LORD acquisition, we're well positioned to take advantage of those. Secondary is batteries and fuel cells that utilize most of the technologies see on this page, third would be clean power sources and that kind of falls into 2 buckets: Renewables, which we do a lot -- we've always have done a lot of wind and solar; Then the hydrogen, we just recently joined the Hydrogen Council, and it's going to be both onboard as well as infrastructure opportunities as you go out for the next many years. And it's really building in our high-pressure and our cryogenic applications that we have today. 
And then we've been a more sustainable company for a long time and really the a clean technology example for us that started a lot of things is filtration. And our filtration business protects and purifies assets and equipment for people for a more sustainable environment. So we feel very good about this portfolio for climate investment in the future. 
Going to Slide 8. I just want to remind you of our purpose statement enabling engineering brakes that lead into a better tomorrow, it's been very inspirational for our team. And I think it comes more to light when we give you examples of the purpose in action, which is on Slide 9. And again, kind of following with that clean technology discussion, when I'd highlight electrification, I'm going to highlight in particular, electric vehicles. On the left-hand side, you see applications that are changed because of an HEV or EV versus a combustion engine. On the right-hand side, you see the various technologies that Parker has that addresses those applications. I won't read all those under the Bayou see the major category, safety, related technologies, things that say, weight, thermal management and a variety of things we do critical protection. The big opportunity for us, so we obviously are in the factories helping to make these vehicles, and we'll always do that. But the big opportunity for us is the onboard content around Engineered materials. Our bill of material for an EV or HEV is 10x what it was in a combustion engine. And it's one of the key reasons why our LORD business has grown so nicely even despite the pandemic, we grew 11% organically in Q3 from LORD. So we're very happy with the progress so far and our purpose and action around electrification as an example. 
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Todd for more details on the quarter."
295170,711878152,2262876,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Parker-Hannifin Corporation","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Tom. I'll just orientate everyone to Slide 11, and I'll do a quick review of the financial results for the quarter. Tom mentioned some of these, so I'll try to move quickly. Sales for the quarter were $3.746 billion. That is an increase of 1",1919,"Okay. Thanks, Tom. I'll just orientate everyone to Slide 11, and I'll do a quick review of the financial results for the quarter. Tom mentioned some of these, so I'll try to move quickly. Sales for the quarter were $3.746 billion. That is an increase of 1.2% versus prior year. 
We are proud of the fact that the Diversified industrial segment did turn positive organically. Industrial segment organic growth was 3.7%. Obviously, that was offset by the Aerospace Systems segment, their organic decline was 19.7%. So all in, that drove total organic sales to minus   1.0  %. Currency was a favorable impact this quarter of 2.2%. And just a note in respect to acquisitions, this is the first full quarter that we report both LORD and exotic in our organic growth numbers. So therefore, the acquisition impact was zero. Moving to segment operating margins. You saw the number, 21.4%, that's an improvement of 240 basis points from prior year. It's also an improvement of 130 basis points sequentially, strong margin performance there. And that really was a result of just broad-based execution of the Win strategy. We continue to manage our cost in a disciplined manner. The portfolio additions in CLARCOR, LORD and Exotic are all performing soundly. And you've all been familiar with the restructuring activities that we've done in FY '20 and in FY '21. Those are on track and on planned and generating the savings that we expected. 
Adjusted EBITDA margins did expand 250 basis points from prior year, finished the quarter at 21.8%. And net income is $540 million, which is a 14.4% ROS, that's increased by 22% from prior year. Adjusted EPS is $4.11, that is $0.72 or 21% increase compared to prior year's results of $3.39. And as Tom said, it's just really outstanding performance. And I'd also too like to commend our global team members for generating these results. 
If you slide to Slide 12, this is really a bridge of that $0.72 increase in adjusted EPS versus prior year. And the story here across the board is just strong execution from all of our businesses. This produced robust incrementals in our Diversified Industrial segment and really commendable decrementals in the Aerospace Systems segment. Adjusted segment operating income did increase by $98 million or 14% versus prior year, that equates to $0.58 of EPS and really is the primary driver of the increase in our adjusted EPS number. Interest expense was favorable to prior by $0.12 as we posted yet another quarter of sizable repayment of our serviceable debt, and that is really benefiting from our strong cash flow generation. 
Other expense, income tax and shares netted to a $0.02 favorable impact compared to prior year. Moving to Slide 13. This is just an update on our discretionary and permanent cost out actions. And this is just a reminder, these represent both savings recognized in the current fiscal year from our discretionary actions in response to the pandemic and our permanent realignment actions that were taken at the end of FY '20 and throughout FY '21. 
Discretionary statements came in exactly as we guided, at $25 million for Q3, and now total $215 million year-to-date. There is no change to our discretionary savings forecast for Q4. That remains $10 million. And we continue to forecast the total year to be $225 million in full year savings. 
Just to note, with the increased demand levels that we're seeing from our positive order entry, our teams have really pivoted to growth and really now these discretionary actions that we knew would diminish across the calendar year have now really been based in reduced travel expenses. If you move to permanent savings, we realized $65 million in Q3. Our total year-to-date is $190 million. The full year forecast, again, here remains, as previously communicated, at $250 million. One item to note, we did guide that the cost of the FY '21 restructuring would come in around $60 million. It's now expected to be $10 million less or $50 million but there is no change to the expected savings that we are forecasting. Total incremental impact for the year for both permanent and discretionary savings is $260 million. And just one other thing to note, this will probably be the last quarter that we detail these items as we anniversary the pandemic-induced volume declines and really focus our attention on growth. 
So the takeaway is savings are on track, no changes other than the expense will be a little bit less. If you go to Slide 14, this is just highlighting some items from our segment performance for the third quarter. In our diversified North America business, sales were $1.76 billion. That is an improvement in organic sales sequentially from Q2. It still is down 1.2% from prior year, but if you look at the adjusted operating margins, we did increase those operating margins by 190 basis points versus prior year and reached 21.9% for the quarter. 
We were able to increase these margins despite that sales decline due to our disciplined cost management, those portfolio improvements we've talked about and really, margins in this segment are at a record level. If you slide over to order rates, another positive here, they improved significantly from plus   1   last quarter, and they're now ending the quarter at plus   11  %. Looking at the diversified industrial international sales, robust organic growth here of 11.1%. Total sales came in at $1.39 billion, and another great story here, adjusted operating margins expanded substantially and reached 21.6%, an improvement of 400 basis points versus prior year. Clearly, the double-digit organic growth, coupled with the cost containment and the effort from our global team really generated this level of record margin performance as well. And again, another plus here is order rates accelerated in this segment and are now plus   14  % for the quarter. If you look at aerospace systems, they continue to really perform soundly in the current environment, sales were $599 million for the quarter. Organic sales showed a slight sequential improvement from Q2, but are still down basically 20% from prior year. Commercial end markets are still under pressure. However, there is strength in our military end markets. What's nice here is operating margins were   19.4  %, 30 basis points better than prior year. Despite that 20% decline in volume. And if you look at our fiscal year, that performance of   19.4  % is the highest they've done all year, so we're really proud about that. 
Decremental margins are also impressive here in this segment. This quarter, they're 18% decremental margins. Order rates appeared to have bottomed and finished at minus 19% for this quarter. And just a reminder, that is on a rolling 12-month basis. So overall, we're pleased about a number of things this quarter. That diversified industrial segment, organic growth of 3.7% as a positive. Total segment margins improved 240 basis points from prior year and at record levels. Orders have turned positive and are plus 6%, and our teams really continue to leverage the Win Strategy to drive significant improvements in our business and increased productivity and generate strong cash flow. 
So with that, I'll ask you to go to Slide 15. This is just some details on our cash flow. Year-to-date cash flow from operations is now $1.9 billion. That's 18.1% of sales. That's up 45% from prior year, and it is a year-to-date record. Improved net income margin, as we've talked about before, is really a key driver in this. It's created a step change in our cash flow generation, but I'd also like to commend our team members' intense focus on our working capital metrics. Each of our working capital metrics is improving and showing positive results, and I'm really proud about that. Moving to free cash flow at 16.8% of sales. That's an increase of 630 basis points over prior year, and our free cash flow conversion is now 141%, which compares to   122  % in the prior year, so great cash flow generation there. 
Moving to Slide 16. I just want to mention some things we've done on our capital deployment. We did pay down $426 million of debt this quarter. That brings our total debt reduction to a little over $3.2 billion in the last 17 months since the LORD acquisition closed. 
This reduced our gross debt-to-EBITDA to   2.4  %, it was   3.8  % in the prior year, and net debt-to-EBITDA is now 2.2%, and that's down from 3.5% in the prior year. 
Looking at dividends. Last week, you saw our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase of $0.15 or 17%. This raises our quarterly dividend from $0.88 to $1.03 per share and extends our record of increasing the annual dividends paid per share to 65 consecutive years. And finally, as we mentioned at the Q2 earnings release, we reinstated our 10b5 program and repurchased $50 million of shares in the quarter. 
All right. So if you go to Slide 17, I'll just provide some color to the increase in guidance that we gave this morning, really, the strong year-to-date performance and these order trends have positioned us to increase our full year outlook for sales to a year-over-year increase of 4.5% at the midpoint. And the breakdown of that sales change is this. 
Organic sales are now expected to be flat year-over-year. Acquisitions will add 3%, and the full year currency impact is expected to be 1.5%. We've calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of the quarter ended March 31 and we held those rates constant to estimate the Q4 21 impact. Moving to segment operating margins. Our guidance for the full year is raised to 20.8% and  that would equate to an increase of 190 basis points versus prior year. And just some additional color, some things to note. Corporate G&A, interest and other is expected to be $381 million on an as-reported basis. And $479 million on an adjusted basis. The main difference between those 2 numbers is that $101 million pretax or $76 million after-tax gain on real estate that we recognized and adjusted in the other income line in Q2. That's the main item. If you look at our tax rates down just a little bit. We're now expecting the full year tax rate to be 22.5%. And moving to EPS on a full year basis. Our as-reported EPS guidance range has increased from $12.96 to $13.26, that's $13.11 at the midpoint. And on an adjusted basis, we're increasing the range from $14.65 to $14.95, and that's $14.80 at the midpoint. For Q4, adjusted EPS is projected to be $4.18 per share, that excludes $0.54 or $93 million of acquisition-related amortization expense, the finishing of our business realignment expenses and integration costs to achieve. 
If you look at Slide 18, this is just the bridge of our increase to our adjusted EPS guidance. These results that we just reviewed, you can see the outperformance that we had in Q3. That increases our previous guide by $0.57. The order strength that we just reviewed and really the exceptional operation and execution by our teams have allowed us to increase Q4 guide by an additional $0.33, and that is exclusively based on increased segment operating income. This raises our full year EPS guide by about 6.5% from prior guide. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for some summary comments and ask you to move to Slide 19."

Can we have above average sort of incrementals and how the discretionary costs sort of factor back in an impact incremental margins? And then I guess my second question is regards to your longer-term margin targets, which you're already starting to beat those targets. So in particular, with volumes not really showing up in your numbers. I'm just trying to think about how we position your margins longer term, potentially, to be at a higher structural level?"

The one thing I would point out is our guidance for Q4 is incrementals of about 30%. And if you were to do like-for-like and take out the discretionary savings we had in the Q4 prior period, may be about 50% incremental. 
So they'd be at the incrementals that we feel based on the cost structure and all the things we've done with Win 2.0, Win 3.0, that we would generate at this point in the cycle. So that's -- we would continue to do 30%. I think as we go into '22, obviously, we're not guiding to that yet, but I think that's a good round number to use for us. But I highlight Q4 because it is impacted by the prior period discretionary, which we don't have now or not as much. And that difference is pretty significant. We go from a   30   to a plus   50   incremental. So it speaks to the underlying power of the business is there. 
And then on your question on long-term margin targets, yes, this is a good problem that we have, that we basically beat our targets by about 2 years. Our guide at 20.8% at the midpoint on op margin is within split distance of the '21. And then EBITDA, we don't guide on EBITDA margins will be at the 21% for a full year on EBITDA. So we're actively working on what this new set of targets will be. And I'm sure this is a question everybody had. So we're going to disclose them at IR day, which will be March of next year. And we think that's the appropriate forum to do that, but rest assured, we're working on it and we're not going to settle or be happy with stopping with where we're at, we're going to continue to march forward. And we'll give you that vision when we have Investor Day."

I mean, one of our strengths historically is when there is a spike in demand, our supply chain and the fact that we make, buy and sell local-for-local and our manufacturing footprint, which is diversified around the world, has typically been more responsive than our competitors. And then what we've done with 3.0 and adding Kaizen, and when -- as I started with my opening comments, when you link the safety performance, lean, Kaizen and the high-performance teams, think of the high-performance teams is the structure, how we run the various sales and value streams. You've got a very powerful combination and as we do Kaizens, we keep finding ways to free up capacity, free of floor space, free of capacity and our equipment. We're able to do what we call more simple automation category, which is uses the only free thing in life, which is gravity. And if you saw these, these are gravity induced material handling things and simple automation in the factories, has allowed us to be responsive to this demand. So I think we're well positioned. Obviously, we're going to have to continue to invest, which we will, but we just found ways to do it more efficiently. And Kaizen has been kind of the great liberator for us to be able to do that. On the channel, the channel has been, to your point, has been consolidating over the last number of years. I think it's a better position than it's ever been to respond. We did see nice growth in distribution sequentially. And our distributors are investing in some inventory for the future. And I think they'll be a position to respond. Obviously, we take share through them as well as through our OEMs going direct. And we've got a great distribution team. Our partners are strong. We've got a great distribution sales force. The distributors have been investing in application engineers and have been relying on us to be better in supply chain, and in their eyes, we can continue to do better, but we have made quite a bit of stride on that. So I think both of those will be well positioned to take advantage of this upturn."

There in the commercial side, it will be all based on we will be based on line rates from the OEMs, the airframers.

And you'll continue to see speed solidated choice. We think we're still the best home of these motion control properties. But we'll also look at the other areas that you've seen us build on in the last several years. And hopefully, by now, people feel good about our track record. We've -- the last 3, got a lot of fanfare. We've been good at this for a long time. We've done 80 deals in the last 20 years. And I think you'll see us to continue to be active on that. First and foremost, for us, the dividends, we were very excited to clip that dollar mark on a quarterly basis. And you'll see us stay on top of that. Our net income is going to grow. And we're going to stay on top of those dividends to match the net income growth. We'll continue to invest in the company organically in productivity. And if we don't find the right properties, which our preference would be to do deals because it drives cash and EBITDA growth, we think we're a great investment, and we'll buy shares on a discretionary basis on top of a 10b5-1. But the pipeline is active and more to come on that."

I'm looking at a commodity chart right now, which has got trends year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, going back to the last big inflation period. It's a core. But the thing I would say about our team is we saw this coming early on as we did this. And as you know, we've got really 2 great internal processes inside the company. It's how we track our PPI, which our input cost and how we track our selling price index to make sure that we always maintain this margin neutral kind of role. So we've been active with price through the distribution channel, and we'll continue to do that. We're fortunate to have great contracts in place with many OEMs that have raw material cost escalators in them. But our goal on the whole pricing side is to be margin neutral. We've done that before, we'll continue to do that. On the supply chain side, I would say, just echo what Tom said earlier, the biggest benefit is our business model. So we design, source, make, sell in the region for the region. Everything you read about in the paper, we're not immune to that. I mean there's still things that happen on a day-to-day basis. But I would just tell you, from a company standpoint, it's not material. 
I mean, we manage it day in and day out. So on pricing, I think we're active in a good place on the supply chain side. We're managing it. The model is set up. So I don't think we'll get hurt, and it's really not going to be material."

Just thinking about this idea, Tom, of trying to break the gravitational pull of the PMI. Actually, 2 questions. One, just kind of maybe fundamental in the business and maybe a second kind of philosophical. First, obviously, the PMI is a broad industrial benchmark, right? Have you considered that calling your segments diversified industrial just suggests you are an industrial proxy? Perhaps some kind of different earnings presentation would make sense. You give us this global technology platforms, but we don't know anything about the profitability of those subsegments. 
So that's more of a philosophical question. I wonder if you've thought about that. And then secondly, although most of your business is short cycle, right, I would argue, it's really a broad mix of early, mid and late. And I think, to some degree, people confuse short with early I just wonder if you could kind of give us some rough buckets.

First of all, that whole PMI gravitational pull, that's one of the reasons besides, I think it's just a great way to describe the company when we did Slide 5 and that's, for those of you who are not looking at your slides, that's the whole PMI versus our EPS trend. And I hope you -- all people got the point there, this company is dramatically and have underlying dramatically different and yes, we'll never be completely detached from PMIs because obviously that represents total manufacturing activity, and we would benefit from that. But we didn't get much help from that over the last 6 years, and you've seen us double EPS and add 600 basis points to EBITDA margins. So we'll continue that. And hopefully, people recognize that we don't need the macros to help us. We have enough self help with 2.0 and 3.0 to keep lasting us for many, many years. The current environment is going to get better. So we are going to get some up with that. Your comment philosophically on reporting segments, yes, that's been a raging internal debate for many, many years. There's pros and cons to a probably longer discussion than I can do on an earnings call. But we continue to think that representing the way we do today is the best way because if you go back to those 8 to 10 technologies, and the fact that 2/3 of our revenue comes from customers who buy and perform all those technologies. That's exactly how we go to market. We don't go-to-market specifically with one-off technologies all the time. We go to market, to look at our commercial teams, leveraging that breadth of technology. So that's how we're representing the company to shareholders is exactly how we go to market. Now we early versus mid versus late I'm not even going to try to do that. 
Other than I'm going to reinforce your point, yes, we are a mixture. And obviously, you can look at aerospace, and we characterize that as long. But where do you want to put EV? EV, we're feeling that now, but EV is a long-term change that's going to happen. Where do you want to put all the clean technologies. I could add up all the things I talked about on that 1 slide related to clean technology, and you get a pretty significant percentage of the company. Obviously, hydrogen's long, very long cycle, what's happening there. Electrification is a little more near term. So it's -- I think unfairly, we've been characterized as early and maybe because it just historically how we used to report orders on a monthly basis. And people could see those things sooner. I think we're a good mix. And I think, hopefully, over the last 6 years, people recognize we're a good bet you want to bet your money embedded on this team."

Before I jump into Slide 3 and the quarter, I want to say thank you to all the Parker team members around the world for an outstanding quarter. It's really more than just this quarter, it's really been the who",1511,"Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everybody. Before I jump into Slide 3 and the quarter, I want to say thank you to all the Parker team members around the world for an outstanding quarter. It's really more than just this quarter, it's really been the whole year and the performance through the pandemic and also the transformation of the company into a top quartile diversified industrial company. These results are all because of your efforts. 
So let's look at the quarter on top of Slide 3. Starting with safety, as we always do, we had a 33% reduction in recordable incidents. We're still in the top quartile. The combination of safety, Lean, our high-performance team structure and Kaizen were all driving high engagement and high performance and you see that show up in our results. 
Sales grew about 1%. The organic decline was minus 1%. But in particular, if you take out Aerospace and look at the Industrial only, Industrial segment grew organically almost 4%, so that was significant. 
We had 5 all-time quarterly records. You can see that in net income, EPS and the segment margins for Parker, North America and International. 
EBITDA margin was very strong at 21.6% as reported, 21.8% adjusted, a huge increase versus prior 250 basis points. 
Year-to-date cash flow was an all-time record of $1.9 billion and 18 -- a little over 18% of sales. 
If you go to the very last row of this page, you see segment operating margin on adjusted basis, 21.4%, again, a significant improvement versus prior, plus 240 basis points. 
So a terrific quarter in really tough conditions. 
If you go to the next slide. I want to talk about the transformation of the company. The old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words and so I want to take you to Slide 5, and this is really the picture that speaks to the transformation of the company. 
Let me explain the chart here for a minute. So you've got in gold bars the adjusted EPS. The blue line is global PMI plotted on a quarterly basis. If you look at the last 6 years and look at that dotted green line and compare that to the blue global PMI line, you see they are much less correlated. In fact, they are diverging. And there's been a step change in performance. The EPS over this time period is more than doubled from $7 to our guidance of $14.80, so approaching $15. And what's propelled that over that time period is an EBITDA margin that's grown 600 basis points. 
So you might ask how, how's that happened? It's really that blue takeaway at the bottom of the page: it's our people that focus the alignment, the engagement that comes when you have people think and act like an owner; the portfolio, which is a combination of our interconnected technologies and the value they bring; and the capital deployment we've done buying some great companies that have added to the strength of the company. Then our performance, which really sits with the strategy of the company, Win Strategy 2.0, at the kind of the beginning of this journey and then Win Strategy 3.0 most recently in FY '20. So this combination has really transformed the company. You see that as evidenced on this slide, and we're very proud of it. 
But if you go to Slide 6. So that's what's kind of in the rearview mirror. But going forward, we're equally excited about where the company is going to go. And I've called this a convergence of positive inflection points. So on the left-hand side is kind of those external inflection points, you're familiar with a lot of these. 
The macro environment. Industrial momentum, you see that in our positive orders and positive organic growth in Industrial we showed in this quarter. Aerospace is going to recover, the question is just what the trajectory will be and the timing. Vaccines are making progress around the world. There's going to be a significant amount of climate investment. And you put all that on top, I didn't write all these down, but low interest rates, pent-up CapEx demand and fiscal spending, you have a very attractive environment for industrials for the next several years. 
On the right-hand side is really the internal things we've been doing, Win Strategy 3.0, in particular. But that last slide that I just went through spoke to all those internal actions because that's what's been propelling us. Remember that last period -- last 6 years, really had very little help from a macro standpoint. 
So you look at the 3 major things I highlight here. Performance, becoming top quartile, strategies to grow fast in the market, you've seen our margin expansion, great cash flow generation consistently over the cycle. Portfolio, we've added 3 great companies, all accretive on growth, cash and margins, and with the rapid debt paydown that we've done, we're positioned to do future capital deployment, which is very exciting. The technology, I'll get into in the next slide, but the interconnected technologies really is distinctive for us, and then with a climate investment, we are very well positioned with our suite of clean technologies to take advantage of that. So I would tell you that my view and the team's view, this is about as good an environment as we've seen in a number of years. 
Go to Slide 7. You've heard me talk about this page. The power of interconnectedness of technology brings the value accretion for customers. What I want to do today in light of the clean technology discussion is give you 4 examples of how this suite of technologies helps with a more clean environment -- clean technology world. 
So the first would be electrification and we've got a full portfolio of technologies here: hydraulic, electrohydraulic, pneumatic, electromechanical. No competitors got that breadth of technologies. And we formed about 4 years ago the Motion Technology center, which put the best and brightest of engineers doing motion technologies, things that fly as well as things with wheels underneath it. So we put the Motion and the Aerospace teams together. And this team has come up with a great listing of products around motors, inverters and controllers. But there's also, in addition to the typical motion opportunities, there's other challenges around electrification like lightweighting, thermal management, shielding, structural adhesives and noise vibration, all these through the combination of we have a legacy Engineered Materials and with the LORD acquisition, we're well positioned to take advantage of those. 
Secondary is batteries and fuel cells that utilize most of the technologies you see on this page. 
Third would be clean power sources and that kind of falls into 2 buckets: renewables, which we do a lot -- we've always have done a lot of wind and solar; then the hydrogen, we just recently joined the Hydrogen Council, and it's going to be both onboard as well as infrastructure opportunities as you go out for the next many years. And it's really building on our high-pressure and cryogenic applications that we have today. 
And then we've been a more sustainable company for a long time and really the  clean technology example for us that started a lot of things is filtration. And our Filtration business protects and purifies assets and equipment for people for a more sustainable environment. So we feel very good about this portfolio. There's more climate investment in the future. 
Going to Slide 8. I just want to remind you of our purpose statement: enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. It's been very inspirational for our team. 
And I think it comes more to light when we give you examples of the purpose in action, which is on Slide 9. And again, kind of following with that clean technology discussion, when I highlight electrification, I'm going to highlight in particular electric vehicles. On the left-hand side, you see applications that are changed because of an HEV or EV versus a combustion engine. On the right-hand side, you see the various technologies that Parker has that addresses those applications. I won't read all those underneath, but you see the major categories: safety and related technologies, things that say weight, thermal management and a variety of things we do for critical protection. 
The big opportunity for us -- so we obviously are in the factories helping to make these vehicles and we'll always do that. But the big opportunity for us is the onboard content around engineered materials. Our bill of material for an EV or HEV is 10x what it was in a combustion engine. And it's one of the key reasons why our LORD business has grown so nicely even despite the pandemic. So we grew 11% organically in Q3 from LORD. So we're very happy with the progress so far and our purpose and action around electrification as an example. 
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Todd with more details on the quarter."
295170,711878152,2264450,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Parker-Hannifin Corporation","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Tom. I'll just orientate everyone to Slide 11, and I'll do a quick review of the financial results for the quarter. Tom mentioned some of these, so I'll try to move quickly. Sales for the quarter were $3.746 billion, that is an increase of",1918,"Okay. Thanks, Tom. I'll just orientate everyone to Slide 11, and I'll do a quick review of the financial results for the quarter. Tom mentioned some of these, so I'll try to move quickly. 
Sales for the quarter were $3.746 billion, that is an increase of 1.2% versus prior year. We are proud of the fact that the Diversified industrial segment did turn positive organically. Industrial segment organic growth was 3.7%. Obviously, that was offset by the Aerospace Systems segment, their organic decline was 19.7%. So all in, that drove total organic sales to minus 1.0%. 
Currency was a favorable impact this quarter of 2.2%. And just a note, in respect to acquisitions, this is the first full quarter that we report both LORD and Exotic in our organic growth numbers. So therefore, the acquisition impact was zero. 
Moving to segment operating margins. You saw the number, 21.4%, that's an improvement of 240 basis points from prior year. It's also an improvement of 130 basis points sequentially. Strong margin performance there. And that really was a result of just broad-based execution of The Win Strategy. We continued to manage our cost in a disciplined manner. The portfolio additions in CLARCOR, LORD and Exotic are all performing soundly. And you've all been familiar with the restructuring activities that we've done in FY '20 and in FY '21. Those are on track and on planned and generating the savings that we expected. 
Adjusted EBITDA margins did expand 250 basis points from prior year, finished the quarter at 21.8%. 
And net income is $540 million, which is a 14.4% ROS, that's increased by 22% from prior year. 
Adjusted EPS is $4.11, that is $0.72 or 21% increase compared to prior year's results of $3.39. 
And as Tom said, it's just really outstanding performance. And I'd also, too, like to commend our global team members for generating these results. 
If you slide to Slide 12, this is really a bridge of that $0.72 increase in adjusted EPS versus prior year. And the story here across the board is just strong execution from all of our businesses. This produced robust incrementals in our Diversified Industrial segment and really commendable decrementals in the Aerospace Systems segment. 
Adjusted segment operating income did increase by $98 million or 14% versus prior year, that equates to $0.58 of EPS and really is the primary driver of the increase in our adjusted EPS number. 
Interest expense was favorable to prior by $0.12 as we posted yet another quarter of sizable repayment of our serviceable debt and that is really benefiting from our strong cash flow generation. 
Other expense, income tax and shares netted to a $0.02 favorable impact compared to prior year. 
Moving to Slide 13. This is just an update on our discretionary and permanent cost-out actions. And this is just a reminder, these represent both savings recognized in the current fiscal year from our discretionary actions in response to the pandemic and our permanent realignment actions that were taken at the end of FY '20 and throughout FY '21. 
Discretionary statements came in exactly as we guided, at $25 million for Q3, and now totaled $215 million year-to-date. There is no change to our discretionary savings forecast for Q4, that remains $10 million. And we continue to forecast the total year to be $225 million in full year savings. 
Just to note, with the increased demand levels that we're seeing from our positive order entry, our teams have really pivoted to growth and really now these discretionary actions that we knew would diminish across the calendar year have now really been based in reduced travel expenses. 
If you move to permanent savings, we realized $65 million in Q3. Our total year-to-date is $190 million. The full year forecast, again, here remains, as previously communicated, at $250 million. 
One item to note, we did guide that the cost of the FY '21 restructuring would come in around $60 million. It's now expected to be $10 million less or $50 million, but there is no change to the expected savings that we are forecasting. 
Total incremental impact for the year for both permanent and discretionary savings is $260 million. 
And just one other thing to note, this will probably be the last quarter that we detail these items as we anniversary the pandemic-induced volume declines and really focus our attention on growth. 
So the takeaway is savings are on track, no changes other than the expense will be a little bit less. 
If you go to Slide 14, this is just highlighting some items from our segment performance for the third quarter. In our Diversified North America business, sales were $1.76 billion. That is an improvement in organic sales sequentially from Q2. It still is down 1.2% from prior year. 
But if you look at the adjusted operating margins, we did increase those operating margins by 190 basis points versus prior year and reached 21.9% for the quarter. We were able to increase these margins despite that sales decline due to our disciplined cost management, those portfolio improvements we've talked about, and really, margins in this segment are at a record level. 
If you slide over to order rates, another positive here. They improved significantly from plus 1% last quarter and they're now ending the quarter at plus 11%. 
Looking at the Diversified Industrial International sales, robust organic growth here of 11.1%. Total sales came in at $1.39 billion. 
And another great story here, adjusted operating margins expanded substantially and reached 21.6%, an improvement of 400 basis points versus prior year. Clearly, the double-digit organic growth, coupled with the cost containment and the effort from our global team, really generated this level of record margin performance as well. 
And again, another plus here is order rates accelerated in this segment and are now plus 14% for the quarter. 
If you look at Aerospace Systems, they continued to really perform soundly in the current environment. Sales were $599 million for the quarter. Organic sales showed a slight sequential improvement from Q2, but are still down basically 20% from prior year. Commercial end markets are still under pressure. However, there is strength in our military end markets. 
What's nice here is operating margins were 19.4%, 30 basis points better than prior year despite that 20% decline in volume. And if you look at our fiscal year, that performance of 19.4% is the highest they've done all year. So we're really proud about that. 
Decremental margins are also impressive here in this segment. This quarter, they're 18% decremental margins. 
Order rates appeared to have bottomed and finished at minus 19% for this quarter. And just a reminder, that is on a rolling 12-month basis. 
So overall, we're pleased about a number of things this quarter. That Diversified Industrial segment organic growth of 3.7% is a positive. Total segment margins improved 240 basis points from prior year and at record levels. Orders have turned positive and are plus 6%. And our teams really continued to leverage the Win Strategy to drive significant improvements in our business and increase productivity and generate strong cash flow. 
So with that, I'll ask you to go to Slide 15. This is just some details on our cash flow. Year-to-date cash flow from operations is now $1.9 billion. That's 18.1% of sales. That's up 45% from prior year, and it is a year-to-date record. 
Improved net income margin, as we've talked about before, is really a key driver in this. It's created a step change in our cash flow generation. But I'd also like to commend our team members' intense focus on our working capital metrics. Each of our working capital metrics is improving and showing positive results, and I'm really proud about that. 
Moving to free cash flow at 16.8% of sales. That's an increase of 630 basis points over prior year. And our free cash flow conversion is now 141%, which compares to 122% in the prior year. So great cash flow generation there. 
Moving to Slide 16. I just want to mention some things we've done on our capital deployment. We did pay down $426 million of debt this quarter. That brings our total debt reduction to a little over $3.2 billion in the last 17 months since the LORD acquisition closed. 
This reduced our gross debt-to-EBITDA to 2.4x, it was 3.8x in the prior year. And net debt-to-EBITDA is now 2.2x and that's down from 3.5% (sic) [ 3.5x ] in the prior year. 
Looking at dividends. Last week, you saw our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase of $0.15 or 17%. This raises our quarterly dividend from $0.88 to $1.03 per share and extends our record of increasing the annual dividends paid per share to 65 consecutive years. 
And finally, as we mentioned at the Q2 earnings release, we reinstated our 10b5 (sic) [ 10b5-1 ] program and repurchased $50 million of shares in the quarter. 
All right. So if you go to Slide 17, I'll just provide some color to the increase in guidance that we gave this morning. Really, the strong year-to-date performance and these order trends have positioned us to increase our full year outlook for sales to a year-over-year increase of 4.5% at the midpoint. 
And the breakdown of that sales change is this. Organic sales are now expected to be flat year-over-year. Acquisitions will add 3%, and the full year currency impact is expected to be 1.5%. 
We've calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of the quarter ended March 31 and we held those rates constant to estimate the Q4 '21 impact. 
Moving to segment operating margins. Our guidance for the full year is raised to 20.8% and  that would equate to an increase of 190 basis points versus prior year. 
And just some additional color, some things to note. Corporate G&A, interest and other is expected to be $381 million on an as-reported basis and $479 million on an adjusted basis. The main difference between those 2 numbers is that $101 million pretax or $76 million after-tax gain on real estate that we recognized and adjusted in the other income line in Q2. That's the main item. 
If you look at our tax rates down just a little bit, we're now expecting the full year tax rate to be 22.5%. 
And moving to EPS on a full year basis. Our as-reported EPS guidance range has increased from $12.96 to $13.26, that's $13.11 at the midpoint. And on an adjusted basis, we're increasing the range from $14.65 to $14.95, and that's $14.80 at the midpoint. 
For Q4, adjusted EPS is projected to be $4.18 per share. That excludes $0.54 or $93 million of acquisition-related amortization expense, the finishing of our business realignment expenses and integration costs to achieve. 
If you look at Slide 18, this is just the bridge of our increase to our adjusted EPS guidance. These results that we just reviewed, you can see the outperformance that we had in Q3. That increases our previous guide by $0.57. The order strength that we just reviewed and really the exceptional operation and execution by our teams have allowed us to increase Q4 guide by an additional $0.33, and that is exclusively based on increased segment operating income. This raises our full year EPS guide by about 6.5% from prior guide. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom for some summary comments and ask you to move to Slide 19."

One, understanding you don't want to talk about 2022, but I'm trying to understand the setup for incrementals and to what degree if volumes are still there. Can we have above average sort of incrementals and how the discretionary costs sort of factor back in and impact incremental margins? 
And then I guess my second question is regards to your longer-term margin targets, which you're already starting to beat those targets. So in particular, with volumes not really showing up in your numbers. I'm just trying to think about how we position your margins longer term potentially to be at a higher structural level?"

The one thing I would point out is our guidance for Q4 is incrementals of about 30%. And if you were to do like-for-like and take out the discretionary savings we had in the Q4 prior period, may be about 50% incremental. 
So they'd be the incrementals that we feel based on the cost structure and all the things we've done with Win 2.0, Win 3.0, that we would generate at this point in the cycle. So that's -- we would continue to do 30%. I think as we go into '22, obviously, we're not guiding to that yet, but I think that's a good round number to use for us. 
But I'll highlight Q4 because it is impacted by the prior period discretionary, which we don't have now or not as much and that difference is pretty significant. We go from a 30% to a plus 50% incremental. So it speaks to the underlying power of the business is there. 
And then on your question on long-term margin targets, yes, this is a good problem that we have, that we basically had beat our targets by about 2 years. Our guide at 20.8% at the midpoint on op margin is within spitting distance of the 21%. And then on EBITDA, we don't guide on EBITDA margins, we'll be at the 21% for a full year on EBITDA. 
So we're actively working on what this new set of targets will be. And I'm sure this is a question everybody had. So we're going to disclose them at IR day, which will be March of next year. And we think that's the appropriate forum to do that. But rest assured, we're working on it and we're not going to settle or be happy with stopping at where we're at. We're going to continue to march forward. And we'll give you that vision when we have Investor Day."

And then what we've done with 3.0 and adding Kaizen, and when -- as I started with my opening comments, when you link to safety performance Lean, Kaizen and the high-performance teams, think of the high-performance teams as the structure, how we run the various sales and value streams, you've got a very powerful combination. And as we do Kaizens, we keep finding ways to free up capacity, free of floor space, free of capacity in our equipment, we're able to do what we call more simple automation category, which is uses the only free thing in life, which is gravity. And if you saw these, these are gravity-induced material handling things and simple automation in the factories, has allowed us to be responsive to this demand. 
So I think we're well positioned. Obviously, we're going to have to continue to invest, which we will, but we just found ways to do it more efficiently. And Kaizen has been kind of the great liberator for us to be able to do that. 
On the channel, the channel has been -- to your point, has been consolidating over the last number of years. I think it's in a better position than it's ever been to respond. We did see nice growth in distribution sequentially. And our distributors are investing in some inventory for the future and I think they'll be in position to respond. Obviously, we take share through them as well as through our OEMs going direct. 
And we've got a great distribution team. Our partners are strong. We've got a great distribution sales force. The distributors have been investing in application engineers and have been relying on us to be better at supply chain. And in their eyes, we can continue to do better, but we have made quite a bit of stride on that. 
So I think both of those we'll be well positioned to take advantage of this upturn."

And really, the combination we've got there has really given us a very attractive offering for the customers. And the debate is how fast it's going to grow and what percentage of the total fleet it will take over. 
But for us, every time there's a new EV, it's an upside opportunity. Recognize, as I mentioned, that LORD growing 11% in the quarter, LORD is 1/3 of Aerospace. So LORD's aerospace business is doing a little better than legacy Parker's because they have pretty big military exposure. But it's feeling pressure just like legacy partners.

We saw really good growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America in that 15% to 20% range. EMEA was flat. And North America was just slightly negative, low single digits. But pretty much across all our distributors, we saw a combination of actual activity driving demand and then investing in inventory in the coming months. So I think the channel has turned from -- last quarter, I talked about selective restocking. I think it's pretty much across the board people are planning for their future. 
And then in Aerospace, we still need time. It's -- I think we're bouncing along the bottom there. And we've sized the company to put great margins, where we're at right now. We have the advantage of being very diversified in our segments between engines, military, commercial, helicopters, et cetera, going down the line, that's helped us quite a bit. We're about 50-50 in military and OE. 
So we're well positioned. But the question mark there is just what will the trajectory be and how long do we bounce along the bottom. Clearly, I think the military side will continue to be strong for us. It was strong this quarter and will continue to be strong going forward. Both OE and MRO, we're on the right programs there. In the commercial side, it will be all based on -- we will be based on line rates from the OEMs, the airframers. And then on the MRO side for commercial, it's all about air traffic shop business and you see positives with airlines hiring pilots back. And departure rates are improving, and that will speak well to shop visits down the road."

And the way I would always describe it and the lessons learned from the financial crisis is to continuously work the financial pipeline. Lee, Todd and myself just did reviews. We do this all the time. Lee does it monthly with his presidents. And so this is something we stay on top of, building those relationships. 
So the pipeline is active. But it's always a matter of finding a willing seller and a willing buyer. And so it's this activity doesn't necessarily translate into actual properties being acquired. But we're looking and certainly we're going to buy companies with the same kind of themes that you've seen before that either are immediately accretive or accretive within our synergy time period where they can help the growth rates of the company, help margins, help cash flow. 
And you'll continue to see us be the consolidated choice. We think we're still the best home of these motion and control properties. But we'll also look at the other areas that you've seen us build on in the last several years. And hopefully, by now, people feel good about our track record. We've -- the last 3 got a lot of fanfare. We've been good at this for a long time. We've done 80 deals in the last 20 years. And I think you'll see us to continue to be active on that. 
First and foremost, for us, the dividends, we were very excited to clip that dollar mark on a quarterly basis. And you'll see us stay on top of that. Our net income is going to grow. And we're going to stay on top of those dividends to match the net income growth. We'll continue to invest in the company organically in productivity. And if we don't find the right properties, which our preference would be to do deals because it drives cash and EBITDA growth, we think we're a great investment, and we'll buy shares on a discretionary basis on top of a 10b5-1.

But the thing I would say about our team is we saw this coming early on as we did this. And as you know, we've got really 2 great internal processes inside the company. It's how we track our PPI, which is our input cost, and how we track our selling price index to make sure that we always maintain this margin-neutral kind of role. 
So we've been active with price through the distribution channel, and we'll continue to do that. We're fortunate to have great contracts in place with many OEMs that have raw material cost escalators in them. But our goal on the whole pricing side is to be margin-neutral. We've done that before, we'll continue to do that. 
On the supply chain side, I would say, just echo what Tom said earlier, the biggest benefit is our business model. So we design, source, make, sell in the region for the region. Everything you read about in the paper, we're not immune to that. I mean there's still things that happen on a day-to-day basis.

So clearly, Simple by Design, I would just say everything that's in Win 3.0 is part of our basket of goods that go into evaluating acquisitions. So we look at what the best practices are for the acquisition, what best practices do we bring. That combination of 1 plus 1 equals 3 generates the synergy plan. And that's -- the bigger the synergies, which you're alluding to, Simple by Design, the opportunity you have to pay. And what we really look for is what's the synergized EBITDA multiple were done and is that something that makes sense given where we're trading. 
The other part, aside from acquisitions, to get at what Lee was talking about with competitive dynamics, Simple by Design is an opportunity for share gain. As we come up with products that are simpler to make, easier supply chains, more reliable, et cetera, and maybe in some areas where we don't currently have share, it allows us to penetrate an account. Overall, we've got 11%, 12% market share of this $135 billion space. We've got lots of room to grow. Simple by Design is just one of many share gain opportunities."

Just thinking about this idea, Tom, of trying to break the gravitational pull of the PMI. Actually, 2 questions. One, just kind of maybe fundamental in the business and maybe a second kind of philosophical. 
First, obviously, the PMI is a broad industrial benchmark, right? Have you considered that calling your segments Diversified Industrial just suggests you are an industrial proxy? Perhaps some kind of different earnings presentation would make sense. You give us this global technology platforms, but we don't know anything about the profitability of those subsegments. So that's more of a philosophical question, I wonder if you've thought about that. 
And then secondly, although most of your business is short cycle, right, I would argue, it's really a broad mix of early, mid and late. And I think, to some degree, people confuse short with early. I just wonder if you could kind of give us some rough buckets. What percent of your business you would actually characterize as early cycle versus mid-cycle versus late cycle?"

Jeff, it's Tom. So those are -- that's a good question and a hard one. First of all, that whole PMI gravitational pull, that's one of the reasons, besides I think it's just a great way to describe the company when we did Slide 5. And that's, for those of you who are not looking at your slides, that's the whole PMI versus our EPS trend. And I hope you -- I hope people got the point there, this company is dramatically, and I'm underlining dramatically, different. And yes, we'll never be completely detached from PMIs because obviously that represents total manufacturing activity and we would benefit from that. But we didn't get much help from that over the last 6 years, and you've seen us double EPS and add 600 basis points to EBITDA margins. 
So we'll continue that. And hopefully, people recognize that we don't need the macros to help us. We have enough self-help with 2.0 and 3.0 to keep lasting us for many, many years. The current environment is going to get better. So we are going to get some help with that. 
Your comment philosophically on reporting segments, yes, that's been a raging internal debate for many, many years. There's pros and cons to a probably longer discussion than I can do on an earnings call. But we continue to think that representing the way we do today is the best way because if you go back to those 8 technologies, and the fact that 2/3 of our revenue comes from customers who buy and perform all those technologies, that's exactly how we go to market. We don't go to market specifically with one-off technologies all the time. We go to market, if you look at our commercial teams, leveraging that breadth of technology. So that's how we're representing the company to shareholders is exactly how we go to market. 
Now the whole early versus mid versus late, I'm not even going to try to do that other than I'm going to reinforce your point, yes, we are a mixture. And obviously, you can look at Aerospace and you characterize that as long. But where do you want to put EV? With EV, we're feeling that now, but EV is a long-term change that's going to happen. Where do you want to put all the clean technologies? I could add up all the things I talked about on that one slide related to clean technologies and you get a pretty significant percentage of the company. Obviously, hydrogen's long -- very long cycle what's happening there. Electrification is a little more near term. 
So it's -- I think unfairly, we've been characterized as early and maybe because it's just historically how we used to report orders on a monthly basis and people could see those things sooner. I think we're a good mix. And I think, hopefully, over the last 6 years, people recognize we're a good bet. You want to bet your money, bet it on this team."

But you don't usually do a lot of increases for July 1. The setup here feels though more accommodative to you putting price increases through. 
So 2 questions. Is it fair to say we should see a lot more midyear price increases than we've seen in the past? 
And second, is the lead time issue significant enough where distributors who would normally want to get ahead of that increase are not able to, given the lead times? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of the price increase we could think about for '22 and sales that kind of capture it versus maybe a little bit of a natural prebuy that you see sometimes when you announce an increase?"

I did want to go back to your comments about incremental margins for 2022. And I know that, that wasn't guidance necessarily. But if you could do 30% incremental margins with the temporary costs coming back and perhaps obviously inflation pretty rampant in the back half of the calendar year, I guess what I'm trying to ask is do you think that there's a line of sight based on where you sit today to hitting that 30% incremental margin for FY '22?"

And it will -- and Q1 is probably not a tough comparison, but it will get progressively easier as we go through '22 of those comparisons.

This marks the end of FY '21 for us, and it was a difficult year personally and professionally for everybody due to COVID, but it was a year where the Parker team really shined. We delivered outstanding results and lived up to our purpose in enabling a better tomorrow, and my thanks goes out to the global team for just a great year, great quarter. 
So let's start with the quarter. It was dynamite. Top quartile safety performance, 29% reduction in reportable incidents. The sales growth in the quarter was 25% approximately. Organic was almost 22 and the industrial portion of the company grew at almost 27% in the quarter. We have 6 all-time quarterly records: sales, net income, EPS, segment margins for total Parker as well as North America and international. The EBITDA margins were very strong at 21.8% as reported or 22.1% adjusted, that was 190 basis points improvement versus prior. 
On the segment operating margin, on an adjusted basis, if you go to last row, 22.2% or a 230 basis point improvement versus prior. Just a great quarter and a really great team effort by everybody around the world. 
Go to Slide 4, we'll move to the full year. It was a year of records, and I won't read all of these to you, but you can see 8 all-time fiscal year records. And just -- that's in the history of the company, so that's 104 years to put up a record. So it speaks to how well the team performed in this last fiscal year. 
Sales growth came in almost 5% year-over-year. Organic was flat, but clear momentum building on orders and organic growth in the second half of the year, as you see from our order rates. FY '23 margin targets, we hit them at full 2 years early, and we'll be announcing new targets once we have Investor Day, March of next year, and we're going to go out for a new 5-year target, so we'll be going out to FY '26. We look forward to a discussion at that time. 
Operating cash flow was $2.6 billion, a record, that was almost 18% of sales. Free cash flow conversion rate was 135%. And we were very pleased to be able to announce the offer to acquire Meggitt PLC, which greatly enhances our aerospace portfolio, and I'll touch on that briefly here in a few minutes. 
So if you go to Slide 5, I want to talk about the transformation of the company, give you a little bit of color behind what's driving it and the progress we're making on the results. 
And Slide 6 speaks to those 3 drivers: living up to our purpose, being great generators and deployers of cash; and being a top quartile performer. I'm going to touch on each one of these over the next several slides. 
When it comes to purpose, enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. This is something that really resonates with our people. It represents a higher calling to your work, and it acts as our North Star. In the next few slides, I'm going to talk about and highlight our purpose in action, specifically our technologies and how they're helping health care and how they're helping the climate and create a more clean technology world for everybody. 
So on Slide 8, we're going to talk about vaccine production, in particular, something that's obviously very pertinent for today, COVID-19 production. On the left-hand side speaks to the challenges that drug manufacturers have today. This is a batch process typically with extensive inventories, long lead times to produce these products. They take huge space requirements, large footprints for storage, large footprints with the manufacturing processes and very difficult changeovers. The cleaning cycles between the batch processes is very complicated. 
So the idea here is a simple concept that most of us can relate to. All those have been in some kind of a restaurant with a soda fountain, where you can pick your beverage of choice. And of course, the technology behind that is a concentrated syrup and carbonated water and you get to pick the soft drink of your choice. So the idea here instead of soft drinks, could we deliver sterile vaccine ingredients with a similar type of process? 
And Slide 9 is that process. So that's our inline dilution system. It's a proprietary point-of-use process for combining the purified vaccine ingredients. So if you look at that piece of equipment, you can see it's on wheels, so it's modular, easy to move around, easy to deploy. As mixing and sensing combined, it has 2-way communications via the IoT-enabled, so it can talk to the manufacturer's enterprise system to enable scheduling it just in time. It uses, very importantly, intellectual property-protected single-use consumables. So instead of these massive batch processes, huge cleaning events for changeovers, this is a giant productivity improvement for the drug manufacturers on the speed of the change, but also just reducing contamination tied to the changeover. 
Then our software and automation helps control the amount and the flow of these various ingredients. So this applies obviously to COVID-19 and apply to other vaccines that are being developed and that we can use this for other drugs as well. So this is a really attractive business opportunity for us. But more importantly, it's a great help to customers and society is a great example of our purpose in action. 
Move to Slide 10, move to the climate and the clean technology portion of our purpose. We just recently announced last month new sustainability targets. You see on the right-hand side of this page is our new sustainability report, which you can reach electronically, where we announced a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. So that would be Scope 1 and 2 emissions, direct and indirect. And by 2040, same things go pointing to be carbon neutral. So enabling a more sustainable future with what we do with our plants, our operations, our supply chain. 
But in addition, if you go to Slide 11, and actually, more importantly, how can we help our customers? Like how can we help society with the sustainability journey? And so in this page you see, the 8 motion control technologies across the top and that this portfolio, approximately 2/3 of this portfolio is a very much part of the enabling of clean technologies for our customers. The exciting part is an expanding bill of material on automobiles, construction equipment, on forestry and mining, basically almost every piece of equipment on airplanes, engines, everything is feeling this impact for more electric applications. So there's onboard opportunities, but there's also infrastructure opportunities as the world has to build in infrastructure to support that growth. Our technologies can help with that infrastructure move. 
And then I want to move to Slide 12, which illustrates the top quartile performance portion of those 3 drivers. And you can see we're using 2 metrics to illustrate this: adjusted EPS on the left; and adjusted EBITDA margin on the right. It's really been our people, the strategic portfolio changes we made, the capital deployment decisions that we made over the last 7 years and The Win Strategy that's transformative of this performance. 
And when you step back and look at this, this is just a remarkable improvement. On the left is a more than doubling of our EPS. And that's hard to do. I can assure you that's really hard to do. This is a fantastic progress, a little less than $7 in FY '16 and over $15 as we closed last year. And the EBITDA margin, which has clearly been propelling that from 14.7% to 21.3%, so a 660 basis point improvement there. 
And then the last part on transformation and the drivers is cash generation and deployment. We touched on the cash generation piece in my opening comments, but clearly, in the deployment is how to deploy capital and buying effective companies. And we're very excited to put 2 high-quality companies together, an aerospace combination that we announced Monday, Parker with Meggitt nearly doubles the size of our Aerospace Systems segment with highly complementary technologies, 70% sole source, a strong recurring revenue, excellent growth potential combination of commercial aerospace recovery as well as the synergies, and this will be accretive to our organic sales growth margins, EPS and cash flow. This deal makes sense for all stakeholders, the shareholders of Parker and Meggitt. 
The team members of both of our companies, their parishioners, pensioners and of course, both of our customers. Following the announcement on Monday, we've introduced ourselves to the key stakeholders in the U.K., reinforcing why we are the best home for Meggitt. Our long great track record in the U.K., a clear strategic rationale for the deal including a premium we are offered to the Meggitt shareholders, our shared interest to continue to innovate and invest, that we are committed to being a responsible steward of Meggitt. And that is why we've agreed with Meggitt to offer the U.K. government a number of legally binding commitments about how we're going to operate going forward. 
These type of transactions, but we are pleased with the reception so far, and we look forward to constructive discussions with the key people in the U.K. government. And we'll keep you updated as the process unfolds and go to the planned completion of this in approximate 12 months. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Todd for more details on the quarter."

And I'll just, real quickly, walk through the FY '21 Q4 results. As Tom mentioned earlier, we have some outstanding results to share here. Sales increased over 25% in Q4 versus prior year and finished at $3.9 billion. As we said, that's an all-time record for the company. And we're really particularly proud of this due to the fact that our aerospace markets are still challenged. 
It really demonstrates the strength of the portfolio additions that we've spoken about, CLARCOR, LORD and Exotic, and really is driven by strong broad-based demand across all of our industrial businesses. Organic sales are up 22% in the quarter. So basically, the majority of that change is all organic. This is the first time organic sales have been positive for the company in over 2 years. Currency also was favorable with a 3.5% impact to total sales. 
Moving to adjusted segment margins. That 22.2% is an improvement, like Tom said, a 230 basis points from prior year, and it's also 80 basis points improved sequentially from Q3. Just another strong quarter of margin performance as really our teams around the world pivoted to the increased demand levels and managed through a number of challenges. Very proud of our team for that margin performance. 
Incrementals are also commendable at 31% year-over-year, really impressive considering last year with the depth of the pandemic. And our decrementals last year were fantastic at plus -- or excuse me, minus 13%. And if you remember, that included approximately $175 million of temporary savings in that FY '20 Q4. So we're really happy with the 31% incrementals. 
EBITDA margins also expanded 190 basis points from prior year, finishing the quarter at 22.1%. And if you look at that net income number, $577 million, that's an ROS of 14.6%, and that's an increase of nearly 50% from prior year. All of those great results translated to an adjusted EPS of $4.38. That's an increase of $1.39 per share or 46% compared to the prior year number on this slide of $2.99. 
Just 1 point I want to reference to the prior year numbers, and I'm really speaking to net income and the EPS numbers only. We have been planning for some time to convert our remaining U.S. locations that used to use LIFO for inventory evaluation to standardize that across the company and move to FIFO inventory valuation purposes. We made that voluntary change in FY '21 Q4, and we've retrospectively applied that change to prior years, and we've attached the impact of those prior years to this press release in the table section. So the impact to the previously reported quarter last year was minimal. It was only $0.04 last year. So the $2.99 on this page, if you're looking back to prior year, that would have been $3.03 in FY '20. 
So one other note I want to make, LIFO, we've always booked this at the corporate level. This has no impact to our segment operating margins or the incrementals that I just mentioned to and now 100% of the company's inventory is valued using the FIFO method. 
So just one last comment on the quarter. Really proud of our team globally. It's just a tremendous effort the team put forth to put up just such a solid quarter to finish really, as Tom said, a record year. 
So if we can move to Slide 16, this is just a bridge of that $1.39 increase to adjusted EPS that I just mentioned, and what I love here is the largest bar on the page. Signals the strong operating performance that the teams put together. Our segment operating income on an adjusted basis increased $250 million or 40% from prior year Q4. That accounts to $1.50 of the increase in EPS that we just put up for the quarter of $1.39, so it's really strong execution really everywhere across the company. All the other items you see on the slide, if you net it, it's $0.11 unfavorable. Corporate G&A, income tax and shares were slightly unfavorable, but lower interest and lower other expense partially offset the impact there. So again, most of this is really fantastic due to comparing back to our COVID-impacted quarter of the prior year. 
If you go to Slide 17, just some color on our segment performance. Really, the message here is our industrial businesses delivered outstanding results across the board. We've spoken in the past about the impact of these portfolio changes have had on the company, and you can see it here in these margin numbers. Diversified North America sales were $1.8 billion in the quarter. Organic sales improved again in this segment sequentially up and are up 26% versus prior year. Operating margins improved an impressive 300 basis points versus prior year and really finished at 22.5% for the quarter. Obviously, volume helped us a little bit there, but really the disciplined operating performance and cost control really continue to drive the sizable increase to margins. Margins in this segment are a record, all-time record. And incrementals were also were very healthy at 34%. And again, I keep referencing the comparables back to last year, which is just a very tough comparison. 
If you look at order rates, order rates are robust at plus 56%. This is up sequentially from last quarter where we reported plus 11% and really just strong across the board. 
If I move to the International -- Diversified International segment, really same story here, a little bit higher organic growth of 2.5%. And sales just reached $1.5 billion in that segment. And again, another story here, adjusted segment operating margins expanded 300 basis points versus prior year and finished at 22.1% in the International segment. Just really, again, strong organic growth in that volume, coupled with that cost containment and productivity initiatives really generated this record margin performance in this segment as well. Order rates again here, tremendous, up a little bit higher than North America at plus 58% versus 14% positive in the last quarter. So really just a great performance out of our industrial businesses. 
I'll just touch on Aerospace Systems, really slightly. Very sound performance in the current market. Sales here were $630 million for the quarter. And I'm happy to report organic sales have turned positive in this segment. They are up 1%. We saw strength in commercial and military aftermarkets with strong sequential growth again in Q4 and we're happy to start seeing rate increases from OEMs, particularly in the narrow body and business jet platforms. Aerospace orders also got less negative and improved to minus 7% this quarter on a rolling 12 basis versus minus 19% last quarter and further proof that we are seeing signs of recovery in this area. Operating margins also very strong, 21.6% that improved sequentially from Q3 and really finished the year at the highest level they've had in the entire fiscal year. So very proud of our aerospace team there. 
So just looking at the company as a whole, we're really pleased with these results. It's a solid finish to the fiscal year. Our total incrementals were 31%. I'm really proud about that. And really just a comment, if I look at just our industrial businesses, if I go back to prepandemic FY '19 and on a like-for-like basis, if I include LORD in those FY '19 numbers, in the industrial businesses, our sales volume has surpassed pre-COVID levels. So we're really proud about that. Orders, you can see in total are plus 43%. And as Tom mentioned, not only did we achieve our FY '23 margin targets, but we surpassed them, and we did that 2 years earlier. 
So if I go to the next slide, Slide 18, cash flow. We're obviously very proud of this. Tom mentioned this earlier, Full year cash flow from operations was $2.6 billion, that's an all-time record for the company. 17.9% of sales, just outstanding top quartile performance. If you look at that compared to prior year, we generated over $500 million more cash. That's 24% more cash than we did prior year. And like I said, that CFOA at $2.6 billion is a record. Working capital, really solid performance here. And I want to just really thank our teams everywhere around the world for focusing on this. We asked them to focus on this through the pandemic and they delivered soundly. So I want to thank you all for your focus on that. 
Free cash flow, also fantastic, 16.5%. That's up 310 basis points versus prior year, and the free cash flow conversion for the year, 135%. So with that, this now marks the 20th year that free cash flow conversion has been greater than 100% and cash flow from operations have been greater than 10%, 20 years running. All of these allowed us to significantly pay down our serviceable debt. We've been vocal about that for the last couple of months. If you look at the last 20 months, we've paid down $3.4 billion of debt and our gross debt-to-EBITDA finished the year at 2.1%, net debt is 1.9%. So again, the similar story here, we achieved these leverage levels a full 1 year sooner than we have originally forecast, and it's just an outstanding cash position. It's top quartile execution and really impressive considering the backdrop of the global pandemic. 
So 19, I will ask you to focus on 19, just flipping to FY '22 and our guidance. You saw that we released this, this morning. As usual, we're going to provide this on an as-reported and adjusted basis. And I'll just start at the top. 
Sales. We're forecasting sales to increase in the range of 5% to 9%, really 7% at the midpoint. And really the breakdown of that sales growth is essentially all organic. We do not expect the Meggitt transaction to close in FY '22. Both LORD and Exotic have anniversary-ed, so those are no longer considered acquisition sales. Therefore, we are forecasting no impact sales from acquisitions. And currency is just a minimal drag at 0.2% of sales. And just like we always do, we have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates at the end of June 30, and we've held those rates study as we forecast FY '22. One thing I'll note, the sales split for the guide is 48% first half, 52% second half. 
The next item I'll talk about is segment operating margin. On an as-reported basis, the guidance for the full year is 19.3% at the midpoint, and there's a range of 20 basis points on either side of that. But more importantly, on an adjusted basis, segment operating margin guidance for the full year is 21.6% at the midpoint, same range of 20 basis points on either side of that. This adjusted segment operating margin guide is 50 basis points higher than what we just finished our record FY '21 app. 
Just some color on adjustments. At a pretax level, business realignment charges are expected to be $35 million for FY '22. LORD cost to achieve are only $7 million for the forecasted year and acquisition-related intangible amortization is $320 million. Just a note on the split, adjusted segment operating margins, 46% first half; 52%, second half. 
If you look at the corporate G&A interest and other, $480 million is our forecast. That is the same on an adjusted and an as-reported basis. Tax rate, we are forecasting full year to be 23%. And finally, EPS on an as-reported basis, our guidance is $14.48 at the midpoint. There's a $0.40 range on either side of that. And our adjusted EPS guidance is $16.60 at the midpoint, same $0.40 range on either side of that. Adjusted EPS split: first half is 45%; second half is 55%. And a little color on Q1, we are forecasting adjusted EPS to be $3.60 at the midpoint. 
Slide 20 is the bridge. And again, this is very similar to Q4. Main driver of the $1.56 or 10% increase to adjusted earnings per share is just our continued strong execution across the enterprise. Segment operating margin is accounting for $1.76 of that change. And then again, just slightly higher corporate G&A, tax and average shares outstanding are a little bit of a drag. But all in, a $1.56 increase in earnings per share, increasing earnings per share by 10%. 
Lastly, I will just talk about capital deployment. For FY '22, we are committed to our capital deployment strategies. We have a strong 65 year of record of consistently consecutively increasing the annual dividends paid. We're going to continue with that record. Our payout target has not changed. It remains 30% to 35% of the 5-year average of net income. And of course, we're going to continue to fund organic growth and productivity across our global locations. We expect capital expenditures to be 2% for the year. 
Our 10b5-1 share repurchase program, we reinstated that this year. We are committed to continuing that in FY '22. And as I mentioned, when I was talking about cash flow, we have extinguished all of our serviceable debt, and we are now in a cash building position. So our focus for FY '22 will be to continue our record of strong cash flow generation and accumulation in preparation for the closing of the Meggitt transaction. 
So with that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you, and I'll ask the audience to focus on Slide 22."

Having said that, we're not immune to what's going on in any of the regions, but I would characterize it internally as being manageable but not without hard work. Now I would say the biggest challenges we're dealing with is just our customers. So I mean, I think automotive is very public on what's happening. But I probably don't have a large OEM that hasn't had some kind of disruption where lands have been down, people have been sent home, et cetera. So we're working with our customers to work through that. It's just creating a lot of chatter in the channel and it's just, I would say, best is a lot of choppy production."

I'll go through the aerospace piece. I'll let Lee touch on the price cost aspect. So this is probably the question that everybody is on everybody's mind. And how do we come up with the guidance and some of the context behind it. 
So first of all, there's a number of tailwinds, and I'll highlight some of the headwinds. But on the tailwind side, clearly, the order trends, the macro environment, I think there's a CapEx underspend that happened for a number of years. So I think there's some CapEx demand that's coming back for manufacturing companies. Clearly, governments being more prone to put in stimuluses the rebound from the great shutdown and of course, rebound of activity. 
The commercial aerospace recovery, which I'll touch on, to answer your question here in a minute, Jamie. Low interest rates and then a climate investment, which with our clean technology portfolio is a very attractive positive for us in the future. 
On the headwind side is the Delta variant and COVID hasn't gone away and is creating uncertainties throughout the world. The supply chain disruptions in particular, our customers and how that might impact demand patterns, which Lee touched on than inflation, both on the material side and wages. 
But we've built a pretty sophisticated AI model over the last 18 months. It's not perfect, nothing is when it comes to forecasting. But in my time at the company, it's the best tool we've had to date, and we factored it approximately the same, up 11% in the first half and up mid-single digits in the second half. 
When you think about aerospace and several of the pre reports that came out, didn't have the insight that I'm going to share with you right now. So we have aerospace with a gradual recovery, up 3% in the first half, up 5% in the second half, that's where you get the 4% at the midpoint. But what's underneath that and will help give you some context is as to why that number is what it is. 
On the commercial side, both OEM and MRO, that's going to grow low teens. So nice recovery there. Military MRO is growing mid-single digits. What is down is military OEM, it's down mid-single digits. And the reason for that, and thankfully, our customers thought as our customers accelerated deliveries last year, we were up 19% as an example. They did this to protect the supply chain to protect supplier health because a lot of suppliers have commercial exposure as well as military exposure, and they accelerated the military exposure to help everybody. So this year that we're in now, '22 is a reset of the inventory through that supply chain. So we will be down. And of course, then we'll go back to more normal levels in FY '23. 
If you would take out that acceleration in the prior period, our FY '22 military OEM would be about a plus 3. So then when you add -- when you would factor that in, aerospace growth would be more like 8%. So that 4% is being weighted down by the military OEM segment, that reset of inventory. So hopefully, that helps everybody with why the aerospace number is what it is. 
Just comparing that growth rate to 7% to GIPI, Global Industrial Production Index, that's going to be within our fiscal year '22, that's a 4.8% forecast. And you've heard us talk externally, we want to grow 150 basis points faster than that. So that our number of 7% would do that. 
Then maybe while I've got kind of talking about guidance, I want to just touch for a second on operating margin, and I'll let Lee comment about price cost. So our operating margin guide is at 21.6% at the midpoint. So it's approximately 30% or more less for the full year. If you were to take out the discretionaries in the prior period, it made this an apples-to-apples, the underlying MROS is a positive 50%. And a good indicator is what we did in Q4, we did over 50% in Q4, so that was actual results. 
The reason why I mentioned that is that underlying MROS is being hidden because of the year-over-year comparisons being awkward and really speaks to the operational excellence from the team just because it's hard to do an underlying 50% from where it was. I think everybody can appreciate that. 
So Lee, if you want to comment on the price."

In other words, everything was up. And I would tell you here a quarter later, it's still a sea of red. 
But having said that, we're able to see this coming very well because of the processes we have internally, by measuring what we call our purchase price index and then also maintaining margin neutrality by our selling price index. So we're on top of it. And our goal, as we've always said, is to be margin neutral. We're actively working price both with direct customers and distribution. But it is a -- there is a lot of inflation in the commodity side right now, no doubt about it."

This is Tom. I think just to maybe help clarify things for people. People, you're doing 2-year stacks, you might say, ""Hey, geez, it seems like the organic growth might be like compared to the 2-year stack."" The one thing",304,"So Mig, let me talk about orders. This is Tom. I think just to maybe help clarify things for people. People, you're doing 2-year stacks, you might say, ""Hey, geez, it seems like the organic growth might be like compared to the 2-year stack."" The one thing that you have to look at is in current period, we have acquisitions in prior period. We do not have LORD exactly go the way back to '19. When you do apples-to-apples on orders, '19 to '21 and exclude the acquisitions, our industrial orders are up low teens. 
And I just mentioned, as I was answering to Jamie's question, our forecast for the first half on industrial is low teens at 11% organic growth. So there's a clear correlation between what we're seeing versus '19, again, apples-to-apples on order entry. And that's how we -- in addition to AIMO,how we laid out the year. 
The backlogs are increasing. Again, you got to remember that the prior periods has uniquely low comps. It's probably an inflated number that you can't get too excited about. Our on-time delivery is holding up nicely. Obviously, my customs would like to see us do better on that, but it's holding up very well compared to comparable times. 
And I'd say the impact that we've seen has been more on customer pushouts of schedules, particularly in automotive, where the automobile OEMs are having trouble with chips as everybody knows, and they're taking really targeted shutdowns and that will push out our various orders and that impacted North America a little bit in Q4. 
But as Todd had mentioned, our Q4 sales were up about 10% industrial versus Q4 FY '19. So everything is kind of coalescing between orders and sales when you compare to '19 around that low teens type of growth rate."

We do not use it in our Aerospace business. We really only used it in our traditional U.S. locations. All of our international locations by rule had to use the FIFO valuation method. So we took a look at it and said, ""Hey, maybe this year is an opportunity to convert, and that's essentially what we did. 
We converted early in the quarter. We worked tirelessly across our teams and with our internal -- or excuse me, our external auditors and that we felt it was the best time to do it. There really is no impact to the quarter since we converted. We essentially reported the quarter in the FIFO method. We did go back and restate prior years just to show you what the impact was. And I just want to make sure everybody realizes that. If you look at this historically, it's $0.01 or $0.02 per quarter. It's a very immaterial impact. We always book that at corporate, so it had no impact to our segment margins or anywhere incrementals, and it really just now standardizes our inventory valuation across the entire company. So we're happy with the results.

And it's energy things that we do within the plants, renewables, different lighting, some of this will happen from indirect emissions as the various utility companies change over to using renewables. We automatically get credit for that as well. We're going to be working with our suppliers what they can do to reduce it. All the Kaizen work we do or we just utilize the equipment better, smaller footprints, better flow, less distances traveled all those kind of things helps in this reduction. So we have every group signed up for their -- have their prospective greenhouse targets that they're working on. They know exactly where they are, and that gets cascaded down plant by plant. 
And then we've also have -- envisioned every group having a list of greenhouse gas emissions reductions, all the things they're doing, recycling things they're doing, that's in the way we know how to do. We drive it down in the respective divisions. And then at the group level, we have each group on their technology road map, developing their clean technology portfolio and how it needs to change for more EVs or fuel cell EVs or hydrogen, et cetera, and the groups have been actively doing it. 
The good thing about this is we formed the Motion Technology Center about 3 years ago, and for people who aren't familiar with it, this was taking the best and brightest that we could between aerospace and our Motion Systems Group. So taking all the motion-related technology of the company, having a center of excellence spread. And in particular, focusing on electrification. And a lot of the technologies that we developed in the '90s on the F-35, so the flight surfaces on the F-35 fighter are electro-hydraulically actuated and we've taken a lot of those learnings and applied it into the industrial portion of the company and has developed a suite of motors and motor controllers and software that we're offering on the industrial companies, OEMs in particular, where their platform changes as they look more electric. 
And when you add in acquisitions like LORD on top of the engineered materials applications that we have from legacy Parker, we have a really strong material science portfolio to help with that transformation as well. So our sustainability message is twofold: things we're going to do internally, which we have good line of sight to, and we put out 2 major targets 2030, 2040, but we're looking for year-over-year things to get there; and then what we're doing to help our customers because our customers at Scope 3, that's us helping our customers, and we'll be all over doing that."

Those internal actions have been happening every day since I joined the company and every day that everybody else that works here. I mean we're all about continuous improvement. And I think the slide we showed earlier on the 660 basis points improvement in EBITDA margin is what's positioned us to be able to do a deal of this size. 
If you think about a couple of things regarding Meggitt, and just using that as an example. The multiples that we're going to do are very similar or less than what we have at CLARCOR. The synergies, while the dollars are big, the percent synergies are very similar to what we did with CLARCOR and LORD. And what's interesting is we're going to do a deal that has over 2x the purchase price of our largest transaction, but our starting leverage will be about the same point that we were when we did LORD and Exotic, so that's what might be how. 
The reason for that is because EBITDA has grown dramatically, the cash flow generation of the company, the EBITDA margins have grown so dramatically that we can take this firepower behind it to continue to propel the company. So we're preparing for the future every day. And I think what we did really the last 10 years is what's positioned us to do the Meggitt acquisition."

It would be the portfolio changes we've made, but there's also things organically, we're doing differently the whole strategic positioning, which I'll try to give more color on that on IR Day and how our divisions are taking a real step change in ownership of how they position themselves versus their competitors. The innovation changes we've made on PVI and new product printing, simplify design, which is a growth propellant as well as a margin engine, international distribution growth, the digital leadership and the new incentive plan change, ACIP replacing RONA. All those things are going to help on the top line with several of those help on the margin side as well. So as the portfolio becomes more innovative, and it has over the last number of years, those carry higher margins. Simplify design, as some of you maybe heard me talk about will be the single largest margin enhancement the company has ever done, and it's just starting. International distribution as we move that mix, that's a margin enhancement. We found what digital leadership that we continue to get more efficient with the use of AI. 
And then probably last but not least the most important, the things we've done around engagement. If I had to pick one single thing that propelled the company, it's been the engagement of our team members, the engagement scores, the ownership. And it's hard to put a number to that, which you know when you have people that think and act like an owner that use Lean and Kaizen which is part of their normal thinking, that spirit of continuous improvement is a big part of what's driven our success to date. You can plot our Kaizen activity and our engagement scores and they're working hand in hand. They're locked on a parallel path driving success. So -- it's not one single thing, Joel. It's a number of things. And I guess that 1 slide that we showed you earlier showed the compounding effect of improvement year-over-year. The compounding on EPS, doubling at the compound of margins, and that's going to keep going. We're not going to stop."

We del",1610,"Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. This marks the end of FY '21 for us, and it was a difficult year personally and professionally for everybody due to COVID, but it was a year where the Parker team really shined. We delivered outstanding results and lived up to our purpose in enabling a better tomorrow, and my thanks goes out to the global team for just a great year, great quarter. 
So let's start with the quarter. It was dynamite. Top quartile safety performance, 29% reduction in reportable incidents. The sales growth in the quarter was 25% approximately. Organic was almost 22%, and the industrial portion of the company grew at almost 27% in the quarter. We have 6 all-time quarterly records: sales, net income, EPS, segment margins for total Parker as well as North America and international. The EBITDA margins were very strong at 21.8% as reported or 22.1% adjusted. That was 190 basis points improvement versus prior. On the segment operating margin, on an adjusted basis, if you go to last row, 22.2% or a 230 basis point improvement versus prior. Just a great quarter and a really great team effort by everybody around the world. 
Go to Slide 4, we'll move to the full year. It was a year of records, and I won't read all of these to you, but you can see 8 all-time fiscal year records. And just -- that's in the history of the company, so that's 104 years to put up a record. So it speaks to how well the team performed in this last fiscal year. 
Sales growth came in almost 5% year-over-year. Organic was flat, but clear momentum building on orders and organic growth in the second half of the year as you see from our order rates. FY '23 margin targets, we hit them at full 2 years early, and we'll be announcing new targets once we have Investor Day, March of next year, and we're going to go out for a new 5-year target, so we'll be going out to FY '26. We look forward to a discussion at that time. 
Operating cash flow was $2.6 billion, a record, that was almost 18% of sales. Free cash flow conversion rate was 135%. And we were very pleased to be able to announce the offer to acquire Meggitt PLC, which greatly enhances our aerospace portfolio, and I'll touch on that briefly here in a few minutes. 
So if you go to Slide 5, I want to talk about the transformation of the company, give you a little bit of color behind what's driving it and the progress we're making on the results. 
And Slide 6 speaks to those 3 drivers: living up to our purpose, being great generators and deployers of cash, and being a top quartile performer. I'm going to touch on each one of these over the next several slides. 
When it comes to purpose, enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. This is something that really resonates with our people. It represents a higher calling to your work, and it acts as our North Star. In the next few slides, I'm going to talk about and highlight our purpose in action, specifically our technologies and how they're helping health care and how they're helping the climate and create a more clean technology world for everybody. 
So on Slide 8, we're going to talk about vaccine production, in particular, something that's obviously very pertinent for today, COVID-19 production. On the left-hand side speaks to the challenges that drug manufacturers have today. This is a batch process typically with extensive inventories, long lead times to produce these products. They take huge space requirements, large footprints for storage, large footprints with the manufacturing processes and very difficult changeovers. The cleaning cycles between the batch processes is very complicated. So the idea here is a simple concept that most of us can relate to. All those that have been in some kind of a restaurant with a soda fountain, where you can pick your beverage of choice. And of course, the technology behind that is a concentrated syrup and carbonated water and you get to pick the soft drink of your choice. So the idea here is instead of soft drinks, could we deliver sterile vaccine ingredients with a similar type of process? 
And Slide 9 is that process. So that's our Inline Dilution System. It's a proprietary point-of-use process for combining the purified vaccine ingredients. So if you look at that piece of equipment, you can see it's on wheels, so it's modular, easy to move around, easy to deploy. As mixing and sensing combined, it has 2-way communications via the IoT-enabled, so it can talk to the manufacturer's enterprise system to enable scheduling it just in time. It uses, very importantly, intellectual property-protected single-use consumables. So instead of these massive batch processes, huge cleaning events for changeovers, this is a giant productivity improvement for the drug manufacturers on the speed of the changeover, but also just reducing contamination tied to the changeover. 
Then our software and automation helps control the amount and the flow of these various ingredients. So this applies obviously to COVID-19 and apply to other vaccines that are being developed and that we can use this for other drugs as well. So this is a really attractive business opportunity for us. But more importantly, it's a great help to customers and the society. It's a great example of our purpose in action. 
Move to Slide 10, move to the climate and the clean technology portion of our purpose. We just recently announced last month new sustainability targets. You see on the right-hand side of this page is our new sustainability report, which you can reach electronically, where we announced a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. So that would be Scope 1 and 2 emissions, direct and indirect. And by 2040, same things go pointing to be carbon neutral. So enabling a more sustainable future with what we do with our plants, our operations, our supply chain. 
But in addition, if you go to Slide 11, and actually, more importantly, how can we help our customers? Like how can we help society with the sustainability journey? And so in this page you see, the 8 motion control technologies across the top and that this portfolio, approximately 2/3 of this portfolio is a very much part of the enabling of clean technologies for our customers. The exciting part is an expanding bill of material on automobiles, on construction equipment, on forestry and mining, basically almost every piece of equipment on airplanes, engines, everything is feeling this impact of more electric applications. So there's onboard opportunities, but there's also infrastructure opportunities as the world has to build in infrastructure to support that growth. Our technologies can help with that infrastructure move. 
And then I want to move to Slide 12, which illustrates the top quartile performance portion of those 3 drivers. And you can see we're using 2 metrics to illustrate this: adjusted EPS on the left and adjusted EBITDA margin on the right. It's really been our people, the strategic portfolio changes we made, the capital deployment decisions that we made over the last 7 years and The Win Strategy that's transformed this performance. And when you step back and look at this, this is just a remarkable improvement. 
On the left is a more than doubling of our EPS, and that's hard to do. I can assure you that's really hard to do. This is a fantastic progress, a little less than $7 in FY '16 and over $15 as we closed last year. And the EBITDA margin, which has clearly been propelling that from 14.7% to 21.3%, so a 660 basis point improvement there. 
And then the last part on transformation and the drivers is cash generation and deployment. We touched on the cash generation piece in my opening comments, but clearly, in the deployment is how do you deploy capital and buying effective companies. And we're very excited to put 2 high-quality companies together, an aerospace combination that we announced Monday, Parker and Meggitt, nearly doubles the size of our Aerospace Systems segment with highly complementary technologies, 70% sole source, a strong recurring revenue, excellent growth potential, combination of commercial aerospace recovery as well as the synergies, and this will be accretive to our organic sales growth margins, EPS and cash flow. 
This deal makes sense for all stakeholders, the shareholders of Parker and Meggitt. The team members of both of our companies, their parishioners, pensioners and, of course, both of our customers. Following the announcement on Monday, we've introduced ourselves to the key stakeholders in the U.K., reinforcing why we are the best home for Meggitt. Our long great track record in the U.K., a clear strategic rationale for the deal including a premium we are offering to the Meggitt shareholders, our shared interest to continue to innovate and invest, that we are committed to being a responsible steward of Meggitt. And that is why we've agreed with Meggitt to offer the U.K. government a number of legally binding commitments about how we're going to operate going forward. 
These type of transactions take time, but we are pleased with the reception so far, and we look forward to constructive discussions with the key people in the U.K. government. And we'll keep you updated as the process unfolds and we go to the planned completion of this in approximate 12 months. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Todd for more details on the quarter."
295170,1675233688,2365462,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Parker-Hannifin Corporation","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Tom. I guess I would like to direct everyone's attention to Slide 15. And I'll just, real quickly, walk through the FY '21 Q4 results. As Tom mentioned earlier, we have some outstanding results to share here. Sales increased over 25% in Q4 ve",2263,"Yes. Thanks, Tom. I guess I would like to direct everyone's attention to Slide 15. And I'll just, real quickly, walk through the FY '21 Q4 results. As Tom mentioned earlier, we have some outstanding results to share here. Sales increased over 25% in Q4 versus prior year and finished at $3.9 billion. As we've said, that's an all-time record for the company. And we're really particularly proud of this due to the fact that our aerospace markets are still challenged. 
It really demonstrates the strength of the portfolio additions that we've spoken about, CLARCOR, LORD and Exotic, and really is driven by strong broad-based demand across all of our industrial businesses. Organic sales are up 22% in the quarter. So basically, the majority of that change is all organic. This is the first time organic sales have been positive for the company in over 2 years. Currency also was favorable with a 3.5% impact to total sales. 
Moving to adjusted segment margins. That 22.2% is an improvement, like Tom said, of 230 basis points from prior year, and it's also 80 basis points improved sequentially from Q3. Just another strong quarter of margin performance as really our teams around the world pivoted to the increased demand levels and managed through a number of challenges. Very proud of our team for that margin performance. 
Incrementals are also commendable at 31% year-over-year, really impressive considering last year with the depth of the pandemic. And our decrementals last year were fantastic at plus -- or excuse me, minus 13%. And if you remember, that included approximately $175 million of temporary savings in that FY '20 Q4. So we're really happy with the 31% incrementals. 
EBITDA margins also expanded 190 basis points from prior year, finishing the quarter at 22.1%. And if you look at that net income number, $577 million, that's an ROS of 14.6%, and that's an increase of nearly 50% from prior year. All of those great results translated to an adjusted EPS of $4.38. That's an increase of $1.39 per share or 46% compared to the prior year number on this slide of $2.99. 
Just one point I want to reference to the prior year numbers, and I'm really speaking to net income and the EPS numbers only. We have been planning for some time to convert our remaining U.S. locations that used to use LIFO for inventory evaluation to standardize that across the company and move to FIFO inventory valuation purposes. We made that voluntary change in FY '21 Q4, and we've retrospectively applied that change to prior years, and we've attached the impact of those prior years to this press release in the table section. So the impact to the previously reported quarter last year was minimal. It was only $0.04 last year. So the $2.99 on this page, if you're looking back to prior year, that would have been $3.03 in FY '20. 
So one other note I want to make, LIFO, we've always booked this at the corporate level. This has no impact to our segment operating margins or the incrementals that I just mentioned to and now 100% of the company's inventory is valued using the FIFO method. 
So just one last comment on the quarter. Really proud of our team globally. It's just a tremendous effort the team put forth to put up just such a solid quarter to finish really, as Tom said, a record year. 
So if we can move to Slide 16, this is just a bridge of that $1.39 increase to adjusted EPS that I just mentioned, and what I love here is the largest bar on the page. Signals the strong operating performance that the teams put together. Our segment operating income on an adjusted basis increased $250 million or 40% from prior year Q4. That accounts to $1.50 of the increase in EPS that we just put up for the quarter of $1.39, so it's really strong execution really everywhere across the company. All the other items you see on the slide, if you net it, it's $0.11 unfavorable. Corporate G&A, income tax and shares were slightly unfavorable, but lower interest and lower other expense partially offset the impact there. So again, most of this is really fantastic due to comparing back to our COVID-impacted quarter of the prior year. 
If you go to Slide 17, just some color on our segment performance. Really, the message here is our industrial businesses delivered outstanding results across the board. We've spoken in the past about the impact of these portfolio changes have had on the company, and you can see it here in these margin numbers. Diversified North America sales were $1.8 billion in the quarter. Organic sales improved again in this segment sequentially up and are up 26% versus prior year. Operating margins improved an impressive 300 basis points versus prior year and really finished at 22.5% for the quarter. Obviously, volume helped us a little bit there, but really the disciplined operating performance and cost control really continue to drive the sizable increase to margins. Margins in this segment are a record, all-time record. And incrementals also were very healthy at 34%. And again, I keep referencing the comparables back to last year, which is just a very tough comparison. 
If you look at order rates, order rates are robust at plus 56%. This is up sequentially from last quarter where we reported plus 11% and really just strong across the board. 
If I move to the International -- Diversified International segment, really same story here, a little bit higher organic growth of 28.5%. Sales just reached $1.5 billion in that segment. And again, another story here, adjusted segment operating margins expanded 300 basis points versus prior year and finished at 22.1% in the International segment. Just really, again, strong organic growth in that volume, coupled with that cost containment and productivity initiatives really generated this record margin performance in this segment as well. Order rates again here, tremendous, up a little bit higher than North America at plus 58% versus 14% positive in the last quarter. So really just a great performance out of our industrial businesses. 
I'll just touch on Aerospace Systems, really slightly. Very sound performance in the current market. Sales here were $630 million for the quarter. And I'm happy to report organic sales have turned positive in this segment. They are up 1%. We saw strength in commercial and military aftermarkets with strong sequential growth again in Q4, and we're happy to start seeing rate increases from OEMs, particularly in the narrow body and business jet platforms. Aerospace orders also got less negative and improved to minus 7% this quarter on a rolling 12 basis versus minus 19% last quarter and further proof that we are seeing signs of recovery in this area. Operating margins also very strong, 21.6%. That improved sequentially from Q3 and really finished the year at the highest level they've had in the entire fiscal year. So very proud of our aerospace team there. 
So just looking at the company as a whole, we're really pleased with these results. It's a solid finish to the fiscal year. Our total incrementals were 31%. I'm really proud about that. And really just a comment, if I look at just our industrial businesses, if I go back to pre-pandemic FY '19 and on a like-for-like basis, if I include LORD in those FY '19 numbers, in the industrial businesses, our sales volume has surpassed pre-COVID levels. So we're really proud about that. Orders you can see in total are plus 43%. And as Tom mentioned, not only did we achieve our FY '23 margin targets, but we surpassed them, and we did that 2 years early. 
So if I go to the next slide, Slide 18, cash flow. We're obviously very proud of this. Tom mentioned this earlier. Full year cash flow from operations was $2.6 billion, that's an all-time record for the company. 17.9% of sales, just outstanding top quartile performance. If you look at that compared to prior year, we generated over $500 million more cash. That's 24% more cash than we did prior year. And like I said, that CFOA at $2.6 billion is a record. Working capital, really solid performance here. And I want to just really thank our teams everywhere around the world for focusing on this. We asked them to focus on this through the pandemic and they delivered soundly. So I want to thank you all for your focus on that. 
Free cash flow, also fantastic, 16.5%. That's up 310 basis points versus prior year, and the free cash flow conversion for the year, 135%. So with that, this now marks the 20th year that free cash flow conversion has been greater than 100% and cash flow from operations have been greater than 10%, 20 years running. All of these allowed us to significantly pay down our serviceable debt. We've been vocal about that for the last couple of months. If you look at the last 20 months, we've paid down $3.4 billion of debt and our gross debt-to-EBITDA finished the year at 2.1%. Net debt is 1.9%. So again, the similar story here, we achieved these leverage levels a full 1 year sooner than we had originally forecast, and it's just an outstanding cash position. It's top quartile execution and really impressive considering the backdrop of the global pandemic. 
So 19, I will ask you to focus on 19, just flipping to FY '22 and our guidance. You saw that we released this, this morning. As usual, we're going to provide this on an as-reported and adjusted basis. And I'll just start at the top. 
Sales. We're forecasting sales to increase in the range of 5% to 9%, really 7% at the midpoint. And really the breakdown of that sales growth is essentially all organic. We do not expect the Meggitt transaction to close in FY '22. Both LORD and Exotic have anniversary-ed, so those are no longer considered acquisition sales. Therefore, we are forecasting no impact to sales from acquisitions. And currency is just a minimal drag at 0.2% of sales. And just like we always do, we have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates at the end of June 30, and we've held those rates study as we forecast FY '22. One thing I'll note, the sales split for the guide is 48% first half, 52% second half.
The next item I'll talk about is segment operating margin. On an as-reported basis, the guidance for the full year is 19.3% at the midpoint, and there's a range of 20 basis points on either side of that. But more importantly, on an adjusted basis, segment operating margin guidance for the full year is 21.6% at the midpoint, same range of 20 basis points on either side of that. This adjusted segment operating margin guide is 50 basis points higher than what we just finished our record FY '21 at. 
Just some color on adjustments. At a pretax level, business realignment charges are expected to be $35 million for FY '22. LORD cost to achieve are only $7 million for the forecasted year and acquisition-related intangible amortization is $320 million. Just a note on the split, adjusted segment operating margins 46% first half, 52% second half. 
If you look at the corporate G&A interest and other, $480 million is our forecast. That is the same on an adjusted and an as-reported basis. Tax rate, we are forecasting full year to be 23%. And finally, EPS on an as-reported basis, our guidance is $14.48 at the midpoint. There's a $0.40 range on either side of that. And our adjusted EPS guidance is $16.60 at the midpoint, same $0.40 range on either side of that. Adjusted EPS split first half is 45%, second half is 55%. And a little color on Q1, we are forecasting adjusted EPS to be $3.60 at the midpoint. 
Slide 20 is the bridge. And again, this is very similar to Q4. Main driver of the $1.56 or 10% increase to adjusted earnings per share is just our continued strong execution across the enterprise. Segment operating margin is accounting for $1.76 of that change. And then again, just slightly higher corporate G&A, tax and average shares outstanding are a little bit of a drag. But all in, a $1.56 increase in earnings per share, increasing earnings per share by 10%. 
Lastly, I will just talk about capital deployment. For FY '22, we are committed to our capital deployment strategies. We have a strong 65 year of -- record of consistently, consecutively increasing the annual dividends paid. We're going to continue with that record. Our payout target is not changed. It remains 30% to 35% of the 5-year average of net income. And of course, we're going to continue to fund organic growth and productivity across our global locations. We expect capital expenditures to be 2% for the year. 
Our 10b5-1 share repurchase program, we reinstated that this year. We are committed to continuing that in FY '22. And as I mentioned, when I was talking about cash flow, we have extinguished all of our serviceable debt, and we are now in a cash-building position. So our focus for FY '22 will be to continue our record of strong cash flow generation and accumulation in preparation for the closing of the Meggitt transaction. 
So with that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you, and I'll ask the audience to focus on Slide 22."

Having said that, we're not immune to what's going on in any of the regions, but I would characterize it internally as being manageable but not without hard work. Now I would say the biggest challenges we're dealing with is just our customers. So I mean, I think automotive is very public on what's happening. But I probably don't have a large OEM that hasn't had some kind of disruption where lands have been down, people have been sent home, et cetera. So we're working with our customers to work through that. It's just creating a lot of chatter in the channel and it's just, I would say, best is a lot of choppy production."

I'll go through the aerospace piece. I'll let Lee touch on the price cost aspect. So this is probably the question that everybody -- is on everybody's mind and how do we come up with the guidance and some of the context behind it. So first of all, there's a number of tailwinds, and I'll highlight some of the headwinds. But on the tailwind side, clearly, the order trends, the macro environment, I think there's a CapEx underspend that happened for a number of years. So I think there's some CapEx demand that's coming back for manufacturing companies. Clearly, governments being more prone to put in stimuluses, the rebound from the great shutdown and, of course, rebound of activity, the commercial aerospace recovery, which I'll touch on, to answer your question here in a minute, Jamie. Low interest rates and then the climate investment, which with our clean technology portfolio is a very attractive positive for us in the future. 
On the headwind side is the Delta variant and COVID hasn't gone away and is creating uncertainties throughout the world. The supply chain disruptions in particular, our customers and how that might impact demand patterns, which Lee touched on. Then inflation, both on the material side and wages. But we've built a pretty sophisticated AI model over the last 18 months. It's not perfect, nothing is when it comes to forecasting. But in my time at the company, it's the best tool we've had to date, and we have factored in all these inputs and came up with what the best forecast is. 
So I'll give you a little more details behind it. The first half that we're looking at is up a little over 9% organically. The second half up mid-single digits. That's how you get to the 7% overall. An important part, though, if you look at the industrial piece, both North America and industrial were approximately the same, up 11% in the first half and up mid-single digits in the second half. 
When you think about aerospace and several of the pre reports that came out, didn't have the insight that I'm going to share with you right now. So we have aerospace with a gradual recovery, up 3% in the first half, up 5% in the second half, that's where you get the 4% at the midpoint. But what's underneath that and will help give you some context is as to why that number is what it is. 
On the commercial side, both OEM and MRO, that's going to grow low teens. So nice recovery there. Military MRO is growing mid-single digits. What is down is military OEM. It's down mid-single digits. And the reason for that and thankfully, our customers -- probably as our customers accelerated deliveries last year, we were up 19% as an example. They did this to protect the supply chain to protect supplier health because a lot of suppliers have commercial exposure as well as military exposure, and they accelerated the military exposure to help everybody. So this year that we're in now, '22 is a reset of the inventory through that supply chain. So we will be down. And of course, then we'll go back to more normal levels in FY '23. If you would take out that acceleration in the prior period, our FY '22 military OEM would be about a plus 3%. So then when you add -- when you would factor that in, aerospace growth would be more like 8%. So that 4% is being weighted down by the military OEM segment, that reset of inventory. So hopefully, that helps everybody with why the aerospace number is what it is. 
Just comparing that growth rate to 7% to GIPI, Global Industrial Production Index, that's going to be within our fiscal year '22, that's a 4.8% forecast. And you've heard us talk externally, we want to grow 150 basis points faster than that. So that our number of 7% would do that. Then maybe while I've got kind of talking about guidance, I want to just touch for a second on operating margin, and I'll let Lee comment about price cost. So our operating margin guide is at 21.6% at the midpoint. So it's approximately 30% or more less for the full year. If you were to take out the discretionaries in the prior period, it made this an apples-to-apples, the underlying MROS is a positive 50%. And a good indicator is what we did in Q4, we did over 50% in Q4, so that was actual results. 
The reason why I mentioned that is that underlying MROS is being hidden because of the year-over-year comparisons being awkward and really speaks to the operational excellence from the team just because it's hard to do an underlying 50% MROS. I think everybody can appreciate that. 
So Lee, if you want to comment on the price cost."

In other words, everything was up. And I would tell you here a quarter later, it's still a sea of red. 
But having said that, we're able to see this coming very well because of the processes we have internally, by measuring what we call our purchase price index and then also maintaining margin neutrality by our selling price index. So we're on top of it. And our goal, as we've always said, is to be margin neutral. We're actively working price both with direct customers and distribution.

This is Tom. I think just to maybe help clarify things for people. People, you're doing 2-year stacks, you might say, ""Hey, geez, it seems like the organic growth might be like compared to the 2-year stack."" The one thing that you have to look at is in current period, we have acquisitions. In prior period, we do not have LORD exactly all the way back to '19. When you do apples-to-apples on orders, '19 to '21 and exclude the acquisitions, our industrial orders are up low teens. And I just mentioned, as I was answering to Jamie's question, our forecast for the first half on industrial is low teens at 11% organic growth. So there's a clear correlation between what we're seeing versus '19, again, apples-to-apples on order entry. And that's how we -- in addition to the AI model, how we laid out the year. 
The backlogs are increasing. Again, you got to remember that the prior periods has uniquely low comps. It's probably an inflated number that you can't get too excited about. Our on-time delivery is holding up nicely. Obviously, my customers would like to see us do better on that, but it's holding up very well compared to comparable times. And I'd say the impact that we've seen has been more on customer pushouts of schedules, particularly in automotive, where the automobile OEMs are having trouble with chips as everybody knows, and they're taking really targeted shutdowns and that will push out our various orders and that impacted North America a little bit in Q4. But as Todd had mentioned, our Q4 sales were up about 10% industrial versus Q4 of FY '19. So everything is kind of coalescing between orders and sales when you compare to '19 around that low teens type of growth rate."

So we took a look at it and said, ""Hey, maybe this year is an opportunity to convert,"" and that's essentially what we did. We converted early in the quarter. We worked tirelessly across our teams and with our internal -- or excuse me, our external auditors and we felt it was the best time to do it. 
There really is no impact to the quarter since we converted. We essentially reported the quarter in the FIFO method. We did go back and restate prior years just to show you what the impact was. And I just want to make sure everybody realizes that. If you look at this historically, it's $0.01 or $0.02 per quarter. It's a very immaterial impact. We always book that at corporate, so it had no impact to our segment margins or anywhere incrementals, and it really just now standardizes our inventory valuation across the entire company.

So we've been on this for a while. And it's energy things that we do within the plants, renewables, different lighting, some of this will happen from indirect emissions as the various utility companies change over to easy renewables. We automatically get credit for that as well. We're going to be working with our suppliers and what they can do to reduce it. All the Kaizen work we do or we just utilize the equipment better, smaller footprints, better flow, less distances traveled, all those kind of things helped in this reduction. So we have every group signed up for their -- have their prospective greenhouse targets that they're working on. They know exactly where they are, and that gets cascaded down plant by plant. 
And then we've also have -- envision every group having a list of greenhouse gas emissions reductions, water things they're doing, recycling things they're doing, that's in the way we know how to do. We drive it down in the respective divisions. And then at the group level, we have each group on their technology road map developing their clean technology portfolio and how it needs to change for more EVs, more fuel cell EVs, more hydrogen, et cetera, and the groups have been actively doing it. 
The good thing about this is we've formed the Motion Technology Center about 3 years ago, and for people who aren't familiar with it, this was taking the best and brightest that we could between aerospace and our Motion Systems Group. So taking all the motion-related technology of the company, having a center of excellence for it and, in particular, focusing on electrification. And a lot of the technologies that we developed in the '90s on the F-35, so the flight surfaces on the F-35 fighter are electro-hydraulically actuated, and we've taken a lot of those learnings and applied it into the industrial portion of the company and developed a suite of motors and motor controllers and software that we're offering on the industrial companies, OEMs in particular, where their platform changes as they look more electric. 
And when you add in acquisitions like LORD on top of the engineered materials applications that we have from legacy Parker, we have a really strong material science portfolio to help with that transformation as well. So our sustainability message is twofold: things we're going to do internally, which we have good line of sight to, and we've put out 2 major targets 2030 and 2040, but we're looking for year-over-year things to get there; and then what we're doing to help our customers because our customers at Scope 3, that's us helping our customers, and we'll be all over doing that."

Some of the recent acquisitions, I think we've got some upside on inventory and really on receivables and payables throughout the last 20 months. So I still think we've got room to grow here. So we're not expecting much of an impact."

We look at it all the time, not just when we have a large acquisition, but this is something we have standard workaround that we look at, at the office of the Chief Executive. So Lee, Todd and myself as well as we do it annually with the Board. And I would characterize that I've used this visual for people. I think the portfolio of the company has been very thoughtfully put together. Think of it as a tree trunk with the various branches. 2/3 of our revenue comes from customers that buy from 4 or more of the 8 technologies we have. So my predecessors and everybody that built this company did a very thoughtful job of putting together interconnected pieces that make sense. 
So when we do that portfolio analysis, there's very little we see that we'd want to divest. It's something we look at all the time. It doesn't mean that we wouldn't divest anything. But if you use the tree analogy, it would be a small branch. There's going to be no major trunks that gets lopped off. But we look at it all the time, but I wouldn't see any big announcements from us regarding divestitures."

Those internal actions have been happening every day since I joined the company and every day that everybody else that works here. I mean we're all about continuous improvement. And I think the slide we showed earlier on, the 660 basis points improvement in EBITDA margin, is what's positioned us to be able to do a deal of this size. If you think about a couple of things regarding Meggitt, and just using that as an example, the multiples that we're going to do are very similar or less than what we did with CLARCOR. The synergies -- while the dollars are big, the percent synergies are very similar to what we did with CLARCOR and LORD. And what's interesting is we're going to do the deal that has over 2x the purchase price of our largest transaction, but our starting leverage will be about the same point that we were when we did LORD and Exotic, so the question might be how. 
The reason for that is because EBITDA has grown dramatically, the cash flow generation of the company, the EBITDA margins have grown so dramatically that we can take this size, and it looks very similar to what we did in the past. And so we've been getting ready every day. And as we keep getting ready, we'll probably be ready to do something even better as we go into the future. When we update you on our FY '26 targets, they're going to be higher than where we are today. And The Win Strategy 3.0 just started, and it has tremendous firepower behind it to continue to propel the company. So we're preparing for the future every day. And I think what we did really the last 10 years is what's positioned us to do the Meggitt acquisition."

It would be the portfolio changes we've made, but there's also things organically, we're doing differently, the whole strategic positioning, which I'll try to give more color on that on IR Day and how our divisions are taking a real step change in ownership of how they position themselves versus their competitors. The innovation changes we've made on PVI and new product blueprinting, Simple by Design, which is a growth propellant as well as a margin engine, international distribution growth, the digital leadership and the new incentive plan change, ACIP replacing RONA. All those things are going to help on the top line with several of those help on the margin side as well. So as the portfolio becomes more innovative, and it has over the last number of years, those carry higher margins. Simple by Design, as some of you maybe heard me talk about, will be the single-largest margin enhancement the company has ever done, and it's just starting. International distribution as we move that mix, that's a margin enhancement. We found with digital leadership that we continue to get more efficient with the use of AI. 
And then probably last, but not least, and the most important, the things we've done around engagement. If I had to pick one single thing that's propelled the company, it's been the engagement of our team members, the engagement scores, the ownership. And it's hard to put a number to that, which you know when you have people that think and act like an owner that use Lean and Kaizen, which is part of their normal thinking, that spirit of continuous improvement is a big part of what's driven our success to date. 
You can plot our Kaizen activity and our engagement scores and they're working hand in hand. They're looking at parallel path driving success. So it's not one single thing, Joel. It's a number of things. And I guess that 1 slide that we showed you earlier showed the compounding effect of improvement year-over-year. The compounding on EPS doubling at the compound of margins, and that's going to keep going. We're not going to stop."

This marks the end of FY '21 for us, and it was a difficult year personally and professionally for everybody due to COVID, but it was a year where the Parker team really shined. We delivered outstanding results and lived up to our purpose in enabling a better tomorrow, and my thanks goes out to the global team for just a great year, great quarter. 
So let's start with the quarter. It was dynamite. Top quartile safety performance, 29% reduction in reportable incidents. The sales growth in the quarter was 25% approximately. Organic was almost 22%, and the industrial portion of the company grew at almost 27% in the quarter. We have 6 all-time quarterly records: sales, net income, EPS, segment margins for total Parker, as well as North America and international. The EBITDA margins were very strong at 21.8% as reported or 22.1% adjusted. That was 190 basis points improvement versus prior. On the segment operating margin, on an adjusted basis, if you go to last row, 22.2% or a 230 basis point improvement versus prior. Just a great quarter and a really great team effort by everybody around the world. 
Go to Slide 4, we'll move to the full year. It was a year of records, and I won't read all of these to you, but you can see 8 all-time fiscal year records. And just -- that's in the history of the company, so that's 104 years to put up a record. So it speaks to how well the team performed in this last fiscal year. 
Sales growth came in almost 5% year-over-year. Organic was flat, but clear momentum building on orders and organic growth in the second half of the year as you see from our order rates. FY '23 margin targets, we hit them at full 2 years early. And we'll be announcing new targets once we have Investor Day, March of next year, and we're going to go out for a new 5-year target, so we'll be going out to FY '26. We look forward to a discussion at that time. 
Operating cash flow was $2.6 billion, a record, that was almost 18% of sales. Free cash flow conversion rate was 135%. And we were very pleased to be able to announce the offer to acquire Meggitt PLC, which greatly enhances our aerospace portfolio, and I'll touch on that briefly here in a few minutes. 
So if you go to Slide 5, I want to talk about the transformation of the company, give you a little bit of color behind what's driving it and the progress we're making on the results. 
And Slide 6 speaks to those 3 drivers: living up to our purpose, being great generators and deployers of cash, and being a top quartile performer. I'm going to touch on each one of these over the next several slides. 
When it comes to purpose, enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. This is something that really resonates with our people. It represents a higher calling to your work, and it acts as our North Star. In the next few slides, I'm going to talk about and highlight our purpose in action, specifically our technologies and how they're helping health care and how they're helping the climate and create a more clean technology world for everybody. 
So on Slide 8, we're going to talk about vaccine production, in particular, something that's obviously very pertinent for today, COVID-19 production. 
On the left-hand side speaks to the challenges that drug manufacturers have today. This is a batch process typically, with extensive inventories, long lead times to produce these products. They take huge space requirements, large footprints for storage, large footprints with the manufacturing processes and very difficult changeovers. The cleaning cycles between the batch processes is very complicated. 
So the idea here is a simple concept that most of us can relate to. All those that have been in some kind of a restaurant with a soda fountain, where you can pick your beverage of choice. And of course, the technology behind that is a concentrated syrup and carbonated water, and you get to pick the soft drink of your choice. So the idea here is instead of soft drinks, could we deliver sterile vaccine ingredients with a similar type of process? 
And Slide 9 is that process. So that's our Inline Dilution System. It's a proprietary point-of-use process for combining the purified vaccine ingredients. 
So if you look at that piece of equipment, you can see it's on wheels, so it's modular, easy to move around, easy to deploy. Has mixing and sensing combined. It has 2-way communications via the IoT-enabled so it can talk to the manufacturer's enterprise system to enable scheduling it just in time. It uses, very importantly, intellectual property-protected single-use consumables. So instead of these massive batch processes, huge cleaning events for changeovers, this is a giant productivity improvement for the drug manufacturers on the speed of the changeover, but also just reducing contamination tied to the changeover. Then our software and automation helps control the amount and the flow of these various ingredients. 
So this applies obviously to COVID-19 and apply to other vaccines that are being developed, and that we can use this for other drugs as well. So this is a really attractive business opportunity for us. But more importantly, it's a great help to customers and the society. It's a great example of our purpose in action. 
Move to Slide 10, move to the climate and the clean technology portion of our purpose. We just recently announced last month new sustainability targets. You see on the right-hand side of this page is our new sustainability report, which you can reach electronically, where we announced a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. So that would be Scope 1 and 2 emissions, direct and indirect. And by 2040, same things go pointing to be carbon neutral. So enabling a more sustainable future with what we do with our plants, our operations, our supply chain. 
But in addition, if you go to Slide 11, and actually, more importantly, how can we help our customers? Like how can we help society with the sustainability journey? And so in this page you see the 8 motion control technologies across the top. And that this portfolio, approximately 2/3 of this portfolio is a very much part of the enabling of clean technologies for our customers. The exciting part is an expanding bill of material on automobiles, on construction equipment, on forestry and mining, basically almost every piece of equipment on airplanes, engines, everything is feeling this impact of more electric applications. So there's onboard opportunities, but there's also infrastructure opportunities as the world has to build in infrastructure to support that growth, our technologies can help with that infrastructure move. 
And then I want to move to Slide 12, which illustrates the top quartile performance portion of those 3 drivers. And you can see we're using 2 metrics to illustrate this: adjusted EPS on the left and adjusted EBITDA margin on the right. It's really been our people, the strategic portfolio changes we made, the capital deployment decisions that we made over the last 7 years and The Win Strategy that's transformed this performance. And when you step back and look at this, this is just a remarkable improvement. 
On the left is a more than doubling of our EPS, and that's hard to do. I can assure you that's really hard to do. This is a fantastic progress, a little less than $7 in FY '16 and over $15 as we closed last year. And the EBITDA margin, which has clearly been propelling that, from 14.7% to 21.3%, so a 660 basis point improvement there. 
And then the last part on transformation and the drivers is cash generation and deployment. We touched on the cash generation piece in my opening comments, but clearly, in the deployment is how do you deploy capital and buying effective companies. And we're very excited to put 2 high-quality companies together, an aerospace combination that we announced Monday, Parker and Meggitt, nearly doubles the size of our Aerospace Systems segment with highly complementary technologies, 70% sole source, a strong recurring revenue, excellent growth potential, combination of commercial aerospace recovery as well as the synergies. And this will be accretive to our organic sales growth, margins, EPS and cash flow. 
This deal makes sense for all stakeholders, the shareholders of Parker and Meggitt, the team members of both of our companies, their parishioners, pensioners, and of course, both of our customers. 
Following the announcement on Monday, we've introduced ourselves to the key stakeholders in the U.K., reinforcing why we are the best home for Meggitt: our long great track record in the U.K.; the clear strategic rationale for the deal, including a premium we are offering to the Meggitt shareholders; our shared interest to continue to innovate and invest; that we are committed to being a responsible steward of Meggitt. And that is why we've agreed with Meggitt to offer the U.K. government a number of legally binding commitments about how we're going to operate going forward. 
These type of transactions take time, but we are pleased with the reception so far, and we look forward to constructive discussions with the key people in the U.K. government. And we'll keep you updated as the process unfolds and we go to the planned completion of this in approximate 12 months. 
And with that, I'll hand it back to Todd for more details on the quarter."
295170,1675233688,2392247,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Parker-Hannifin Corporation","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Tom. I guess I would like to direct everyone's attention to Slide 15. And I'll just real quickly walk through the FY '21 Q4 results. As Tom mentioned earlier, we have some outstanding results to share here. Sales increased over 25% in Q4",2264,"Yes. Thanks, Tom. 
I guess I would like to direct everyone's attention to Slide 15. And I'll just real quickly walk through the FY '21 Q4 results. As Tom mentioned earlier, we have some outstanding results to share here. 
Sales increased over 25% in Q4 versus prior year and finished at $3.9 billion. As we've said, that's an all-time record for the company. And we're really particularly proud of this due to the fact that our aerospace markets are still challenged. 
It really demonstrates the strength of the portfolio additions that we've spoken about, CLARCOR, LORD and Exotic, and really is driven by strong broad-based demand across all of our industrial businesses. 
Organic sales are up 22% in the quarter. So basically, the majority of that 25% change is all organic. This is the first time organic sales have been positive for the company in over 2 years. Currency also was favorable with a 3.5% impact to total sales. 
Moving to adjusted segment margins. That 22.2% is an improvement, like Tom said, of 230 basis points from prior year and it's also 80 basis points improved sequentially from Q3. Just another strong quarter of margin performance as really our teams around the world pivoted to the increased demand levels and managed through a number of challenges. Very proud of our team for that margin performance. 
Incrementals are also commendable at 31% year-over-year, really impressive considering last year with the depth of the pandemic. And our decrementals last year were fantastic at plus -- or excuse me, minus 13%. And if you remember, that included approximately $175 million of temporary savings in that FY '20 Q4. So we're really happy with the 31% incrementals. 
EBITDA margins also expanded 190 basis points from prior year, finishing the quarter at 22.1%. And if you look at that net income number, $577 million, that's an ROS of 14.6%, and that's an increase of nearly 50% from prior year. All of those great results translated to an adjusted EPS of $4.38. That's an increase of $1.39 per share or 46% compared to the prior year number on this slide of $2.99. 
Just one point I want to reference to the prior year numbers, and I'm really speaking to net income and the EPS numbers only. We have been planning for some time to convert our remaining U.S. locations that used to use LIFO for inventory valuation to standardize that across the company and move to FIFO inventory valuation purposes. We made that voluntary change in FY '21 Q4, and we've retrospectively applied that change to prior years. And we've attached the impact of those prior years to this press release in the table section. So the impact to the previously reported quarter last year was minimal. It was only $0.04 last year. So the $2.99 on this page, if you're looking back to prior year, that would have been $3.03 in FY '20. 
So one other note I want to make. LIFO, we've always booked this at the corporate level. This has no impact to our segment operating margins or the incrementals that I just mentioned to. And now 100% of the company's inventory is valued using the FIFO method. 
So just one last comment on the quarter. Really proud of our team globally. It's just a tremendous effort the team put forth to put up just such a solid quarter to finish really, as Tom said, a record year. 
So if we can move to Slide 16. This is just a bridge of that $1.39 increase to adjusted EPS that I just mentioned. And what I love here is the largest bar on the page. It signals the strong operating performance that the teams put together. 
Our segment operating income on an adjusted basis increased $250 million or 40% from prior year Q4. That accounts to $1.50 of the increase in EPS that we just put up for the quarter of $1.39, so it's really strong execution really everywhere across the company. 
All the other items you see on the slide, if you net it, it's $0.11 unfavorable. Corporate G&A, income tax and shares were slightly unfavorable, but lower interest and lower other expense partially offset the impact there. So again, most of this is really fantastic due to comparing back to our COVID-impacted quarter of the prior year. 
If you go to Slide 17, just some color on our segment performance. Really, the message here is our industrial businesses delivered outstanding results across the board. We've spoken in the past about the impact of these portfolio changes have had on the company, and you can see it here in these margin numbers. 
Diversified North America sales were $1.8 billion in the quarter. Organic sales improved again in this segment, sequentially up, and are up 26% versus prior year. Operating margins improved an impressive 300 basis points versus prior year and really finished at 22.5% for the quarter. Obviously, volume helped us a little bit there, but really the disciplined operating performance and cost control really continue to drive the sizable increase to margins. Margins in this segment are a record, all-time record. And incrementals also were very healthy at 34%. And again, I keep referencing the comparables back to last year, which is just a very tough comparison. 
If you look at order rates, order rates are robust at plus 56%. This is up sequentially from last quarter where we reported plus 11% and really just strong across the board. 
If I move to the International -- Diversified International segment, really same story here, a little bit higher organic growth of 28.5%. Sales just reached $1.5 billion in that segment. And again, another story here, adjusted segment operating margins expanded 300 basis points versus prior year and finished at 22.1% in the International segment. Just really, again, strong organic growth in that volume coupled with that cost containment and productivity initiatives really generated this record margin performance in this segment as well. Order rates again here, tremendous, up a little bit higher than North America at plus 58% versus 14% positive in the last quarter. So really just a great performance out of our industrial businesses. 
I'll just touch on Aerospace Systems really slightly. Very sound performance in the current market. Sales here were $630 million for the quarter. And I'm happy to report organic sales have turned positive in this segment. They are up 1%. 
We saw strength in commercial and military aftermarkets with strong sequential growth again in Q4. And we're happy to start seeing rate increases from OEMs, particularly in the narrow body and business jet platforms. Aerospace orders also got less negative and improved to minus 7% this quarter on a rolling 12 basis versus minus 19% last quarter and further proof that we are seeing signs of recovery in this area. Operating margins, also very strong, 21.6%. That improved sequentially from Q3 and really finished the year at the highest level they've had in the entire fiscal year. So very proud of our aerospace team there. 
So just looking at the company as a whole, we're really pleased with these results. It's a solid finish to the fiscal year. Our total incrementals were 31%. I'm really proud about that. And really just a comment, if I look at just our industrial businesses, if I go back to pre-pandemic FY '19 and on a like-for-like basis, if I include LORD in those FY '19 numbers, in the industrial businesses, our sales volume has surpassed pre-COVID levels. So we're really proud about that. Orders, you can see in total, are plus 43%. And as Tom mentioned, not only did we achieve our FY '23 margin targets, but we surpassed them, and we did that 2 years early. 
So if I go to the next slide, Slide 18, cash flow. We're obviously very proud of this. Tom mentioned this earlier. Full year cash flow from operations was $2.6 billion. That's an all-time record for the company. 17.9% of sales, just outstanding top quartile performance. If you look at that compared to prior year, we generated over $500 million more cash. That's 24% more cash than we did prior year. And like I said, that CFOA at $2.6 billion is a record. 
Working capital, really solid performance here. And I want to just really thank our teams everywhere around the world for focusing on this. We asked them to focus on this through the pandemic and they delivered soundly. So I want to thank you all for your focus on that. 
Free cash flow, also fantastic, 16.5%. That's up 310 basis points versus prior year, and the free cash flow conversion for the year, 135%. So with that, this now marks the 20th year that free cash flow conversion has been greater than 100% and cash flow from operations have been greater than 10%, 20 years running. 
All of these allowed us to significantly pay down our serviceable debt. We've been vocal about that for the last couple of months. If you look at the last 20 months, we've paid down $3.4 billion of debt, and our gross debt-to-EBITDA finished the year at 2.1%. Net debt is 1.9%. So again, the similar story here, we achieved these leverage levels a full 1 year sooner than we had originally forecast, and it's just an outstanding cash position. It's top quartile execution and really impressive considering the backdrop of the global pandemic. 
So 19, I will ask you to focus on 19, just flipping to FY '22. And our guidance, you saw that we released this, this morning. As usual, we're going to provide this on an as-reported and adjusted basis. And I'll just start at the top. 
Sales, we're forecasting sales to increase in the range of 5% to 9%, really 7% at the midpoint. And really the breakdown of that sales growth is essentially all organic. We do not expect the Meggitt transaction to close in FY '22. Both LORD and Exotic have anniversary-ed, so those are no longer considered acquisition sales. Therefore, we are forecasting no impact to sales from acquisitions. 
And currency is just a minimal drag at 0.2% of sales. And just like we always do, we have calculated the impact of currency to spot rates at the end of June 30, and we've held those rates steady as we forecast FY '22. One thing I'll note, the sales split for the guide is 48% first half, 52% second half.
The next item I'll talk about is segment operating margin. On an as-reported basis, the guidance for the full year is 19.3% at the midpoint, and there's a range of 20 basis points on either side of that. But more importantly, on an adjusted basis, segment operating margin guidance for the full year is 21.6% at the midpoint, same range of 20 basis points on either side of that. This adjusted segment operating margin guide is 50 basis points higher than what we just finished our record FY '21 at. 
Just some color on adjustments. At a pretax level, business realignment charges are expected to be $35 million for FY '22. LORD cost to achieve are only $7 million for the forecasted year and acquisition-related intangible amortization is $320 million. Just a note on the split, adjusted segment operating margins: 46% first half, 52% second half. 
If you look at the corporate G&A interest and other, $480 million is our forecast. That is the same on an adjusted and an as-reported basis. Tax rate, we are forecasting full year to be 23%. And finally, EPS, on an as-reported basis, our guidance is $14.48 at the midpoint. There's a $0.40 range on either side of that. And our adjusted EPS guidance is $16.60 at the midpoint, same $0.40 range on either side of that. Adjusted EPS split: first half is 45%, second half is 55%. And a little color on Q1, we are forecasting adjusted EPS to be $3.60 at the midpoint. 
Slide 20 is the bridge. And again, this is very similar to Q4. Main driver of the $1.56 or 10% increase to adjusted earnings per share is just our continued strong execution across the enterprise. Segment operating margin is accounting for $1.76 of that change. And then again, just slightly higher corporate G&A, tax and average shares outstanding are a little bit of a drag. But all in, a $1.56 increase in earnings per share, increasing earnings per share by 10%. 
Lastly, I will just talk about capital deployment. For FY '22, we are committed to our capital deployment strategies. We have a strong 65 year of record of consistently, consecutively increasing the annual dividends paid. We're going to continue with that record. Our payout target is not changed. It remains 30% to 35% of the 5-year average of net income. And of course, we're going to continue to fund organic growth and productivity across our global locations. We expect capital expenditures to be 2% for the year. 
Our 10b5-1 share repurchase program, we reinstated that this year. We are committed to continuing that in FY '22. And as I mentioned when I was talking about cash flow, we have extinguished all of our serviceable debt, and we are now in a cash-building position. So our focus for FY '22 will be to continue our record of strong cash flow generation and accumulation in preparation for the closing of the Meggitt transaction. 
So with that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you, and I'll ask the audience to focus on Slide 22."

Now I would say the biggest challenges we're dealing with is just our customers. So I mean, I think automotive is very public on what's happening. But I probably don't have a large OEM that hasn't had some kind of disruption where lands have been down, people have been sent home, et cetera. So we're working with our customers to work through that. It's just creating a lot of chatter in the channel and it's just, I would say, best is a lot of choppy production."

I'll go through the aerospace piece. I'll let Lee touch on the price cost aspect. 
So this is probably the question that everybody -- is on everybody's mind, on how do we come up with the guidance and some of the context behind it. So first of all, there's a number of tailwinds, and I'll highlight some of the headwinds. But on the tailwind side, clearly, the order trends, the macro environment. I think there's a CapEx underspend that happened for a number of years. So I think there's some CapEx demand that's coming back for manufacturing companies. Clearly, governments being more prone to put in stimuluses, the rebound from the great shutdown, and of course, rebound of activity, the commercial aerospace recovery, which I'll touch on, to answer your question here in a minute, Jamie. Low interest rates and then the climate investment, which with our clean technology portfolio is a very attractive positive for us in the future. 
On the headwind side is the Delta variant, and COVID, it hasn't gone away and is creating uncertainties throughout the world. The supply chain disruptions in particular, our customers and how that might impact demand patterns, which Lee touched on. Then inflation, both on the material side and wages. But we've built a pretty sophisticated AI model over the last 18 months. It's not perfect, nothing is when it comes to forecasting. But in my time at the company, it's the best tool we've had to date. And we have factored in all these inputs and came up with what the best forecast is. 
So I'll give you a little more detail behind it. The first half that we're looking at is up a little over 9% organically, the second half, up mid-single digits. That's how you get to the 7% overall. An important part though, if you look at the industrial piece, both North America and industrial were approximately the same, up 11% in the first half and up mid-single digits in the second half. 
When you think about aerospace and several of the pre reports that came out, didn't have the insight that I'm going to share with you right now. So we have aerospace with a gradual recovery, up 3% in the first half, up 5% in the second half. That's where you get the 4% at the midpoint. 
But what's underneath that and will help give you some context as to why that number is what it is. On the commercial side, both OEM and MRO, that's going to grow low teens. So nice recovery there. Military MRO is growing mid-single digits. What is down is military OEM. It's down mid-single digits. And the reason for that, and thankfully, our customers -- it was our customers accelerated deliveries last year, we were up 19%, as an example. They did this to protect the supply chain, the -- protect supplier health because a lot of suppliers have commercial exposure as well as military exposure, and they accelerated the military exposure to help everybody. So this year that we're in now, '22 is a reset of the inventory through that supply chain. So we will be down. And of course, then we'll go back to more normal levels in FY '23. 
If you would take out that acceleration in the prior period, our FY '22 military OEM would be about a plus 3%. So then when you add -- when you would factor that in, aerospace growth would be more like 8%. So that 4% is being weighted down by the military OEM segment, that reset of inventory. So hopefully, that helps everybody with why the aerospace number is what it is. 
Just comparing that growth rate to 7% to GIPI, Global Industrial Production Index, that's going to be -- within our fiscal year '22, that's a 4.8% forecast. And you've heard us talk externally, we want to grow 150 basis points faster than that. So that our number of 7% would do that. 
Then maybe while I've got kind of talking about guidance, I want to just touch for a second on operating margin, and I'll let Lee comment about price cost. So our operating margin guide is at 21.6% at the midpoint. So it's approximate 30% or more less for the full year. If you were to take out the discretionaries in the prior period and made this an apples-to-apples, the underlying MROS is a positive 50%. And a good indicator is what we did in Q4, we did over 50% in Q4, so that was actual results. 
The reason why I mentioned that is that underlying MROS is being hidden because of the year-over-year comparisons being awkward and really speaks to the operational excellence from the team just because it's hard to do an underlying 50% MROS. I think everybody can appreciate that. 
So Lee, if you want to comment on the price cost."

In other words, everything was up. And I would tell you here a quarter later, it's still a sea of red. 
But having said that, we're able to see this coming very well because of the processes we have internally by measuring what we call our purchase price index and then also maintaining margin neutrality by our selling price index. So we're on top of it. And our goal, as we've always said, is to be margin neutral. We're actively working price both with direct customers and distribution.

This is Tom. 
I think just to maybe help clarify things for people. People, you're doing 2-year stacks, you might say, ""Hey, geez, it seems like the organic growth might be like compared to the 2-year stack."" The one thing that you have to look at is, in current period, we have acquisitions. In prior period, we do not have LORD and Exotic. You go all the way back to '19. When you do apples-to-apples on orders, '19 to '21, and exclude the acquisitions, our industrial orders are up low teens. And I just mentioned as I was answering to Jamie's question, our forecast for the first half on industrial is low teens at 11% organic growth. So there's a clear correlation between what we're seeing versus '19, again, apples-to-apples on order entry. And that's how we -- in addition to the AI model, how we laid out the year. 
The backlogs are increasing. Again, you got to remember, the prior periods has uniquely low comps. It's probably an inflated number that you can't get too excited about. Our on-time delivery is holding up nicely. Obviously, my customers would like to see us do better on that, but it's holding up very well compared to comparable times. 
And I'd say the impact that we've seen has been more on customer pushouts of schedules, particularly in automotive where the automobile OEMs are having trouble with chips, as everybody knows. And they're taking really targeted shutdowns and that will push out our various orders, and that impacted North America a little bit in Q4. But as Todd had mentioned, our Q4 sales were up about 10% industrial versus Q4 of FY '19. So everything is kind of coalescing between orders and sales when you compare to '19 around that low teens type of growth rate."

We've been talking about this internally for quite some time. And it really started with the recent acquisitions: CLARCOR, LORD and Exotic. Those companies always use the FIFO valuation method. We do not use it in our Aerospace business. We really only used it in our traditional U.S. locations. All of our international locations by rule had to use the FIFO valuation method. 
So we took a look at it and said, ""Hey, maybe this year is an opportunity to convert,"" and that's essentially what we did. We converted early in the quarter. We worked tirelessly across our teams and with our internal -- or excuse me, our external auditors, and we felt it was the best time to do it. 
There really is no impact to the quarter since we converted. We essentially reported the quarter in the FIFO method. We did go back and restate prior years just to show you what the impact was. 
And I just want to make sure everybody realizes that. If you look at this historically, it's $0.01 or $0.02 per quarter. It's a very immaterial impact. We always book that at corporate, so it had no impact to our segment margins or anywhere incrementals. And it really just now standardizes our inventory valuation across the entire company. So we're happy with the results.

So we've been on this for a while. And it's energy things that we do within the plants, renewables, different lighting. Some of this will happen from indirect emissions. As the various utility companies change over to easy renewables, we automatically get credit for that as well. We're going to be working with our suppliers in what they can do to reduce it. All the Kaizen work we do, where we just utilize the equipment better, smaller footprints, a better flow, less distances traveled, all those kind of things helped in this reduction. So we have every group signed up for their -- have their prospective greenhouse targets that they're working on. They know exactly where they are, and that gets cascaded down plant by plant. 
And then we've also have -- so envision every group having a list of greenhouse gas emissions reductions, water things they're doing, recycling things they're doing, that's in the way, we know how to do. We drive it down in the respective divisions. And then at the group level, we have each group on their technology road map developing their clean technology portfolio and how it needs to change for more EVs, more fuel cell EVs, more hydrogen, et cetera. And the groups have been actively doing it. 
The good thing about this is we've formed the Motion Technology Center about 3 years ago. And for people who aren't familiar with it, this was taking the best and brightest that we could between aerospace and our Motion Systems Group. So taking all the motion-related technology of the company, having a center of excellence for it, and in particular, focusing on electrification. 
And a lot of the technologies that we developed in the '90s on the F-35, so the flight surfaces on the F-35 fighter are electro-hydraulically actuated. And we've taken a lot of those learnings and applied it into the industrial portion of the company and developed a suite of motors and motor controllers and software that we're offering on the industrial companies, OEMs in particular, where their platform changes as they look more electric. And when you add in acquisitions like LORD on top of the engineered materials applications that we have from legacy Parker, we have a really strong material science portfolio to help with that transformation as well. 
So our sustainability message is twofold: things we're going to do internally, which we have good line of sight to. And we've put out 2 major targets, 2030 and 2040, but we're looking for year-over-year things to get there, and then what we're doing to help our customers, because our customers at Scope 3, that's us helping our customers, and we'll be all over doing that."

And I would characterize that -- I've used this visual for people. I think the portfolio of the company has been very thoughtfully put together. Think of it as a tree trunk with the various branches. 2/3 of our revenue comes from customers that buy from 4 or more of the 8 technologies we have. So my predecessors and everybody that built this company did a very thoughtful job of putting together interconnected pieces that make sense. 
So when we do that portfolio analysis, there's very little that we see that we'd want to divest. It's something we look at all the time. It doesn't mean that we wouldn't divest anything.

Those internal actions have been happening every day since I joined the company and every day that everybody else that works here. I mean we're all about continuous improvement. And I think the slide we showed earlier on, the 660 basis points improvement in EBITDA margin, is what's positioned us to be able to do a deal of this size. 
If you think about a couple of things regarding Meggitt, and just using that as an example, the multiples that we're going to do are very similar or less than what we did with CLARCOR. The synergies -- while the dollars are big, the percent synergies are very similar to what we did with CLARCOR and LORD. And what's interesting is we're going to do a deal that has over 2x the purchase price of our largest transaction, but our starting leverage will be about the same point that we were when we did LORD and Exotic. So the question might be, how? 
The reason for that is because EBITDA has grown dramatically, the cash flow generation of the company, the EBITDA margins have grown so dramatically that we can take this size, and it looks very similar to what we did in the past. And so we've been getting ready every day. And as we keep getting ready, we'll probably be ready to do something even better as we go into the future. 
When we update you on our FY '26 targets, they're going to be higher than where we are today. And Win Strategy 3.0 just started, and it has tremendous firepower behind it to continue to propel the company. So we're preparing for the future every day.

It would be the portfolio changes we've made, but there's also things organically, we're doing differently, the whole strategic positioning, which I'll try to give more color on that on IR Day, and how our divisions are taking a real step change in ownership of how they position themselves versus their competitors, the innovation changes we've made on PVI and new product blueprinting, Simple by Design, which is a growth propellant as well as a margin engine, international distribution growth, the digital leadership and the new incentive plan change, ACIP replacing RONA. All those things are going to help on the top line, but several of those help on the margin side as well. 
So as the portfolio becomes more innovative, and it has over the last number of years, those carry higher margins. Simple by Design, as some of you maybe heard me talk about, will be the single largest margin enhancement the company has ever done, and it's just starting. International distribution, as we move that mix, that's a margin enhancement. We found with digital leadership that we continue to get more efficient with the use of AI. 
And then probably last but not least, and the most important, the things we've done around engagement. If I had to pick one single thing that's propelled the company, it's been the engagement of our team members, the engagement scores, the ownership. And it's hard to put a number to that. But you know when you have people that think and act like an owner, that use Lean and Kaizen, which is part of their normal thinking, that spirit of continuous improvement is a big part of what's driven our success to date. You can plot our Kaizen activity and our engagement scores, and they're working hand in hand, their look on a parallel path driving success. 
So it's not one single thing, Joel. It's a number of things. And I guess that 1 slide that we showed you earlier showed the compounding effect of improvement year-over-year: the compounding on EPS, doubling at the compounding of margins. And that's going to keep going. We're not going to stop."

And our forecast for organic growth the first half for the industrial piece of the company was around 11%. So they all kind of coalescing around that 10% to 11% low teen type of level."

We turned in an outstanding quarter, and it's a great start to FY '22. My thanks to the global team for delivering such a record quarter against the backdrop of strong demand, inflation and supply chain disruptions. 
So a couple of highlights. Safety performance continued to improve, 17% reduction in recordable incidents on a rolling 12-month basis. Very strong growth, in particular organic growth is 16% year-over-year. It was an extensive list of records. We had 7 first quarter records: sales, total company operating margin, net income and EPS. And in each reporting segment, all 3 of them had all-time operating margin records. EBITDA margin, you can see the reported number was 22.1% adjusted or 210 basis points higher than the prior year. And then down at the bottom, last row, segment operating margin adjusted was 22.0%. Again, a 210 basis points improvement versus the prior year. Just a great quarter. Very proud of the team, and thank you for your hard work. 
Going to Slide 4, there's really 3 things that drive the company, living up our purpose and great generators and deployers of cash and being a top quartile performer. 
If you go to Slide 5, I wanted to spend a minute, if you remembered our purpose statement, enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. And we've been trying to show you examples of our purpose in action, how the company comes to life. And 1 of the secular trends that the pandemic is accelerating is digitalization. And in Investor Day, we're going to highlight more for you our content as you look at the whole digital supply chain. As an example, things like 5G infrastructure, electronics, manufacturing, clean rooms, data centers, electronic devices, shielding the thermal management that we do there and of course, transportation to get these products around the world. But the application that I wanted to cover today is semiconductors, given especially the importance of chip demand around the world. 
So if you go to Slide 6, there's going to be a significant amount of investment, as we all aware of, in the semi-semiconductor space, and that's going to drive for us double-digit growth over the next several years. Now we are -- we have strong expertise in semiconductor manufacturing. About 1/4 of our division ship them kind of content into the semiconductor space. So to orientate you on this slide, on the left-hand side are the applications that we go into and the right-hand side are our technology. So just a second on the applications. Those 6 bullets that you see there really are made up of a combination of what we would call fabs and tools. The fabs would be the infrastructure or the transportation part of the process and the tools and the various tools that are in the factory helping to make the semiconductors. 
On the left-hand side is the picture of a wafer. And on the center there, that is a picture of an etch tool, a 6-chamber etch tool. So on the right are our technologies that we bring to create think value for our customers. First segment is process control. So think of that as precise control of gases and liquids in the process. Fluid and gas handling provides a cooling system for the tools, petromechanicals helping with the wafer movement and then engineered materials is doing shielding and sealing. The shielding is helping to protect the wafer from electromagnetic static issues, which would destroy the chips. So we are essential to the digital supply chain in this supply chain and related technologies and markets around digital. If you combine that, it will be part of 4 major secular trends for the company, driving long-term growth. That would be aerospace, ESG, electrification and digitization. 
So if you go to Slide 7. Speaking of the breadth of technologies, these 8 motion control technologies, 2/3 as you heard me talk about in the past of our revenue come from customers who buy 4 more of these technologies. So again, it speaks to the interconnectedness of the technologies, the value proposition of the system and subsystem work that we do. 
But then coincidentally, 2/3 of our portfolio is also helping to enable our customers with our clean technology journey. And that 2/3 is going to continue to evolve to virtually 100% over time. I'll give you a classic example. The seal work that we do today, a combustion engine for transmissions or for piston seals eventually gets replaced for seals, promoters and batteries in electric vehicles. 
So the takeaway on the bottom here is really our brand promise, helping our customers increase their productivity and their profitability. And we do that really in 2 ways. It's that interconnected tissue, the value proposition that we offer. And we're going to be a big part of helping our customers on their sustainability journeys we help with our claim technologies. 
Going to the next slide, Slide 8, one of our favorite slides. It's going to -- you wanted to know whether Parker is really different or not, a picture's worth a thousand words. On the left-hand side is the EPS trend. We've updated that now for our current guidance for FY '22. And you can see that's virtually a 45-degree angle there, tremendous amount of year-over-year improvement, and 2.5x EPS growth from the $7 that we were doing in FY '16. 
Then on the right-hand side is EBITDA margin. Again, you can see an almost 45-degree angle to that trajectory. And while we don't guide on EBITDA margin, our performance in the actual quarter we just completed for EBITDA margin was 22.1%. So you can see that we'll continue to show the expansion we're doing on margins. So the question might be how, and how is really ahead of there, it's in our people, their engagement, the ownership that they're taking, the portfolio changes that we made and then the strategic changes, 1 strategy 2.0 and now most recently at 3.0. 
If you go to Slide 9, just a quick update on the Meggitt transaction. We had a very strongly favorable shareholder vote. We're working with the U.K. government on both economic and national security views, they're underway. The antitrust and FDA filings are proceeding as planned, and we still anticipate a Q3 calendar 2022 close. And this is what we described before is a really compelling combination. It's going to double the size of our aerospace business. And when you couple this with the other acquisitions we've done, CLARCOR, LORD, Exotic and now Meggitt, our portfolio is now much more long cycle, less cyclical and faster growing. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Todd for more details on the quarter."

I'll ask you to go to Slide 11. I know Tom mentioned a number of these numbers, so I'll try to move quick. The quarter was fantastic, right? 7 records. Sales are up almost 17% versus prior year. We finished at $3.8 billion in sales.",1851,"Okay. Thank you, Tom. I'll ask you to go to Slide 11. I know Tom mentioned a number of these numbers, so I'll try to move quick. The quarter was fantastic, right? 7 records. Sales are up almost 17% versus prior year. We finished at $3.8 billion in sales. Organic sales are roughly 16%. It's almost all of the total, and currency had a small favorable impact of less than 1%. 
The growth this quarter was really driven across the board, strong broad-based demand across all of our industrial businesses and really in the commercial aerospace market, so we were happy to see that. And as Tom mentioned, we continue to benefit from strong growth from those recent portfolio additions we did in CLARCOR and LORD and Exotic. 
Both segment operating margins and adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 210 basis points from prior year. We're really proud of that number. That adjusted segment operating margin came in at 22% and really just another strong quarter of margin performance. Really proud of our teams, not only responding to the increased demand, but also executing through a number of various well-documented supply chain challenges. And I want to give them credit, there was a great effort to maintain costs in the quarter, and you can see that in our results. Incrementals are 35% year-over-year, which is really impressive. But even more impressive considering last year, we had $125 million of discretionary savings really based on the actions we took during the pandemic. So if you account for that, the difference in incrementals would be 58%. So we're very proud of those results. 
If you look at net income, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, both of those numbers increased by 40% versus prior year. Adjusted net income is $557 million, that's a 14.8% return on sales. And adjusted EPS were $4.26, that's a $1.21 increase from prior year where we finished at $3.05. 
If you jump to Slide 12, this is really just that breakdown of the $1.21 increase in adjusted EPS. And really, the story here is just very strong, solid operating performance across every segment. Adjusted segment operating income increased by $184 million or almost 30% from prior year. That really is the first leg in this bridge that's $1.10 or 91% of the increase in earnings per share. All the other items netted to another $0.11 of favorable items and interest expense. Other expense and tax were all favorable and that helped us to offset just a slightly higher corporate G&A that was really based off of some of those temporary savings we took action with last year. 
If you go to Slide 13, just looking at the segment, really, the big way on this page is every segment generated record margins in the quarter. The other big thing I want to note is we were able -- we've always talked about trying to maintain our neutral price cost position. We were able to do that in the quarter across all the segments. 
And I already mentioned incrementals already, but I think it really highlights our efforts on covering inflation costs and really managing through the supply chain inefficiencies. So 35% is the MROS, but 58% if you exclude those discretionary savings. And demand continues to be very robust. Orders for the total company are up 26% from prior year. 
Just diving into the segments really quickly. Diversified Industrial North America, sales were $1.8 billion, that's up 17% from prior year. Adjusted operating margins did improve by 30 basis points from prior year and finished at 21.3%, really sound performance in that segment, considering it's pretty clear that the supply chain challenges are more difficult in the North American region. 
Order rates also very healthy at 32% positive, and it's really just continuing to show a strong rebound off of those prior year comps. If I look at our international businesses and Diversified Industrial International, great quarter here for that team. even higher organic growth, 21% organic growth. Their sales came in just under $1.4 billion, and adjusted operating margins, significant expansion, 360 basis points improvement from prior year, and they did reach 22.8%. Very proud of that team. 
Volume obviously was a big driver here. But also, we've talked about this before, our focus on international distribution that helped our mix. That continues to expand and really some disciplined price/cost management across that segment, very important drivers for the quarter. And order rates also very strong at 25% plus prior year. 
If we move to Aerospace Systems, fantastic quarter from that team, sales were almost $600 million. Organic sales did turn positive for the segment, 3.4%, but it did turn positive. And we were very pleased to see that commercial markets are trending up. And notably, commercial aftermarket came in very strong at 33% over prior year. So it's glad to see some rebound in those markets. 
Operating margin is a great story here, 400 basis points improvement. That segment came in at 22.1%. And I just want to note, it's really nice to see that level of performance. We are still well below pre-COVID volume level, so there is room to grow here as that volume returns. So we're looking forward to see that as well. And order rates tur positive, plus 16%, that is on a 12-month rolling basis. But if you remember last quarter, it was minus 7%, so we did see an inflection to positive orders in the Aerospace segment. And that's really just further proof of a slow but steady recovery in that segment. So really thanks to all of our global team very great execution and really just continuing to live up to our purpose and perform extremely well. 
If I ask you to go to Slide 14, this is just -- I'll touch on cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $424 million or 11.3% of sales. Free cash flow was $376 million or 10% of sales, and our conversion for the quarter was 83%. So I just want everyone to know, working capital management continues to be a very strong story here. We continue to tightly manage this. And really, we're just responding to the inflection in growth here. Increased level of demand, coupled with really our efforts to provide continuity of supply for our customers drove working capital be a use of cash in the quarter. 
It accounted to be a 3.6% use of cash in the quarter. And if you just look at that compared to prior year. Prior year, we were in the second quarter of a significant downturn. Today, we're in the second quarter of a significant upturn. Last year, working capital was 6.1% source of cash last year. 
But just importantly, I want to be clear on this, for the full year, we are forecasting mid-teens cash flow from operations and our free cash flow will be well over 100%. So you'll see that strong cash flow performance for us as we go throughout the year. 
On Slide 15, just really a quick update on capital deployment. I think everyone saw this, but last week, our Board approved a dividend payout of $1.03 per share. That is our 286th consecutive quarterly dividend. And that payout is in line with our now target of 30% to 35% of 5-year average net income. 
And on share repurchases, we did purchase $50 million in the quarter through our 10b5-1 program but we also deployed an additional $180 million to purchase shares on a discretionary basis. And essentially, what that does is that discretionary purchase makes up for the 3 quarters that we paused the 10b5-1 program, from FY '20 Q4 through FY '21 Q2. And our goal there is to eliminate dilution in FY '22. 
And then I just want to give a final update on the Meggitt financing. In the quarter, we did secure a $2 billion deferred draw term loan. That, together with a $215 million cash deposit into escrow positioned us to take down our initial bridge facility. So that was successful. 
And then I want to be clear here, in October, after the quarter end, we also deposited another $2.3 billion into escrow from a combination of proceeds from commercial paper issuance and also some cash on hand, and that really allowed us to further reduce that bridge to 3.2 billion pounds. Lastly, on Mega financing, we did complete a deal contingent forward hedge contract in the amount of $6.4 billion, and that really was just to lock in our pound to dollar rate as we continue to work through financing on the Meggitt acquisition. So great work by the team there. 
If I go to Slide 16, just looking at guidance, obviously, you saw we increased our guidance this morning. As usual, we're going to give this to you on an as reported and an adjusted basis. The sales range now for the year is approximately 6% to 9% or just under 8% at the midpoint. The breakdown of that is really all organic. It's 8.4% organic growth. We do expect currency to turn on us in Q3 through Q4, and that will create just a minimal drag, about 0.5 point to top line sales. And obviously, that's going to impact the International segment. 
There is no impact from acquisitions. We still do not expect Meggitt in our fiscal year. We're targeting Q3 of calendar year but we have no impact from Meggitt acquisition sales or segment operating income. 
And the split on sales is 48% first half, 52% second half. If you move down to segment operating margins, we did increase our adjusted segment operating margin forecast for the full year by 30 basis points from our prior guide, and that full year now gets us to 21.9% at the midpoint. There is a range of 20 basis points on either side of that. And segment operating margin is split 47% first half, 53% in the second half. 
No change to adjustments at a pretax level, so you see all those numbers, those are exactly the same that we guided last quarter. And in corporate G&A and other expense, we expect that to now be $513 million on an as-reported basis and $461 million on an adjusted basis. Really, the only difference there is some transaction-related costs with the Meggitt acquisition. 
And just a reminder, we will continue to adjust transactional-related expenses as they are incurred until we get through all of those transactions. No change to the tax rate. We expect that to be 23%. And our EPS guidance on an adjusted basis is now $17.30 at the midpoint. We did narrow the range a little bit, $0.35 on either side of that. And the first half, second half split is 46% first half, 52% -- or excuse me, 54%, second half. 
And then finally, I'll just say for Q2 we are expecting adjusted EPS to be $3.74 at the midpoint. So that's just a real brief summary of the quarter. 
With that, I will turn it back over to you, Tom."

Congrats on a very strong quarter. Tom, I guess where I was thinking we'd start, you highlighted big trends that benefit your business, right, aerospace, ESG, electrification, digitization, I guess the first one, aerospace is perhaps the clearest to observe. But I'm curious, the other 3, can you give us some context in terms of how Opus plays into your business? How is it driving incremental growth? And more importantly, are all these items driven by sort of new product introduction from Parker? Or is this sort of using the existing solutions that you have in new ways that are helping your customer achieve these goals?"

So what I would characterize these are secular trends that feel longer than a normal business cycle. ESG is going to take decades to unfold. Electrification really being kind of a subset of that and digitization continues to just transform how we interface with each other and how we interface with the supply chain. So these are things that I view as being bigger, longer than a typical business cycle. 
For us, it's going to be a combination of infrastructure. So the infrastructure that goes around the world to put these in place, things that are also onboard equipment. And both of these are bill of material-plus type of additions for us. And then also the fact that they should be faster growing environments as a result of. 
We are doing innovation in this space. But a lot of our portfolio today, which is what I mentioned on that 1 slide, 2/3 of it today is already clean technology related. Yes, we're adding some motors and motor controllers and software in addition to our current portfolio, but our current portfolio was already designed to be very energy source agnostic and be able to respond to these changing dynamics we'll try to give a little more context on this at the Investor Day, but we just started before the call to try to, in the last couple of days, quantify digital and the threat that it cuts through the company and it's surprisingly large, and we'll give you more context on that with some actual numbers when we get to Investor Day. But it has an opportunity you think of the company as being very diverse and probably no end markets outside of aerospace being bigger than 5% or 6%. Digital is a threat that custer so many. It's going to be probably second to aerospace, the biggest thread to cut through the company. 
And ESG is unfolding for the next 20, 30 years as the world tries to get to carbon neutrality. So that's what I like. You've got a prior environment, thinking on leasing my watch, 7 years, 2 industrial recessions and a pandemic, I think we're facing a much more constructive environment going forward."

And to help people, it's easier to look at it from a dollar value basis. The dollar value was fairly consistent with what we saw in the prior quarters. So we had nice consistency. The numbers in the 26% improvement went down from [indiscernible] bit '50s, it's because the prior periods was improving. But we saw all regions strong internationally, all 3 of the international regions were pretty much the same. 
We reported international 25, but all 3 reasons underneath there were pretty much plus and minus 25%, give or take some change. On the margin side, I would say there was nothing in particular that is different other than what we've been doing all along, which was Win Strategy 2.0 and 3.0 and a rapid resizing of the company post pandemic and then being very careful as we moved into a higher demand of feathering cost in a very judicious type of fashion, in a much more lean and natural fashion we've had ever before because our cost structure is so much better. I do think international has less supply chain disruptions in North America for sure. And you see that reflected in MROS."

And those will be the 2 fronts that it touches, obviously. 
With our customers, I would say the supply chain has been much more acute and a bigger of an issue versus our own supply chain. What we've seen with orders from customers is a much more longer period duration, staggered release dates, trying to make sure they have a spot in line, so to speak. 
We've had pushouts on delivery acceptance. So you may have a date as to and due to other challenges they have as far as supply chain with other suppliers, they may not necessarily want that delivery, which we fully understand. They don't want to sit on all these inventory. 
So there's been temporary idling of plants and this isn't really tied to the OEs, but you've got the rolling energy shutdown that we've had and been experiencing in China, which will continue, I think, pretty much all the way to the Olympics. We've done pretty well through all that. If I had to use round numbers, it's probably a $50 million to $75 million impact as far as the OE customers fueling supply chain things that tethered to us. 
I think overall demand with them continues to be strong. It's more just sliding to the right and then trying to manage a more complex supply chain. Their inventory, they've always been just in time and they're being very careful to not accept other inventory that they don't need that they can't put together with holes that they might have in their bill of material."

Lord has proven to be more resilient and faster growing than legacy Parker and that's what we had hoped for.

It's accretive on margins, accretive on cash flow and is exposed to more longer cycle businesses. An Exotic has performed remarkably well. Remember, when we bought Exotic, nobody would have anticipated some set of Max being grounded for as long as it was. And even with that, strength of their portfolio and that team, we put a mid-20s EBITDA. So it's a little light on the top line, mainly because of 2 things, the max grounding, the pandemic but its margins have held up very consistent with what we had approved for the port.

Our second half in the prior guidance, 4.5% and the new guidance, 6%. But we left Q2 basically is the same. And that's really based on what we saw. In Q1 and in particular, in October around just supply chain challenges, more around what I was talking about with Jeff, around our customer demand and kind of the uncertainties are difficulty in predicting delivery dates and time on this on that. 
You also have -- if you just look at the raw dollars, the dollars flow very much proportionally from Q1 to Q2. So normally, we would have less workdays, which is what we have in North America, typically, if you look at over the last 20 years. Our Q2 is typically 4% lighter in Q1. International is typically 1% lighter. We lowered North America hair more. It's not minus 5% from a dollar standpoint versus Q1, mainly because of that extra 100 bps of some supply chain uncertainties. And part of what we're looking at is those temporary idling that customers have been doing. And in particular, we haven't had any customers announcing yet. You've got the holidays. And if you -- it would be very easy for them just to extend a day or a half day of those type of things. And so we're just trying to be pragmatic as to what Q2 would look like given natural progression from Q1 to Q2, putting on a little bit of supply chains. And so I think the difference would be in the top line because the rentals for Q2. If you look at it on apples-to-apples, again, taking out the discretionary basis that we had in prior it's another upper 50s, just like Q1. So if you look at the operational excellence, upper 50s incrementals is pretty hard to beat. And so really, the only difference you could have is top line assumptions that give you the context of how we with our Q2."

Our strategy always has been to build and source local, which has been incredibly helpful. And I think the other thing that's kind of benefited us through these disruptions. We worked hard on dual-sourcing strategy where appropriate, which has given us some flexibility. And one of the things that kind of weaved itself into this are simple by design efforts in some key areas where it's been easier for us to do material substitutions than we've done in the past. So all that together is really -- I'm not saying we're immune, but has made us to be able to work though these supply chain disruptions. 
I would say the market share that we picked up is very sticky. One, you're talking about a lot of engineered products. So I mean, when people take the effort to engineer the product in, it's not something that you quickly change. And two, the reality is if we're taking on new business, we're looking for commitments on both -- from both of us to be committed to the volume going forward.

This is clearly more over multi-quarters. And actually, it's good. It's customers trying to plan for longer, trying to make sure they get their ticket in line in a way that helps us from a planning standpoint.

So Todd mentioned that commercial MRO up 33% for the quarter. And order entry on 312 was over 70%. So you're starting to see that replenishment of commercial aftermarket, which is of the 4 elements, the highest margin that we would have. And then within that kind of favorable mix within that favorable mix, the spare to repair mix was favorable. 
So at the beginning, which is typical when customers are trying to maintain assets and minimize cost, they'll do more repair work. And then once that's kind of exhausted didn't had to put back in spares. So we've seen an uptick in spare activity. And then the Aerospace team has done a great job. But if you go back to the beginning of pandemic, we moved very aggressively at the beginning to resize the business for the long cycle. And what's really remarkable here is we're going to put these margins we're putting up to guide at 20.9% will be higher than our previous all-time high pre-COVID. 
And so this business is not even at 80% volume of COVID and is putting up margins that are higher than the best we've ever done pre-COVID. It's just a job.

So they're pretty much running hand about. And so that -- when I think about the longer-term opportunities for us on growth here, you've got the pent-up demand and kind of the reflex of it the bottom. But there'll be an inventory replenishment back to normal levels for distribution, which will be -- will help us. And if you go out longer than that, you've got CapEx reinvestment, 2 things, they are under investment. And I think this whole localization has a giant burner underneath it now because of this lack of product availability is going to drive customers and suppliers to add capacity and to create dual capacity, which is infrastructure opportunities for us, ESG and then just capital deployment.

We tried to factor in an element of uncertainties with supply chain because we were experiencing them already when we did the August guide. 
I think we weathered the supply chain issues better than we anticipated, allow us to generate higher organic growth. And then the operating margins are, I think, indicative of really multiple years of effort. It's a combination of Win 2.0, Win 3.0, the capital deployment buying, buying companies that are accretive on margins and cash and growth. So it's not an overnight sensation. It's really -- you go to that 1 slide that shows the EBITDA trend. It's been building on and the pace of that improvement on top of some very quick cost actions that we did in the pandemic. And thankfully, not a lot of those costs have come back, we've been able to run the business differently in a more digital fashion, which has clearly helped us on some of those variable costs.

I would argue, everything we do support sustainability, even if you take, say, engine on mobile filtration that we'd be doing for heavy-duty trucks is helping that fuel run more efficiently and better emissions. So even today, we just try to be very conservative in that number, recognizing that, that was still a fossil fuel-related technology. But it's going to morph into a 100% of the portfolio because everything -- if you take construction equipment or forestry equipment as it moves to more electric, all you're really doing is changing the power source, going from say precipitating diesel engine to hydrogen engine or fuel cell or a battery or some combination thereof. And all of our technologies are still needed to facilitate the work functions and the Propel functions. And if anything, like I had mentioned before, our build material gets bigger because it was much more heat and you've got a management of all of our Engineered Materials Technologies, we do have, I think, a bigger bill of material that we'll have with our Motion Technologies, we add more motor content and more software, et cetera.

We turned in an outstanding quarter, and it's a great start to FY '22. My thanks to the global team for delivering such a record quarter against the backdrop of strong demand, inflation and supply chain disruptions.
So a couple of highlights. Safety performance continued to improve, 17% reduction in recordable incidents on a rolling 12-month basis. Very strong growth, in particular organic growth is 16% year-over-year. It was an extensive list of records. We had 7 first quarter records: sales, total company operating margin, net income and EPS. And in each reporting segment, all 3 of them had all-time operating margin records.
EBITDA margin, you can see the reported number was 22.1% adjusted or 210 basis points higher than the prior year. And then down at the bottom, last row, segment operating margin adjusted was 22.0%. Again, a 210 basis points improvement versus the prior year. Just a great quarter. Very proud of the team, and thank you for your hard work.
Going to Slide 4, there's really 3 things that drive the company, living up our purpose and great generators and deployers of cash and being a top quartile performer. If you go to Slide 5, I want to just spend a minute, if you remembered our purpose statement, enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow. And we've been trying to show you examples of our purpose in action, helping the company come to life. And 1 of the secular trends that the pandemic is accelerating is digitization.
And in Investor Day, we're going to highlight more for you our content as you look at the whole digital supply chain. As an example, things like 5G infrastructure, electronics, manufacturing, clean rooms, data centers, electronic devices, shielding the thermal management that we do there and of course, transportation to get these products around the world. But the application that I wanted to cover today is semiconductors, given especially the importance of chip demand around the world.
So if you go to Slide 6, there's going to be a significant amount of investment, as we all are aware of, in the semi-semiconductor space, and that's going to drive for us double-digit growth over the next several years. Now we are -- we have strong expertise in semiconductor manufacturing. About 1/4 of our division ship them kind of content into the semiconductor space.
So to orientate you on this slide, on the left-hand side are the applications that we go into and the right-hand side are our technology. So just a second on the applications. Those 6 bullets that you see there really are made up of a combination of what we would call fabs and tools. The fabs would be the infrastructure or the transportation part of the process and the tools and the various tools that are in the factory helping to make the semiconductors.
On the left-hand side is the picture of a wafer. And on the center there, that is a picture of an etch tool, a 6-chamber etch tool. So on the right are our technologies that we bring to create and bring value for our customers. First segment is process control. So think of that as precise control of gases and liquids in the process. Fluid and gas handling provides a cooling system for the tools, petromechanicals helping with the wafer movement and then engineered materials is doing shielding and sealing.
The shielding is helping to protect the wafer from electromagnetic static issues, which would destroy the chips. So we are essential to the digital supply chain in this supply chain and related technologies and markets around digital. If you combine that, it will be part of 4 major secular trends for the company, driving long-term growth. That would be aerospace, ESG, electrification and digitization.
So if you go to Slide 7. Speaking of the breadth of technologies, these 8 motion control technologies, 2/3 as you heard me talk about in the past of our revenue come from customers who buy 4 more of these technologies. So again, it speaks to the interconnectedness of the technologies, the value proposition of the system and subsystem work that we do. 
But then coincidentally, 2/3 of our portfolio is also helping to enable our customers with our clean technology journey. And that 2/3 is going to continue to evolve to virtually 100% over time. I'll give you a classic example. The seal work that we do today on a combustion engine for transmissions or for piston seals, eventually gets replaced for seals, promoters and batteries in electric vehicles.
So the takeaway on the bottom here is really our brand promise, helping our customers increase their productivity and their profitability. And we do that really in 2 ways. It's that interconnected tissue, the value proposition that we offer. And we're going to be a big part of helping our customers on their sustainability journeys we help with our claim technologies.
Going to the next slide, Slide 8, one of our favorite slides. It's going to -- you wanted to know whether Parker is really different or not, a picture's worth a thousand words. On the left-hand side is the EPS trend. We've updated that now for our current guidance for FY '22. And you can see that's virtually a 45-degree angle there, tremendous amount of year-over-year improvement, and 2.5x EPS growth from the $7 that we were doing in FY '16.
Then on the right-hand side is EBITDA margin. Again, you can see an almost 45-degree angle to that trajectory. And while we don't guide on EBITDA margin, our performance in the actual quarter we just completed for EBITDA margin was 22.1%. So you can see that we'll continue to show the expansion we're doing on margins.
So the question might be how, and how is really in the header there, it's in our people, their engagement, the ownership that they're taking, the portfolio changes that we made and then the strategic changes, Win Strategy 2.0 and now most recently at 3.0.
If you go to Slide 9, just a quick update on the Meggitt transaction. We had a very strongly favorable shareholder vote. We're working with the U.K. government on both economic and national security views, they're underway. The antitrust and FDA filings are proceeding as planned, and we still anticipate a Q3 calendar 2022 close.
And this is what we described before is a really compelling combination. It's going to double the size of our aerospace business. And when you couple this with the other acquisitions we've done, CLARCOR, LORD, Exotic and now Meggitt, our portfolio is now much more long cycle, less cyclical and faster growing.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Todd for more details on the quarter."

I'll ask you to go to Slide 11. I know Tom mentioned a number of these numbers, so I'll try to move quick. The quarter was fantastic, right? 7 records. Sales are up almost 17% versus prior year. We finished at $3.8 billion in sales.",1854,"Okay. Thank you, Tom. I'll ask you to go to Slide 11. I know Tom mentioned a number of these numbers, so I'll try to move quick. The quarter was fantastic, right? 7 records. Sales are up almost 17% versus prior year. We finished at $3.8 billion in sales. Organic sales are roughly 16%. It's almost all of the total, and currency had a small favorable impact of less than 1%.
The growth this quarter was really driven across the board, strong broad-based demand across all of our industrial businesses and really a rebound in the commercial aerospace market, so we were happy to see that. And as Tom mentioned, we continue to benefit from strong growth from those recent portfolio additions we did in CLARCOR and LORD and Exotic.
Both segment operating margins and adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 210 basis points from prior year. We're really proud of that number. That adjusted segment operating margin came in at 22% and really just another strong quarter of margin performance.
Really proud of our teams, not only responding to the increased demand, but also executing through a number of various well-documented supply chain challenges. And I want to give them credit, there was a great effort to maintain costs in the quarter, and you can see that in our results.
Incrementals are 35% year-over-year, which is really impressive. But even more impressive considering last year we had $125 million of discretionary savings really based on the actions we took during the pandemic. So if you account for that, the difference in incrementals would be 58%. So we're very proud of those results.
If you look at net income, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, both of those numbers increased by 40% versus prior year. Adjusted net income is $557 million, that's a 14.8% return on sales. And adjusted EPS were $4.26, that's a $1.21 increase from prior year where we finished at $3.05.
If you jump to Slide 12, this is really just that breakdown of the $1.21 increase in adjusted EPS. And really, the story here is just very strong, solid operating performance across every segment. Adjusted segment operating income increased by $184 million or almost 30% from prior year. That really is the first leg in this bridge that's $1.10 or 91% of the increase in earnings per share.
All the other items netted to another $0.11 of favorable items and interest expense. Other expense and tax were all favorable and that helped us to offset just a slightly higher corporate G&A that was really based off of some of those temporary savings we took action with last year.
If you go to Slide 13, just looking at the segment, really, the takeaway on this page is every segment generated record margins in the quarter. The other big thing I want to note is we were able -- we've always talked about trying to maintain our neutral price cost position. We were able to do that in the quarter across all the segments.
And I already mentioned incrementals already, but I think it really highlights our efforts on covering inflation costs and really managing through the supply chain inefficiencies. So 35% is the MROS, but 58% if you exclude those discretionary savings. And demand continues to be very robust. Orders for the total company are up 26% from prior year.
Just diving into the segments really quickly. Diversified Industrial North America, sales were $1.8 billion, that's up 17% from prior year. Adjusted operating margins did improve by 30 basis points from prior year and finished at 21.3%, really sound performance in that segment, considering it's pretty clear that the supply chain challenges are more difficult in the North American region.
Order rates also very healthy at 32% positive, and it's really just continuing to show a strong rebound off of those prior year comps. If I look at our international businesses and Diversified Industrial International, great quarter here for that team. even higher organic growth, 21% organic growth. Their sales came in just under $1.4 billion, and adjusted operating margins, significant expansion, 360 basis points improvement from prior year, and they did reach 22.8%. Very proud of that team.
Volume obviously was a big driver here. But also, we've talked about this before, our focus on international distribution that helped our mix. That continues to expand and really some disciplined price/cost management across that segment, very important drivers for the quarter. And order rates also very strong at 25% plus prior year.
If we move to Aerospace Systems, fantastic quarter from that team, sales were almost $600 million. Organic sales did turn positive for the segment, 3.4%, but it did turn positive. And we were very pleased to see that commercial markets are trending up. And notably, commercial aftermarket came in very strong at 33% over prior year. So it's glad to see some rebound in those markets.
Operating margin is a great story here, 400 basis points improvement. That segment came in at 22.1%. And I just want to note, it's really nice to see that level of performance. We are still well below pre-COVID volume level, so there is room to grow here as that volume returns. So we're looking forward to see that as well.
And order rates turned positive, plus 16%, that is on a 12-month rolling basis. But if you remember last quarter, it was minus 7%, so we did see an inflection to positive orders in the Aerospace segment. And that's really just further proof of a slow but steady recovery in that segment. So really thanks to all of our global team, very great execution and really just continuing to live up to our purpose and perform extremely well.
If I ask you to go to Slide 14, this is just -- I'll touch on cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $424 million or 11.3% of sales. Free cash flow was $376 million or 10% of sales, and our conversion for the quarter was 83%. So I just want everyone to know, working capital management continues to be a very strong story here.
We continue to tightly manage this. And really, we're just responding to the inflection in growth here. That increased level of demand, coupled with really our efforts to provide continuity of supply for our customers drove working capital to be a use of cash in the quarter.
It accounted to be a 3.6% use of cash in the quarter. And if you just look at that compared to prior year. Prior year, we were in the second quarter of a significant downturn. Today, we're in the second quarter of a significant upturn. Last year, working capital was 6.1% source of cash last year.
But just importantly, I want to be clear on this, for the full year, we are forecasting mid-teens cash flow from operations and our free cash flow will be well over 100%. So you'll see that strong cash flow performance for us as we go throughout the year.
On Slide 15, just really a quick update on capital deployment. I think everyone saw this, but last week, our Board approved a dividend payout of $1.03 per share. That is our 286th consecutive quarterly dividend. And that payout is in line with our announced target of 30% to 35% of 5-year average net income.
And on share repurchases, we did purchase $50 million in the quarter through our 10b5-1 program but we also deployed an additional $180 million to purchase shares on a discretionary basis. And essentially, what that does is that discretionary purchase makes up for the 3 quarters that we paused the 10b5-1 program, from FY '20 Q4 through FY '21 Q2. And our goal there is to eliminate dilution in FY '22.
And then I just want to give a final update on the Meggitt financing. In the quarter, we did secure a $2 billion deferred draw term loan. That, together with a $215 million cash deposit into escrow positioned us to take down our initial bridge facility. So that was successful.
And then I want to be clear here, in October, after the quarter end, we also deposited another $2.3 billion into escrow from a combination of proceeds from commercial paper issuance and also some cash on hand, and that really allowed us to further reduce that bridge to GBP 3.2 billion.
Lastly, on Meggitt financing, we did complete a deal contingent forward hedge contract in the amount of $6.4 billion, and that really was just to lock in our pound to dollar rate as we continue to work through financing on the Meggitt acquisition. So great work by the team there.
If I go to Slide 16, just looking at guidance, obviously, you saw we increased our guidance this morning. As usual, we're going to give this to you on an as-reported and an adjusted basis. The sales range now for the year is approximately 6% to 9% or just under 8% at the midpoint.
The breakdown of that is really all organic. It's 8.4% organic growth. We do expect currency to turn on us in Q3 through Q4, and that will create just a minimal drag, about 0.5 point to top line sales. And obviously, that's going to impact the international segment.
There is no impact from acquisitions. We still do not expect Meggitt in our fiscal year. We're targeting Q3 of calendar year 2022, but we have no impact from Meggitt acquisition sales or segment operating income.
And the split on sales is 48% first half, 52% second half. If you move down to segment operating margins, we did increase our adjusted segment operating margin forecast for the full year by 30 basis points from our prior guide, and that full year now gets us to 21.9% at the midpoint. There is a range of 20 basis points on either side of that. And segment operating margin is split 47% first half, 53% in the second half.
No change to adjustments at a pretax level, so you see all those numbers, those are exactly the same that we guided last quarter. And in corporate G&A and other expense, we expect that to now be $513 million on an as-reported basis and $461 million on an adjusted basis. Really, the only difference there is some transaction-related costs with the Meggitt acquisition.
And just a reminder, we will continue to adjust transactional-related expenses as they are incurred until we get through all of those transactions. No change to the tax rate. We expect that to be 23%. And our EPS guidance on an adjusted basis is now $17.30 at the midpoint.
We did narrow the range a little bit, $0.35 on either side of that. And the first half, second half split is 46% first half, 52% -- or excuse me, 54%, second half. And then finally, I'll just say for Q2 we are expecting adjusted EPS to be $3.74 at the midpoint. So that's just a real brief summary of the quarter.
With that, I will turn it back over to you, Tom."

But I'm curious, the other 3, can you give us some context in terms of how all this plays into your business? How is it driving incremental growth? And more importantly, are all these items driven by sort of new product introduction from Parker? Or is this sort of using the existing solutions that you have in new ways that are helping your customer achieve these goals?"

But, yes, so what I would characterize these are secular trends that feel longer than a normal business cycle. ESG is going to take decades to unfold. Electrification really being kind of a subset of that and digitization continues to just transform how we interface with each other and how we interface with the supply chain.
So these are things that I view as being bigger, longer than a typical business cycle. For us, it's going to be a combination of infrastructure. So the infrastructure that goes around the world to put these in place, things that are also onboard equipment. And both of these are bill of material-plus type of additions for us. And then also the fact that they should be faster growing environments as a result of.
We are doing innovation in this space. But a lot of our portfolio today, which is what I mentioned on that 1 slide, 2/3 of it today is already clean technology related. Yes, we're adding some motors and motor controllers and software in addition to our current portfolio, but our current portfolio was already designed to be very energy-source agnostic and be able to respond to these changing dynamics.
We'll try to give a little more context on this at the Investor Day. We just started before the call to try to, in the last couple of days, quantify digital and the threat that it cuts through the company and it's surprisingly large, and we'll give you more context on that with some actual numbers when we get to Investor Day.
But it has an opportunity, you think of the company as being very diverse and probably no end markets outside of aerospace being bigger than 5% or 6%. Digital is a threat that cuts through so many. It's going to be probably second to aerospace, the biggest threat that cuts through the company.
And ESG is unfolding for the next 20, 30 years, as the world tries to get to carbon neutrality. So that's what I like. You've got a prior environment, thinking on lease in my watch, 7 years, 2 industrial recessions and a pandemic, I think we're facing a much more constructive environment going forward."

And on the order front, I'm curious as to how you're seeing the various regions develop, China, in particular. I know that geography punch is maybe above its weight from a profitability and margin standpoint, so what are you seeing there? And what's the impact on a go-forward basis in terms of mix?"

And to help people, it's easier to look at it from a dollar value basis. The dollar value was fairly consistent with what we saw in the prior quarters.
So we had nice consistency. The numbers in the 26% improvement went down from all the way from mid-50s just because the prior periods was improving. But we saw all regions strong. Internationally, all 3 of the international regions were pretty much the same. We reported international 25, but all 3 reasons underneath there were pretty much plus and minus 25%, give or take some change.
On the margin side, I would say there was nothing in particular that is different other than what we've been doing all along, which was Win Strategy 2.0 and 3.0 and a rapid resizing of the company post pandemic and then being very careful as we moved into a higher demand of feathering cost in a very judicious type of fashion, and a much more lean and natural fashion we've had ever before because our cost structure is so much better. 
I do think international has less supply chain disruptions in North America for sure. And you see that reflected in MROS."

So I want to touch on customers and then a little bit about us because what you're referring to is really supply chain issues. And those will be the 2 fronts that it touches, obviously. With our customers, I would say the supply chain has been much more acute and a bigger of an issue versus our own supply chain.
What we've seen with orders from customers is a much more longer period duration, staggered release dates, trying to make sure they have a spot in line, so to speak. We've had pushouts on delivery acceptance. So you may have a date as due and due to other challenges they have as far as supply chain with other suppliers, they may not necessarily want that delivery, which we fully understand. They don't want to sit on all this inventory.
So there's been temporary idling of plants and this isn't really tied to the OEs, but you've got the rolling energy shutdowns that we've had and been experiencing in China, which will continue, I think, pretty much all the way to the Olympics. We've done pretty well through all that. If I had to use round numbers, it's probably a $50 million to $75 million impact as far as the OE customers fueling supply chain things that tethered it to us.
I think overall demand with them continues to be strong. It's more just sliding to the right and then trying to manage a more complex supply chain. Their inventory, they've always been just in time and they're being very careful to not accept other inventory that they don't need that they can't put together with holes that they might have in their bill of material."

Lord has proven to be more resilient and faster growing than legacy Parker and that's what we had hoped for.

It's accretive on margins, it's accretive on cash flow and is exposed to more longer cycle businesses.
Exotic has performed remarkably well. Remember, when we bought Exotic, nobody would have anticipated 737 MAX being grounded for as long as it was. And even with that, strength of their portfolio and that team, we put a mid-20s EBITDA. So it's a little light on the top line, mainly because of 2 things, the MAX grounding and the pandemic, but its margins have held up very consistent with what we had approved for the port.
And we know we're at the beginning of a long cycle improvement there with Exotic. The aerospace traffic is going to come back. and the MAX ramp-up is coming back. So we've gotten through the worst of it, and it's going to be quite an exciting transaction for us."

So what we tried to do with Q2, you saw that we raised the organic guide for the full year from 7% to 8.5%, and that was primarily by raising the second half. Our second half in the prior guide was 4.5% and the new guide is 6%.
But we left Q2 basically as the same. And that's really based on what we saw. In Q1 and in particular, in October around just supply chain challenges, more around what I was talking about with Jeff, around our customer demand and kind of the uncertainties or difficulty in predicting delivery dates and time on this on that.
You also have -- if you just look at the raw dollars, the dollars flow very much proportionally from Q1 to Q2. So normally, we would have less workdays, which is what we have in North America, typically, if you look at over the last 20 years. Our Q2 is typically 4% lighter in Q1. International is typically 1% lighter. We lowered North America here more. It's not minus 5% from a dollar standpoint versus Q1, mainly because of that extra 100 bps of supply chain uncertainties.
And part of what we're looking at is those temporary idling that customers have been doing. And in particular, while we haven't had any customers announcing yet, you've got the holidays, and if you -- it would be very easy for them just to extend a day or a half day of those type of things.
And so we're just trying to be pragmatic as to what Q2 would look like given natural progression from Q1 to Q2, putting on a little bit of supply chain. And so I think the difference would be in the top line because the incrementals for Q2. If you look at it on apples-to-apples, again, taking out the discretionary basis that we had in prior Q2, it's another upper 50s, just like Q1.
So if you look at the operational excellence, upper 50s incrementals is pretty hard to beat. And so really, the only difference you could have is top line assumptions that give you the context of how we came up with our Q2."

We could not be happier obviously, because this has been something the company has been working on for a long time, long time on international margins. So I would say it started a while even before the changes to the Win Strategy, at least on my watch. It started with our team working very hard to change the cost structure in all international, in particular in EMEA.
And just recognizing that all those different countries and different infrastructures, there was an opportunity to try to simplify that. So that's been going on for multiple years, having a more agile, lower cost structure, than a concerted effort to grow international distribution from where we started at 35%, a 35-65 split now up to 40, and we'll give you the latest when we get to Investor Day, but it's north of 40 now, so you're getting some mix out there.
We've had -- Asia has always historically been a very strong performer. We really kind of set that region up if we think -- if you think about over the last 30 years, we set that region up the latest. And so we took all the best practices we had from everywhere around the world, when we set that region up from a cost structure standpoint.
But what's helped us a lot in the last couple of years is, is the Europe team and Latin America, Latin America being small for us, but both of those teams have made a marked improvement. And when we think going forward to your other part of your question, David, we see no reason why they can't continue, we'll give you new targets when we get to March.
But you see right now our full year guide, basically North America, international margins converging. We had always hoped that they're basically the same. And so going forward, we don't see any reason why they can't be. And they both have equal opportunity to grow to higher levels, and we'll give you that vision in March."

So you're starting to see that replenishment of commercial aftermarket, which is of the 4 elements, the highest margin that we would have. And then within that kind of favorable mix -- within that favorable mix, the spare to repair mix was favorable.
So at the beginning, which is typical when customers are trying to maintain assets and minimize cost, they'll do more repair work. And then once that's kind of exhausted and they had to put back in spares. We've seen an uptick in spare activity.
And then the aerospace team has done a great job. If you go back to the beginning of pandemic, we moved very aggressively at the beginning to resize the business for the long cycle. And what's really remarkable here is we're going to put these margins we're putting up to guide at 20.9% will be higher than our previous all-time high pre-COVID.

That's how we came up with it. 2/3 our revenue today would be supporting intent. I would argue, everything we do support sustainability, even if you take, say, engine on mobile filtration that we'd be doing for heavy-duty trucks is helping that fuel run more efficiently and better emissions.
So even today, we just try to be very conservative in that number, recognizing that, that was still a fossil fuel-related technology.
