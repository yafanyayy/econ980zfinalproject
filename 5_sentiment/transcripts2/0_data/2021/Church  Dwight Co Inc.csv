261105,709188736,2262629,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q1 results, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions. Before we begin, I'd like t",1194,"Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q1 results, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions. 
Before we begin, I'd like to recognize all Church & Dwight employees around the world for their continued dedication to keeping our company going during the pandemic, especially our supply chain and R&D teams as we overcame raw material shortages in Q1 as a result of the Texas freeze. 
Now let's talk about the results. Q1 was another exceptional quarter. Reported sales growth was 6.3%, and adjusted EPS was $0.83, and that's $0.03 better than our outlook. Organic sales grew 4.9%, driven by higher consumption. 
The e-commerce shows no signs of slowing. In Q1, our online sales increased by 54% year-over-year and as a percentage of total sales were 14.8% in Q1 compared to 10.2% in Q1 of 2020. We continue to expect online sales for the full year to be 15% as a percentage of total sales. 
Vaccinations will significantly influence consumer behavior. The U.S. is slowly opening up, which means consumers are more mobile. 60% of vaccinated consumers are optimistic that they will return to a normal or new normal as we are seeing the first signs that consumers are willing to spend more time in stores based on a study by IRI. In contrast, many countries outside the U.S. continue to experience lockdowns. 
As described in the release, we have been facing shortages of raw materials due to the Texas freeze. Raw material and transportation costs spiked higher in February and were exacerbated by the Texas freeze. We expect the tight supply and higher input cost to continue for the balance of the year. 
To mitigate the cost increases, we have announced price increases in laundry and across our international portfolio and we have reduced couponing and promotional spending. Rick will discuss this further in a couple of minutes. 
At our Analyst Day in January, we outlined which categories and brands we expected to stay elevated throughout 2021, recover from COVID lows, decline from COVID highs and which ones would remain steady. Overall, our full year thinking has not changed. To name a few categories, demand for vitamins, laundry additives and cat litter are expected to remain elevated in 2021. Condoms, dry shampoo, power flossers and women's grooming are expected to deliver year-over-year growth as society opens up and consumers have greater mobility. Baking soda, pregnancy test kits and oral analgesics are expected to decline from COVID highs. 
Of the 16 categories in which we compete, 8 grew consumption in Q1, in some cases, on top of big consumption gains in Q1 of 2020. Of those 8 categories, 5 saw a double-digit growth, gummy vitamins, toothache, battery-powered toothbrush, pregnancy test kits and women's electric grooming. Household categories, such as laundry detergent and baking soda, were down in the quarter and unable to comp the huge COVID-19 sales spikes seen in Q1 2020. 
Looking at market shares in Q1, 8 out of our 13 power brands met or gained share within our U.S. Consumer Domestic business, which grew organic sales 5.1%. I'll comment on a few of the brands right now. 
Consumers have made health and wellness a priority. VITAFUSION and L’IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins saw great consumption growth in Q1, up 24% with the help of the new launches described in the release. It appears that new consumers are coming into the category and they're staying. One survey showed that consumers who are new to the category had a 90% repeat rate. 
WATERPIK grew consumption 15% in Q1 as it continues to recover from COVID lows and benefit from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness. WATERPIK is also benefiting from dental offices returning to pre-COVID patient levels. We expect the frequency of our Lunch & Learn program to return to normal levels in the second half of this year. 
Now BATISTE. While BATISTE remains impacted by social distancing, consumption was up 6% and we achieved a record high quarterly balance share of 39% behind our International Women's Day campaign. 
Now I want to talk about the International division. Despite European lockdowns, our International business came through with 3.2% organic growth in the quarter, primarily driven by strong growth in our Global Markets group. Asia continues to be a strong growth engine for us. WATERPIK, FEMFRESH and ARM & HAMMER led the growth for the International division in the quarter. 
Our Specialty Products business delivered a positive quarter with 6% growth, primarily due to higher pricing. [ Milk ] prices were stable in Q1 and are projected to increase later in the year due to higher demand. 
Now turning to new products. Innovative new products will continue to attract consumers. In 2021, we have launched many new products, which are described in our press release. 
In the Household products portfolio, we are introducing OXICLEAN Laundry and Home Sanitizer. It is the first and only sanitizing laundry additives that boost stain fighting and eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and viruses. The product is also designed for cleaning throughout the house and on a variety of services. 
In the personal care portfolio, VITAFUSION launched Elderberry gummies, triple immune comes and POWER ZINC gummies to capitalize on increased consumer interest in immunity. 
WATERPIK launched WATERPIK ION, a water flosser which is 30% smaller and contains a long-lasting lithium-ion battery and is specifically designed for smaller bathroom spaces. To capitalize on its earlier success, WATERPIK SONIC-FUSION, the world's first flossing toothbrush, was upgraded to SONIC-FUSION 2.0 with 2 brush head sizes and 2 brush speeds. 
And finally, FLAWLESS is taking advantage of the at-home beauty and self-care trends with a facial cleanser system, a shower wand for a full-body spa like experience and at-home manicure and pedicure solutions. 
Now let's turn to the outlook. We're off to a good start in Q1. We continue to expect full year adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8%, which is in line with our Evergreen target despite the heightened input cost. 
Given our expectations, for consumer consumption, we have raised our full year outlook for reported sales growth from 4.5% to now 5% to 6%. 
Organic sales growth expectations were raised from 3% to 4% to 5%. 
And if you look at consumption trends through the middle of April, 14 of our 16 categories were up in consumption year-over-year. 
Now in conclusion, I'd like to remind everyone of the many reasons to have confidence in Church & Dwight. Our track record shows that we are positioned to do well in both good and bad times and in uncertain economic times such as now. Categories in which we play are essential to consumers. We have a balance sheet of value and -- pardon me, we have a balance of value and premium products. Our power brands are #1 or #2 in their categories. And we have low exposure to private label. And with a strong balance sheet, we continue to be open to acquiring TSR-accretive businesses. 
Next up is Rick to give us details on Q1."
261105,709188736,2262629,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes the positive earnout adjustment, was $0.83, flat to prior year.

First quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes the positive earnout adjustment, was $0.83, flat to prior year. And as we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earnout adjustment will continue until Q4, which is the conclusion of the earnout period. $0.83 was better than our $0.80 outlook, primarily due to continued increase in consumer demand for many of our products. 
Reported revenue was up 6.3%. Organic sales were up 4.9%, driven by a volume increase of 3.1% and a positive price/mix of 1.8%. 
Now let's review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic. Organic sales increased by 5.1% due to the higher volume and positive price mix. Overall, growth was led VITAFUSION, L’IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, WATERPIK oral care products, FLAWLESS beauty products, ARM & HAMMER clumping cat litter and KABOOM bathroom cleaners as well as VITAFUSION hair thinning products. 
Consumer International delivered 3.2% organic growth due to higher volume, partially offset by lower price and product mix. This was a great result despite European write-downs. 
For our SPD business, organic sales increased 6% due to higher pricing, partially offset by lower volume. Milk prices have remained stable month-to-month and are projected to rise as 2021 moves forward. 
Now turning to gross margin. Our first quarter gross margin was 44.5%, a 120 basis point decrease from a year ago. Gross margin drag was impacted by 350 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to commodities, distribution, tariffs and COVID impacts. Commodities, which were exacerbated due to the Texas freeze were a 90 basis point drag on margin. Tariff costs negatively impacted gross margin by 40 basis points. These costs were partially offset by a plus 190 basis points from price/volume mix and a positive 170 basis points from productivity programs as well as a 10 basis point positive impact from favorable currency. 
As a reminder, our outlook for the quarter on gross margin was down 50 basis points. The entire variance was related to the spike in commodities and tight transportation market. The good news is for the back half of the year, we expect margin expansion behind the pricing and promotional actions we laid out in the release as well as we start to lap some of the higher inflation and tariffs that we experienced in the back half of 2020. 
Moving to marketing. Marketing was up $2.3 million year-over-year as we invested behind our brand. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 8%. 
For SG&A, Q1 adjusted SG&A increased 60 basis points year-over-year primarily due to acquisition-related intangible amortization. We also had higher investments within IT and R&D as well as some transition costs from the ZICAM acquisition. 
Other expense all in was $11.6 million, a $3.6 million decline due to lower interest expense from lower interest rates. 
And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24.2% compared to 23.2% in 2020, an increase of 100 basis points, primarily driven by lower stock option exercises. 
And now to cash. For the first 3 months of 2021, cash from operating activities decreased 57% to $100 million due to higher cash earnings, which was offset by an increase in working capital. Inventories higher support increase in sales as we continue to improve customer fill levels. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased due to the timing of payments. 
As of March 31, cash on hand was $128 million. 
Our full year CapEx plan continues to be approximately $180 million as we continue to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins. 
For Q2, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 4.5%, organic sales growth of approximately 4% and gross margin contraction of 350 basis points as higher input costs continue and we lap artificially low promotional levels from a year ago. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.69 per share, a 10% decrease from last year's adjusted Q2 EPS. 
As you read in the release, we did a voluntary recall of selected products within our vitamin business. We expect the EPS impact in Q2 to be approximately $0.04 for the quarter and we are seeking reimbursement by insurance. 
And now for the full year outlook. We now expect full year 2021 reported sales growth to be 5% to 6%, which is above our previous 4.5% outlook. We're also raising our full year organic sales growth to approximately 4% to 5%, up from the previous outlook of 3%. 
Turning to gross margin. We now expect full year gross margin to be flat for the year, primarily due to the impact of higher raw material and transportation costs and the Texas freeze in March. We had previously expected gross margin expansion of 50 basis points for the year. And recently, we have seen a large increase in raw materials and transportation costs. 
We're absorbing $90 million of incremental costs for the full year. Higher sales, reductions in promotions and price increases across all 3 of our divisions represented about 1/3 of our portfolio, offset a large part of the cost increases. As a reminder, we price to protect gross profit dollars, not necessarily margin. 
Our full year tax rate expectations are now 22%, higher versus our last expectations due to lower stock option exercises. This is a $0.02 headwind versus our previous full year outlook. 
Adjusted EPS expectations continue to be in the range of $0.03 to $3.06 and 6% to 8% increase year-over-year. 
Our cash from operations outlook continues to be $1 billion, while we continue to pursue accretive acquisitions. 
As you heard from Matt, the company is off to a great start, and we expect 2021 to be another strong year. And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions."

Rick, if you can just spend a moment on how much of your commodity exposure you have hedged for the year, I think that would be helpful. 
And then shifting to pricing, Matt, you mentioned laundry and your international portfolio. I think typically, the company will lead in baking soda, contraceptives in OXI. What percentage of your portfolio do you expect to take pricing? How much is in your outlook? I know pricing is a sensitive topic, but maybe just sort of triangulate between how much is in your outlook? And then how much you -- there might be additional pricing that may not be in your outlook, I suppose. And then what are you seeing from competition, specifically in your bigger categories like laundry and litter and vitamins on the pricing front?"

And remember, we said if we could hedge those, whatever [ 6 or 7 ] commodities that a lot of the volatility does go away. 
We do have a lot of confidence in gross margin expansion in the back half as we are lapping some of those higher commodity costs in the back half of 2020. Just as an indication, ethylene, for example, in the first half of 2021, is up 70%. If we keep that current spot rate for the remainder of the year, the back half would be up 30% versus the second half of 2020. 
So like I said, we are confident [indiscernible] that's why we think we have confidence in the back half gross margin expansion as well as the price/volume mix."

So if you look at over the past 18 months, our competitors have taken price in a different way, generally through changes in ounces. And our estimate is anywhere from maybe 8% to 1",362,"Okay. And Kevin, your question about pricing. So we'll start with laundry. So if you look at over the past 18 months, our competitors have taken price in a different way, generally through changes in ounces. And our estimate is anywhere from maybe 8% to 12% price. And so we announced in early April that we're raising price. We're discussing that with retailers now. And -- but we don't think we're going to be out of bounds with respect to price gaps in laundry. 
Your question about how much has been priced, we've had 1/3 of the portfolio. And that would include Domestic, International and also SPD. And in the U.S. business, it's ARM & HAMMER and XTRA, our sheets business, scent boosters, so it's pretty much concentrated on the laundry. A couple of other categories in there raising some price and also just a couple of specific variants within the TROJAN category. 
Internationally, it's largely a personal care business. So the price increases are largely around the personal care business. 
And SPD, in particular, some of our products are being impacted by PFAD, which is a [indiscernible] acid distillate, which is affecting inputs for one of our products called MEGALAC. So we've been increasing prices now monthly for MEGALAC, and we'll be doing it as well for some of our other products. 
As far as -- I think a related question might be sold on deal, so how promotional is the environment today. So as everyone knows, the household side of the business is the one that's promotional. So laundry was down 300 basis points. The laundry category is now 300 basis points year-over-year sold on deal. And litter, similarly, was down 500 basis points year-over-year in Q1. We think that's probably going to reverse in Q2, and there's a simple reason for that. It's because last year in Q2, promotions were pulled in these categories. So for example, last year, in the second quarter and year-over-year, the laundry sold on deal was down 1,700 basis points 2020 versus '19. So obviously, a different kind of comp in Q2. So we think it may be up. Does that help you, Kevin?"

Just first, on the back half gross margin expectations, I guess it feels like something like 225 basis points average midpoint of gross margin expansion versus 2020. I appreciate your comps, appreciate lower promos and pricing. But it's also, I guess, implying a slightly higher gross margin level than even in 2019 despite this higher inflation environment. I wonder if you can just maybe, number one, is that a fair way to look at it? And then number two, maybe just unpack that a little bit. How much of that is maybe lower promo, the mix of the business relative to 2019, higher pricing levels? Just anything you might think relevant to  better think through that dynamic. And then I have one follow-up."

The first way, I'll just give you some of the details of the full year outlook, remembering, in New York, in our annual, or at CAGNY, we give you a full year outlook on gross margin, gave you the pieces. So I'll do that again",347,"Yes, sure. I'll do it 2 ways. The first way, I'll just give you some of the details of the full year outlook, remembering, in New York, in our annual, or at CAGNY, we give you a full year outlook on gross margin, gave you the pieces. So I'll do that again, and then I'll kind of bridge it to you. 
So the full year outlook for margin is plus 200 basis points for price/volume mix, plus 120 basis points for productivity. So those are the 2 big tailwinds. Price/volume mix, for example, is a lot higher than it was, given all of our expectations for, number one, lower promotional spending but higher pricing and really baseline volume is doing better than we expected. 
Then we have inflation down 300 basis points. And then tariffs down 40. M&A, up 20. That's how we get to 0. 
Now if you take a step back and you think, well, the first half of this year, to get to 0, the first half is going to be down about 2 35. And the back half is going to be up about 2 35. That's a delta of about 470 basis points. So why are we convinced that we can go from the first half down to the second half up? 200 basis points of that 470 is because of price/volume mix, the actions that we talked about. The other 300 basis points is really cost related. Inflation, I gave an example in relation to Kevin's question, that ethylene, for example, is up  70% in the first half of 2021. HDPE is up 85% in the first half of 2021. Ethylene is only up 30% in the back half. We keep current spot levels.  HDPE is only up 50% if we keep current spot levels. 
We're lapping tariffs, right? We had tariffs in the year ago numbers in the back half. We had some higher COVID costs in the back half of 2020. So those are -- that's a little bit more color, but I just wanted to walk you through."

I appreciate that. And just one follow-up would be on the vitamin category. So I know that this was -- has been approached a few different ways already just from a category growth and higher per capita consumption perspective. But it's not just that, right? I mean, you outperformed the category, I don't know, at least in Scanner roughly 50 points, maybe a little bit less in 2020. And the relative outperformance has certainly sustained, not that high of a level, but it certainly sustained on a year-to-date basis. So like there's clearly a pretty significant share gain story here, too, and asked different ways in the past, but can you just offer a little bit of perspective on exactly why you think that's the case, whether that's the incremental capacity that you had already invested into, whether you think your product SKUs or the price tiers or the specific subcategories that you're in are particularly relevant in the current environment? Just broadly, what do you think is contributing to the relative outperformance in a category that's doing quite well?"

In fact, going back over the last 10 years, it will be the highest back half margin you've ever achieved, which in context of the environment, seems surprising. So I was hoping you could explain like why structurally you're going to be at a higher margin even with these cost pressures? 
And then the second related question is, gosh, if you can hit all-time high margins in the back half of this environment, what is the right margin for this portfolio? Streets out there looking at fiscal '23, maybe you're 46, 46 street. Do you think with the portfolio you have today, your normalized gross margin rate should be in the 47%, 48% type range?"

I think I'm trying to explain that we're going to -- we have a lot of confidence in being up in the back half. And part of it was the comp on inflation, the comp on COVID comp on tariffs. But underlying that, remember, all the things we talk about with our Evergreen model are certainly true, right? Our productivity program over the last couple of years has almost doubled in relation to where it was just 5 years ago. So we have a new capability that's offsetting these things that has been masked for a period of time because all this inflation, all these tariff discussions, all these COVID costs. So that's certainly coming to bear in just a great way. 
NPD, as an example, when we buy businesses that have higher gross margin than simple ad as well. So ZICAM, even though, as an example, that revenue number will be lower than we had hoped for because there's 0 cold and flu season. The margin impact is still a tailwind. 
So all those things that are structural are also tailwinds. I think over the long term, we have a lot of confidence in the Evergreen model, expanding gross margin. We've got to get past all these one-timers like tariffs and whatnot. But I really do believe that we have more upside, more room to run. And so I do think that we're going to be into the higher 40s over the long term."

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q1 results, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick, our CFO.

I'll begin with a review of the Q1 results, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions.  
Before we begin, I'd like to recognize all Church & Dwight employees around the world for their continued dedication to keeping our company going during the pandemic, especially our supply chain and R&D teams, as we overcame raw material shortages in Q1 as a result of the Texas freeze.  
Now let's talk about the results. Q1 was another exceptional quarter. Reported sales growth was 6.3%, and adjusted EPS was $0.83, and that's $0.03 better than our outlook. Organic sales grew 4.9%, driven by higher consumption. E-commerce shows no signs of slowing. In Q1, our online sales increased by 54% year-over-year, and as a percentage of total sales, were 14.8% in Q1 compared to 10.2% in Q1 of 2020. We continue to expect online sales for the full year to be 15% as a percentage of total sales.  
The vaccinations will significantly influence consumer behavior. The U.S. is slowly opening up, which means consumers are more mobile. 60% of vaccinated consumers are optimistic that they will return to a normal, or new normal, as we are seeing the first signs that consumers are willing to spend more time in stores based on a study by IRI. In contrast, many countries outside the U.S. continue to experience lockdowns.  
As described in the release, we have been facing shortages of raw materials due to the Texas freeze. Raw material and transportation costs spiked higher in February and were exacerbated by the Texas freeze. We expect the tight supply and higher input cost to continue for the balance of the year. To mitigate the cost increases, we have announced price increases in laundry and across our international portfolio, and we have reduced couponing and promotional spending. Rick will discuss this further in a couple of minutes.  
At our Analyst Day in January, we outlined which categories and brands we expected to stay elevated throughout 2021, recover from COVID lows, decline from COVID highs and which ones would remain steady. Overall, our full year thinking has not changed. To name a few categories, demand for vitamins, laundry additives and cat litter are expected to remain elevated in 2021. Condoms, dry shampoo, power flossers and women's grooming are expected to deliver year-over-year growth as society opens up and consumers have greater mobility. Baking soda, pregnancy test kits and oral analgesics are expected to decline from COVID highs.  
Of the 16 categories in which we compete, 8 grew consumption in Q1, in some cases, on top of big consumption gains in Q1 of 2020. Of those 8 categories, 5 saw a double-digit growth: Gummy vitamins, toothache, battery-powered toothbrush, pregnancy test kits and women's electric grooming. Household categories, such as laundry detergent and baking soda, were down in the quarter and unable to comp the huge COVID-19 sales spikes seen in Q1 2020.  
Looking at market shares in Q1, 8 out of our 13 power brands met or gained share within our U.S. Consumer Domestic business, which grew organic sales 5.1%. I'll comment on a few of the brands right now.  
Consumers have made health and wellness a priority. VITAFUSION and L'il Critters Gummy Vitamins saw great consumption growth in Q1, up 24% with the help of the new launches described in the release. It appears that new consumers are coming into the category and they're staying. One survey showed that consumers who are new to the category had a 90% repeat rate.  
WATERPIK grew consumption 15% in Q1 as it continues to recover from COVID lows and benefit from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness. WATERPIK is also benefiting from dental offices returning to pre-COVID patient levels. We expect the frequency of our Lunch & Learn program to return to normal levels in the second half of this year.  
Now BATISTE. While BATISTE remains impacted by social distancing, consumption was up 6% and we achieved a record-high quarterly dollar share of 39% behind our International Women's Day campaign.  
Now I want to talk about the International division. Despite European lockdowns, our International business came through with 3.2% organic growth in the quarter, primarily driven by strong growth in our Global Markets group. Asia continues to be a strong growth engine for us. WATERPIK, FEMFRESH and ARM & HAMMER led the growth for the International division in the quarter.  
Our Specialty Products business delivered a positive quarter with 6% growth, primarily due to higher pricing. Milk prices were stable in Q1 and are projected to increase later in the year due to higher demand.  
Now turning to new products. Innovative new products will continue to attract consumers. In 2021, we have launched many new products which are described in our press release.  
In the household products portfolio, we are introducing OXICLEAN Laundry and Home Sanitizer. It is the first and only sanitizing laundry additive that boosts stain fighting and eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and viruses. The product is also designed for cleaning throughout the house and on a variety of surfaces.  
In the personal care portfolio, VITAFUSION launched Elderberry gummies, triple immune gummies and POWER ZINC gummies to capitalize on increased consumer interest in immunity.  
WATERPIK launched WATERPIK ION, a water flosser which is 30% smaller and contains a long-lasting lithium-ion battery and is specifically designed for smaller bathroom spaces. To capitalize on its earlier success, Waterpik Sonic-Fusion, the world's first flossing toothbrush, was upgraded to Sonic-Fusion 2.0 with 2 brush head sizes and 2 brush speeds.  
And finally, FLAWLESS is taking advantage of the at-home beauty and self-care trends with a facial cleanser system, a shower wand for a full-body spa-like experience and at-home manicure and pedicure solutions.  
Now let's turn to the outlook. We're off to a good start in Q1. We continue to expect full year adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8%, which is in line with our evergreen target despite the heightened input cost. Given our expectations for consumer consumption, we have raised our full year outlook for reported sales growth from 4.5% to now 5% to 6%. Organic sales growth expectations were raised from 3% to 4% to 5%. And if you look at consumption trends through the middle of April, 14 of our 16 categories were up in consumption year-over-year. 
Now in conclusion. I'd like to remind everyone of the many reasons to have confidence in Church & Dwight. Our track record shows that we are positioned to do well in both good and bad times and in uncertain economic times such as now. Categories in which we play are essential to consumers. We have a balance sheet of value and -- pardon me, we have a balance of value and premium products. Our power brands are #1 or #2 in their categories. And we have low exposure to private label. And with a strong balance sheet, we continue to be open to acquiring TSR-accretive businesses. 
Next up is Rick to give us details on Q1."
261105,709188736,2262822,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody.

We'll start with EPS. First quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes the positive earnout adjustment, was $0.83, flat to prior year. And as we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earnout adjustment will continue until Q4, which is the conclusion of the earnout period. $0.83 was better than our $0.80 outlook, primarily due to continued increase in consumer demand for many of our products. Reported revenue was up 6.3%. Organic sales were up 4.9%, driven by a volume increase of 3.1% and a positive price/mix of 1.8%. 
Now let's review the segments. First, Consumer Domestic. Organic sales increased by 5.1% due to higher volume and positive price/mix. Overall, growth was led VITAFUSION, L'il Critters Gummy Vitamins, WATERPIK oral care products, FLAWLESS beauty products, ARM & HAMMER clumping cat litter and KABOOM bathroom cleaners as well as VIVISCAL hair-thinning products. 
Consumer International delivered 3.2% organic growth due to higher volume, partially offset by lower price and product mix. This was a great result despite European lockdowns. 
For our SPD business, organic sales increased 6% due to higher pricing, partially offset by lower volume. Milk prices have remained stable month-to-month and are projected to rise as 2021 moves forward. 
Now turning to gross margin. Our first quarter gross margin was 44.5%, a 120 basis point decrease from a year ago. Gross margin drag was impacted by 350 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to commodities, distribution, tariffs and COVID impacts. Commodities, which were exacerbated due to the Texas freeze, were a 90 basis point drag on margin. Tariff costs negatively impacted gross margin by 40 basis points. These costs were partially offset by a plus 190 basis points from price/volume mix and a positive 170 basis points from productivity programs as well as a 10 basis point positive impact from favorable currency. 
As a reminder, our outlook for the quarter on gross margin was down 50 basis points. The entire variance was related to the spike in commodities and tight transportation market. The good news is, for the back half of the year, we expect margin expansion behind the pricing and promotional actions we laid out in the release as well as we start to lap some of the higher inflation and tariffs that we experienced in the back half of 2020. 
Moving to marketing. Marketing was up $2.3 million year-over-year as we invested behind our brands. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 8%. 
For SG&A, Q1 adjusted SG&A increased 60 basis points year-over-year primarily due to acquisition-related intangible amortization. We also had higher investments within IT and R&D as well as some transition costs from the ZICAM acquisition. 
Other expense, all in, was $11.6 million, a $3.6 million decline due to lower interest expense from lower interest rates. 
And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24.2% compared to 23.2% in 2020, an increase of 100 basis points, primarily driven by lower stock option exercises. 
And now to cash. For the first 3 months of 2021, cash from operating activities decreased 57% to $100 million due to higher cash earnings, which was offset by an increase in working capital. Inventory is higher to support increase in sales as we continue to improve customer fill levels. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased due to the timing of payments. As of March 31, cash on hand was $128 million. 
Our full year CapEx plan continues to be approximately $180 million as we continue to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins. 
For Q2, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 4.5%, organic sales growth of approximately 4% and gross margin contraction of 350 basis points as higher input costs continue and we lap artificially low promotional levels from a year ago. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.69 per share, a 10% decrease from last year's adjusted Q2 EPS. As you read in the release, we did a voluntary recall of selected products within our vitamin business. We expect the EPS impact in Q2 to be approximately $0.04 for the quarter, and we are seeking reimbursement by insurance. 
And now for the full year outlook. We now expect full year 2021 reported sales growth to be 5% to 6%, which is above our previous 4.5% outlook. We're also raising our full year organic sales growth to approximately 4% to 5%, up from the previous outlook of 3%. 
Turning to gross margin. We now expect full year gross margin to be flat for the year, primarily due to the impact of higher raw material and transportation costs and the Texas freeze in March. We had previously expected gross margin expansion of 50 basis points for the year. And recently, we have seen a large increase in raw materials and transportation costs. We're absorbing $90 million of incremental costs for the full year. Higher sales, reductions in promotions and price increases across all 3 of our divisions represented about 1/3 of our portfolio, offset a large part of the cost increases. As a reminder, we price to protect gross profit dollars, not necessarily margin. 
Our full year tax rate expectations are now 22%, higher versus our last expectations due to lower stock option exercises. This is a $0.02 headwind versus our previous full year outlook. 
Adjusted EPS expectations continue to be in the range of $3.00 to $3.06, a 6% to 8% increase year-over-year. Our cash from operations outlook continues to be $1 billion while we continue to pursue accretive acquisitions. 
As you heard from Matt, the company is off to a great start, and we expect 2021 to be another strong year. 
And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions."

And then shifting to pricing. Matt, you mentioned laundry and your international portfolio. I think typically, the company will lead in baking soda, contraceptives, in OXI. What percentage of your portfolio do you expect to take pricing? How much is in your outlook? I know pricing is a sensitive topic, but maybe just sort of triangulate between how much is in your outlook. And then how much you -- there might be additional pricing that may not be in your outlook, I suppose. 
And then what are you seeing from competition, specifically in your bigger categories like laundry and litter and vitamins, on the pricing front?"

We do have a lot of confidence in gross margin expansion in the back half as we are lapping some of those higher commodity costs in the back half of 2020. Just as an indication, ethylene, for example, in the first half of 2021, is up 70%. If we keep that current spot rate for the remainder of the year, the back half would be up 30% versus the second half of 2020.

So if you look at over the past 18 months, our competitors have taken price in a different way, generally through changes in ounces. And where our estimate is anywhere from maybe 8",362,"Okay. And Kevin, your question about pricing. So we'll start with laundry. So if you look at over the past 18 months, our competitors have taken price in a different way, generally through changes in ounces. And where our estimate is anywhere from maybe 8% to 12% price. And so we announced in early April that we're raising price. We're discussing that with retailers now. And -- but we don't think we're going to be out of bounds with respect to price gaps in laundry. 
Your question about how much has been priced. We've had 1/3 of the portfolio, and that would include Domestic, International and also SPD. And in the U.S. business, it's ARM & HAMMER and XTRA, our sheets business, scent boosters, so it's pretty much concentrated on laundry. A couple of other categories in there, we're raising some price, and also just a couple of specific variants within the TROJAN category. 
Internationally, it's largely a personal care business, so the price increases are largely around the personal care business. 
And SPD, in particular, some of our products are being impacted by PFAD, which is Palm Fatty Acid Distillate, which is affecting inputs for one of our products called MEGALAC. So we've been increasing prices now monthly for MEGALAC, and we'll be doing it as well for some of our other products. 
As far as -- I think a related question might be sold on deal, so how promotional is the environment today? So as everyone knows, the household side of the business is the one that's promotional. So laundry was down 300 basis points. The laundry category is now 300 basis points year-over-year sold on deal. And litter, similarly, was down 500 basis points year-over-year in Q1. We think that's probably going to reverse in Q2, and there's a simple reason for that is because last year in Q2, promotions were pulled in these categories. 
So for example, last year, in the second quarter and year-over-year, the laundry sold on deal was down 1,700 basis points 2020 versus '19. So obviously, a different kind of comp in Q2, so we think it may be up. 
That help you, Kevin?"

The first way, I'll just give you some of the details of the full year outlook, remembering, in New York, in our annual -- or at CAGNY, we gave you a full year outlook on gross margin, gave you the pieces. So I'll do that again, and then I'll kind of bridge it to you. 
So the full year outlook for margin is plus 200 basis points for price/volume mix, plus 120 basis points for productivity. So those are the 2 big tailwinds. Price/volume mix, for example, is a lot higher than it was, given all of our expectations for, number one, lower promotional spending but higher pricing; and really, baseline volumes doing better than we expected. Then we have inflation down 300 basis points; and then tariffs down 40; m&A, up 20. That's how we get to 0. 
Now if you take a step back and you think, well, the first half of this year, to get to 0, the first half is going to be down about 2.35%, and the back half is going to be up about 2.35%. That's a delta of about 470 basis points. So why are we convinced that we can go from the first half down to the second half up? 
200 basis points of that 470 is because of price/volume mix, those the actions that we talked about. The other 300 basis points is really cost-related. Inflation, I gave the example in relation to Kevin's question, that ethylene, for example, is up 70% in the first half of 2021, HDPE is up 85% in the first half of 2021. Ethylene is only up 30% in the back half if we keep current spot levels, HDPE is only up 50% if we keep current spot levels. 
We're lapping tariffs, right? We had tariffs in the year-ago numbers in the back half. We had some higher COVID costs in the back half of 2020. So those are -- that's a little bit more color, but just wanted to walk you through."

I appreciate that. And just one follow-up would be on the vitamin category. So I know that this was -- has been approached a few different ways already just from a category growth and higher per capita consumption perspective. 
But it's not just that, right? I mean, you outperformed the category, I don't know, at least at scanner, roughly 50 points, maybe a little bit less, in 2020. And the relative outperformance has certainly sustained that -- not that high of a level, but it certainly sustained on a year-to-date basis. So like there's clearly a pretty significant share gain story here, too. 
And asked different ways in the past, but can you just offer a little bit of perspective on exactly why you think that's the case? Whether that's the incremental capacity that you had already invested into, whether you think your product SKUs or the price tiers or the specific subcategories that you're in are particularly relevant in the current environment?

Our productivity program over the last couple of years has almost doubled in relation to where it was just 5 years ago. So we have a new capability that's offsetting these things that has been masked for a period of time because of all this inflation, all these tariff discussions, all these COVID costs. So that's certainly coming to bear in just a great way. 
NPD as an example. When we buy businesses that have higher gross margin, that's simply an add as well. So ZICAM, even though, as an example, that revenue number will be lower than we had hoped for because there's 0 cold and flu season, the margin impact is still a tailwind. 
So all those things that are structural are also tailwinds. I think over the long term, we have a lot of confidence in the evergreen model, expanding gross margin. We've got to get past all these onetimers like tariffs and whatnot. But I really do believe that we have more upside, more room to run. And so I do think that we're going to be into the higher 40s over the long term."

Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q2 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions. But before we begin, I'd like to recog",1413,"Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q2 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions. But before we begin, I'd like to recognize all Church & Dwight employees around the world for their continued dedication to keeping our company going during the pandemic, especially our supply chain and R&D teams as during this quarter, the company faced the complexities of raw material shortages and labor shortages at our suppliers and third-party manufacturers. 
Now let's talk about the results. Q2 was another solid quarter for the company. Reported sales growth was 6.4%. Organic sales growth grew 4.5% and exceeded our 4% Q2 outlook. The 4.5% organic growth is impressive, considering Q2 2020 organic sales growth was 8.4%. Adjusted EPS was $0.76 and that's $0.07 better than our outlook. The EPS beat is attributed to two things: one, a temporary reduction in marketing; and two, our revenue growth handily exceeded our outlook. Another item that is noteworthy is we overcame a tax rate, which was much, much higher than expected in Q2. 
We grew consumption in 13 of the 16 categories in which we compete, and in some cases, on top of big consumption gains last year. Another way to look at this is to compare our Q2 consumption on those 16 categories to 2019, a pre-COVID year. We have higher consumption in 14 of those 16 categories compared to Q2 2019. Regarding brand performance, 9 of our 13 brands saw a double-digit consumption growth, and I'll name them for you: Gummy Vitamins, stain fighters, cat litter, condoms, battery-powered toothbrushes, depilatories, dry shampoo, saline spray and water flossers. Now although many of our brands delivered double-digit consumption growth, it is not reflected in our 4.5% organic sales growth as shipments were constrained by supply issues, which we do expect to lessen by Q4. In Q2, online sales as a percentage of total sales was 14.2%. Our online sales increased by 7% year-over-year. But remember, this is on top of the 75% growth in e-commerce that we experienced in Q2 2020 versus '19. We continue to expect online sales for the full year to be 15% as a percentage of total sales. 
With 70% of American adults having at least 1 vaccine shot so far, the U.S. has been opening up with consumers becoming more mobile. In recent days, however, it appears that trend could slow down due to the delta variant, combined with many people still being unvaccinated. Outside the U.S., many countries continue to enforce periodic lockdowns, and we expect that to continue. As described in the release, we faced shortages of raw and packaging materials. Labor shortages that suppliers and third-party manufacturers have reduced their ability to produce and transportation challenges have further contributed to supply problems. 
Besides shortages, we are dealing with inflation, significant inflation of material and component cost is affecting our gross margin expectations, which Rick will cover in his remarks. Due to a lower case fill rate, we pulled back on Q2 marketing, especially for household products. We expect the supply issues to begin to abate in Q4 and the higher input costs and transportation costs are expected to continue, though, for the rest of the year. 
On past earnings calls, we described how we expected categories and brands to perform in 2021. Overall, our full year thinking is generally consistent to name a few categories, demand for vitamins, laundry additives and cat litter is expected to remain elevated in 2021. Condoms, dry shampoo and water flosses are recovering and experiencing year-over-year growth as society opens up and consumers have greater mobility. Baking soda and oral analgesics are expected to decline from COVID highs. 
Now I'm going to talk about the divisions. Consumer Domestic business grew organic sales 2.8%. This is on top of 10.7% organic growth in Q2 2020. Looking at market shares in Q2, 5 out of our 13 power brands met or gained share. Our share results are clearly impacted by our supply issues. I'll comment on a few of the brands right now. VITAFUSION gummy vitamins saw great consumption growth in Q2, up 10%. Consumers have made health and wellness a priority. It appears that new consumers are coming into the category and they're staying. So here's a supporting statistic. In the last year, VITAFUSION household penetration is up 17%. That means the brand is now in 1 out of every 10 households. 
Next up is WATERPIK. WATERPIK grew consumption 72% in Q2 as it continues to recover from COVID lows and benefits from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness. WATERPIK is also benefiting from dental offices returning to pre-COVID patient levels. We expect the frequency of our Lunch & Learn program to return to normal levels in the second half of this year. BATISTE dry shampoo grew consumption 37%. Dry shampoo is recovering as stores have reopened and consumers are becoming more mobile. Similarly, TROJAN delivered 11% consumption growth. Society has been opening up as restaurants, bars and clubs have reopened, people are hooking up again. Here's a fun fact that might be a contributing factor. In Q2, TROJAN launched on TikTok, with explosive uptake from consumers, with over 47 million views. 
Next, I want to discuss international. Despite intermittent lockdowns in our markets, our international business came through with 10.4% organic growth in the quarter, primarily driven by our strong growth in our Global Markets group. Asia continues to be a strong growth engine for us. WATERPIK, BATISTE and ARM & HAMMER led the growth for the International division in the quarter. Our Specialty Products business delivered a positive quarter with 11.8% organic growth. This was driven by higher pricing and volume. Milk prices remain stable and demand is high for our nutritional supplements. The prior year quarterly organic growth for Specialty Products was 3%, so 11.8% is an impressive result. 
Now turning to new products. Innovative new products will continue to attract consumers. In 2021, we have launched many new products, which are described in our press release. In the household products portfolio, we introduced OXICLEAN laundry and home sanitizer. It's the first and only sanitizing laundry additive that boosts stain fighting and eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and viruses. In the personal care portfolio, VITAFUSION launched Elderberry Gummies, Triple Immune Gummies and Power Sync Gummies to capitalize on increased consumer interest in immunity. WATERPIK launched WATERPIK Ion, a water flosser which is 30% smaller with a long-lasting lithium-ion battery. It is specifically designed for smaller bathrooms spaces. To capitalized on its earlier success WATERPIK SONIC-FUSION, the world's first flossing toothbrush, was upgraded to SONIC-FUSION 2.0, with 2 brush head sizes and 2 brush speeds, and that's doing extremely well. And finally, FLAWLESS is taking advantage of the at-home beauty and self-care trends with at-home manicure and pedicure solutions. 
Now let's turn to the outlook. Since we last spoke to you in April, unplanned cost inflation has grown by another $35 million. In addition to the price increases on 33% of our portfolio that we announced in April, we have just announced price increases on other categories, which means we have now priced up 50% of our portfolio. Of course, there is a lag on the positive impact of these increases, which impacts our earnings outlook. We now expect to be at the lower end of our range of adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% as a result of heightened input costs. Although we expect to be at the low end of the range, it's really important to remember that we are comping 15% EPS growth in 2020. We expect full year reported sales growth of 5%, with 4% full year organic sales growth. It's also important to call out that we are committed to maintaining the long-term health of our brands by ensuring sustained high levels of marketing investment in the second half. 
In conclusion, July consumption continues to be strong. We are navigating through significant supply challenges and cost inflation. We believe we are well positioned for 2022 with the pricing actions we have taken. We expect our portfolio of brands to do well, both in good and bad times and in uncertain economic times such as now. We have a strong balance sheet, and we continue to hunt for TSR-accretive businesses. 
Next up is Rick to give us details on Q2."

We'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes the positive earnout adjustment, was $0.76, down 1.3% to prior year. And as we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earn-out adjustment w",1029,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes the positive earnout adjustment, was $0.76, down 1.3% to prior year. And as we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earn-out adjustment will continue until Q4, which is the conclusion of the earnout period. $0.76 was better than our $0.69 outlook, primarily due to continued strong consumer demand for many of our products as well as a temporary reduction in marketing spend as supply chain shortages were impacting customer fill rates, which we expect to recover in Q4. The $0.76 includes a $0.04 drag from a higher tax rate and a $0.04 drag from the VMS recall costs. Reported revenue was up 6.4%. Organic sales were up 4.5%, driven by a volume increase of 4.3%. 
Matt covered the top line, and I'll jump right into gross margin. Our second quarter gross margin was 43.4%, a 340 basis point decrease from a year ago. This was right in line with our outlook for down 350 basis points for the quarter, gross margin was impacted by 480 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to commodities, distribution and labor costs. Tariff costs negatively impacted gross margin by an additional 50 basis points. These costs were partially offset by a positive 40 basis point impact from price volume mix and a positive 140 basis point impact from productivity programs as well as a 10 basis point positive impact from currency. 
Moving to marketing, marketing was down $5.3 million year-over-year as we lowered spend to reduce demand until fill rates could recover. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 100 basis points to 9.2%. We continue to expect full year marketing expense as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 11.5%, in line with historical averages. For SG&A, Q2 adjusted SG&A decreased 140 basis points year-over-year with lower legal costs and lower incentive comp. Other expense all-in was $11.4 million, a $3.3 million decline due to lower interest expense from lower interest rates. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24% compared to 19.6% in 2020, an increase of 440 basis points, primarily driven by lower stock option exercises. You will hear in a minute, this also impacts our full year tax rate. 
And now to cash. For the full -- for the first 6 months of 2021, cash from operating activities decreased 42% to $344 million due to higher cash earnings being offset by an increase in working capital. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased due to the timing of payments. As a reminder, in the year ago numbers, there was an $80 million benefit in Q2 related to the timing of U.S. federal income tax payments shifting from the second to the third quarter in the prior year. We expect cash from operations to be approximately $950 million for the full year. As of June 30, cash on hand was $149.8 million. Our full year CapEx plan is now $140 million as we continue to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins. The decrease from our previous $180 million is project timing related. 
For Q3, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 3% and organic sales growth of approximately 1.5%, entirely due to supply chain constraints. We expect gross margin expansion in the quarter, led by our price increases. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.70 per share, flat from the last year's adjusted EPS as strong operating performance is offset by a higher tax rate. 
And now for the full year outlook. We now expect full year 2021 reported sales growth to be approximately 5%, organic sales growth to be approximately 4%. Our consumption is strong and outpacing shipments. We expect our customer fill levels to improve by Q4. 
Turning to gross margin, we now expect full year gross margin to be down 75 basis points. This represents an incremental impact from our last guidance due to broad-based inflation on raw materials and transportation costs. Our April outlook expected gross margin to be flat for the year and $90 million of inflation from our original guidance. Now we're absorbing $125 million of incremental costs for the full year. This additional $35 million of inflation drives the change in our gross margin outlook. 
We have taken another round of pricing actions with over 50% of our global brands having announced price increase. While some of this benefit helps the second half of 2021, most of the benefit is in 2022. As a reminder, we price to protect gross profit dollars, not necessarily margin. The $35 million movement versus our previous outlook is primarily noncommodity-related, transportation, labor, third-party manufacturers and other raw material price increases make up the majority. Commodities are also up. And while we have 80% of our commodities hedged, let me give you a sense of what's going on with major commodities. 
Over the past few months, second half expectations for resins have moved up considerably. For example, previously in our forecast, it was based on HDPE being up 30% in the second half of the year. Now it's up 60%. Polypro has moved from being up 40% to now 90%. In addition, transportation costs such as diesel, have continued to rise. We previously expected second half diesel to be up 18% and now it's up 27%. Cartons and corrugate previously were single digit, now they're low double digit. So that's the latest income in commodities. 
And now we'll move to tax. Our full year tax rate expectations are now 23% higher versus our last expectations due to lower stock option exercises. This is a $0.04 drag versus our previous outlook. We now expect adjusted EPS to be at the lower end of our previous range of 6% to 8%. Our brands continue to go from strength to strength as strong consumption and organic sales growth lapsed almost 10% organic growth a year ago. While inflation is broad-based, we have taken pricing actions to mitigate, which gives us confidence in margin expansion in the back half. 
And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions."

The issue is getting components, can be raw or packaging materials, chemicals, et cetera.

And then that's exacerbated by the fact that sometimes, you can't get the product delivered, particularly if you're having -- if you're sourcing components or ingredients from Asia and you're dealing with containers. 
So not a capacity issue, it's really due to ability to get labor. And in some cases, it's because of the freeze. We had force majeure for half a dozen of our suppliers, chemicals. If you recall earlier in the year, the Texas Freeze, so we're not quite out of the woods on that one yet either."

They're greater in some categories than others, but you also have to keep an eye on the competitive set. So we are looking at the rest of the portfolio now to see whether it makes sense to have a 2022 price increase. And the other thing we're going to do is we're going to review the price increases that we've already taken on the first 50% and ask ourselves if those need to be revisited. 
As far as the price increases go, we announced in April for laundry. Those have taken effect now in July. We know at least one other competitor has said publicly that their prices are going up in Q4. So we may have some temporary price gaps in Q3, but -- and then on the litter side, we raised price there. That pricing is shelf mid-October. And we know that a one major competitor has already raised price as well. So we've seen that. And I think Rick mentioned on the earlier call, in April that when we were planning this, we were not assuming that competitors would follow. So the fact that since then, in the laundry and litter, we've heard and seen that from a couple of competitors, that's a good indication for us. Rick, anything to add?"

And the simple way to think about it is, when we gave our April outlook, inflation was a minus 300 basis points, and that was what was included in our flat guidance. Now our inflation number is closer to minus 375. That's kind of the entire change from going flat to minus 75. And that minus 375 for the full year is kind of an indication of the inflation that we've seen for the whole year, inclusive of the first [ $90 million ], inclusive of the new [ $35 million ] that we're talking about. As we exit the year, we think price volume mix will be a tailwind of like 285 basis points. So that's probably a good -- the way to gauge it is we're not quite recovering all of our inflation yet, but we've only priced half the portfolio."

I think it's important to just have the backdrop of Q2 for both laundry and litter. Take litter, for example, year-over-year, sold on deal for litter was actually down 80 basis points. So the categories right now, promotion in the second quarter, around 13% sold on deal. Historically, it's around 19% to 20%. And so it's pretty off its normal sold on deal percentages. 
So -- but we do know that one major competitor besides ARM & HAMMER has had supply issues as well in the second quarter, which I'm not going to name, that may have contributed to the fact that litter sold on deal was down in Q2 for just about all competitors. For Laundry, Q2 was up almost 1,200 basis points to about 32% sold on deal for liquid laundry detergent. Remember, last year, promotions were pulled. So it's not surprising that there would be a rebound this year. We actually had the lowest increase in sold on deal, up 700 basis points in Q2. And our lower promotions made sense in the context of supply shortages. And obviously, going forward, we only want the price to stick. So the promotions would also be limited as well."

And then a follow-up on the margins.

So we have been raising prices in SPD. We probably were the earliest of all 3 divisions of raising price in specialty products. And that's both on the animal side and also on the bulk sodium bicarbonate side. Bulk sodium bicarbonate is oftentimes a contracted business, but the noncontracted volume, we've been raising price.

As far as your gross margin question, look, I think you're right, pricing over the long term recovers the inflation. And so that is a good guy and a bad guy, and they kind of wash over time. Look, we have a lot of confidence in our evergreen model, and it's only 25 basis points of expansion. So we're going to get that over the long term through productivity, through innovation and through mix.

Inflation is a headwind of around 285 basis points. We have incremental tariffs of the 35 basis points, which is a little bit better than it was in the first half because we had tariffs starting a year ago. We have productivity programs of around plus 85. The acquisition for largely ZICAM helps on margin by about 40 basis points and then currency is a little bit of a drag.

And then just connected to that, it sounds like pricing in laundry is going okay, early days, but you also have supply issues in household. And did it sound like it's mainly in areas where it's like components or could supply chain issues actually have an issue on getting pricing through in laundry, if you start to experience some out of stocks?

The other question about raising price, not just in laundry and litter, but in other categories, which we have. So for example, OXICLEAN Stain Fighters, baking soda. We announced one variant of TROJAN condoms. WATERPIK will be raising price as well. So we've been able to -- we're announcing price increases in many categories. And keep in mind that we are the #1 brand in stain fighters, depilatories, water flossers, baking soda, et cetera. So we do have some strength and the ability to lead there.

I mentioned earlier in my comments that because of the Texas Freeze, there are issues with chemicals, and that affects both liquid laundry detergent and unit dose.

Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q2 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions. But before we begin, I'd like to recog",1412,"Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q2 results. And then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions. But before we begin, I'd like to recognize all Church & Dwight employees around the world for their continued dedication to keeping our company going during the pandemic, especially our supply chain and R&D teams as during this quarter, the company faced the complexities of raw material shortages and labor shortages at our suppliers and third-party manufacturers.
Now let's talk about the results. Q2 was another solid quarter for the company. Reported sales growth was 6.4%. Organic sales growth grew 4.5% and exceeded our 4% Q2 outlook. The 4.5% organic growth is impressive, considering Q2 2020 organic sales growth was 8.4%. Adjusted EPS was $0.76 and that's $0.07 better than our outlook.
The EPS beat is attributed to two things: one, a temporary reduction in marketing; and two, our revenue growth handily exceeded our outlook. Another item that is noteworthy is we overcame a tax rate, which was much, much higher than expected in Q2.
We grew consumption in 13 of the 16 categories in which we compete and in some cases, on top of big consumption gains last year. Another way to look at this is to compare our Q2 consumption on those 16 categories to 2019, a pre-COVID year. We have higher consumption in 14 of those 16 categories compared to Q2 2019.
Regarding brand performance, 9 of our 13 brands saw a double-digit consumption growth, and I'll name them for you: gummy vitamins, stain fighters, cat litter, condoms, battery-powered toothbrushes, depilatories, dry shampoo, saline spray and water flossers. Now although many of our brands delivered double-digit consumption growth, it is not reflected in our 4.5% organic sales growth as shipments were constrained by supply issues, which we do expect to lessen by Q4.
In Q2, online sales as a percentage of total sales was 14.2%. Our online sales increased by 7% year-over-year. But remember, this is on top of the 75% growth in e-commerce that we experienced in Q2 2020 versus '19. We continue to expect online sales for the full year to be 15% as a percentage of total sales.
With 70% of American adults having at least 1 vaccine shot so far, the U.S. has been opening up with consumers becoming more mobile. In recent days, however, it appears that trend could slow down due to the Delta variant combined with many people still being unvaccinated.
Outside the U.S., many countries continue to enforce periodic lockdowns, and we expect that to continue. As described in the release, we faced shortages of raw and packaging materials, labor shortages that suppliers and third-party manufacturers have reduced their ability to produce and transportation challenges have further contributed to supply problems.
Besides shortages, we are dealing with inflation. Significant inflation of material and component cost is affecting our gross margin expectations, which Rick will cover in his remarks. Due to a lower case fill rate, we pulled back on Q2 marketing, especially for household products. We expect the supply issues to begin to abate in Q4. The higher input costs and transportation costs are expected to continue, though, for the rest of the year.
On past earnings calls, we described how we expected categories and brands to perform in 2021. Overall, our full year thinking is generally consistent. To name a few categories, demand for vitamins, laundry additives and cat litter is expected to remain elevated in 2021. Condoms, dry shampoo and water flossers are recovering and experiencing year-over-year growth as society opens up and consumers have greater mobility. Baking soda and oral analgesics are expected to decline from COVID highs.
Now I'm going to talk about the divisions. Consumer Domestic business grew organic sales 2.8%. This is on top of 10.7% organic growth in Q2 2020. Looking at market shares in Q2, 5 out of our 13 power brands met or gained share. Our share results are clearly impacted by our supply issues. I'll comment on a few of the brands right now.
VITAFUSION gummy vitamins saw great consumption growth in Q2, up 10%. Consumers have made health and wellness a priority. It appears that new consumers are coming into the category and they're staying. So here's a supporting statistic. In the last year, VITAFUSION household penetration is up 17%. That means the brand is now in one out of every 10 households.
Next up is WATERPIK. WATERPIK grew consumption 72% in Q2 as it continues to recover from COVID lows and benefits from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness. WATERPIK is also benefiting from dental offices returning to pre-COVID patient levels. We expect the frequency of our Lunch & Learn program to return to normal levels in the second half of this year.
BATISTE dry shampoo grew consumption 37%. Dry shampoo is recovering as stores have reopened and consumers are becoming more mobile. Similarly, TROJAN delivered 11% consumption growth. Society has been opening up. As restaurants, bars and clubs have reopened, people are hooking up again. Here's a fun fact that might be a contributing factor. In Q2, TROJAN launched on TikTok with explosive uptake from consumers with over 47 million views.
Next, I want to discuss international. Despite intermittent lockdowns in our markets, our international business came through with 10.4% organic growth in the quarter, primarily driven by our strong growth in our Global Markets Group. Asia continues to be a strong growth engine for us. WATERPIK, BATISTE and ARM & HAMMER led the growth for the International division in the quarter.
Our Specialty Products business delivered a positive quarter with 11.8% organic growth. This was driven by higher pricing and volume. Milk prices remained stable and demand is high for our nutritional supplements. The prior year quarterly organic growth for Specialty Products was 3%, so 11.8% is an impressive result.
Now turning to new products. Innovative new products will continue to attract consumers. In 2021, we have launched many new products, which are described in our press release. In the household products portfolio, we introduced OXICLEAN Laundry and Home Sanitizer. It's the first and only sanitizing laundry additive that boosts stain fighting and eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and viruses.
In the personal care portfolio, VITAFUSION launched Elderberry Gummies, Triple Immune Gummies and Power Zinc Gummies to capitalize on increased consumer interest in immunity. WATERPIK launched WATERPIK ION, a water flosser which is 30% smaller with a long-lasting lithium-ion battery. It is specifically designed for smaller bathrooms spaces.
To capitalize on its earlier success WATERPIK SONIC-FUSION, the world's first flossing toothbrush, was upgraded to SONIC-FUSION 2.0, with 2 brush head sizes and 2 brush speeds, and that's doing extremely well. And finally, FLAWLESS is taking advantage of the at-home beauty and self-care trends with at-home manicure and pedicure solutions.
Now let's turn to the outlook. Since we last spoke to you in April, unplanned cost inflation has grown by another $35 million. In addition to the price increases on 33% of our portfolio that we announced in April, we have just announced price increases on other categories, which means we have now priced up 50% of our portfolio.
Of course, there is a lag on the positive impact of these increases, which impacts our earnings outlook. We now expect to be at the lower end of our range of adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% as a result of heightened input costs.
Although we expect to be at the low end of the range, it's really important to remember that we are comping 15% EPS growth in 2020. We expect full year reported sales growth of 5% with 4% full year organic sales growth. It's also important to call out that we are committed to maintaining the long-term health of our brands by ensuring sustained high levels of marketing investment in the second half.
In conclusion, July consumption continues to be strong. We are navigating through significant supply challenges and cost inflation. We believe we are well positioned for 2022 with the pricing actions we have taken. We expect our portfolio of brands to do well, both in good and bad times and in uncertain economic times such as now. We have a strong balance sheet, and we continue to hunt for TSR-accretive businesses.
Next up is Rick to give us details on Q2."
261105,1672555265,2357742,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Church & Dwight Co., Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes the positive earnout adjustment, was $0.76, down 1.3% to prior year. And as we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earnout adjustment wi",1027,"Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. We'll start with EPS. Second quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes the positive earnout adjustment, was $0.76, down 1.3% to prior year. And as we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earnout adjustment will continue until Q4, which is the conclusion of the earnout period.
$0.76 was better than our $0.69 outlook, primarily due to continued strong consumer demand for many of our products as well as a temporary reduction in marketing spend as supply chain shortages were impacting customer fill rates, which we expect to recover in Q4. The $0.76 includes a $0.04 drag from a higher tax rate and a $0.04 drag from the VMS recall costs. Reported revenue was up 6.4%. Organic sales were up 4.5%, driven by a volume increase of 4.3%.
Matt covered the top line, and I'll jump right into gross margin. Our second quarter gross margin was 43.4%, a 340 basis point decrease from a year ago. This was right in line with our outlook for down 350 basis points for the quarter. Gross margin was impacted by 480 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to commodities, distribution and labor costs.
Tariff costs negatively impacted gross margin by an additional 50 basis points. These costs were partially offset by a positive 40 basis point impact from price/volume mix and a positive 140 basis point impact from productivity programs as well as a 10 basis point positive impact from currency.
Moving to marketing, marketing was down $5.3 million year-over-year as we lowered spend to reduce demand until fill rates could recover. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 100 basis points to 9.2%. We continue to expect full year marketing expense as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 11.5%, in line with historical averages.
For SG&A, Q2 adjusted SG&A decreased 140 basis points year-over-year with lower legal costs and lower incentive comp. Other expense all-in was $11.4 million, a $3.3 million decline due to lower interest expense from lower interest rates. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24% compared to 19.6% in 2020, an increase of 440 basis points primarily driven by lower stock option exercises. You will hear in a minute this also impacts our full year tax rate.
And now to cash. For the full -- for the first 6 months of 2021, cash from operating activities decreased 42% to $344 million due to higher cash earnings being offset by an increase in working capital. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased due to the timing of payments.
As a reminder, in the year ago numbers, there was an $80 million benefit in Q2 related to the timing of U.S. federal income tax payments shifting from the second to the third quarter in the prior year. We expect cash from operations to be approximately $950 million for the full year.
As of June 30, cash on hand was $149.8 million. Our full year CapEx plan is now $140 million as we continue to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins. The decrease from our previous $180 million is project timing related.
For Q3, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 3% and organic sales growth of approximately 1.5% entirely due to supply chain constraints. We expect gross margin expansion in the quarter led by our price increases. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.70 per share, flat from the last year's adjusted EPS as strong operating performance is offset by a higher tax rate.
And now for the full year outlook. We now expect full year 2021 reported sales growth to be approximately 5%, organic sales growth to be approximately 4%. Our consumption is strong and outpacing shipments. We expect our customer fill levels to improve by Q4.
Turning to gross margin. We now expect full year gross margin to be down 75 basis points. This represents an incremental impact from our last guidance due to broad-based inflation on raw materials and transportation costs. Our April outlook expected gross margin to be flat for the year and $90 million of inflation from our original guidance. Now we're absorbing $125 million of incremental costs for the full year. This additional $35 million of inflation drives the change in our gross margin outlook.
We have taken another round of pricing actions with over 50% of our global brands having announced price increase. While some of this benefit helps the second half of 2021, most of the benefit is in 2022. As a reminder, we price to protect gross profit dollars, not necessarily margin.
The $35 million movement versus our previous outlook is primarily non-commodity-related. Transportation, labor, third-party manufacturers and other raw material price increases make up the majority. Commodities are also up. And while we have 80% of our commodities hedged, let me give you a sense of what's going on with major commodities.
Over the past few months, second half expectations for resins have moved up considerably. For example, previously in our forecast, it was based on HDPE being up 30% in the second half of the year. Now it's up 60%. Polypro has moved from being up 40% to now 90%. In addition, transportation costs such as diesel have continued to rise. We previously expected second half diesel to be up 18% and now it's up 27%. Cartons and corrugate previously were single digit, now they're low double digit. So that's the latest in commodities.
And now we'll move to tax. Our full year tax rate expectations are now 23%, higher versus our last expectations due to lower stock option exercises. This is a $0.04 drag versus our previous outlook. We now expect adjusted EPS to be at the lower end of our previous range of 6% to 8%.
Our brands continue to go from strength to strength as strong consumption and organic sales growth lapsed almost 10% organic growth a year ago. While inflation is broad-based, we have taken pricing actions to mitigate, which gives us confidence in margin expansion in the back half.
And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions."

The issue is getting components, can be raw or packaging materials, chemicals, et cetera. And the reason there are shortages is because our suppliers are having trouble getting labor into their plants to actually make their raw packaging materials. And then that's exacerbated by the fact that sometimes, you can't get the product delivered, particularly if you're having -- if you're sourcing components or ingredients from Asia and you're dealing with containers.
So not a capacity issue. It's entirely due to ability to get labor. And in some cases, it's because of the freeze. We had force majeure for half a dozen of our suppliers, chemicals. If you recall earlier in the year, the Texas Freeze, so we're not quite out of the woods on that one yet either."

So we are looking at the rest of the portfolio now to see whether it makes sense to have a 2022 price increase. And the other thing we're going to do is we're going to review the price increases that we've already taken on the first 50% and ask ourselves if those need to be revisited.
As far as the price increases go, we announced in April for laundry, those have taken effect now in July. We know at least one other competitor has said publicly that their prices are going up in Q4. So we may have some temporary price gaps in Q3.
But -- and then on the litter side, we raised price there. That pricing is shelf mid-October. And we know that one major competitor has already raised price as well, so we've seen that. And I think Rick mentioned on the earlier call in April that when we were planning this, we were not assuming that competitors would follow. So the fact that since then, in laundry and litter, we've heard and seen that from a couple of competitors, that's a good indication for us. Rick, anything to add?"

Now our inflation number is closer to minus 375. That's kind of the entire change from going flat to minus 75.
And that minus 375 for the full year is kind of an indication of the inflation that we've seen for the whole year, inclusive of the first [ $90 million ], inclusive of the new $35 million that we're talking about. As we exit the year, we think price/volume mix will be a tailwind of like 285 basis points.

Take litter, for example, year-over-year, sold on deal for litter was actually down 80 basis points. So the categories right now, promotion in the second quarter, around 13% sold on deal. Historically, it's around 19% to 20%. And so it's pretty off its normal sold on deal percentages.
So -- but we do know that one major competitor besides ARM & HAMMER has had supply issues as well in the second quarter, which I'm not going to name. So that may have contributed to the fact that litter sold on deal was down in Q2 for just about all competitors.
For laundry, Q2 was up almost 1,200 basis points to about 32% sold on deal for liquid laundry detergent. Remember, last year, promotions were pulled. So it's not surprising that there would be a rebound this year. We actually had the lowest increase in sold on deal, up 700 basis points in Q2. And our lower promotions made sense in the context of supply shortages. And obviously, going forward, we only want the price to stick so the promotions would also be limited as well."

And then a follow-up on the margins. Just kind of curious how you're thinking about operating margin expansion long term and the leverage you can pull in order to get back on track with respect to margin expansion because, obviously, pricing is a piece of that. But mix is not as big of a factor for you guys relative to some of your peers and then you're already still good at overhead control. So just wondering how much you can push on the G&A or the S&A as an offset."

So we have been raising prices in SPD.
We probably were the earliest of all 3 divisions of raising price in Specialty Products. And that's both on the animal side and also on the bulk sodium bicarbonate side. Bulk sodium bicarbonate is oftentimes a contracted business, but the non-contracted volume, we've been raising price. So that's a steady business, a good quarter.

As far as your gross margin question, look, I think you're right, pricing over the long term recovers the inflation. And so that is a good guy and a bad guy, and they kind of wash over time. Look, we have a lot of confidence in our evergreen model, and it's only 25 basis points of expansion. So we're going to get that over the long term through productivity, through innovation and through mix.
And we're doing a lot of work internally on mix actually and using technology to trade optimize and product optimize across retailers. And so that work is ongoing, but those are 3 levers that we have."

But the second half gross margin outlook, right, the first half is down 230, the second half is up 80, and price/volume mix is a tailwind of what we think is 285 basis points. Inflation is a headwind of around 285 basis points.
We have incremental tariffs of the 35 basis points, which is a little bit better than it was in the first half because we had tariffs starting a year ago. We have productivity programs of around plus 85. The acquisition for largely ZICAM helps on margin by about 40 basis points, and then currency is a little bit of a drag. So that's how we get to plus 80 in the back half."

And then just connected to that, it sounded like pricing in laundry is going okay, early days, but you also have supply issues in household. And did it sound like it's mainly in areas where it's like components -- or could supply chain issues actually have an issue on getting pricing through in laundry if you start to experience some out of stocks?

The other question about raising price not just in laundry and litter but in other categories, which we have. So for example, NAIR, OXICLEAN stain fighters, baking soda -- we announced one variant of TROJAN condoms. WATERPIK will be raising price as well. So we've been able to -- we're announcing price increases in many categories. And keep in mind that we are the #1 brand in stain fighters, depilatories, water flossers, baking soda, et cetera. So we do have some strength and the ability to lead there.

Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of the Q3 results, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions.

And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions. 
But before we begin, I would like to recognize all Church & Dwight employees around the world for their continued dedication to keeping our company going, especially our supply chain and R&D teams as during this quarter, the company faced the complexities of widespread raw material and labor shortages at our suppliers and at our third-party manufacturers. 
Now let's talk about the results. Q3 was a solid quarter. Reported sales growth was 5.7%, organic sales growth grew 3.7% and exceeded our 1.5% Q3 outlook. The 3.7% organic growth rate in the quarter is impressive, considering the prior year Q3 2020 organic sales growth was 9.9%. So that's growth on top of growth. The adjusted EPS was $0.80, and that's $0.10 better than our outlook. We grew consumption in 12 of the 16 categories in which we compete, and in some cases, on top of big consumption gains last year. 
Regarding brand performance, 5 of our brands saw a double-digit consumption growth, and I'll name them for you: vitamins, ARM & HAMMER cat litter, Scent Boosters, BATISTE and ZICAM. And although many of our brands experienced double-digit consumption growth, it's not all reflected in our 3.7% organic sales growth as shipments were constrained by supply issues. 
In Q3, online sales as a percentage of total sales was 14.3%. Our online sales increased by 2% year-over-year. Now keep in mind, this is on top of 100% growth in e-commerce that we experienced in Q3 2020 versus 2019. And we continue to expect online sales for the full year to be above 15% as a percentage of total sales. 
Now as described in the release, Hurricane Ida's impact was substantial, which resulted in limited availability of raw materials and caused our fill levels to continue to be below normal. Labor shortages at suppliers and third-party manufacturers have constrained their ability to produce. Transportation challenges have further contributed to supply problems. 
Now the good news is that over the past 18 months, we have made our supply chain more resilient by qualifying dozens of new suppliers and co-packers, which provides, of course, both short-term and long-term benefits. And in a few minutes, Rick will tell you about our plans to expand capacity in 2022, with a significant increase in CapEx next year to support our growth plans. 
Now due to the lower than normal case fill rate, we pulled back on Q3 marketing compared to the prior year, and we expect the supply issues to begin to abate in the first half of 2022. Our biggest issue is wide widespread inflation. We're dealing with significant inflation of raw and packaging materials, labor, transportation and component costs which is compressing our gross margin. These conditions are expected to continue well into 2022, and Rick will cover gross margin in his remarks in a few minutes. 
On past earnings calls, we described how we expected categories to perform in 2021. Overall, our full year thinking is generally consistent. Just to name a few categories, demand for vitamins, laundry additives and cat litter has remained elevated in 2021. The condoms, dry shampoo and water flosser categories have recovered and are experiencing year-over-year growth as society opens up and consumers have greater mobility. Baking soda and oral analgesics have declined from COVID highs as expected. 
So now I'm going to talk about each business. First up is Consumer Domestic. So the Consumer Domestic business grew organic sales 2.8%, and this is on top of 10.7% organic growth in Q3 2020. Looking at market shares in Q3, 6 of our 13 power brands gained share, and our share results are clearly impacted by our supply issues. I will comment on a few of the brands right now. 
VITAFUSION gummy vitamins saw a huge consumption growth in Q3, up 24%. Consumers have made health and wellness a priority. It appears that the new consumers that came into the category are staying, because if we look at the last year, VITAFUSION household penetration is up almost 10%. BATISTE dry shampoo grew consumption 36% in the quarter and grew share to over 40%, first time that's happened. Dry shampoo is recovering as stores have reopened and consumers are becoming more mobile. Next up is WATERPIK. WATERPIK consumption declined in the quarter due to the year-over-year timing of a major online retailer sales event. But the good news is that WATERPIK continues to have strong consumption year-to-date and continues to benefit from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness. 
In Household Products, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry held share despite leading with price. ARM & HAMMER scent boosters continue to gain share, going the other way was unit dose share, which declined due to supply issues. The good news in unit dose is that we are now self-reliant with reliable in-house production. And also in household products, ARM & HAMMER cat litter grew consumption 11%, while gaining 50 basis points of market share. 
Next up is International. Despite disruptions due to COVID, our International business came through with 2.3% organic growth, primarily driven by strong growth in the Global Markets Group. Asia continues to be a strong growth engine for us. STERIMAR, FEMFRESH, VITAFUSION and L'il Critters led the growth for the International business. 
Now the next one is Specialty Products. Our Specialty Products business delivered a very strong quarter with 18.5% organic growth, but this was on an easy comp. The prior year quarterly organic growth for Specialty Products was actually down 3.4%. So 18.5% is a really nice rebound. And this was driven by both higher pricing and volume. Milk prices remained stable and demand is high for our nutritional supplements. 
Now let's talk about pricing. In response to the rising costs, we have already taken pricing actions in 50% of our portfolio, effective July 1 and October 1. The volume elasticities have been slightly better than expected since the July price increases. We will be announcing pricing actions effective Q1 2022 on an additional 30% of the portfolio. That means that as of Q1 2022, we expect to have raised price on approximately 80% of our global portfolio of brands. Due to our expectation of incremental cost increases, we continue to analyze additional pricing actions that can be put in place next year in 2022. 
Now let's turn to the outlook. Significant inflation of material and component costs and co-packer costs impacted our gross margin in Q3. Looking forward, we expect input costs and transportation costs to remain elevated in Q4 and we expect significant incremental cost increases in 2022. Our EPS expectations are unchanged. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 6% this year. It's important to remember that we are comping 15% EPS growth in 2020. 
We expect full year reported sales growth of 5.5%, with 4% full year organic sales growth. It's also important to call out that we are committed to maintaining the long-term health of our brands by ensuring a healthy level of marketing investment in Q4 and in 2022. As many of you know, we typically target 11% to 12% marketing spend. Q3 was 12.3%, and we expect Q4 to be approximately 13%.  
Just to wrap things up, October consumption continues to be strong. We're navigating through significant supply challenges and cost inflation. We expect our portfolio of brands to do well, both in good and bad times and in uncertain economic times such as now. We have a strong balance sheet, and we continue to hunt for TSR-accretive businesses. And next up is Rick to give you more details on Q3."

Third quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes the positive earnout adjustments, was $0.80, up 14.3% to prior year. We don't expect any further adjustments to the earnout. The $0.80 was better than our $0.70 outlook, primarily due to continued strong consumer demand and higher-than-expected sales as well as lower incentive comp and lower marketing spend as supply chain shortages were impacting customer fill rates. We also overcame a higher tax rate year-over-year. Reported revenue was up 5.7% and organic sales were up 3.7%. 
Matt covered the details of the top line. I'll jump right into gross margin. Our third quarter gross margin was 44.2%, a 130 basis point decrease from a year ago. This was below our previous outlook of expansion as we faced incremental pressure from the effect of Hurricane Ida on material costs and distribution. Gross margin was impacted by 500 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to commodities, distribution and labor. Tariff costs negatively impacted gross margin by an additional 40 basis points. These costs were partially offset by a positive 250 basis point impact from price/volume mix and a positive 120 basis point impact from productivity. 
Moving to marketing. Marketing was down $10 million year-over-year as we lowered spend to reduce demand until fill rates could recover. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was healthy at 12.3%. For SG&A, Q3 adjusted SG&A decreased to 180 basis points year-over-year with lower legal costs and lower incentive comp. Other expense all-in was $12.1 million, a slight decline due to lower interest expense from lower interest rates. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 20.4% compared to 17.3% in 2020, an increase of 310 basis points, primarily driven by lower stock option exercises. We continue to expect the full year rate to be 23%. 
And net of cash. For the first 9 months of 2021, cash from operating activities decreased 18% to $653 million due to higher cash earnings being offset by an increase in working capital. We continue to expect cash from operations to be approximately $950 million for the full year. As of September 30, cash on hand was $180 million. Our full year CapEx plan is now $120 million, down from the original $180 million in the outlook due to project timing. This CapEx moves out a year, and we now expect CapEx in 2022 to exceed $200 million. 
Future is bright as we continue to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins. On October 28, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program up to $1 billion. As you read in the release, this is a sign of our confidence in the company's future performance and the expectations of our robust cash flow generation. Our #1 priority for capital allocation remains acquisitions, and given our low leverage ratios, we have confidence to do both. Through October, we purchased approximately $130 million worth of shares. And in Q4, we will likely get ahead of our 2022 planned purchases as well. 
And now for the full year outlook. We now expect the full year 2021 reported sales growth to be approximately 5.5% and organic sales growth to be approximately 4%. Our consumption is strong and outpacing shipments. We expect our customer fill levels to improve throughout Q4. 
Turning to gross margin, we now expect full year gross margin to be down 170 basis points, previously down to 75 basis points. This represents an incremental impact from our last guidance due to broad-based inflation on raws and transportation costs. That was exacerbated by Hurricane Ida. 
In our prior outlook, we had discussed $125 million of higher cost versus our plan. That number today is $170 million, and the majority of that increase in the last 90 days related to transportation, labor, and other increases. As a reminder, we price to protect gross profit dollars, not necessarily margin. The $45 million movement versus our previous outlook is primarily noncommodity-related. Commodity spot pricing today is elevated compared to spot pricing just 3 months ago. 
And now for the full year. We expect adjusted EPS to be 6%. Our brands continue to go from strength to strength as strong consumption and organic sales growth lap almost 10% organic growth a year ago. And while inflation is broad based, we have taken pricing actions to mitigate, which gives us confidence over the long term. For our Q4 outlook, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 3%. We expect organic sales growth of approximately 2% due to the supply chain constraints and our SPD business to return to a more normal growth rate. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.61 per share, up 15% from last year's adjusted EPS. 
And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions."

Our goal is to offset cost increases dollar for dollar with our price increases. And the 2022 plan at this time of the year is a work in process. And we have -- we expect to have, like I said, significant incremental cost increases year-over-year, '22 versus '21. If you look at what's happened so far, in April, we priced up 30%, and that was primarily laundry, and that was high single digits. And in July, there's another 20%. This is litter, additives, baking soda, flossers and showerheads. And that was mid- to high single digits. And today, we're saying another 30%, but that's largely personal care. And that will be mid- to high single digits as well. 
But as one of my friends likes to say is everyone is chasing a ball downhill. And so costs have continued to escalate, even since the April announcement and the July announcements. So we're going to be revisiting all the -- our '21 pricing decisions next year. And Rick could probably give you a little bit of color on maybe a couple of things that are causing the incremental cost increases. But that's probably as far as we would go on '22. But Rick, do you want to add anything to that?"

Just to kind of triangulate what we're seeing. I would tell you that in our July outlook, if we looked at our Q4 forecast, for example, and you look at the gross margin bridge or even the dollars, we were seeing that inflation was largely going to be offset by price. Fast forward 3 months and the gap is a couple of hundred basis points. And so that's why we're -- as Matt said, revisiting pricing. That's why we're doing more pricing for other parts of the portfolio. 
We are going to -- I think it's a no-brainer at this point in time, we are going to assume spot pricing as we move into 2022 for a large part of it that we're at right now. We're going to assume transportation tightness. The good thing for us, though, is as our fill levels improve, that tightness, the efficiency improves, right? There's still macro tightness, but the efficiency of our trucks improved. And we're going to assume labor is still elevated. But we're going to do as best we can to mitigate as much as that, and we'll give you our outlook in January."

But going the other way is inflation, right? So one headline is the $4 for a gallon of gasoline. 
But as far as the willingness to buy new products and for demand to stay strong, the stimulus has ended. I do think household balance sheets are going to be strong -- are strong at the moment. And likely, we'll sustain strong demand for a couple of quarters, although visibility is poor beyond a quarter or 2, as we all know. But we got a good lineup for 2021.

So as we look into '22, knowing pricing continues to build but in the interim, right, there's -- I'm guessing there's less ability to control the SG&A line, if that's fair, right, given what you have lots of flexibility in marketing, you put so much money to work during 2020, there's a lot of flexibility.

So rightfully conclusion that you had, Lauren, SG&A will be higher next year as we get back and hopefully hit a plan with all the levers that we typically do.

I'll begin with a review of the Q3 results, and then I'll turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO. And when Rick is done, we'll open up the call for questions.
But before we begin, I would like to recognize all Church & Dwight employees around the world for their continued dedication to keeping our company going, especially our supply chain and R&D teams as during this quarter, the company faced the complexities of widespread raw material and labor shortages at our suppliers and at our third-party manufacturers.
Now let's talk about the results. Q3 was a solid quarter. Reported sales growth was 5.7%, organic sales growth grew 3.7% and exceeded our 1.5% Q3 outlook. The 3.7% organic growth rate in the quarter is impressive, considering the prior year Q3 2020 organic sales growth was 9.9%. So that's growth on top of growth. The adjusted EPS was $0.80, and that's $0.10 better than our outlook. We grew consumption in 12 of the 16 categories in which we compete, and in some cases, on top of big consumption gains last year.
Regarding brand performance, 5 of our brands saw a double-digit consumption growth, and I'll name them for you: vitamins, ARM & HAMMER cat litter, Scent Boosters, BATISTE and ZICAM. And although many of our brands experienced double-digit consumption growth, it's not all reflected in our 3.7% organic sales growth as shipments were constrained by supply issues.
In Q3, online sales as a percentage of total sales was 14.3%. Our online sales increased by 2% year-over-year. Now keep in mind, this is on top of 100% growth in e-commerce that we experienced in Q3 2020 versus 2019. And we continue to expect online sales for the full year to be above 15% as a percentage of total sales.
Now as described in the release, Hurricane Ida's impact was substantial, which resulted in limited availability of raw materials and caused our fill levels to continue to be below normal. Labor shortages at suppliers and third-party manufacturers have constrained their ability to produce. Transportation challenges have further contributed to supply problems.
Now the good news is that over the past 18 months, we have made our supply chain more resilient by qualifying dozens of new suppliers and co-packers, which provides, of course, both short-term and long-term benefits. And in a few minutes, Rick will tell you about our plans to expand capacity in 2022, with a significant increase in CapEx next year to support our growth plans.
Now due to the lower than normal case fill rate, we pulled back on Q3 marketing compared to the prior year, and we expect the supply issues to begin to abate in the first half of 2022. Our biggest issue is widespread inflation. We're dealing with significant inflation of raw and packaging materials, labor, transportation and component costs which is compressing our gross margin. These conditions are expected to continue well into 2022, and Rick will cover gross margin in his remarks in a few minutes.
On past earnings calls, we described how we expected categories to perform in 2021. Overall, our full year thinking is generally consistent. Just to name a few categories, demand for vitamins, laundry additives and cat litter has remained elevated in 2021. The condoms, dry shampoo and water flosser categories have recovered and are experiencing year-over-year growth as society opens up and consumers have greater mobility. Baking soda and oral analgesics have declined from COVID highs as expected.
So now I'm going to talk about each business. First up is Consumer Domestic. So the Consumer Domestic business grew organic sales 2.8%, and this is on top of 10.7% organic growth in Q3 2020. Looking at market shares in Q3, 6 of our 13 power brands gained share, and our share results are clearly impacted by our supply issues. I will comment on a few of the brands right now.
Vitafusion gummy vitamins saw a huge consumption growth in Q3, up 24%. Consumers have made health and wellness a priority. It appears that the new consumers that came into the category are staying, because if we look at the last year, Vitafusion household penetration is up almost 10%. Batiste dry shampoo grew consumption 36% in the quarter and grew share to over 40%, first time that's happened. Dry shampoo is recovering as stores have reopened and consumers are becoming more mobile. Next up is Waterpik. Waterpik consumption declined in the quarter due to the year-over-year timing of a major online retailer sales event. But the good news is that Waterpik continues to have strong consumption year-to-date and continues to benefit from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness.
In Household Products, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry held share despite leading with price. ARM & HAMMER scent boosters continue to gain share, going the other way was unit dose share, which declined due to supply issues. The good news in unit dose is that we are now self-reliant with reliable in-house production. And also in household products, ARM & HAMMER cat litter grew consumption 11%, while gaining 50 basis points of market share.
Next up is International. Despite disruptions due to COVID, our International business came through with 2.3% organic growth, primarily driven by strong growth in the Global Markets Group. Asia continues to be a strong growth engine for us. STERIMAR, FEMFRESH, Vitafusion and L'il Critters led the growth for the International business.
Now the next one is Specialty Products. Our Specialty Products business delivered a very strong quarter with 18.5% organic growth, but this was on an easy comp. The prior year quarterly organic growth for Specialty Products was actually down 3.4%. So 18.5% is a really nice rebound. And this was driven by both higher pricing and volume. Milk prices remained stable and demand is high for our nutritional supplements.
Now let's talk about pricing. In response to the rising costs, we have already taken pricing actions in 50% of our portfolio, effective July 1 and October 1. The volume elasticities have been slightly better than expected since the July price increases. We will be announcing pricing actions effective Q1 2022 on an additional 30% of the portfolio. That means that as of Q1 2022, we expect to have raised price on approximately 80% of our global portfolio of brands. Due to our expectation of incremental cost increases, we continue to analyze additional pricing actions that can be put in place next year in 2022.
Now let's turn to the outlook. Significant inflation of material and component costs and co-packer costs impacted our gross margin in Q3. Looking forward, we expect input costs and transportation costs to remain elevated in Q4 and we expect significant incremental cost increases in 2022. Our EPS expectations are unchanged. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 6% this year. It's important to remember that we are comping 15% EPS growth in 2020.
We expect full year reported sales growth of 5.5%, with 4% full year organic sales growth. It's also important to call out that we are committed to maintaining the long-term health of our brands by ensuring a healthy level of marketing investment in Q4 and in 2022. As many of you know, we typically target 11% to 12% marketing spend. Q3 was 12.3%, and we expect Q4 to be approximately 13%.
Just to wrap things up, October consumption continues to be strong. We're navigating through significant supply challenges and cost inflation. We expect our portfolio of brands to do well, both in good and bad times and in uncertain economic times such as now. We have a strong balance sheet, and we continue to hunt for TSR-accretive businesses. And next up is Rick to give you more details on Q3."

Third quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes the positive earnout adjustments, was $0.80, up 14.3% to prior year. We don't expect any further adjustments to the earnout. The $0.80 was better than our $0.70 outlook, primarily due to continued strong consumer demand and higher-than-expected sales as well as lower incentive comp and lower marketing spend as supply chain shortages were impacting customer fill rates. We also overcame a higher tax rate year-over-year. Reported revenue was up 5.7% and organic sales were up 3.7%.
Matt covered the details of the top line. I'll jump right into gross margin. Our third quarter gross margin was 44.2%, a 130 basis point decrease from a year ago. This was below our previous outlook of expansion as we faced incremental pressure from the effect of Hurricane Ida on material costs and distribution. Gross margin was impacted by 500 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to commodities, distribution and labor. Tariff costs negatively impacted gross margin by an additional 40 basis points. These costs were partially offset by a positive 250 basis point impact from price/volume mix and a positive 120 basis point impact from productivity.
Moving to marketing. Marketing was down $10 million year-over-year as we lowered spend to reduce demand until fill rates could recover. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was healthy at 12.3%. For SG&A, Q3 adjusted SG&A decreased to 180 basis points year-over-year with lower legal costs and lower incentive comp. Other expense all-in was $12.1 million, a slight decline due to lower interest expense from lower interest rates. And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 20.4% compared to 17.3% in 2020, an increase of 310 basis points, primarily driven by lower stock option exercises. We continue to expect the full year rate to be 23%.
And net of cash. For the first 9 months of 2021, cash from operating activities decreased 18% to $653 million due to higher cash earnings being offset by an increase in working capital. We continue to expect cash from operations to be approximately $950 million for the full year. As of September 30, cash on hand was $180 million. Our full year CapEx plan is now $120 million, down from the original $180 million in the outlook due to project timing. This CapEx moves out a year, and we now expect CapEx in 2022 to exceed $200 million.
Future is bright as we continue to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins. On October 28, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program up to $1 billion. As you read in the release, this is a sign of our confidence in the company's future performance and the expectations of our robust cash flow generation. Our #1 priority for capital allocation remains acquisitions, and given our low leverage ratios, we have confidence to do both. Through October, we purchased approximately $130 million worth of shares. And in Q4, we will likely get ahead of our 2022 planned purchases as well.
And now for the full year outlook. We now expect the full year 2021 reported sales growth to be approximately 5.5% and organic sales growth to be approximately 4%. Our consumption is strong and outpacing shipments. We expect our customer fill levels to improve throughout Q4.
Turning to gross margin, we now expect full year gross margin to be down 170 basis points, previously down to 75 basis points. This represents an incremental impact from our last guidance due to broad-based inflation on raw costs and transportation costs. That was exacerbated by Hurricane Ida.
In our prior outlook, we had discussed $125 million of higher cost versus our plan. That number today is $170 million, and the majority of that increase in the last 90 days relate to transportation, labor, and other increases. As a reminder, we price to protect gross profit dollars, not necessarily margin. The $45 million movement versus our previous outlook is primarily noncommodity-related. Commodity spot pricing today is elevated compared to spot pricing just 3 months ago.
And now for the full year. We expect adjusted EPS to be 6%. Our brands continue to go from strength to strength as strong consumption and organic sales growth lap almost 10% organic growth a year ago. And while inflation is broad based, we have taken pricing actions to mitigate, which gives us confidence over the long term. For our Q4 outlook, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 3%. We expect organic sales growth of approximately 2% due to the supply chain constraints and our SPD business to return to a more normal growth rate. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.61 per share, up 15% from last year's adjusted EPS.
And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions."

Our goal is to offset cost increases dollar for dollar with our price increases. And the 2022 plan at this time of the year is a work in process. And we have -- we expect to have, like I said, significant incremental cost increases year-over-year, '22 versus '21. If you look at what's happened so far, in April, we priced up 30%, and that was primarily laundry, and that was high single digits. And in July, there's another 20%. This is litter, additives, baking soda, flossers and showerheads. And that was mid- to high single digits. And today, we're saying another 30%, but that's largely personal care. And that will be mid- to high single digits as well.
But as one of my friends likes to say is everyone is chasing a ball downhill. And so costs have continued to escalate, even since the April announcement and the July announcements. So we're going to be revisiting all of the -- our 2021 pricing decisions next year. And Rick could probably give you a little bit of color on maybe a couple of things that are causing the incremental cost increases. But that's probably as far as we would go on '22. But Rick, do you want to add anything to that?"

Just to kind of triangulate what we're seeing.

Fast forward 3 months and the gap is a couple of hundred basis points. And so that's why we're -- as Matt said, revisiting pricing. That's why we're doing more pricing for other parts of the portfolio.
We are going to -- I think it's a no-brainer at this point in time, we are going to assume spot pricing as we move into 2022 for a large part of it that we're at right now. We're going to assume transportation tightness. Now, the good thing for us, though, is as our fill levels improve, that tightness, the efficiency improves, right? There's still macro tightness, but the efficiency of our trucks improved. And we're going to assume labor is still elevated. But we're going to do as best we can to mitigate as much as that, and we'll give you our outlook in January."

As of right now, hedges are very expensive. So we actually lean towards a lot of the spot market as of right now. The volatility in the market in 2021 has, I think, made the banks less likely to offer up any reasonable hedges after 2022. So that's a quick overview of the hedging."

I guess my question is, you're seeing supply shortages and pulling back on marketing. So we're about to flip as we go to the first of the year, I mean typically, you roll out a lot of new products in 1Q and step up marketing in 2Q. And at the same point, you've said you're not sure or you don't believe the things will be back to normal in terms of supply chain until sometime in the first half. So I guess, does it change?
One, what gives you confidence that things improve in the first half? And two, does it change your cadence of kind of rolling out new products and marketing behind those and stuff like that? Or is everything normal at this point?"

So that's a good thing because we're leaving money on the table, because we haven't been able to meet customer owners right now.
So as far as marketing goes, typically, Q1 is our lowest quarter for marketing. So you wouldn't expect a pickup in marketing spend in Q1. And it's oftentimes around 9%, 10%. But you're right, we do -- new products do start hitting shelves in March, April. So Q2 is often the month when we -- of the quarter, when we start amping up the marketing.

And the other half is we're being conservative on the fill rates. As they continue to improve, but we're still assuming they're in the low 80s. And then we said in the first half of 2022, it gets back to normal. So I would just say it's probably conservatism. If great unbelievable consumption demand continues, like we just saw in Q3 or earlier, then when you have a bigger number times 80% fill rate, then that's when you kind of overdeliver on the quarter, and that's what happened for us in Q3, we outdelivered because of consumer domestic.

Maybe in that regard, I'll keep it a bit more medium, longer term. I guess there's this dynamic with the Church & Dwight portfolio, where there's a piece that's valued as a piece that's premium. This offers the flexibility to respond to different economic environments. But we're clearly in this period where demand elasticities are basically nonexistent. So I mean, in theory, maybe that means the value end of your portfolio offers relative less value than typically it would. I mean, does that give you more credence to close price gaps to get more aggressive on price gaps? I guess I'm thinking about this 80% of your portfolio is going be pricing in Q1, but you may have to look at more pricing, maybe expand pricing. Maybe you raised pricing. I'm not sure. 
But I guess it's a bit theoretical because it's almost like how long this demand elasticity environment lasts, I don't know. I don't think anyone does, but maybe just how you see your relative positioning on shelf but in the context of this value versus premium mix in your portfolio?"
