I hope you enjoy the opening video. We will all always remember 2020. And while we'll never recall the year with anything close to fondness, at Tractor Supply, 2020 will be remembered with a small measure of pride as we reflect on our efforts to take care of our fellow team members, support our customers and invest in the future. 
None of these results would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our team, and I want to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to the more than 42,000 Tractor Supply team members for how they have lived our mission values and work together to take care of each other and our customers. My thanks also go out to our supply chain and vendor partners, who've done an excellent job supporting our business. The environment continues to be uncertain and challenging. Vaccines are on the rise, but our country is still very much in the midst of a pandemic. Given the pace of the vaccine rollout, it will be at least fall before we're back to some form of normality. Throughout the pandemic, our utmost priority has been to take care of the health and safety and well-being of our team members and customers. We spent tens of millions of dollars on cleaning and mask, plexiglass and sanitizer. We provided almost 700,000 hours of COVID sick pay. We have conducted nearly 20,000 COVID tests. And we rolled out company-wide a contact tracing wearable devices for all team members to use. We will continue to spare no expense in this area in 2021. In addition to rolling out industry-leading safety protocols, we've also shown our commitment to our team members through appreciation bonuses, increased wages and broader benefits offerings. 
At Tractor Supply, we are committed to being a part of the solution for our team members, our customers and our communities, and we remain steadfast in that commitment going forward. As we talk now shifting and talking about 2021, we believe there is as much uncertainty this year as there was in 2020. How fast will vaccines roll out? How are the derivatives of COVID impact transmission rates and antibody effectiveness? Will there be another stimulus? How will consumer spending evolve through the year? 
Given these questions and there are all the other elements of uncertainty, we're planning for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes. The initial guidance we're providing today is consistent with our long-term algorithm, that we shared with you at our enhanced earnings event in October. Importantly, our 2021 outlook reflects the strategic initiatives that are foundational to our life out here strategy. With the actions we're taking, we are committed to emerging from the pandemic stronger than before. 
Now let's shift to the business review section for the fourth quarter of 2020 in the fiscal year. We delivered another strong quarter that exceeded our expectations. In the fourth quarter, we had strong net sales gains of 31.3%, with comparable store sales up 27.3%. We continue to gain market share and benefited from customer shopping with us with larger baskets. All customer segments and all value segments experienced growth. For the fiscal year, we added over $2 billion in revenue, and we reached over $10 billion in sales for the year, a significant milestone for the company. Once again, our quarterly results were remarkably consistent across all periods of the quarter across all product categories, across all geographic regions of the country. Also, both our transactions and ticket growth we're seeing and were very balanced. For the third quarter, e-commerce saw strong triple-digit growth and increased significantly as a percentage of our overall sales. 
The work we did this year to improve our omnichannel capabilities has certainly resonated with our customers as we've seen several years of digital adoption accelerate in just a matter of months. For the year, about 75% of our omnichannel sales were picked up at a Tractor Supply store, further reinforcing the importance of our stores to our customers. As we have experienced in the last several quarters, we continue to have strong performance and market share gains in our consumable, usable and edible categories, with growth exceeding 20% for the quarter. 
In 2020, we had more customers shop with us than ever before, with increased sales across our existing customer groups, new customers and reacquired customers. Now shifting to talk about a few other operational highlights for 2020. We added more than 10,000 team members to support the growth of our business. These new team members were critical in our ability to service our customers at these elevated levels and also flow volumes through our supply chain. We pivoted our marketing spending for more traditional print media, digital and national TV. We launched our first national advertising campaign in over a decade. Our research indicates that Tractor Supply has become more top of mind with consumers as our unaided brand awareness increased over 800 basis points. We expanded our in-store and digital capabilities to make it easier and safer to shop at Tractor Supply. We were nimble and agile in offering curbside pickup and same-day next-day delivery. We also relaunched our website, and we rolled out a new mobile app, which already has over 1 million downloads. We celebrated the opening of our 1,900 store in Oakhurst, California and announced plans for a new distribution center in Navara, Ohio, that is expected to be operational by the fall of 2022. We reinforced our long-standing commitment to ESG through improved disclosure and transparency. We also surpassed our original target of a 25% reduction in carbon emissions, 5 years ahead of plan. We just step back, overall, 2020 really highlighted the resiliency of the Tractor Supply team and illuminated the potential for the business. We participate in a large, attractive market. We have momentum. We're investing in our business through our life out here strategy. We have the opportunity to create and define our future and extend our leadership for years to come. 
Before I hand the call over to Kurt, I'd like to address the impairment charge we took for the Petsense business. We recently completed a strategic review of Petsense. Although Petsense had solid sales performance in 2020, we reached the conclusion to reduce the number of new store openings planned over the long-term and identified some underperforming stores to close. We expect to close 10 to 15 stores in 2021. Combined, this resulted in a pretax charge of about $74.1 million or $0.49 per diluted share after tax. Petsense offers a differentiated shopping experience to the suburban and rural pet owner. As mentioned, the business is currently doing well overall. We remain committed to growing and investing Petsense. Earlier this week, we named Matthew Ruben as SVP and General Manager for Petsense. Matthew brings a strong retail background, and I'm confident that he'll be an immediate asset to the business. I look forward to sharing more about our plans with you over time. 
Now Kurt will walk you through greater details of the quarter and the year, along with our 2021 outlook before I return to give you an update on our life out her strategy."

This year was like no other in the history of Tractor Supply as we delivered record sales and financial performance for the year. The fourth quarter continued to benefit from the macro trends that have worked to our favor. As we rank order our comparable store sales performance, the trends that I shared with you in the second and third quarter continue to play out in our sales performance. The largest driver continued to be our customers' desire for product categories that support their out here lifestyle as they shifted spending away from travel, entertainment and dining to creating their own experiences. 
For Tractor Supply, this included purchases such as outdoor recreation and living, like UTVs and outdoor Fire pits along with all those indoor projects and winterizing their homes and equipment. This trend also includes living a more self reliant lifestyle. The adoption of new hobbies like backyard poultry, hunting, gardening and bird had continued. And we believe these hobbies and trends are becoming more ingrained in our customers' behavior. The strong brand awareness and new customer performance that Hal discussed was the second largest driver of our comparable store sales performance. This was then followed by tailwinds such as emergency response related demand due to the hurricane activity and various strategic initiatives, such as our investments in digital and the omnichannel experience same-day delivery and our private label credit card. 
Exclusive of the modest hurricane activity benefit, the weather impact was generally neutral compared to the prior year. We had robust performance in our big ticket categories, which exceeded our overall comp sales growth. This was driven by broad-based strength. With safe, recreational vehicles, utility vehicles, trailers and generators representing the top 5 product categories. Fourth quarter gross profit exceeded our expectations due to higher demand for our products and a reduction in promotional and clearance activities. These factors were partially offset by higher transportation costs as a percentage of net sales. The result was that gross margin as a percentage of sales was 34.6% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 75 basis points. 
Moving on to SG&A. The 46 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A as a percent of net sales was attributable to 3 primary factors: first, incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic; second, increased incentive compensation due to record sales and profit performance in the quarter; and then third, investments in our strategic initiatives. The additional costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic included appreciation bonuses to team members across stores and distribution centers as well as additional labor hours and supply cost dedicated to cleaning and sanitation to enhance the health and safety of team members and our customers. COVID-19 related incremental costs were approximately $33 million in the quarter, and that compares to our estimate of $15 million to $20 million going into the quarter, which resulted from an unexpected resurgence of COVID-19 cases late in the year. 
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased nearly 36% with operating profit margin of 9%, an improvement of 29 basis points. Adjusted net income was $193.2 million, an increase of 34%. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.64, an increase of nearly 36%. For the year, we reached an adjusted operating profit margin of 10.1% and had strong growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 47.4%. 
Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong, merchandise inventories were $1.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, representing an increase of 5.6% in average inventory per store. This level of inventory is still a bit lighter than we would like. Given the momentum of the business, and we are working with our suppliers and vendors to build our stock to support this momentum. During the quarter, we issued our first ever public offering of debt, and we received investment-grade ratings from both MOODY'S and S&P given our strong credit metrics. We issued $650 million in 10-year notes at a coupon rate of 1.75%. The proceeds from the debt issues were used for refinancing and repayment of term loans as we plan to maintain a leverage ratio below 2.5x. 
Fiscal 2020 was a year of strong cash flow from operations, which totaled $1.39 billion, an increase of $582 million or 72%. For the full year, we returned a total of $518 million in capital to our shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. We currently have approximately $1.1 billion remaining on our authorization for share repurchases. Today, our Board reconfirmed our commitment to returning cash to shareholders through a 30% increase in our quarterly dividend, which puts our dividend payments in line with our target of at least a 30% payout ratio. 
Moving now to our guidance for 2021 that is detailed on Page 11 of the supplemental deck. The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results remains uncertain. Given that backdrop, we are planning our for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes. To date, while still very early in the first quarter, we continue to see strong sales momentum in the business. For fiscal 2021, we expect net sales in the range of $10.7 billion to $11 billion. Comp store sales are anticipated to be in the range of down 2% to up 1%. 
For the year, we anticipate operating profit margin to be in the range of 9.3% to 9.6%, a significant step-up when compared to our baseline 2019 performance. In fiscal 2020, approximately 90% of the operating margin year-over-year gain was driven by gross margin improvement. For fiscal 2021, we anticipate some giveback in gross margin and SG&A to slightly increase as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2020 on an adjusted basis. 
Now let's go into a little more detail on each of these areas. Our expectation is for modest gross margin contraction in 2021 as we anticipate incremental promotional activity, along with higher freight costs. Partially offsetting these pressures are an expected benefit from vendor funding for our field activity support team program while the fast program expenses will be reported in SG&A with a year-over-year impact of about 40 basis points on each. 
Breaking down SG&A. The leverage from reduced COVID-19 costs and more normalized incentive compensation is expected to be offset by ongoing wage pressures, investments in our supply chain and digital space and higher depreciation and amortization expense. And as a reminder, the FAST program costs are reported in SG&A. As a result, we are forecasting SG&A as a percent of sales to slightly deleverage. Adjusted for normalization of the FAST program costs, SG&A is expected to remain relatively flat as a percent of sales. As always, we would encourage you to think about our business between the first half of the year and the second half as this is in line with how we manage the business. 
As you model 2021, I want to point out a few items that will impact comparability. Appreciation bonuses impact the second and fourth quarters of 2020, while wage increases of about $13 million per quarter took effect in the third quarter of 2020. Costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain an uncertainty for us in 2020 as our utmost priority remains the health and safety of our team members and our customers. For the first quarter, we anticipate costs related to the pandemic will continue at elevated levels. Additionally, as you think about the cadence of 2021, our business performance is expected to be stronger in the first quarter, as our comparisons step up starting in the second quarter. The first quarter of 2021 is forecast to have the highest comp performance of the year and correspondingly the highest operating profit growth rate. The second quarter is likely to be our most difficult earnings comparison of the year due to a couple of factors. Please recall the second quarter of 2020 experienced the strongest gross margin performance, driven by the least sales promotional activity. 
In addition, we expect incremental cost in Q2 of this year as we support the launch of an upgrade to our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. Moving to below the line. We expect total interest expense for 2021 to be approximately $27 million while our effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 22.5% to 22.8%. Our capital spending is anticipated to range from $450 million to $550 million with more than 80% of that spending going towards growth initiatives. The vast majority of the capital spending increase is attributable to new in-store initiatives and supporting technology for our Life Out Here strategy. Depreciation expense is estimated to increase approximately $50 million. This is above our recent run rate as we accelerate our investments in the business. 
For the year, we expect share repurchases to reduce our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by about 1% to 2%. For modeling purposes, we've assumed weighted average shares outstanding of about 116 million shares in 2021. Net income is forecast in the range of $750 million to $800 million or $6.50 to $6.90 per diluted share. With our strong performance in 2020 and the critical momentum in our business, the team at Tractor Supply is excited about the Life Out Here strategy. Our clear focus enables us to continue to be the innovation leader in our channel and emerge from the pandemic stronger than before. 
Now I'll turn it back to Hal."

Second is nurt",1146,"Thanks, Kurt. So now let's shift into 2021. As Kurt said, we're laser focused, and we're focused on continuing to gain market share. We're going to do this in 3 different ways. One is capitalizing on our numerous macro trends benefiting us. Second is nurturing our existing new and reengaged customers and the third is executing our Life Out Here strategy. So let's talk about each one of those in a little more detail. 
We believe that many of the consumer behaviors that we've seen over the last 9 months will continue through most or all of 2021. These trends we've mentioned before, but they include rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption, self reliant lifestyle movement, consumer spending that's shifting from travel and entertainment to home and land and an all-time high pet ownership. We exited the year with nearly 19 million Neighbor's Club members. For the full year, over 11 million new identified customers and more than 6 million reactivated customers shop with us at Tractor Supply. We're seeing strong retention with these customers, and we have plans in place to engage them with new capabilities, marketing and product offerings. 
The third way we're going to be focused on gaining share this year is our Life Out Here strategy, and it really positions us to strengthen and transform the company. As we shared last quarter, there are 5 pillars to our Life Out Here strategy. The first is the liver legendary customer service, second is advance our ONETractor capabilities, the third is to operate the tractor way, the fourth is go to country model for our team, and lastly, it's generate healthy shareholder return. 
So let me highlight some of our planned efforts that we have this year in support of our strategy. In 2021, we plan to open 80 new tractor supply stores and 10 Petsense stores. Additionally, we plan to remodel 150 to 200 stores with Project Fusion, and to execute Project Side Lot in 150 to 200 of our stores. That brings our total construction activity for the year to 400 to 500 projects. This is a significant step-up in the team's workload and also is being executed in the midst of COVID. Our Project Fusion remodel program is designed to drive space productivity and to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base. It is a combination of both changes in the store layout and imagery that creates a greater lifestyle impression and drive space allocation for product assortment. Fusion stores help create a more welcoming destination and offer compelling showcase for our brands. Our Side Lot program is a full transformation of the space from primarily a storage location for agriculture equipment to a state of the art outside garden feed and farm shopping center. That also provides for greater convenience through the expansion of buy online pick up at store. 
While still very early with both of these projects, we continue to be very excited about the sales trends we're seeing from the first tranche of fusion remodels and side lot transformation projects. And importantly, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Given the size of the store -- of our store base, these initiatives represent a multiyear opportunity to continually refresh our store base and drive further comp sales. Another initiative we have is our fast team. And they are already having a significant impact on the business. Since their implementation in August, they've taken on execution programs like executing merchandising programs like Center Court, End Caps, planogram resets, seasonal programs and sales driving initiatives. And what this is doing is it's really allowing our store teams to focus more on customer service and improve their in-store execution and then really ultimately allow us to focus more on the customer and driving comparable sales. And we're very pleased with the fast rollout. We're also committed to ensuring our digital capabilities stay ahead of our customer expectations. 
We did this in 2020, and we'll continue to do this in 2021 and beyond. Big areas of focus for us in the first half are shipped from store, search engine optimization, payment options like Apple Pay and Google Pay, subscriptions, both online and in-store and also the recent launch of our Pet Rx platform. As Kurt mentioned, we have plans in place for an upgrade in our Neighbor's club loyalty program by midyear. And we anticipate that this new program will really drive incremental customer retention and also provides strong incentive to allow us to grow our share of wallet with our customers. As we get closer to the launch of our new Neighbor's club program, I look forward to sharing more of the details about the changes with you. 
Now just stepping back, we're excited about spring. We believe our customers will continue to be focused on their homes as their oasis and creating their own experiences whether that's through things like gardening, grilling or home setting with their family and friends and neighbors. Spring chick days create great retail theater and support existing and new customers who want to expand their flocks. This was a big category for us last year, and we expect it to be so this year. And we will have a broader selection than we have historically of chicken coops. Tractor Supply is the clear destination for this on trend category. Given the strong trends we're seeing in our companion animal categories and the recent growth in pet ownership, we're focused on being a more complete resource for pet parents. In store, this includes relevant product assortment and brands, expansion of self-serve pet wash locations across 150 to 200 stores and the build-out of 50 to 75 additional pet wellness centers. Currently, about 1,600 stores have vet services in-store through our mobile vet clinics. Starting this quarter, pet prescriptions can be fulfilled online at Tractor Supply, as I mentioned earlier. In our app, we're now offering on demand veterinary advice from a team of experienced veterinary professionals. Our customers can call, chat or e-mail a team of veterinary professionals to get all their pet health questions answered. These expanded and new services allow tractor supply to offer a complete solution to care for our customers, pets, whether in-store or online. 
Our stores will be ready for the change of seasons as we move into spring. In closing, we have a unique opportunity. We compete in an attractive and fragmented market. We have a track record of success and outperformance in our business. We see a unique opportunity to capitalize on the powerful customer trends we are benefiting from and to emerge from the pandemic, stronger transform company. Our goal is to make strategic investments that enable us to create greater competitive advantage, capture the opportunity we've discussed and generate shareholder value. 
With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions."

I think the guidance that we provided is very consistent with the commentary that we had at the end of the third quarter. And I think aligned with the spirit of the dialogue in our opening remarks, which is that we expect COVID to remain a large kind of consumer driving force for the foreseeable future, certainly into the fall, if not for the balance of the year. And as a consequence of that, many of the macro trends, which have benefited us will continue. We also think a number of these macro trends are sticky irregardless of COVID. And so we kind of see those 2 coming together in a way that shapes the year as follows. The first quarter we're in now, we expect momentum in this quarter and our results in this quarter will be much like what we saw in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 with elevated sales levels. And then as we start to comp on top of those in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 this year, we do expect that the comps will start to turn to more normal levels. And the collectiveness of that will kind of compile guided between minus 2% and plus 1%. So it is a heavily weighted in the first quarter with kind of Q2, Q3, Q4, recognizing it will be comping on top of last year's elevated levels. But with still likely strong underlying momentum supporting those quarters."

We're certainly looking to piece apart our various initiatives, and we have some pretty sophisticated analytics tools that allow us to do that at these more elevated volume levels, it is a little bit harder to see than what you might see in a normal mid single-digit comp environment. But I will say that we're -- it's our view that we are gaining share and winning in all the categories that we participate in. And that's really consistent across the board, whether you're looking at industry level data or we're talking with vendors. And so that would lead us to believe that not only are we benefiting from the macro trends, but the work that we're doing to support the business is also helping with that. And I'll call out a few things that kind of give us that give us that sense. 
First off, I'll point to kind of some data sets around our customer. Our unaided brand awareness due -- in part, due to our national television campaign that we launched last March is up 8 points in the year. That's a very significant improvement in unaided brand awareness. And then the benefit that we've seen of that is a -- the most customers that we've ever had shop our store in 1 year last year, including 11 million new customers and 6 million reacquired customers. And those customers are shopping with us at repeat rates that are at kind of all-time highs. And those repeat shopping rates are for the new customers are holding -- have held through the year. So whether it was a new customer we saw in March or April or May, or a new customer that we saw in October, November, December, all those repeat shopping rates are holding at all-time highs. And then last thing I'll talk about is, if you look at our team members and you look like our customer SAT scores, our -- if you look at the customers' perception of safety and health and well-being in our stores, customers seem to be voting with their wallets and shopping and Tractor Supply, indicative of both our strong transactions, but also our strong ticket. And I think that would speak to the fact that customers are certainly aggregating their ticket. You're hearing that from other retailers, more units per basket driving basket up, but a lot of these retailers are talking about negative comp transactions. With us, it's very balanced with about half coming from comp transactions and about half coming from average ticket. So we're seeing that stock up, but we're also seeing more transactions in the store. So it's hard to kind of piece it together, but we do think the initiatives we're taking, the support we've given the business on inventory and adding staffing, our focus on cleanliness, plus our digital efforts and our early efforts around fusion and sidelight and fast are adding to the share -- creating -- helping us drive share gains and kind of add it to the macro trends we're seeing."

The business -- the net takeaway is where the business is doing well. But if you look at the broader landscape of pets and where the shifts are coming, where things are growing, and you look at the -- kind of what's playing out in specialty, through that work and then us revisiting our real estate model as a part of that, we made the decision to reduce the long-term store count expectations that we have for that business. And in doing so, that led us to revisit the value that we had on that business on our balance sheet. And so we've now kind of reset our expectations for the new store counts of that business. We've hired a new leader for the Petsense business. And we are -- we will continue to invest in Petsense as we see opportunities. And it's -- as I said, the business is doing well. We do think it's gaining share in the specialty space. And we will continue to support that business and moving forward just at a lower long-term store count target."

And really, the question, as I understand it, is about the outlook on the operating margin, the flow-through going forward. One important thing that I pointed out in our prepared remarks is we had tremendous upside and benefit in 2020 from the gross margin side of the business. And the principal drivers with that was for the majority of the year, we had favorable transportation. And the most significant was unusually of low levels of promotion and clearance. I mean the inventory, at some point, really felt like it was going hand to mouth to the consumer. And we anticipate this year in 2021, as we still have some of that extended pandemic demand before we start to cycle into that that there's benefit on less promotion and clearance. We'll start to normalize on that. The important thing is to manage the business, ensuring that we're everyday low price, we're giving our customers a great value in our product enterprise. And over the years, we're going to manage the operating margin, ensuring that we continue to gain market share. And the important thing is that there may begin to be in the next couple of years as inventory more normalizes and more clearance exposure normalizes. There's some anticipated risk with gross margin. So we'll continue to manage gross margin with our benefits of our driving and staying at EDLP, not anticipating to revert back to the promotional activity in the past. But with our investments in the business the next couple of years to continue to gain this market share, we anticipate still staying around that range. We think it's a great sweet spot to allow us to continue to hit those revenue growth targets and to continue to gain on the market share. So we want to manage to a reasonable operating margin to continue our opportunity to gain market share and our outlook for 2021 and the long-term really anticipates that. And as we progress, we'll continue to update you as we see more visibility as things change."

We're going to be nimble and have shown in the past that we can shift very well to that. So as we think about the business with ticket and traffic, I'll give you some thoughts on ticket drivers, certainly some level of inflation that could be driving ticket. If there's continued trip consolidation, it helps in the ticket. But other aspects on traffic as areas such as trip consolidation, if there's a bit more normalization on trip consolidation as we begin to cycle some of the COVID demand. And if there's inflation, it sometimes has an offset on the traffic. So point being, there's a number of variables in there. And as we cycle this, we see our opportunity in both categories, and there can be some risk and shift in both. And we've contemplated those aspects in our guidance for comp sales as we begin to cycle the COVID lift that we saw starting in Q2 of 2020. And we anticipate that there's not a meaningful shift from either one as we see it at this point, but both have variables that could drive it up or down."

Steve, a couple of things I'll say. First of all, on the Neighbor's Club program, we are very pleased with the growth in the ownership of that -- I mean, the growth in the membership of that program, reaching 19 million members, representing approximately 60% of our total sales. We're seeing very strong engagement rates with those customers. And we have plans, as we've talked about, to reinvigorate that program in the first half of this year, which I think will drive a step change in engagement with those customers and also migration upward of their spend. So we're very -- we're looking forward to that promotion and getting it out there and look forward to sharing more details with you at our next earnings call on it. 
As it relates to our new customers, we've mentioned in the past that we see approximately 20% of our new customers return and shop with us within 28 days. And that trend really hasn't changed since the beginning of the year. It's held very stable. And it's 2 or 3 points higher than what we would have seen in a historic period when we cohorted new customers. And then I would say it's not -- we also continue to see strong repurchase rates as you get out to kind of 2 months at the 56 day count and at 3 months. And so we're very pleased with their reengagement. We see them engaging first in categories like poultry and dog and pet. But then they start to broaden their purchases across things like apparel and garden. And if they started in pet, they might move to poultry or vice versa. And a higher percentage of these groups than our normal business starts online and does a pickup in store, and then you'll see in their next purchase then coming into the store for purchase. And our new customer scores are higher than historic as well. So I'd say all around, we are pleased with the 19 million numbers. They represent the growth that we had this year. Particularly in the midst of the pandemic. Our sign up is really at the register there face-to-face. People are really trying to check out much faster as we all know. So the ability to still sign up those Neighbor's Clubs members and gain the millions that we did this year. We're very pleased with. And then the new customers are exhibiting very strong reengagement behavior."

And what I'd say is the -- I think the dynamics that are playing out in the market right now, whether it's with customers or vis-à-vis our competitors, those dynamics are really playing to the sweet spots of tractor supply. First off, people are struggling with in stocks, and I think you're going to see more of that as we get into the spring with the supply chain disruption that's out there. And our team has done an outstanding job managing inventory through the year. We saw how we ended the year with inventory above last year. And we're tracking to continue with that at those levels, if not higher, as Kurt mentioned in his opening remarks. We planned for our spring shipments to arrive earlier than they have historically. And so while we are seeing some container backlog, it will -- we are going to be able to manage through that and get it kind of in on a normal time frame, but that's to our benefit. So I think anywhere where you've made investments in inventory and you've leaned in there anywhere where you're making investments in customer service because right now that makes such a big difference in this environment. And we've certainly done that through the net hiring of 10,000 team members and providing appreciation bonuses and others and raises to drive their engagement. Also in technology, if you've invested in technology and you can do curb side pickup, and you can do same day, next-day delivery, and you can do those with great customer service, that leads to advantages as well. So I think the scale that we have in our distribution systems, the scale that we have in technology, the leverage and scale that we have with our vendors, and then, of course, our advantage of our 42,000 team members, which wake up every day looking to provide legendary service, all that just plays well for us. I mean we're -- and then you think about the convenience, the location of our stores and that's why if you go across every category, we're confident that we're taking share in a significant way. I mean if you look at our C.U.E. business being up over 20% for the quarter, that's -- and you think about the proxy -- using that as a proxy for the businesses that are in there around animal feed and pet food and others, those rates are well above industry estimates for those categories. And certainly, a lot of other companies that are out there reporting that play in those categories. So I think it really just speaks to the business model to track or the resiliency of it and the foundation of it and then the investments that we're making day-to-day to ensure that our customers and our new customers are having a great experience."

One interesting anecdote that I'll give on this is we ask our customers in our checkout survey, kind of post-purchase survey, what their top criteria were for why they selected to shop with Tractor Supply. And typically, the responses are similar to what any other retailer would have with price and location convenience, having the right product, customer service, those sorts of things that are kind of the dominant criteria for shopping for retail. During this pandemic over the last 6 months, the #1 and #2 criteria have been cleanliness and safety. Never in my 20-plus years of retail have I seen those 2 criteria at the top of a customer's decision-making criteria. And so that's why we've invested so much in those areas.

I mean we saw a bit of elevation as we worked our way through the year. In Q4, we still saw a bit of a modest level of inflation, less than 100 basis points of commodity inflation into the product cost. We anticipate that as all of the inflation information, as I know everyone's seen is certainly at higher levels. We're anticipating that to accelerate in 2021. We've seen where inflation on commodities can rise as quickly as it did. It can also shift, as you know, just as quickly. So like we said in our prepared remarks, we're planning for 2021 and are a number of scenarios. But in our guidance, we assume that over the year, a weighted average of about 1% to 2% inflation into the product cost and that certainly could vary first half versus second half of the year. And right now, we're seeing the points that Seth mentioned on grains and steel being primary drivers of some inflation at this point. So as we picked up an assumption, that range of about 1% to 2% is where we landed in our assumption."

And to overperform relative to our overall business in the year. I think on the last call, we talked about poultry and chickens and flocks and how they're a bit of an annuity stream given that they have a 7, 8-year lifespan, obviously, pet is very much the same way. With pet adoption up at an all-time high, those pets, as they grow, are only going to -- they're going to move from puppy food to adult food. We're seeing that, by the way, in our trends. Typically with dogs, as they get a little older, they eat a little more, as they get bigger. So we're actually seeing that -- the benefit from that a little bit on the tonnage side. And we expect the humanization of pet will remain very strong this entire year as people continue to work from home really for the foreseeable future, potentially all of 2021. And so they're around their pets. They're buying toys. They're buying snacks. They're upgrading their bed, they're getting them a new bed. All those things, I expect will continue this year. And as I said, we're very pleased with our pet business. We are confident we're gaining share in our pet business. We're seeing strong growth in our pet business, both in-store just through brick-and-mortar channels as well as online. And certainly, the sweet spot for us on pet is our omni channel, where we're seeing significant amount of pet purchases online picked up in store. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're investing heavily in this category to remain a strong destination for our customers in it, whether it was the release recently of our new Pet Rx solution online, whether it's the rollout of both the subscriptions in-store to support in a similar way that we have it online, whether it's the addition of 150 to 200 pet watch stations this year, and then also the build-out of more pet wellness clinics in our stores to support the mobile pet clinics that we have that drive significant engagement with our stores from our customers. So we feel really good about where we are in pet, and we'll be continuing to invest here. I guess I neglected also mentioned topologies is that our marketing campaign that we've been doing in the past year, we have a significant amount of dedicated marketing, both TV and digital devoted to pet, and it's it's systemic mean it's always on, and we do spike it at certain periods, but it's a consistent program that we're doing now. First time we've done that I've been doing that for about 6 or 9 months."

Some, we're in the process of applying for permits. Some were in the final stages of getting the certificate of occupancy. We've got 100-plus more scheduled for the year and we're very excited about their potential. And the team is doing an excellent job kind of navigating this environment to get those built. It's in the context of COVID, you've got construction crews at a time. So we'll have to quarantine for a couple of weeks if 1 of the team members on the project is test positive. You've got city municipalities that getting permitting done is very difficult. Getting someone to come out and do a certificate of occupancy is much slower. And the team is just doing an excellent job managing through all those twists and turns. We're very -- we remain very bullish on side lot. And like I said, a number of them underway.

I hope you enjoyed the opening video. We will all always remember 2020. And while we'll never recall the year with anything close to fondness, at Tractor Supply, 2020 will be remembered with a small measure of pride as we reflect on our efforts to take care of our fellow team members, support our customers and invest in the future.
None of these results would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our team, and I want to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to the more than 42,000 Tractor Supply team members for how they have lived our mission and values and worked together to take care of each other and our customers. My thanks also go out to our supply chain and vendor partners, who've done an excellent job supporting our business.
The environment continues to be uncertain and challenging. Vaccines are on the rise, but our country is still very much in the midst of a pandemic. Given the pace of the vaccine rollout, it will be at least fall before we're back to some form of normality. Throughout the pandemic, our utmost priority has been to take care of the health and safety and well-being of our team members and customers. We spent tens of millions of dollars on cleaning and mask, plexiglass and sanitizer. We provided almost 700,000 hours of COVID sick pay. We have conducted nearly 20,000 COVID tests. And we rolled out company-wide contact-tracing wearable devices for all team members to use. We will continue to spare no expense in this area in 2021.
In addition to rolling out industry-leading safety protocols, we've also shown our commitment to our team members through appreciation bonuses, increased wages and broader benefits offerings. At Tractor Supply, we are committed to being a part of the solution for our team members, our customers and our communities, and we remain steadfast in that commitment going forward.
As we talk -- now shifting and talking about 2021. We believe there is as much uncertainty this year as there was in 2020. How fast will vaccines roll out? How are the derivatives of COVID impact transmission rates and antibody effectiveness? Will there be another stimulus? How will consumer spending evolve through the year?
Given these questions and there are all the other elements of uncertainty, we're planning for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes. The initial guidance we're providing today is consistent with our long-term algorithm that we shared with you at our enhanced earnings event in October. Importantly, our 2021 outlook reflects the strategic initiatives that are foundational to our Life Out Here Strategy. With the actions we're taking, we are committed to emerging from the pandemic stronger than before.
Now let's shift to the business review section for the fourth quarter of 2020 in the fiscal year. We delivered another strong quarter that exceeded our expectations. In the fourth quarter, we had strong net sales gains of 31.3%, with comparable store sales up 27.3%. We continued to gain market share and benefited from customer shopping with us with larger baskets. All customer segments and all value segments experienced growth.
For the fiscal year, we added over $2 billion in revenue, and we reached over $10 billion in sales for the year; a significant milestone for the company. Once again, our quarterly results were remarkably consistent across all periods of the quarter, across all product categories, across all geographic regions of the country. Also, both our transactions and ticket growth we're seeing and were very balanced. For the third quarter, e-commerce saw strong triple-digit growth and increased significantly as a percentage of our overall sales.
The work we did this year to improve our omnichannel capabilities has certainly resonated with our customers as we've seen several years of digital adoption accelerate in just a matter of months. For the year, about 75% of our omnichannel sales were picked up at a Tractor Supply store, further reinforcing the importance of our stores to our customers. As we have experienced in the last several quarters, we continue to have strong performance and market share gains in our consumable, usable and edible categories, with growth exceeding 20% for the quarter. In 2020, we had more customers shop with us than ever before, with increased sales across our existing customer groups, new customers and reacquired customers.
Now shifting to talk about a few other operational highlights for 2020. We added more than 10,000 team members to support the growth of our business. These new team members were critical in our ability to service our customers at these elevated levels and also flow volumes through our supply chain. We pivoted our marketing spending for more traditional print media, digital and national TV. We launched our first national advertising campaign in over a decade. Our research indicates that Tractor Supply has become more top of mind with consumers as our unaided brand awareness increased over 800 basis points. We expanded our in-store and digital capabilities to make it easier and safer to shop at Tractor Supply. We were nimble and agile in offering curbside pickup and same-day, next-day delivery. We also relaunched our website, and we rolled out a new mobile app, which already has over 1 million downloads.
We celebrated the opening of our 1,900th store in Oakhurst, California and announced plans for a new distribution center in Navarre, Ohio, that is expected to be operational by the fall of 2022. We reinforced our long-standing commitment to ESG through improved disclosure and transparency. We also surpassed our original target of a 25% reduction in carbon emissions, 5 years ahead of plan.
If we just step back, overall, 2020 really highlighted the resiliency of the Tractor Supply team and illuminated the potential for the business. We participate in a large, attractive market. We have momentum. We're investing in our business through our Life Out Here Strategy. We have the opportunity to create and define our future and extend our leadership for years to come.
Before I hand the call over to Kurt, I'd like to address the impairment charge we took for the Petsense business. We recently completed a strategic review of Petsense. Although Petsense had solid sales performance in 2020, we reached the conclusion to reduce the number of new store openings planned over the long term and identified some underperforming stores to close. We expect to close 10 to 15 stores in 2021. Combined, this resulted in a pretax charge of about $74.1 million or $0.49 per diluted share after tax. Petsense offers a differentiated shopping experience to the suburban and rural pet owner. As mentioned, the business is currently doing well overall. We remain committed to growing and investing Petsense.
Earlier this week, we named Matthew Rubin as SVP and General Manager for Petsense. Matthew brings a strong retail background, and I'm confident that he'll be an immediate asset to the business. I look forward to sharing more about our plans with you over time.
Now Kurt will walk you through greater details of the quarter and the year, along with our 2021 outlook before I return to give you an update on our Life Out Here Strategy."

And hello to everyone on the call. This year was like no other in the history of Tractor Supply as we delivered record sales and financial performance for the year. The fourth quarter continued to benefit from the macro trends that have wo",1580,"Thank you, Hal. And hello to everyone on the call. This year was like no other in the history of Tractor Supply as we delivered record sales and financial performance for the year. The fourth quarter continued to benefit from the macro trends that have worked to our favor. As we rank order our comparable store sales performance, the trends that I shared with you from the second and third quarter continue to play out in our sales performance. The largest driver continued to be our customers' desire for product categories that support their Out Here Lifestyle as they shifted spending away from travel, entertainment and dining to creating their own experiences.
For Tractor Supply, this included purchases such as outdoor recreation and living, like UTVs and outdoor fire pits along with all those indoor projects and winterizing their homes and equipment. This trend also includes living a more self-reliant lifestyle. The adoption of new hobbies, like backyard poultry, hunting, gardening and bird feeding had continued. And we believe these hobbies and trends are becoming more ingrained in our customers' behavior.
The strong brand awareness and new customer performance that Hal discussed was the second largest driver of our comparable store sales performance. This was then followed by tailwinds such as emergency response related demand due to the hurricane activity and various strategic initiatives, such as our investments in digital and the omnichannel experience, same-day delivery and our private label credit card. Exclusive of the modest hurricane activity benefit, the weather impact was generally neutral compared to the prior year.
We had robust performance in our big ticket categories, which exceeded our overall comp sales growth. This was driven by broad-based strength. With safe, recreational vehicles, utility vehicles, trailers and generators representing the top 5 product categories. Fourth quarter gross profit exceeded our expectations due to higher demand for our products and a reduction in promotional and clearance activities. These factors were partially offset by higher transportation costs as a percentage of net sales. The result was that gross margin as a percentage of sales was 34.6% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 75 basis points.
Moving on to SG&A. The 46 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A as a percent of net sales was attributable to 3 primary factors: first, incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic; second, increased incentive compensation due to record sales and profit performance in the quarter; and then third, investments in our strategic initiatives. The additional costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic included appreciation bonuses to team members across stores and distribution centers as well as additional labor hours and supply cost dedicated to cleaning and sanitation to enhance the health and safety of team members and our customers. COVID-19 related incremental costs were approximately $33 million in the quarter, and that compares to our estimate of $15 million to $20 million going into the quarter, which resulted from an unexpected resurgence of COVID-19 cases late in the year.
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased nearly 36% with operating profit margin of 9%, an improvement of 29 basis points. Adjusted net income was $193.2 million, an increase of 34%. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.64, an increase of nearly 36%. For the year, we reached an adjusted operating profit margin of 10.1% and had strong growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 47.4%.
Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong. Merchandise inventories were $1.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, representing an increase of 5.6% in average inventory per store. This level of inventory is still a bit lighter than we would like given the momentum of the business, and we are working with our suppliers and vendors to build our stock to support this momentum.
During the quarter, we issued our first-ever public offering of debt, and we received investment-grade ratings from both Moody's and S&P given our strong credit metrics. We issued $650 million in 10-year notes at a coupon rate of 1.75%. The proceeds from the debt issuance were used for refinancing and repayment of term loans as we plan to maintain a leverage ratio below 2.5x.
Fiscal 2020 was a year of strong cash flow from operations, which totaled $1.39 billion, an increase of $582 million or 72%. For the full year, we returned a total of $518 million in capital to our shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. We currently have approximately $1.1 billion remaining on our authorization for share repurchases. Today, our Board reconfirmed our commitment to returning cash to shareholders through a 30% increase in our quarterly dividend, which puts our dividend payments in line with our target of at least a 30% payout ratio.
Moving now to our guidance for 2021 that is detailed on Page 11 of the supplemental deck. The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results remains uncertain. Given that backdrop, we are planning for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes. To date, while still very early in the first quarter, we continue to see strong sales momentum in the business. For fiscal 2021, we expect net sales in the range of $10.7 billion to $11 billion. Comp store sales are anticipated to be in the range of down 2% to up 1%.
For the year, we anticipate operating profit margin to be in the range of 9.3% to 9.6%, a significant step-up when compared to our baseline 2019 performance. In fiscal 2020, approximately 90% of the operating margin year-over-year gain was driven by gross margin improvement. For fiscal 2021, we anticipate some giveback in gross margin and SG&A to slightly increase as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2020 on an adjusted basis.
Now let's go into a little more detail on each of these areas. Our expectation is for modest gross margin contraction in 2021 as we anticipate incremental promotional activity, along with higher freight costs. Partially offsetting these pressures are an expected benefit from vendor funding for our Field Activity Support Team program while the FAST program expenses will be reported in SG&A with a year-over-year impact of about 40 basis points on each.
Breaking down SG&A. The leverage from reduced COVID-19 costs and more normalized incentive compensation is expected to be offset by ongoing wage pressures, investments in our supply chain and digital space, and higher depreciation and amortization expense. And as a reminder, the FAST program costs are reported in SG&A. As a result, we are forecasting SG&A as a percent of sales to slightly deleverage. Adjusted for normalization of the FAST program costs, SG&A is expected to remain relatively flat as a percent of sales. As always, we would encourage you to think about our business between the first half of the year and the second half as this is in line with how we manage the business.
As you model 2021, I want to point out a few items that will impact comparability. Appreciation bonuses impact the second and fourth quarters of 2020, while wage increases of about $13 million per quarter took effect in the third quarter of 2020. Costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain an uncertainty for us in 2020 as our utmost priority remains the health and safety of our team members and our customers. For the first quarter, we anticipate costs related to the pandemic will continue at elevated levels.
Additionally, as you think about the cadence of 2021, our business performance is expected to be stronger in the first quarter, as our comparisons step up starting in the second quarter. The first quarter of 2021 is forecast to have the highest comp performance of the year and correspondingly the highest operating profit growth rate. The second quarter is likely to be our most difficult earnings comparison of the year due to a couple of factors. Please recall the second quarter of 2020 experienced the strongest gross margin performance, driven by the least sales promotional activity. In addition, we expect incremental cost in Q2 of this year as we support the launch of an upgrade to our Neighbor's Club loyalty program.
Moving to below the line. We expect total interest expense for 2021 to be approximately $27 million while our effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 22.5% to 22.8%. Our capital spending is anticipated to range from $450 million to $550 million with more than 80% of that spending going towards growth initiatives. The vast majority of the capital spending increase is attributable to new in-store initiatives and supporting technology for our Life Out Here strategy. Depreciation expense is estimated to increase approximately $50 million. This is above our recent run rate as we accelerate our investments in the business.
For the year, we expect share repurchases to reduce our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by about 1% to 2%. For modeling purposes, we've assumed weighted average shares outstanding of about 116 million shares in 2021. Net income is forecast in the range of $750 million to $800 million or $6.50 to $6.90 per diluted share.
With our strong performance in 2020 and the critical momentum in our business, the team at Tractor Supply is excited about the Life Out Here Strategy. Our clear focus enables us to continue to be the innovation leader in our channel and emerge from the pandemic stronger than before.
Now I'll turn it back to Hal."

As Kurt said, we're laser-focused, and we're focused on continuing to gain market share. We're going to do this in 3 different ways: One is capitalizing on our numerous macro trends benefiting us, second is nurturing our existing new and reengaged customers, and the third is executing our Life Out Here Strategy. So let's talk about each one of those in a little more detail.
We believe that many of the consumer behaviors that we've seen over the last 9 months will continue through most or all of 2021. These trends we've mentioned before, but they include rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption, self-reliant lifestyle movement, consumer spending that's shifting from travel and entertainment to home and land, and an all-time high pet ownership. We exited the year with nearly 19 million Neighbor's Club members. For the full year, over 11 million new identified customers and more than 6 million reactivated customers shopped with us at Tractor Supply. We're seeing strong retention with these customers, and we have plans in place to engage them with new capabilities, marketing and product offerings.
The third way we're going to be focused on gaining share this year is our Life Out Here Strategy, and it really positions us to strengthen and transform the company. As we shared last quarter, there are 5 pillars to our Life Out Here Strategy. The first is to deliver legendary customer service, second is advance our ONETractor capabilities, the third is to operate the Tractor Way, the fourth is Go the Country Mile for our team, and lastly, it's generate healthy shareholder return.
So let me highlight some of our planned efforts that we have this year in support of our strategy. In 2021, we plan to open 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 Petsense stores. Additionally, we plan to remodel 150 to 200 stores with Project Fusion, and to execute Project Side Lot in 150 to 200 of our stores. That brings our total construction activity for the year to 400 to 500 projects. This is a significant step-up in the team's workload and also is being executed in the midst of COVID.
Our Project Fusion remodel program is designed to drive space productivity and to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base. It is a combination of both changes in the store layout and imagery that creates a greater lifestyle impression and drive space allocation for product assortment. Fusion stores help create a more welcoming destination and offer compelling showcase for our brands. Our Side Lot program is a full transformation of the space from primarily a storage location for agriculture equipment to a state-of-the-art outside garden, feed and farm shopping center that also provides for greater convenience through the expansion of buy online pick up at store. While still very early with both of these projects, we continue to be very excited about the sales trends we're seeing from the first tranche of Fusion remodels and Side Lot transformation projects. And importantly, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Given the size of the store -- of our store base, these initiatives represent a multiyear opportunity to continually refresh our store base and drive further comp sales.
Another initiative we have is our FAST team. And they are already having a significant impact on the business. Since their implementation in August, they've taken on execution programs like -- executing merchandising programs like Center Court, End Caps, planogram resets, seasonal programs and sales driving initiatives. And what this is doing is it's really allowing our store teams to focus more on customer service and improve their in-store execution and then really ultimately allow us to focus more on the customer and driving comparable sales. And we're very pleased with the fast rollout.
We're also committed to ensuring our digital capabilities to stay ahead of our customer expectations. We did this in 2020, and we'll continue to do this in 2021 and beyond. Big areas of focus for us in the first half are ship from store; search engine optimization; payment options like Apple Pay and Google Pay; subscriptions, both online and in-store; and also the recent launch of our Pet Rx platform.
As Kurt mentioned, we have plans in place for an upgrade in our Neighbor's Club loyalty program by midyear. And we anticipate that this new program will really drive incremental customer retention and also provides strong incentive to allow us to grow our share of wallet with our customers. As we get closer to the launch of our new Neighbor's Club program, I look forward to sharing more of the details about the changes with you.
Now just stepping back. We're excited about spring. We believe our customers will continue to be focused on their homes as their oasis and creating their own experiences whether that's through things like gardening, grilling or homesteading with their family and friends and neighbors. Spring Chick Days create great retail theater and support existing and new customers who want to expand their flocks. This was a big category for us last year, and we expect it to be so this year. And we will have a broader selection than we have historically of chicken coops. Tractor Supply is the clear destination for this on-trend category.
Given the strong trends we're seeing in our companion animal categories and the recent growth in pet ownership, we're focused on being a more complete resource for pet parents. In store, this includes relevant product assortment and brands, expansion of self-serve pet wash locations across 150 to 200 stores, and the build-out of 50 to 75 additional pet wellness centers. Currently, about 1,600 stores have vet services in-store through our mobile vet clinics. Starting this quarter, pet prescriptions can be fulfilled online at Tractor Supply, as I mentioned earlier. In our app, we're now offering on-demand veterinary advice from a team of experienced veterinary professionals. Our customers can call, chat or e-mail a team of veterinary professionals to get all their pet health questions answered. These expanded and new services allow Tractor Supply to offer a complete solution to care for our customers' pets, whether in-store or online. Our stores will be ready for the change of seasons as we move into spring.
In closing, we have a unique opportunity. We compete in an attractive and fragmented market. We have a track record of success and outperformance in our business. We see a unique opportunity to capitalize on the powerful customer trends we are benefiting from and to emerge from the pandemic, stronger, transformed company. Our goal is to make strategic investments that enable us to create greater competitive advantage, capture the opportunity we've discussed and generate shareholder value.
With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions."

I think the guidance that we provided is very consistent with the commentary that we had at the end of the third quarter, and I think aligned with the spirit of the dialogue in our opening remarks, which is that we expect COVID to remain a large kind of consumer-driving force for the foreseeable future, certainly into the fall, if not for the balance of the year. And as a consequence of that, many of the macro trends, which have benefited us, will continue. We also think a number of these macro trends are sticky regardless of COVID.
And so we kind of see those 2 coming together in a way that shapes the year as follows. The first quarter we're in now, we expect momentum in this quarter and our results in this quarter will be much like what we saw in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 with elevated sales levels. And then as we start to comp on top of those in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 this year, we do expect that the comps will start to turn to more normal levels. And the collectiveness of that will kind of compile the guidance we guided between minus 2% and plus 1%. So it is heavily weighted in the first quarter with kind of Q2, Q3, Q4, recognizing it will be comping on top of last year's elevated levels. But with still likely strong underlying momentum supporting those quarters."

We're certainly looking to piece apart our various initiatives, and we have some pretty sophisticated analytics tools that allow us to do that. At these more elevated volume levels, it is a little bit harder to see than what you might see in a normal mid-single-digit comp environment. But I will say that we're -- it's our view that we are gaining share and winning in all the categories that we participate in. And that's really consistent across the board, whether you're looking at industry level data or we're talking with vendors. And so that would lead us to believe that not only are we benefiting from the macro trends, but the work that we're doing to support the business is also helping with that. And I'll call out a few things that kind of give us that sense.
First off, I'll point to kind of some data sets around our customer. Our unaided brand awareness due -- in part due to our national television campaign that we launched last March is up 8 points in the year. That's a very significant improvement in unaided brand awareness. And then the benefit that we've seen of that is a -- the most customers that we've ever had shop our store in 1 year last year, including 11 million new customers and 6 million reacquired customers. And those customers are shopping with us at repeat rates that are at kind of all-time highs. And those repeat shopping rates are -- for the new customers are holding -- have held through the year. So whether it was a new customer we saw in March or April or May, or a new customer that we saw in October, November, December, all those repeat shopping rates are holding at all-time highs.
And then last thing I'll talk about is, if you look at our team members and you look like our customer SAT scores, our -- if you look at the customers' perception of safety and health and well-being in our stores, customers seem to be voting with their wallets and shopping at Tractor Supply, indicative of both our strong transactions, but also our strong ticket. And I think that would speak to the fact that customers are certainly aggregating their ticket. You're hearing that from other retailers, more units per basket driving basket up, but a lot of these retailers are talking about negative comp transactions. With us, it's very balanced with about half coming from comp transactions and about half coming from average ticket. So we're seeing that stock up, but we're also seeing more transactions in the store.
So it's hard to kind of piece it together, but we do think the initiatives we're taking, the support we've given the business on inventory and adding staffing, our focus on cleanliness, plus our digital efforts and our early efforts around Fusion and Side Lot and FAST are adding to the share -- are creating -- helping us drive share gains and kind of add it to the macro trends we're seeing."

But if you look at the broader landscape of pets and where the shifts are coming, where things are growing, and you look at the various -- kind of what's playing out in specialty, through that work and then us revisiting our real estate model as a part of that, we made the decision to reduce the long-term store count expectations that we have for that business. And in doing so, that led us to revisit the value that we had on that business on our balance sheet.
And so we've now kind of reset our expectations for the new store counts of that business. We've hired a new leader for the Petsense business. And we are -- we will continue to invest in Petsense as we see opportunities. And it's -- as I said, the business is doing well. We do think it's gaining share in the specialty space.

And really, the question, as I understand it, is about the outlook on the operating margin, the flow-through going forward. One important thing that I pointed out in our prepared remarks is we had tremendous upside and benefit in 2020 from the gross margin side of the business. And the principal drivers with that was for the majority of the year, we had favorable transportation. And the most significant was unusually low levels of promotion and clearance. I mean the inventory, at some points, really felt like it was going hand to mouth to the consumer.
And we anticipate this year, in 2021, as we still have some of that extended pandemic demand before we start to cycle into that, that there's benefit on less promotion and clearance. We'll start to normalize on that. The important thing is to manage the business, ensuring that we're everyday low price, we're giving our customers a great value in our product enterprise. And over the years, we're going to manage the operating margin, ensuring that we continue to gain market share. And the important thing is that there may begin to be in the next couple of years as inventory more normalizes and more clearance exposure normalizes, there's some anticipated risk with gross margin.
So we'll continue to manage gross margin with our benefits of our driving and staying at EDLP, not anticipating to revert back to the promotional activity in the past. But with our investments in the business in the next couple of years to continue to gain this market share, we anticipate still staying around that range. We think it's a great sweet spot to allow us to continue to hit those revenue growth targets and to continue to gain on the market share. So we want to manage to a reasonable operating margin to continue our opportunity to gain market share. And our outlook for 2021 and the long term really anticipates that. And as we progress, we'll continue to update you as we see more visibility and as things change."

As we think about traffic and ticket in 2021, there's a lot of variables and still some uncertainty as we begin to lap that. We're going to be nimble and have shown in the past that we can shift very well to that. So as we think about the business with ticket and traffic, I'll give you some thoughts on ticket drivers. Certainly, some level of inflation that could be driving ticket. If there's continued trip consolidation, it helps in the ticket. But other aspects on traffic as -- areas such as trip consolidation, if there's a bit more normalization on trip consolidation as we begin to cycle some of the COVID demand, and if there's inflation, it sometimes has an offset on the traffic.
So point being, there's a number of variables in there. And as we cycle this, we see our opportunity in both categories, and there can be some risk and shift in both. And we've contemplated those aspects in our guidance for comp sales as we begin to cycle the COVID lift that we saw starting in Q2 of 2020. And we anticipate that there's not a meaningful shift from either one as we see it at this point, but both have variables that could drive it up or down."

First of all, on the Neighbor's Club program, we are very pleased with the growth in the ownership of that -- I mean, the growth in the membership of that program, reaching 19 million members, representing approximately 60% of our total sales. We're seeing very strong engagement rates with those customers. And we have plans, as we've talked about, to reinvigorate that program in the first half of this year, which I think will drive a step change in engagement with those customers and also migration upward of their spend. So we're very -- we're looking forward to that promotion and getting it out there and look forward to sharing more details with you at our next earnings call on it.
As it relates to our new customers, we've mentioned in the past that we see approximately 20% of our new customers return and shop with us within 28 days. And that trend really hasn't changed since the beginning of the year. It's held very stable. And it's 2 or 3 points higher than what we would have seen in a historic period when we cohorted new customers. And then I would say it's not -- we also continue to see strong repurchase rates as you get out to kind of 2 months at the 56-day count and at 3 months. And so we're very pleased with their reengagement. We see them engaging first in categories like poultry and dog and pet. But then they start to broaden their purchases across things like apparel and garden. And if they started in pet, they might move to poultry or vice versa. And a higher percentage of these groups than our normal business starts online and does a pickup in store, and then you'll see in their next purchase then coming into the store for purchase. And our new customer SAT scores are higher than historic as well.
So I'd say all around. We are pleased with the 19 million numbers. They represent the growth that we had this year, particularly in the midst of the pandemic. Our sign up is really at the register there, face to face. People are really trying to check out much faster as we all know. So the ability to still sign up those Neighbor's Clubs members and gain the millions that we did this year, we're very pleased with. And then the new customers are exhibiting very strong reengagement behavior."

And what I'd say is the -- I think the dynamics that are playing out in the market right now, whether it's with customers or vis-à-vis our competitors, those dynamics are really playing to the sweet spots of Tractor Supply. First off,",477,"Yes. Thanks, Peter. And what I'd say is the -- I think the dynamics that are playing out in the market right now, whether it's with customers or vis-à-vis our competitors, those dynamics are really playing to the sweet spots of Tractor Supply. First off, people are struggling with in stocks, and I think you're going to see more of that as we get into the spring with the supply chain disruption that's out there. And our team has done an outstanding job managing inventory through the year. You saw how we ended the year with inventory above last year. And we're tracking to continue with that at those levels, if not higher, as Kurt mentioned in his opening remarks. We plan for our spring shipments to arrive earlier than they have historically. And so while we are seeing some container backlog, it will -- we are going to be able to manage through that and get it kind of in on a normal time frame, but that's to our benefit.
So I think anywhere where you've made investments in inventory and you've leaned in there, anywhere where you're making investments in customer service because right now that makes such a big difference in this environment, and we've certainly done that through the net hiring of 10,000 team members and providing appreciation bonuses and others and raises to drive their engagement. Also in technology, if you've invested in technology and you can do curbside pickup, and you can do same-day, next-day delivery, and you can do those with great customer service, that leads to advantages as well.
So I think the scale that we have in our distribution systems, the scale that we have in technology, the leverage and scale that we have with our vendors, and then, of course, our advantage of our 42,000 team members, which wake up every day looking to provide legendary service, all that just plays well for us. I mean we're -- and then you think about the convenience, the location of our stores. And that's why if you go across every category, we're confident that we're taking share in a significant way. I mean if you look at our C.U.E. business being up over 20% for the quarter, that's -- and you think about the proxy -- using that as a proxy for the businesses that are in there around animal feed and pet food and others, those rates are well above industry estimates for those categories, and certainly, any -- a lot of other companies that are out there reporting that play in those categories. So I think it really just speaks to the business model of Tractor, the resiliency of it and the foundation of it and then the investments that we're making day-to-day to ensure that our customers and our new customers are having a great experience."

So this is what the full focus of our marketing team is focused on is exactly this, is we've got -- we've invested over the last 1.5 years or 2 in our CRM capabilities, moving that platform to the Azure cloud, upgrading our analytical capabilities, adding new personalization tooling in place and also looking at behaviors, whether on their site -- on the site or inside of the store and then looking for kind of like comparing them to lookalike shoppers. And so whether it's e-mails that those new customers get or whether it's digital banner ads, we're retargeting them. All those sorts of kind of marketing channels and vehicles are being used to engage with these customers and encourage them to reshop with us. And in addition, obviously, we just have the investments we're making in our team members, the investments we're making in our store experience, the investments we're making in inventory and those sorts of things that drive repeat behavior as well.
One interesting anecdote that I'll give on this is we ask our customers in our checkout survey, kind of post-purchase survey, what their top criteria were for why they selected to shop with Tractor Supply. And typically, the responses are similar to what any other retailer would have with price and location convenience, having the right product, customer service, those sorts of things that are kind of the dominant criteria for shopping for retail. During this pandemic, over the last 6 months, the #1 and #2 criteria have been cleanliness and safety. Never in my 20-plus years of retail have I seen those 2 criteria at the top of a customer's decision-making criteria. And so that's why we've invested so much in those areas. And I highlighted the tens of millions of dollars we've spent on those areas in the last quarter."

I mean we saw a bit of elevation as we worked our way through the year. In Q4, we still saw a bit of a modest level of inflation, less than 100 basis points of commodity inflation into the product cost. We anticipate that as all of the inflation information, as I know everyone's seen, is certainly at higher levels, we're anticipating that to accelerate in 2021. We've seen where inflation on commodities can rise as quickly as it did. It can also shift, as you know, just as quickly.
So like we said in our prepared remarks, we're planning for 2021 on a number of scenarios. But in our guidance, we assume that over the year, a weighted average of about 1% to 2% inflation into the product cost and that certainly could vary first half versus second half of the year. And right now, we're seeing the points that Seth mentioned on grains and steel being primary drivers of some inflation at this point. So as we picked up an assumption, that range of about 1% to 2% is where we landed in our assumption."

We are planning for the pet category to continue to remain strong and to overperform relative to our overall business in the year. I think on the last call, we talked about poultry and chickens and flocks and how they're a bit of an annuity stream given that they have a 7-, 8-year lifespan. Obviously, pet is very much the same way. With pet adoption up at an all-time high, those pets, as they grow, are only going to -- they're going to move from puppy food to adult food. We're seeing that, by the way, in our trends. Typically with dogs, as they get a little older, they eat a little more as they get bigger. So we're actually seeing that -- the benefit from that a little bit on the tonnage side.
And we expect the humanization of pet will remain very strong this entire year as people continue to work from home really for the foreseeable future, potentially all of 2021. And so they're around their pets. They're buying toys. They're buying snacks. They're upgrading their bed. They're getting them a new bed. All those things I expect will continue this year. And as I said, we're very pleased with our pet business. We are confident we're gaining share in our pet business. We're seeing strong growth in our pet business, both in-store just through brick-and-mortar channels as well as online. And certainly, the sweet spot for us on pet is our omnichannel, where we're seeing significant amount of pet purchases online, picked up in store.
And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're investing heavily in this category to remain a strong destination for our customers in it, whether it was the release recently of our new Pet Rx solution online, whether it's the rollout of both the subscriptions in-store to support in a similar way that we have it online, whether it's the addition of 150 to 200 pet watch stations this year, and then also the build-out of more pet wellness clinics in our stores to support the mobile pet clinics that we have that drive significant engagement with our stores from our customers.
So we feel really good about where we are in pet, and we'll be continuing to invest here. I guess I neglected also to mention, my apologies, is that our marketing campaign that we've been doing in the past year. We have a significant amount of dedicated marketing, both TV and digital devoted to pet, and it's systemic, meaning, it's always on, and we do spike it at certain periods. But it's a consistent program that we're doing now. First time we've done that. We've been doing that for about 6 or 9 months."

So we've got over 50 of these Side Lots in -- underway right now. Some, we're in the process of applying for permits. Some, we're in the final stages of getting the certificate of occupancy. We've got 100-plus more scheduled for the year, and we're very excited about their potential. And the team is doing an excellent job kind of navigating this environment to get those built. It's -- in the context of COVID, you've got construction crews at a time. So we'll have to quarantine for a couple of weeks if one of the team members on the project tests positive.

My thanks also go out to our supply chain and vendor partners, who've done an excellent job supporting our business.
The environment continues to be uncertain and challenging. Vaccines are on the rise, but our country is still very much in the midst of a pandemic. Given the pace of the vaccine rollout, it will be at least fall before we're back to some form of normality. Throughout the pandemic, our utmost priority has been to take care of the health and safety and well-being of our team members and customers. We spent tens of millions of dollars on cleaning and mask, plexiglass and sanitizer. We provided almost 700,000 hours of COVID sick pay. We have conducted nearly 20,000 COVID tests. And we rolled out company-wide contact-tracing wearable devices for all team members to use. We will continue to spare no expense in this area in 2021.
In addition to rolling out industry-leading safety protocols, we've also shown our commitment to our team members through appreciation bonuses, increased wages and broader benefits offerings. At Tractor Supply, we are committed to being a part of the solution for our team members, our customers and our communities, and we remain steadfast in that commitment going forward.
As we talk -- now shifting and talking about 2021. We believe there is as much uncertainty this year as there was in 2020. How fast will vaccines roll out? How are the derivatives of COVID impact transmission rates and antibody effectiveness? Will there be another stimulus? How will consumer spending evolve through the year?
Given these questions and there are all the other elements of uncertainty, we're planning for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes. The initial guidance we're providing today is consistent with our long-term algorithm that we shared with you at our enhanced earnings event in October. Importantly, our 2021 outlook reflects the strategic initiatives that are foundational to our Life Out Here Strategy. With the actions we're taking, we are committed to emerging from the pandemic stronger than before.
Now let's shift to the business review section for the fourth quarter of 2020 in the fiscal year. We delivered another strong quarter that exceeded our expectations. In the fourth quarter, we had strong net sales gains of 31.3%, with comparable store sales up 27.3%. We continued to gain market share and benefited from customer shopping with us with larger baskets. All customer segments and all value segments experienced growth.
For the fiscal year, we added over $2 billion in revenue, and we reached over $10 billion in sales for the year; a significant milestone for the company. Once again, our quarterly results were remarkably consistent across all periods of the quarter, across all product categories, across all geographic regions of the country. Also, both our transactions and ticket growth we're seeing and were very balanced. For the third quarter, e-commerce saw strong triple-digit growth and increased significantly as a percentage of our overall sales.
The work we did this year to improve our omnichannel capabilities has certainly resonated with our customers as we've seen several years of digital adoption accelerate in just a matter of months. For the year, about 75% of our omnichannel sales were picked up at a Tractor Supply store, further reinforcing the importance of our stores to our customers. As we have experienced in the last several quarters, we continue to have strong performance and market share gains in our consumable, usable and edible categories, with growth exceeding 20% for the quarter. In 2020, we had more customers shop with us than ever before, with increased sales across our existing customer groups, new customers and reacquired customers.
Now shifting to talk about a few other operational highlights for 2020. We added more than 10,000 team members to support the growth of our business. These new team members were critical in our ability to service our customers at these elevated levels and also flow volumes through our supply chain. We pivoted our marketing spending for more traditional print media, digital and national TV. We launched our first national advertising campaign in over a decade. Our research indicates that Tractor Supply has become more top of mind with consumers as our unaided brand awareness increased over 800 basis points. We expanded our in-store and digital capabilities to make it easier and safer to shop at Tractor Supply. We were nimble and agile in offering curbside pickup and same-day, next-day delivery. We also relaunched our website, and we rolled out a new mobile app, which already has over 1 million downloads.
We celebrated the opening of our 1,900th store in Oakhurst, California and announced plans for a new distribution center in Navarre, Ohio, that is expected to be operational by the fall of 2022. We reinforced our long-standing commitment to ESG through improved disclosure and transparency. We also surpassed our original target of a 25% reduction in carbon emissions, 5 years ahead of plan.
If we just step back, overall, 2020 really highlighted the resiliency of the Tractor Supply team and illuminated the potential for the business. We participate in a large, attractive market. We have momentum. We're investing in our business through our Life Out Here Strategy. We have the opportunity to create and define our future and extend our leadership for years to come.
Before I hand the call over to Kurt, I'd like to address the impairment charge we took for the Petsense business. We recently completed a strategic review of Petsense. Although Petsense had solid sales performance in 2020, we reached the conclusion to reduce the number of new store openings planned over the long term and identified some underperforming stores to close. We expect to close 10 to 15 stores in 2021. Combined, this resulted in a pretax charge of about $74.1 million or $0.49 per diluted share after tax. Petsense offers a differentiated shopping experience to the suburban and rural pet owner. As mentioned, the business is currently doing well overall. We remain committed to growing and investing Petsense.
Earlier this week, we named Matthew Rubin as SVP and General Manager for Petsense. Matthew brings a strong retail background, and I'm confident that he'll be an immediate asset to the business. I look forward to sharing more about our plans with you over time.
Now Kurt will walk you through greater details of the quarter and the year, along with our 2021 outlook before I return to give you an update on our Life Out Here Strategy."

This year was like no other in the history of Tractor Supply as we delivered record sales and financial performance for the year. The fourth quarter continued to benefit from the macro trends that have worked to our favor. As we rank order our comparable store sales performance, the trends that I shared with you from the second and third quarter continue to play out in our sales performance. The largest driver continued to be our customers' desire for product categories that support their Out Here Lifestyle as they shifted spending away from travel, entertainment and dining to creating their own experiences.
For Tractor Supply, this included purchases such as outdoor recreation and living, like UTVs and outdoor fire pits along with all those indoor projects and winterizing their homes and equipment. This trend also includes living a more self-reliant lifestyle. The adoption of new hobbies, like backyard poultry, hunting, gardening and bird feeding had continued. And we believe these hobbies and trends are becoming more ingrained in our customers' behavior.
The strong brand awareness and new customer performance that Hal discussed was the second largest driver of our comparable store sales performance. This was then followed by tailwinds such as emergency response related demand due to the hurricane activity and various strategic initiatives, such as our investments in digital and the omnichannel experience, same-day delivery and our private label credit card. Exclusive of the modest hurricane activity benefit, the weather impact was generally neutral compared to the prior year.
We had robust performance in our big ticket categories, which exceeded our overall comp sales growth. This was driven by broad-based strength. With safe, recreational vehicles, utility vehicles, trailers and generators representing the top 5 product categories. Fourth quarter gross profit exceeded our expectations due to higher demand for our products and a reduction in promotional and clearance activities. These factors were partially offset by higher transportation costs as a percentage of net sales. The result was that gross margin as a percentage of sales was 34.6% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 75 basis points.
Moving on to SG&A. The 46 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A as a percent of net sales was attributable to 3 primary factors: first, incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic; second, increased incentive compensation due to record sales and profit performance in the quarter; and then third, investments in our strategic initiatives. The additional costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic included appreciation bonuses to team members across stores and distribution centers as well as additional labor hours and supply cost dedicated to cleaning and sanitation to enhance the health and safety of team members and our customers. COVID-19 related incremental costs were approximately $33 million in the quarter, and that compares to our estimate of $15 million to $20 million going into the quarter, which resulted from an unexpected resurgence of COVID-19 cases late in the year.
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased nearly 36% with operating profit margin of 9%, an improvement of 29 basis points. Adjusted net income was $193.2 million, an increase of 34%. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.64, an increase of nearly 36%. For the year, we reached an adjusted operating profit margin of 10.1% and had strong growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 47.4%.
Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong. Merchandise inventories were $1.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, representing an increase of 5.6% in average inventory per store. This level of inventory is still a bit lighter than we would like given the momentum of the business, and we are working with our suppliers and vendors to build our stock to support this momentum.
During the quarter, we issued our first-ever public offering of debt, and we received investment-grade ratings from both Moody's and S&P given our strong credit metrics. We issued $650 million in 10-year notes at a coupon rate of 1.75%. The proceeds from the debt issuance were used for refinancing and repayment of term loans as we plan to maintain a leverage ratio below 2.5x.
Fiscal 2020 was a year of strong cash flow from operations, which totaled $1.39 billion, an increase of $582 million or 72%. For the full year, we returned a total of $518 million in capital to our shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. We currently have approximately $1.1 billion remaining on our authorization for share repurchases. Today, our Board reconfirmed our commitment to returning cash to shareholders through a 30% increase in our quarterly dividend, which puts our dividend payments in line with our target of at least a 30% payout ratio.
Moving now to our guidance for 2021 that is detailed on Page 11 of the supplemental deck. The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results remains uncertain. Given that backdrop, we are planning for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes. To date, while still very early in the first quarter, we continue to see strong sales momentum in the business. For fiscal 2021, we expect net sales in the range of $10.7 billion to $11 billion. Comp store sales are anticipated to be in the range of down 2% to up 1%.
For the year, we anticipate operating profit margin to be in the range of 9.3% to 9.6%, a significant step-up when compared to our baseline 2019 performance. In fiscal 2020, approximately 90% of the operating margin year-over-year gain was driven by gross margin improvement. For fiscal 2021, we anticipate some giveback in gross margin and SG&A to slightly increase as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2020 on an adjusted basis.
Now let's go into a little more detail on each of these areas. Our expectation is for modest gross margin contraction in 2021 as we anticipate incremental promotional activity, along with higher freight costs. Partially offsetting these pressures are an expected benefit from vendor funding for our Field Activity Support Team program while the FAST program expenses will be reported in SG&A with a year-over-year impact of about 40 basis points on each.
Breaking down SG&A. The leverage from reduced COVID-19 costs and more normalized incentive compensation is expected to be offset by ongoing wage pressures, investments in our supply chain and digital space, and higher depreciation and amortization expense. And as a reminder, the FAST program costs are reported in SG&A. As a result, we are forecasting SG&A as a percent of sales to slightly deleverage. Adjusted for normalization of the FAST program costs, SG&A is expected to remain relatively flat as a percent of sales. As always, we would encourage you to think about our business between the first half of the year and the second half as this is in line with how we manage the business.
As you model 2021, I want to point out a few items that will impact comparability. Appreciation bonuses impact the second and fourth quarters of 2020, while wage increases of about $13 million per quarter took effect in the third quarter of 2020. Costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain an uncertainty for us in 2020 as our utmost priority remains the health and safety of our team members and our customers. For the first quarter, we anticipate costs related to the pandemic will continue at elevated levels.
Additionally, as you think about the cadence of 2021, our business performance is expected to be stronger in the first quarter, as our comparisons step up starting in the second quarter. The first quarter of 2021 is forecast to have the highest comp performance of the year and correspondingly the highest operating profit growth rate. The second quarter is likely to be our most difficult earnings comparison of the year due to a couple of factors. Please recall the second quarter of 2020 experienced the strongest gross margin performance, driven by the least sales promotional activity. In addition, we expect incremental cost in Q2 of this year as we support the launch of an upgrade to our Neighbor's Club loyalty program.
Moving to below the line. We expect total interest expense for 2021 to be approximately $27 million while our effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 22.5% to 22.8%. Our capital spending is anticipated to range from $450 million to $550 million with more than 80% of that spending going towards growth initiatives. The vast majority of the capital spending increase is attributable to new in-store initiatives and supporting technology for our Life Out Here strategy. Depreciation expense is estimated to increase approximately $50 million. This is above our recent run rate as we accelerate our investments in the business.
For the year, we expect share repurchases to reduce our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by about 1% to 2%. For modeling purposes, we've assumed weighted average shares outstanding of about 116 million shares in 2021. Net income is forecast in the range of $750 million to $800 million or $6.50 to $6.90 per diluted share.
With our strong performance in 2020 and the critical momentum in our business, the team at Tractor Supply is excited about the Life Out Here Strategy. Our clear focus enables us to continue to be the innovation leader in our channel and emerge from the pandemic stronger than before.
Now I'll turn it back to Hal."

As Kurt said, we're laser-focused, and we're focused on continuing to gain market share. We're going to do this in 3 different ways: One is capitalizing on our numerous macro trends benefiting us, second is nurturing our existing new and reengaged customers, and the third is executing our Life Out Here Strategy. So let's talk about each one of those in a little more detail.
We believe that many of the consumer behaviors that we've seen over the last 9 months will continue through most or all of 2021. These trends we've mentioned before, but they include rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption, self-reliant lifestyle movement, consumer spending that's shifting from travel and entertainment to home and land, and an all-time high pet ownership. We exited the year with nearly 19 million Neighbor's Club members. For the full year, over 11 million new identified customers and more than 6 million reactivated customers shopped with us at Tractor Supply. We're seeing strong retention with these customers, and we have plans in place to engage them with new capabilities, marketing and product offerings.
The third way we're going to be focused on gaining share this year is our Life Out Here Strategy, and it really positions us to strengthen and transform the company. As we shared last quarter, there are 5 pillars to our Life Out Here Strategy. The first is to deliver legendary customer service, second is advance our ONETractor capabilities, the third is to operate the Tractor Way, the fourth is Go the Country Mile for our team, and lastly, it's generate healthy shareholder return.
So let me highlight some of our planned efforts that we have this year in support of our strategy. In 2021, we plan to open 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 Petsense stores. Additionally, we plan to remodel 150 to 200 stores with Project Fusion, and to execute Project Side Lot in 150 to 200 of our stores. That brings our total construction activity for the year to 400 to 500 projects. This is a significant step-up in the team's workload and also is being executed in the midst of COVID.
Our Project Fusion remodel program is designed to drive space productivity and to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base. It is a combination of both changes in the store layout and imagery that creates a greater lifestyle impression and drive space allocation for product assortment. Fusion stores help create a more welcoming destination and offer compelling showcase for our brands. Our Side Lot program is a full transformation of the space from primarily a storage location for agriculture equipment to a state-of-the-art outside garden, feed and farm shopping center that also provides for greater convenience through the expansion of buy online pick up at store. While still very early with both of these projects, we continue to be very excited about the sales trends we're seeing from the first tranche of Fusion remodels and Side Lot transformation projects. And importantly, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Given the size of the store -- of our store base, these initiatives represent a multiyear opportunity to continually refresh our store base and drive further comp sales.
Another initiative we have is our FAST team. And they are already having a significant impact on the business. Since their implementation in August, they've taken on execution programs like -- executing merchandising programs like Center Court, End Caps, planogram resets, seasonal programs and sales driving initiatives. And what this is doing is it's really allowing our store teams to focus more on customer service and improve their in-store execution and then really ultimately allow us to focus more on the customer and driving comparable sales. And we're very pleased with the fast rollout.
We're also committed to ensuring our digital capabilities to stay ahead of our customer expectations. We did this in 2020, and we'll continue to do this in 2021 and beyond. Big areas of focus for us in the first half are ship from store; search engine optimization; payment options like Apple Pay and Google Pay; subscriptions, both online and in-store; and also the recent launch of our Pet Rx platform.
As Kurt mentioned, we have plans in place for an upgrade in our Neighbor's Club loyalty program by midyear. And we anticipate that this new program will really drive incremental customer retention and also provides strong incentive to allow us to grow our share of wallet with our customers. As we get closer to the launch of our new Neighbor's Club program, I look forward to sharing more of the details about the changes with you.
Now just stepping back. We're excited about spring. We believe our customers will continue to be focused on their homes as their oasis and creating their own experiences whether that's through things like gardening, grilling or homesteading with their family and friends and neighbors. Spring Chick Days create great retail theater and support existing and new customers who want to expand their flocks. This was a big category for us last year, and we expect it to be so this year. And we will have a broader selection than we have historically of chicken coops. Tractor Supply is the clear destination for this on-trend category.
Given the strong trends we're seeing in our companion animal categories and the recent growth in pet ownership, we're focused on being a more complete resource for pet parents. In store, this includes relevant product assortment and brands, expansion of self-serve pet wash locations across 150 to 200 stores, and the build-out of 50 to 75 additional pet wellness centers. Currently, about 1,600 stores have vet services in-store through our mobile vet clinics. Starting this quarter, pet prescriptions can be fulfilled online at Tractor Supply, as I mentioned earlier. In our app, we're now offering on-demand veterinary advice from a team of experienced veterinary professionals. Our customers can call, chat or e-mail a team of veterinary professionals to get all their pet health questions answered. These expanded and new services allow Tractor Supply to offer a complete solution to care for our customers' pets, whether in-store or online. Our stores will be ready for the change of seasons as we move into spring.
In closing, we have a unique opportunity. We compete in an attractive and fragmented market. We have a track record of success and outperformance in our business. We see a unique opportunity to capitalize on the powerful customer trends we are benefiting from and to emerge from the pandemic, stronger, transformed company. Our goal is to make strategic investments that enable us to create greater competitive advantage, capture the opportunity we've discussed and generate shareholder value.
With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions."

I think the guidance that we provided is very consistent with the commentary that we had at the end of the third quarter, and I think aligned with the spirit of the dialogue in our opening remarks, which is that we expect COVID to remain a large kind of consumer-driving force for the foreseeable future, certainly into the fall, if not for the balance of the year. And as a consequence of that, many of the macro trends, which have benefited us, will continue. We also think a number of these macro trends are sticky regardless of COVID.
And so we kind of see those 2 coming together in a way that shapes the year as follows. The first quarter we're in now, we expect momentum in this quarter and our results in this quarter will be much like what we saw in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 with elevated sales levels. And then as we start to comp on top of those in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 this year, we do expect that the comps will start to turn to more normal levels. And the collectiveness of that will kind of compile the guidance we guided between minus 2% and plus 1%. So it is heavily weighted in the first quarter with kind of Q2, Q3, Q4, recognizing it will be comping on top of last year's elevated levels. But with still likely strong underlying momentum supporting those quarters."

We're certainly looking to piece apart our various initiatives, and we have some pretty sophisticated analytics tools that allow us to do that. At these more elevated volume levels, it is a little bit harder to see than what you might see in a normal mid-single-digit comp environment. But I will say that we're -- it's our view that we are gaining share and winning in all the categories that we participate in. And that's really consistent across the board, whether you're looking at industry level data or we're talking with vendors. And so that would lead us to believe that not only are we benefiting from the macro trends, but the work that we're doing to support the business is also helping with that. And I'll call out a few things that kind of give us that sense.
First off, I'll point to kind of some data sets around our customer. Our unaided brand awareness due -- in part due to our national television campaign that we launched last March is up 8 points in the year. That's a very significant improvement in unaided brand awareness. And then the benefit that we've seen of that is a -- the most customers that we've ever had shop our store in 1 year last year, including 11 million new customers and 6 million reacquired customers. And those customers are shopping with us at repeat rates that are at kind of all-time highs. And those repeat shopping rates are -- for the new customers are holding -- have held through the year. So whether it was a new customer we saw in March or April or May, or a new customer that we saw in October, November, December, all those repeat shopping rates are holding at all-time highs.
And then last thing I'll talk about is, if you look at our team members and you look like our customer SAT scores, our -- if you look at the customers' perception of safety and health and well-being in our stores, customers seem to be voting with their wallets and shopping at Tractor Supply, indicative of both our strong transactions, but also our strong ticket. And I think that would speak to the fact that customers are certainly aggregating their ticket. You're hearing that from other retailers, more units per basket driving basket up, but a lot of these retailers are talking about negative comp transactions. With us, it's very balanced with about half coming from comp transactions and about half coming from average ticket. So we're seeing that stock up, but we're also seeing more transactions in the store.
So it's hard to kind of piece it together, but we do think the initiatives we're taking, the support we've given the business on inventory and adding staffing, our focus on cleanliness, plus our digital efforts and our early efforts around Fusion and Side Lot and FAST are adding to the share -- are creating -- helping us drive share gains and kind of add it to the macro trends we're seeing."

But if you look at the broader landscape of pets and where the shifts are coming, where things are growing, and you look at the various -- kind of what's playing out in specialty, through that work and then us revisiting our real estate model as a part of that, we made the decision to reduce the long-term store count expectations that we have for that business. And in doing so, that led us to revisit the value that we had on that business on our balance sheet.
And so we've now kind of reset our expectations for the new store counts of that business. We've hired a new leader for the Petsense business. And we are -- we will continue to invest in Petsense as we see opportunities. And it's -- as I said, the business is doing well. We do think it's gaining share in the specialty space.

And really, the question, as I understand it, is about the outlook on the operating margin, the flow-through going forward. One important thing that I pointed out in our prepared remarks is we had tremendous upside and benefit in 2020 from the gross margin side of the business. And the principal drivers with that was for the majority of the year, we had favorable transportation. And the most significant was unusually low levels of promotion and clearance. I mean the inventory, at some points, really felt like it was going hand to mouth to the consumer.
And we anticipate this year, in 2021, as we still have some of that extended pandemic demand before we start to cycle into that, that there's benefit on less promotion and clearance. We'll start to normalize on that. The important thing is to manage the business, ensuring that we're everyday low price, we're giving our customers a great value in our product enterprise. And over the years, we're going to manage the operating margin, ensuring that we continue to gain market share. And the important thing is that there may begin to be in the next couple of years as inventory more normalizes and more clearance exposure normalizes, there's some anticipated risk with gross margin.
So we'll continue to manage gross margin with our benefits of our driving and staying at EDLP, not anticipating to revert back to the promotional activity in the past. But with our investments in the business in the next couple of years to continue to gain this market share, we anticipate still staying around that range. We think it's a great sweet spot to allow us to continue to hit those revenue growth targets and to continue to gain on the market share. So we want to manage to a reasonable operating margin to continue our opportunity to gain market share. And our outlook for 2021 and the long term really anticipates that. And as we progress, we'll continue to update you as we see more visibility and as things change."

As we think about traffic and ticket in 2021, there's a lot of variables and still some uncertainty as we begin to lap that. We're going to be nimble and have shown in the past that we can shift very well to that. So as we think about the business with ticket and traffic, I'll give you some thoughts on ticket drivers. Certainly, some level of inflation that could be driving ticket. If there's continued trip consolidation, it helps in the ticket. But other aspects on traffic as -- areas such as trip consolidation, if there's a bit more normalization on trip consolidation as we begin to cycle some of the COVID demand, and if there's inflation, it sometimes has an offset on the traffic.
So point being, there's a number of variables in there. And as we cycle this, we see our opportunity in both categories, and there can be some risk and shift in both. And we've contemplated those aspects in our guidance for comp sales as we begin to cycle the COVID lift that we saw starting in Q2 of 2020. And we anticipate that there's not a meaningful shift from either one as we see it at this point, but both have variables that could drive it up or down."

Steve, a couple of things I'll say. First of all, on the Neighbor's Club program, we are very pleased with the growth in the ownership of that -- I mean, the growth in the membership of that program, reaching 19 million members, representing approximately 60% of our total sales. We're seeing very strong engagement rates with those customers. And we have plans, as we've talked about, to reinvigorate that program in the first half of this year, which I think will drive a step change in engagement with those customers and also migration upward of their spend. So we're very -- we're looking forward to that promotion and getting it out there and look forward to sharing more details with you at our next earnings call on it.
As it relates to our new customers, we've mentioned in the past that we see approximately 20% of our new customers return and shop with us within 28 days. And that trend really hasn't changed since the beginning of the year. It's held very stable. And it's 2 or 3 points higher than what we would have seen in a historic period when we cohorted new customers. And then I would say it's not -- we also continue to see strong repurchase rates as you get out to kind of 2 months at the 56-day count and at 3 months. And so we're very pleased with their reengagement. We see them engaging first in categories like poultry and dog and pet. But then they start to broaden their purchases across things like apparel and garden. And if they started in pet, they might move to poultry or vice versa. And a higher percentage of these groups than our normal business starts online and does a pickup in store, and then you'll see in their next purchase then coming into the store for purchase. And our new customer SAT scores are higher than historic as well.
So I'd say all around. We are pleased with the 19 million numbers. They represent the growth that we had this year, particularly in the midst of the pandemic. Our sign up is really at the register there, face to face. People are really trying to check out much faster as we all know. So the ability to still sign up those Neighbor's Clubs members and gain the millions that we did this year, we're very pleased with. And then the new customers are exhibiting very strong reengagement behavior."

And what I'd say is the -- I think the dynamics that are playing out in the market right now, whether it's with customers or vis-à-vis our competitors, those dynamics are really playing to the sweet spots of Tractor Supply. First off, people are struggling with in stocks, and I think you're going to see more of that as we get into the spring with the supply chain disruption that's out there. And our team has done an outstanding job managing inventory through the year. You saw how we ended the year with inventory above last year. And we're tracking to continue with that at those levels, if not higher, as Kurt mentioned in his opening remarks. We plan for our spring shipments to arrive earlier than they have historically. And so while we are seeing some container backlog, it will -- we are going to be able to manage through that and get it kind of in on a normal time frame, but that's to our benefit.
So I think anywhere where you've made investments in inventory and you've leaned in there, anywhere where you're making investments in customer service because right now that makes such a big difference in this environment, and we've certainly done that through the net hiring of 10,000 team members and providing appreciation bonuses and others and raises to drive their engagement. Also in technology, if you've invested in technology and you can do curbside pickup, and you can do same-day, next-day delivery, and you can do those with great customer service, that leads to advantages as well.
So I think the scale that we have in our distribution systems, the scale that we have in technology, the leverage and scale that we have with our vendors, and then, of course, our advantage of our 42,000 team members, which wake up every day looking to provide legendary service, all that just plays well for us. I mean we're -- and then you think about the convenience, the location of our stores. And that's why if you go across every category, we're confident that we're taking share in a significant way. 
I mean if you look at our C.U.E. business being up over 20% for the quarter, that's -- and you think about the proxy -- using that as a proxy for the businesses that are in there around animal feed and pet food and others, those rates are well above industry estimates for those categories, and certainly, any -- a lot of other companies that are out there reporting that play in those categories. So I think it really just speaks to the business model of Tractor, the resiliency of it and the foundation of it and then the investments that we're making day-to-day to ensure that our customers and our new customers are having a great experience."

One interesting anecdote that I'll give on this is we ask our customers in our checkout survey, kind of post-purchase survey, what their top criteria were for why they selected to shop with Tractor Supply. And typically, the responses are similar to what any other retailer would have with price and location convenience, having the right product, customer service, those sorts of things that are kind of the dominant criteria for shopping for retail. During this pandemic, over the last 6 months, the #1 and #2 criteria have been cleanliness and safety. Never in my 20-plus years of retail have I seen those 2 criteria at the top of a customer's decision-making criteria. And so that's why we've invested so much in those areas.

We've seen where inflation on commodities can rise as quickly as it did. It can also shift, as you know, just as quickly.
So like we said in our prepared remarks, we're planning for 2021 on a number of scenarios.

I think on the last call, we talked about poultry and chickens and flocks and how they're a bit of an annuity stream given that they have a 7-, 8-year lifespan. Obviously, pet is very much the same way. With pet adoption up at an all-time high, those pets, as they grow, are only going to -- they're going to move from puppy food to adult food. We're seeing that, by the way, in our trends. Typically with dogs, as they get a little older, they eat a little more as they get bigger. So we're actually seeing that -- the benefit from that a little bit on the tonnage side.
And we expect the humanization of pet will remain very strong this entire year as people continue to work from home really for the foreseeable future, potentially all of 2021. And so they're around their pets. They're buying toys. They're buying snacks. They're upgrading their bed. They're getting them a new bed. All those things I expect will continue this year. And as I said, we're very pleased with our pet business. We are confident we're gaining share in our pet business. We're seeing strong growth in our pet business, both in-store just through brick-and-mortar channels as well as online. And certainly, the sweet spot for us on pet is our omnichannel, where we're seeing significant amount of pet purchases online, picked up in store.
And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're investing heavily in this category to remain a strong destination for our customers in it, whether it was the release recently of our new Pet Rx solution online, whether it's the rollout of both the subscriptions in-store to support in a similar way that we have it online, whether it's the addition of 150 to 200 pet watch stations this year, and then also the build-out of more pet wellness clinics in our stores to support the mobile pet clinics that we have that drive significant engagement with our stores from our customers.
So we feel really good about where we are in pet, and we'll be continuing to invest here. I guess I neglected also to mention, my apologies, is that our marketing campaign that we've been doing in the past year. We have a significant amount of dedicated marketing, both TV and digital devoted to pet, and it's systemic, meaning, it's always on, and we do spike it at certain periods. But it's a consistent program that we're doing now. First time we've done that. We've been doing that for about 6 or 9 months."

Once that's all -- once the project is complete and the product is in there, we saw really strong engagement with customers. And this is in the midst of fall and winter when live goods assortments are very limited and gardening activities is much less.
So we've got over 50 of these Side Lots in -- underway right now. Some, we're in the process of applying for permits. Some, we're in the final stages of getting the certificate of occupancy. We've got 100-plus more scheduled for the year, and we're very excited about their potential. And the team is doing an excellent job kind of navigating this environment to get those built. It's -- in the context of COVID, you've got construction crews at a time. So we'll have to quarantine for a couple of weeks if one of the team members on the project tests positive. You've got city municipalities that -- getting permitting done is very difficult. Getting someone to come out and do a certificate of occupancy is much slower. And the team is just doing an excellent job managing through all those twists and turns. We're very -- we remain very bullish on Side Lot. And like I said, a number of them underway. I just visited a handful of them in the last week and really excited to have our first batch of them opened in time for the spring season."

I hope you enjoyed the opening video. We will all always remember 2020. And while we'll never recall the year with anything close to fondness, at Tractor Supply, 2020 will be remembered with a small measure of pride as we reflect on our efforts to take care of our fellow team members, support our customers and invest in the future.
None of these results would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our team, and I want to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to the more than 42,000 Tractor Supply team members for how they have lived our mission and values and worked together to take care of each other and our customers. My thanks also go out to our supply chain and vendor partners, who've done an excellent job supporting our business.
The environment continues to be uncertain and challenging. Vaccines are on the rise, but our country is still very much in the midst of a pandemic. Given the pace of the vaccine rollout, it will be at least fall before we're back to some form of normality. Throughout the pandemic, our utmost priority has been to take care of the health and safety and well-being of our team members and customers. We spent tens of millions of dollars on cleaning and mask, plexiglass and sanitizer. We provided almost 700,000 hours of COVID sick pay. We have conducted nearly 20,000 COVID tests. And we rolled out company-wide contact-tracing wearable devices for all team members to use. We will continue to spare no expense in this area in 2021.
In addition to rolling out industry-leading safety protocols, we've also shown our commitment to our team members through appreciation bonuses, increased wages and broader benefits offerings. At Tractor Supply, we are committed to being a part of the solution for our team members, our customers and our communities, and we remain steadfast in that commitment going forward.
As we talk -- now shifting and talking about 2021. We believe there is as much uncertainty this year as there was in 2020. How fast will vaccines roll out? How are the derivatives of COVID impact transmission rates and antibody effectiveness? Will there be another stimulus? How will consumer spending evolve through the year?
Given these questions and there are all the other elements of uncertainty, we're planning for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes. The initial guidance we're providing today is consistent with our long-term algorithm that we shared with you at our enhanced earnings event in October. Importantly, our 2021 outlook reflects the strategic initiatives that are foundational to our Life Out Here Strategy. With the actions we're taking, we are committed to emerging from the pandemic stronger than before.
Now let's shift to the business review section for the fourth quarter of 2020 in the fiscal year. We delivered another strong quarter that exceeded our expectations. In the fourth quarter, we had strong net sales gains of 31.3%, with comparable store sales up 27.3%. We continued to gain market share and benefited from customer shopping with us with larger baskets. All customer segments and all value segments experienced growth.
For the fiscal year, we added over $2 billion in revenue, and we reached over $10 billion in sales for the year; a significant milestone for the company. Once again, our quarterly results were remarkably consistent across all periods of the quarter, across all product categories, across all geographic regions of the country. Also, both our transactions and ticket growth we're seeing and were very balanced. For the third quarter, e-commerce saw strong triple-digit growth and increased significantly as a percentage of our overall sales.
The work we did this year to improve our omnichannel capabilities has certainly resonated with our customers as we've seen several years of digital adoption accelerate in just a matter of months. For the year, about 75% of our omnichannel sales were picked up at a Tractor Supply store, further reinforcing the importance of our stores to our customers. As we have experienced in the last several quarters, we continue to have strong performance and market share gains in our consumable, usable and edible categories, with growth exceeding 20% for the quarter. In 2020, we had more customers shop with us than ever before, with increased sales across our existing customer groups, new customers and reacquired customers.
Now shifting to talk about a few other operational highlights for 2020. We added more than 10,000 team members to support the growth of our business. These new team members were critical in our ability to service our customers at these elevated levels and also flow volumes through our supply chain. We pivoted our marketing spending for more traditional print media, digital and national TV. We launched our first national advertising campaign in over a decade. Our research indicates that Tractor Supply has become more top of mind with consumers as our unaided brand awareness increased over 800 basis points. We expanded our in-store and digital capabilities to make it easier and safer to shop at Tractor Supply. We were nimble and agile in offering curbside pickup and same-day, next-day delivery. We also relaunched our website, and we rolled out a new mobile app, which already has over 1 million downloads.
We celebrated the opening of our 1,900th store in Oakhurst, California and announced plans for a new distribution center in Navarre, Ohio, that is expected to be operational by the fall of 2022. We reinforced our long-standing commitment to ESG through improved disclosure and transparency. We also surpassed our original target of a 25% reduction in carbon emissions, 5 years ahead of plan.
If we just step back, overall, 2020 really highlighted the resiliency of the Tractor Supply team and illuminated the potential for the business. We participate in a large, attractive market. We have momentum. We're investing in our business through our Life Out Here Strategy. We have the opportunity to create and define our future and extend our leadership for years to come.
Before I hand the call over to Kurt, I'd like to address the impairment charge we took for the Petsense business. We recently completed a strategic review of Petsense. Although Petsense had solid sales performance in 2020, we reached the conclusion to reduce the number of new store openings planned over the long term and identified some underperforming stores to close. We expect to close 10 to 15 stores in 2021. Combined, this resulted in a pretax charge of about $74.1 million or $0.49 per diluted share after tax. Petsense offers a differentiated shopping experience to the suburban and rural pet owner. As mentioned, the business is currently doing well overall. We remain committed to growing and investing Petsense.
Earlier this week, we named Matthew Rubin as SVP and General Manager for Petsense. Matthew brings a strong retail background, and I'm confident that he'll be an immediate asset to the business. I look forward to sharing more about our plans with you over time.
Now Kurt will walk you through greater details of the quarter and the year, along with our 2021 outlook before I return to give you an update on our Life Out Here Strategy."

This year was like no other in the history of Tractor Supply as we delivered record sales and financial performance for the year. The fourth quarter continued to benefit from the macro trends that have worked to our favor. As we rank order our comparable store sales performance, the trends that I shared with you from the second and third quarter continue to play out in our sales performance. The largest driver continued to be our customers' desire for product categories that support their Out Here Lifestyle as they shifted spending away from travel, entertainment and dining to creating their own experiences.
For Tractor Supply, this included purchases such as outdoor recreation and living, like UTVs and outdoor fire pits along with all those indoor projects and winterizing their homes and equipment. This trend also includes living a more self-reliant lifestyle. The adoption of new hobbies, like backyard poultry, hunting, gardening and bird feeding had continued. And we believe these hobbies and trends are becoming more ingrained in our customers' behavior.
The strong brand awareness and new customer performance that Hal discussed was the second largest driver of our comparable store sales performance. This was then followed by tailwinds such as emergency response related demand due to the hurricane activity and various strategic initiatives, such as our investments in digital and the omnichannel experience, same-day delivery and our private label credit card. Exclusive of the modest hurricane activity benefit, the weather impact was generally neutral compared to the prior year.
We had robust performance in our big ticket categories, which exceeded our overall comp sales growth. This was driven by broad-based strength. With safe, recreational vehicles, utility vehicles, trailers and generators representing the top 5 product categories. Fourth quarter gross profit exceeded our expectations due to higher demand for our products and a reduction in promotional and clearance activities. These factors were partially offset by higher transportation costs as a percentage of net sales. The result was that gross margin as a percentage of sales was 34.6% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 75 basis points.
Moving on to SG&A. The 46 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A as a percent of net sales was attributable to 3 primary factors: first, incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic; second, increased incentive compensation due to record sales and profit performance in the quarter; and then third, investments in our strategic initiatives. The additional costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic included appreciation bonuses to team members across stores and distribution centers as well as additional labor hours and supply cost dedicated to cleaning and sanitation to enhance the health and safety of team members and our customers. COVID-19 related incremental costs were approximately $33 million in the quarter, and that compares to our estimate of $15 million to $20 million going into the quarter, which resulted from an unexpected resurgence of COVID-19 cases late in the year.
For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased nearly 36% with operating profit margin of 9%, an improvement of 29 basis points. Adjusted net income was $193.2 million, an increase of 34%. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.64, an increase of nearly 36%. For the year, we reached an adjusted operating profit margin of 10.1% and had strong growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 47.4%.
Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong. Merchandise inventories were $1.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, representing an increase of 5.6% in average inventory per store. This level of inventory is still a bit lighter than we would like given the momentum of the business, and we are working with our suppliers and vendors to build our stock to support this momentum.
During the quarter, we issued our first-ever public offering of debt, and we received investment-grade ratings from both Moody's and S&P given our strong credit metrics. We issued $650 million in 10-year notes at a coupon rate of 1.75%. The proceeds from the debt issuance were used for refinancing and repayment of term loans as we plan to maintain a leverage ratio below 2.5x.
Fiscal 2020 was a year of strong cash flow from operations, which totaled $1.39 billion, an increase of $582 million or 72%. For the full year, we returned a total of $518 million in capital to our shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. We currently have approximately $1.1 billion remaining on our authorization for share repurchases. Today, our Board reconfirmed our commitment to returning cash to shareholders through a 30% increase in our quarterly dividend, which puts our dividend payments in line with our target of at least a 30% payout ratio.
Moving now to our guidance for 2021 that is detailed on Page 11 of the supplemental deck. The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results remains uncertain. Given that backdrop, we are planning for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes. To date, while still very early in the first quarter, we continue to see strong sales momentum in the business. For fiscal 2021, we expect net sales in the range of $10.7 billion to $11 billion. Comp store sales are anticipated to be in the range of down 2% to up 1%.
For the year, we anticipate operating profit margin to be in the range of 9.3% to 9.6%, a significant step-up when compared to our baseline 2019 performance. In fiscal 2020, approximately 90% of the operating margin year-over-year gain was driven by gross margin improvement. For fiscal 2021, we anticipate some giveback in gross margin and SG&A to slightly increase as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2020 on an adjusted basis.
Now let's go into a little more detail on each of these areas. Our expectation is for modest gross margin contraction in 2021 as we anticipate incremental promotional activity, along with higher freight costs. Partially offsetting these pressures are an expected benefit from vendor funding for our Field Activity Support Team program while the FAST program expenses will be reported in SG&A with a year-over-year impact of about 40 basis points on each.
Breaking down SG&A. The leverage from reduced COVID-19 costs and more normalized incentive compensation is expected to be offset by ongoing wage pressures, investments in our supply chain and digital space, and higher depreciation and amortization expense. And as a reminder, the FAST program costs are reported in SG&A. As a result, we are forecasting SG&A as a percent of sales to slightly deleverage. Adjusted for normalization of the FAST program costs, SG&A is expected to remain relatively flat as a percent of sales. As always, we would encourage you to think about our business between the first half of the year and the second half as this is in line with how we manage the business.
As you model 2021, I want to point out a few items that will impact comparability. Appreciation bonuses impact the second and fourth quarters of 2020, while wage increases of about $13 million per quarter took effect in the third quarter of 2020. Costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain an uncertainty for us in 2020 as our utmost priority remains the health and safety of our team members and our customers. For the first quarter, we anticipate costs related to the pandemic will continue at elevated levels.
Additionally, as you think about the cadence of 2021, our business performance is expected to be stronger in the first quarter, as our comparisons step up starting in the second quarter. The first quarter of 2021 is forecast to have the highest comp performance of the year and correspondingly the highest operating profit growth rate. The second quarter is likely to be our most difficult earnings comparison of the year due to a couple of factors. Please recall the second quarter of 2020 experienced the strongest gross margin performance, driven by the least sales promotional activity. In addition, we expect incremental cost in Q2 of this year as we support the launch of an upgrade to our Neighbor's Club loyalty program.
Moving to below the line. We expect total interest expense for 2021 to be approximately $27 million while our effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 22.5% to 22.8%. Our capital spending is anticipated to range from $450 million to $550 million with more than 80% of that spending going towards growth initiatives. The vast majority of the capital spending increase is attributable to new in-store initiatives and supporting technology for our Life Out Here strategy. Depreciation expense is estimated to increase approximately $50 million. This is above our recent run rate as we accelerate our investments in the business.
For the year, we expect share repurchases to reduce our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by about 1% to 2%. For modeling purposes, we've assumed weighted average shares outstanding of about 116 million shares in 2021. Net income is forecast in the range of $750 million to $800 million or $6.50 to $6.90 per diluted share.
With our strong performance in 2020 and the critical momentum in our business, the team at Tractor Supply is excited about the Life Out Here Strategy. Our clear focus enables us to continue to be the innovation leader in our channel and emerge from the pandemic stronger than before.
Now I'll turn it back to Hal."

As Kurt said, we're laser-focused, and we're focused on continuing to gain market share. We're going to do this in 3 different ways: One is capitalizing on our numerous macro trends benefiting us, second is nurturing our existing new and reengaged customers, and the third is executing our Life Out Here Strategy. So let's talk about each one of those in a little more detail.
We believe that many of the consumer behaviors that we've seen over the last 9 months will continue through most or all of 2021. These trends we've mentioned before, but they include rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption, self-reliant lifestyle movement, consumer spending that's shifting from travel and entertainment to home and land, and an all-time high pet ownership. We exited the year with nearly 19 million Neighbor's Club members. For the full year, over 11 million new identified customers and more than 6 million reactivated customers shopped with us at Tractor Supply. We're seeing strong retention with these customers, and we have plans in place to engage them with new capabilities, marketing and product offerings.
The third way we're going to be focused on gaining share this year is our Life Out Here Strategy, and it really positions us to strengthen and transform the company. As we shared last quarter, there are 5 pillars to our Life Out Here Strategy. The first is to deliver legendary customer service, second is advance our ONETractor capabilities, the third is to operate the Tractor Way, the fourth is Go the Country Mile for our team, and lastly, it's generate healthy shareholder return.
So let me highlight some of our planned efforts that we have this year in support of our strategy. In 2021, we plan to open 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 Petsense stores. Additionally, we plan to remodel 150 to 200 stores with Project Fusion, and to execute Project Side Lot in 150 to 200 of our stores. That brings our total construction activity for the year to 400 to 500 projects. This is a significant step-up in the team's workload and also is being executed in the midst of COVID.
Our Project Fusion remodel program is designed to drive space productivity and to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base. It is a combination of both changes in the store layout and imagery that creates a greater lifestyle impression and drive space allocation for product assortment. Fusion stores help create a more welcoming destination and offer compelling showcase for our brands. Our Side Lot program is a full transformation of the space from primarily a storage location for agriculture equipment to a state-of-the-art outside garden, feed and farm shopping center that also provides for greater convenience through the expansion of buy online pick up at store. While still very early with both of these projects, we continue to be very excited about the sales trends we're seeing from the first tranche of Fusion remodels and Side Lot transformation projects. And importantly, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Given the size of the store -- of our store base, these initiatives represent a multiyear opportunity to continually refresh our store base and drive further comp sales.
Another initiative we have is our FAST team. And they are already having a significant impact on the business. Since their implementation in August, they've taken on execution programs like -- executing merchandising programs like Center Court, End Caps, planogram resets, seasonal programs and sales driving initiatives. And what this is doing is it's really allowing our store teams to focus more on customer service and improve their in-store execution and then really ultimately allow us to focus more on the customer and driving comparable sales. And we're very pleased with the fast rollout.
We're also committed to ensuring our digital capabilities to stay ahead of our customer expectations. We did this in 2020, and we'll continue to do this in 2021 and beyond. Big areas of focus for us in the first half are ship from store; search engine optimization; payment options like Apple Pay and Google Pay; subscriptions, both online and in-store; and also the recent launch of our Pet Rx platform.
As Kurt mentioned, we have plans in place for an upgrade in our Neighbor's Club loyalty program by midyear. And we anticipate that this new program will really drive incremental customer retention and also provides strong incentive to allow us to grow our share of wallet with our customers. As we get closer to the launch of our new Neighbor's Club program, I look forward to sharing more of the details about the changes with you.
Now just stepping back. We're excited about spring. We believe our customers will continue to be focused on their homes as their oasis and creating their own experiences whether that's through things like gardening, grilling or homesteading with their family and friends and neighbors. Spring Chick Days create great retail theater and support existing and new customers who want to expand their flocks. This was a big category for us last year, and we expect it to be so this year. And we will have a broader selection than we have historically of chicken coops. Tractor Supply is the clear destination for this on-trend category.
Given the strong trends we're seeing in our companion animal categories and the recent growth in pet ownership, we're focused on being a more complete resource for pet parents. In store, this includes relevant product assortment and brands, expansion of self-serve pet wash locations across 150 to 200 stores, and the build-out of 50 to 75 additional pet wellness centers. Currently, about 1,600 stores have vet services in-store through our mobile vet clinics. Starting this quarter, pet prescriptions can be fulfilled online at Tractor Supply, as I mentioned earlier. In our app, we're now offering on-demand veterinary advice from a team of experienced veterinary professionals. Our customers can call, chat or e-mail a team of veterinary professionals to get all their pet health questions answered. These expanded and new services allow Tractor Supply to offer a complete solution to care for our customers' pets, whether in-store or online. Our stores will be ready for the change of seasons as we move into spring.
In closing, we have a unique opportunity. We compete in an attractive and fragmented market. We have a track record of success and outperformance in our business. We see a unique opportunity to capitalize on the powerful customer trends we are benefiting from and to emerge from the pandemic, stronger, transformed company. Our goal is to make strategic investments that enable us to create greater competitive advantage, capture the opportunity we've discussed and generate shareholder value.
With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions."

I think the guidance that we provided is very consistent with the commentary that we had at the end of the third quarter, and I think aligned with the spirit of the dialogue in our opening remarks, which is that we expect COVID to remain a large kind of consumer-driving force for the foreseeable future, certainly into the fall, if not for the balance of the year. And as a consequence of that, many of the macro trends, which have benefited us, will continue. We also think a number of these macro trends are sticky regardless of COVID.
And so we kind of see those 2 coming together in a way that shapes the year as follows. The first quarter we're in now, we expect momentum in this quarter and our results in this quarter will be much like what we saw in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 with elevated sales levels. And then as we start to comp on top of those in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 this year, we do expect that the comps will start to turn to more normal levels. And the collectiveness of that will kind of compile the guidance we guided between minus 2% and plus 1%. So it is heavily weighted in the first quarter with kind of Q2, Q3, Q4, recognizing it will be comping on top of last year's elevated levels. But with still likely strong underlying momentum supporting those quarters."

We're certainly looking to piece apart our various initiatives, and we have some pretty sophisticated analytics tools that allow us to do that. At these more elevated volume levels, it is a little bit harder to see than what you might see in a normal mid-single-digit comp environment. But I will say that we're -- it's our view that we are gaining share and winning in all the categories that we participate in. And that's really consistent across the board, whether you're looking at industry level data or we're talking with vendors. And so that would lead us to believe that not only are we benefiting from the macro trends, but the work that we're doing to support the business is also helping with that. And I'll call out a few things that kind of give us that sense.
First off, I'll point to kind of some data sets around our customer. Our unaided brand awareness due -- in part due to our national television campaign that we launched last March is up 8 points in the year. That's a very significant improvement in unaided brand awareness. And then the benefit that we've seen of that is a -- the most customers that we've ever had shop our store in 1 year last year, including 11 million new customers and 6 million reacquired customers. And those customers are shopping with us at repeat rates that are at kind of all-time highs. And those repeat shopping rates are -- for the new customers are holding -- have held through the year. So whether it was a new customer we saw in March or April or May, or a new customer that we saw in October, November, December, all those repeat shopping rates are holding at all-time highs.
And then last thing I'll talk about is, if you look at our team members and you look like our customer SAT scores, our -- if you look at the customers' perception of safety and health and well-being in our stores, customers seem to be voting with their wallets and shopping at Tractor Supply, indicative of both our strong transactions, but also our strong ticket. And I think that would speak to the fact that customers are certainly aggregating their ticket. You're hearing that from other retailers, more units per basket driving basket up, but a lot of these retailers are talking about negative comp transactions. With us, it's very balanced with about half coming from comp transactions and about half coming from average ticket. So we're seeing that stock up, but we're also seeing more transactions in the store.
So it's hard to kind of piece it together, but we do think the initiatives we're taking, the support we've given the business on inventory and adding staffing, our focus on cleanliness, plus our digital efforts and our early efforts around Fusion and Side Lot and FAST are adding to the share -- are creating -- helping us drive share gains and kind of add it to the macro trends we're seeing."

But if you look at the broader landscape of pets and where the shifts are coming, where things are growing, and you look at the various -- kind of what's playing out in specialty, through that work and then us revisiting our real estate model as a part of that, we made the decision to reduce the long-term store count expectations that we have for that business. And in doing so, that led us to revisit the value that we had on that business on our balance sheet.
And so we've now kind of reset our expectations for the new store counts of that business. We've hired a new leader for the Petsense business. And we are -- we will continue to invest in Petsense as we see opportunities. And it's -- as I said, the business is doing well. We do think it's gaining share in the specialty space.

And really, the question, as I understand it, is about the outlook on the operating margin, the flow-through going forward. One important thing that I pointed out in our prepared remarks is we had tremendous upside and benefit in 2020 from the gross margin side of the business. And the principal drivers with that was for the majority of the year, we had favorable transportation. And the most significant was unusually low levels of promotion and clearance. I mean the inventory, at some points, really felt like it was going hand to mouth to the consumer.
And we anticipate this year, in 2021, as we still have some of that extended pandemic demand before we start to cycle into that, that there's benefit on less promotion and clearance. We'll start to normalize on that. The important thing is to manage the business, ensuring that we're everyday low price, we're giving our customers a great value in our product enterprise. And over the years, we're going to manage the operating margin, ensuring that we continue to gain market share. And the important thing is that there may begin to be in the next couple of years as inventory more normalizes and more clearance exposure normalizes, there's some anticipated risk with gross margin.
So we'll continue to manage gross margin with our benefits of our driving and staying at EDLP, not anticipating to revert back to the promotional activity in the past. But with our investments in the business in the next couple of years to continue to gain this market share, we anticipate still staying around that range. We think it's a great sweet spot to allow us to continue to hit those revenue growth targets and to continue to gain on the market share. So we want to manage to a reasonable operating margin to continue our opportunity to gain market share. And our outlook for 2021 and the long term really anticipates that. And as we progress, we'll continue to update you as we see more visibility and as things change."

As we think about traffic and ticket in 2021, there's a lot of variables and still some uncertainty as we begin to lap that. We're going to be nimble and have shown in the past that we can shift very well to that. So as we think about the business with ticket and traffic, I'll give you some thoughts on ticket drivers. Certainly, some level of inflation that could be driving ticket. If there's continued trip consolidation, it helps in the ticket. But other aspects on traffic as -- areas such as trip consolidation, if there's a bit more normalization on trip consolidation as we begin to cycle some of the COVID demand, and if there's inflation, it sometimes has an offset on the traffic.
So point being, there's a number of variables in there. And as we cycle this, we see our opportunity in both categories, and there can be some risk and shift in both. And we've contemplated those aspects in our guidance for comp sales as we begin to cycle the COVID lift that we saw starting in Q2 of 2020. And we anticipate that there's not a meaningful shift from either one as we see it at this point, but both have variables that could drive it up or down."

Steve, a couple of things I'll say. First of all, on the Neighbor's Club program, we are very pleased with the growth in the ownership of that -- I mean, the growth in the membership of that program, reaching 19 million members, representing approximately 60% of our total sales. We're seeing very strong engagement rates with those customers. And we have plans, as we've talked about, to reinvigorate that program in the first half of this year, which I think will drive a step change in engagement with those customers and also migration upward of their spend. So we're very -- we're looking forward to that promotion and getting it out there and look forward to sharing more details with you at our next earnings call on it.
As it relates to our new customers, we've mentioned in the past that we see approximately 20% of our new customers return and shop with us within 28 days. And that trend really hasn't changed since the beginning of the year. It's held very stable. And it's 2 or 3 points higher than what we would have seen in a historic period when we cohorted new customers. And then I would say it's not -- we also continue to see strong repurchase rates as you get out to kind of 2 months at the 56-day count and at 3 months. And so we're very pleased with their reengagement. We see them engaging first in categories like poultry and dog and pet. But then they start to broaden their purchases across things like apparel and garden. And if they started in pet, they might move to poultry or vice versa. And a higher percentage of these groups than our normal business starts online and does a pickup in store, and then you'll see in their next purchase then coming into the store for purchase. And our new customer SAT scores are higher than historic as well.
So I'd say all around. We are pleased with the 19 million numbers. They represent the growth that we had this year, particularly in the midst of the pandemic. Our sign up is really at the register there, face to face. People are really trying to check out much faster as we all know. So the ability to still sign up those Neighbor's Clubs members and gain the millions that we did this year, we're very pleased with. And then the new customers are exhibiting very strong reengagement behavior."

And what I'd say is the -- I think the dynamics that are playing out in the market right now, whether it's with customers or vis-à-vis our competitors, those dynamics are really playing to the sweet spots of Tractor Supply. First off, people are struggling with in stocks, and I think you're going to see more of that as we get into the spring with the supply chain disruption that's out there. And our team has done an outstanding job managing inventory through the year. You saw how we ended the year with inventory above last year. And we're tracking to continue with that at those levels, if not higher, as Kurt mentioned in his opening remarks. We plan for our spring shipments to arrive earlier than they have historically. And so while we are seeing some container backlog, it will -- we are going to be able to manage through that and get it kind of in on a normal time frame, but that's to our benefit.
So I think anywhere where you've made investments in inventory and you've leaned in there, anywhere where you're making investments in customer service because right now that makes such a big difference in this environment, and we've certainly done that through the net hiring of 10,000 team members and providing appreciation bonuses and others and raises to drive their engagement. Also in technology, if you've invested in technology and you can do curbside pickup, and you can do same-day, next-day delivery, and you can do those with great customer service, that leads to advantages as well.
So I think the scale that we have in our distribution systems, the scale that we have in technology, the leverage and scale that we have with our vendors, and then, of course, our advantage of our 42,000 team members, which wake up every day looking to provide legendary service, all that just plays well for us. I mean we're -- and then you think about the convenience, the location of our stores. And that's why if you go across every category, we're confident that we're taking share in a significant way. 
I mean if you look at our C.U.E. business being up over 20% for the quarter, that's -- and you think about the proxy -- using that as a proxy for the businesses that are in there around animal feed and pet food and others, those rates are well above industry estimates for those categories, and certainly, any -- a lot of other companies that are out there reporting that play in those categories. So I think it really just speaks to the business model of Tractor, the resiliency of it and the foundation of it and then the investments that we're making day-to-day to ensure that our customers and our new customers are having a great experience."

So this is what the full focus of our marketing team is focused on is exactly this, is we've got -- we've invested over the last 1.5 years or 2 in our CRM capabilities, moving that platform to the Azure cloud, upgrading our analytical capabilities, adding new personalization tooling in place and also looking at behaviors, whether on their site -- on the site or inside of the store and then looking for kind of like comparing them to lookalike shoppers. And so whether it's e-mails that those new customers get or whether it's digital banner ads, we're retargeting them. All those sorts of kind of marketing channels and vehicles are being used to engage with these customers and encourage them to reshop with us. And in addition, obviously, we just have the investments we're making in our team members, the investments we're making in our store experience, the investments we're making in inventory and those sorts of things that drive repeat behavior as well.
One interesting anecdote that I'll give on this is we ask our customers in our checkout survey, kind of post-purchase survey, what their top criteria were for why they selected to shop with Tractor Supply. And typically, the responses are similar to what any other retailer would have with price and location convenience, having the right product, customer service, those sorts of things that are kind of the dominant criteria for shopping for retail. During this pandemic, over the last 6 months, the #1 and #2 criteria have been cleanliness and safety. Never in my 20-plus years of retail have I seen those 2 criteria at the top of a customer's decision-making criteria. And so that's why we've invested so much in those areas. And I highlighted the tens of millions of dollars we've spent on those areas in the last quarter."

I mean we saw a bit of elevation as we worked our way through the year. In Q4, we still saw a bit of a modest level of inflation, less than 100 basis points of commodity inflation into the product cost. We anticipate that as all of the inflation information, as I know everyone's seen, is certainly at higher levels, we're anticipating that to accelerate in 2021. We've seen where inflation on commodities can rise as quickly as it did. It can also shift, as you know, just as quickly.
So like we said in our prepared remarks, we're planning for 2021 on a number of scenarios. But in our guidance, we assume that over the year, a weighted average of about 1% to 2% inflation into the product cost and that certainly could vary first half versus second half of the year. And right now, we're seeing the points that Seth mentioned on grains and steel being primary drivers of some inflation at this point. So as we picked up an assumption, that range of about 1% to 2% is where we landed in our assumption."

We are planning for the pet category to continue to remain strong and to overperform relative to our overall business in the year. I think on the last call, we talked about poultry and chickens and flocks and how they're a bit of an annuity stream given that they have a 7-, 8-year lifespan. Obviously, pet is very much the same way. With pet adoption up at an all-time high, those pets, as they grow, are only going to -- they're going to move from puppy food to adult food. We're seeing that, by the way, in our trends. Typically with dogs, as they get a little older, they eat a little more as they get bigger. So we're actually seeing that -- the benefit from that a little bit on the tonnage side.
And we expect the humanization of pet will remain very strong this entire year as people continue to work from home really for the foreseeable future, potentially all of 2021. And so they're around their pets. They're buying toys. They're buying snacks. They're upgrading their bed. They're getting them a new bed. All those things I expect will continue this year. And as I said, we're very pleased with our pet business. We are confident we're gaining share in our pet business. We're seeing strong growth in our pet business, both in-store just through brick-and-mortar channels as well as online. And certainly, the sweet spot for us on pet is our omnichannel, where we're seeing significant amount of pet purchases online, picked up in store.
And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're investing heavily in this category to remain a strong destination for our customers in it, whether it was the release recently of our new Pet Rx solution online, whether it's the rollout of both the subscriptions in-store to support in a similar way that we have it online, whether it's the addition of 150 to 200 pet watch stations this year, and then also the build-out of more pet wellness clinics in our stores to support the mobile pet clinics that we have that drive significant engagement with our stores from our customers.
So we feel really good about where we are in pet, and we'll be continuing to invest here. I guess I neglected also to mention, my apologies, is that our marketing campaign that we've been doing in the past year. We have a significant amount of dedicated marketing, both TV and digital devoted to pet, and it's systemic, meaning, it's always on, and we do spike it at certain periods. But it's a consistent program that we're doing now. First time we've done that. We've been doing that for about 6 or 9 months."

So we've got over 50 of these Side Lots in -- underway right now. Some, we're in the process of applying for permits. Some, we're in the final stages of getting the certificate of occupancy. We've got 100-plus more scheduled for the year, and we're very excited about their potential. And the team is doing an excellent job kind of navigating this environment to get those built. It's -- in the context of COVID, you've got construction crews at a time. So we'll have to quarantine for a couple of weeks if one of the team members on the project tests positive. You've got city municipalities that -- getting permitting done is very difficult. Getting someone to come out and do a certificate of occupancy is much slower. And the team is just doing an excellent job managing through all those twists and turns. We're very -- we remain very bullish on Side Lot. And like I said, a number of them underway.

2021 is off to a great start for Tractor Supply. I'm extremely proud and appreciative of the hard work by the more than 42,000 Tractor Supply and Petsense team members. Once again, they took care of each other and tirelessly served our customers who depend on us to live the Out Here lifestyle. I also want to thank all of our supply chain and vendor partners. We've been operating in the COVID-19 environment for over a year now, and the Tractor Supply system has more than risen to the occasion as they strive to serve our mission and values every single day. 
While we anticipated that we would have our strongest growth of the year in the first quarter, our results were significantly ahead of our expectations. When you couple this performance with the continuing momentum we are seeing in the second quarter, the positive macro environment and our strong customer trends, we are adjusting our comp outlook to mid- to high single-digit growth in 2021. Kurt will share more details on the improved financial outlook for the year across our key financial metrics. 
Throughout the pandemic, our utmost priority has been the health and safety of our team members and customers. We continue to incur significant incremental expense for items like paid time-off, mask and testing. We remain committed to following the advice of the CDC and other medical professionals to protect our team and customers. 
As we enter the vaccination phase, we are committed to helping our team members who choose to get vaccinated to do so. We are providing a onetime payment of $50 and allowing time-off as needed for all team members who elect to receive a COVID-19 vaccines. To further alleviate the barriers to receiving a vaccine, we have partnered with a third-party provider to facilitate on-site vaccination at our 8 distribution centers and store support center. 
During the quarter, we also announced our entry into an agreement to acquire [ Ashland Farm and Home ], a retailer with 167 stores across 11 states. This is an exciting step for Tractor Supply as we look to expand our footprint in the Midwest with the high-quality assets of [ Orscheln Farm and Home ]. We have always had great respect for [ Barry Orscheln ] and team for the strong connection they have with customers in the communities they serve, along with their industry knowledge and capabilities. With our shared values and passion for the Out Here lifestyle, we look forward to bringing together our highly complementary cultures and teams to realize the long-term value and benefit that we expect this acquisition to deliver over time. As we previously disclosed, we received a second request from the FTC as part of their review of the transaction and are cooperating with that confidential review. Accordingly, we are limited in the comments we can make about the transition at this time. 
I hope you all saw our release this week with our updated ESG tear sheet for 2020, which provides new and updated performance metrics in context related to our environmental sustainability efforts, our commitment to our team members and communities and corporate governance. This report helps us provide detailed information and progress on our ESG journey. In addition, we laid out our commitment to provide new targets in the fall this year as it relates to our greenhouse gas emission plan and our aspirational goals for diversity, equity inclusion. These initiatives make great businesses for Tractor Supply. As a purpose-driven company, setting targets for ourselves creates long-term value and our potential to have a positive impact on the world. We remain committed to constant improvement on this journey. 
Now let's turn to the business review for the first quarter of 2021. We had exceptional net sales gains of 42.5%, with comparable store sales up 38.6%. We materially benefited in the quarter from transitory factors such as stimulus spending, favorable weather and inflation. Importantly, however, the underlying foundation of our business is robust, and we're gaining share across all categories, online and in stores and also with existing customers and new customers. Our Neighbor's Club membership reached 20 million members strong. This is an important milestone for our loyalty program as we know that they are customers that shop us more frequently and they spend more money with us. 
We saw 2.5 million new customers shop with us in the quarter. And that's an increase of over 30% over last year. Reengaged customers also exhibited strong growth, up over 12% from the first quarter of 2020. And customer retention for both our new and reengaged customers continues to run above last year. 
We saw strong growth across all product categories and geographic regions of the country. Comps for each month of the quarter were above 30%. And our growth was well-balanced between transactions and ticket growth. The business, like the last few quarters, continues to be a very consistent and stable. 
For the fourth quarter, our e-commerce saw strong triple-digit growth and increased significantly as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we did last year to improve our omnichannel capabilities continues to resonate with our customers. Ongoing improvements to the customer experience for better search capabilities and enhanced personalization are being recognized by our customers. 
As we've experienced in the last several quarters, we continue to see strong performance and market share gains in our consumable, usable and edible categories with growth in the mid-20% range. More specifically, we continue to be very encouraged by the trends we're seeing within our pet and poultry categories, where we're driving shopping frequency and market share gains. 
Over the last 15 months, our unaided brand awareness scores are up 17 percentage points. I believe these type of metrics serve as leading indicators of our brand health and future spending patterns of our customers. We continue to execute our shift away from print advertising to brand building and digital marketing. We're currently airing our national TV spring advertising campaign that highlights the strength of Tractor Supply's offering to serve the seasonal needs of our customers to take care of their land, pets and animals. Overall, the strong first quarter highlighted the unique advantages that we have at Tractor Supply. Our team members delivered exceptional results in a generation-defining moment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kurt to discuss some of the details of the first quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year."

We're excited to be starting fiscal 2021 on such a positive note as we performed well ahead of our expectations. Let me share some further color on our strong first quarter results and our upward revision",1553,"Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. We're excited to be starting fiscal 2021 on such a positive note as we performed well ahead of our expectations. Let me share some further color on our strong first quarter results and our upward revisions to our guidance for the year. 
Our record first quarter earnings were driven by positive momentum in all areas of the business. Comp sales increased 38.6% as the trends we experienced over the past year continued throughout the first quarter of 2021. Traffic increased 21%, and average ticket grew 17.6%. All geographic areas reported sales gains of at least 30% positive comparison to last year. 
Big ticket purchases had robust growth, up strong double digits that well outpaced our average comp sales increase. Safe, fencing, utility vehicles, trailers and outdoor power equipment, such as the zero-turn mowers, were some of the notable gainers in the quarter. As Hal mentioned, we did benefit from more transitory factors like stimulus payments, favorable weather and inflation that had a positive impact on the sales in the quarter. In total, we estimate that about 1/3 of our comparable store sales growth in the first quarter is attributable to these transitory factors. 
Our best estimate is that more favorable weather for the quarter contributed about 400 basis points to comps. Both January and February were colder than last year, with February being the coldest month in 30 years. While the last few weeks of March turned to a favorable spring weather in many of our markets. We also saw retail price inflation, primarily in commodities, which contributed around 300 basis points to our comp sales performance. 
The impact of stimulus payments is more difficult to quantify, but we recognize that consumers had more cash to spend during the quarter, and we believe Tractor Supply benefited from this in Q1. Towards the end of the quarter, in line with the timing of stimulus payments, we saw customer spending at elevated levels, especially in big ticket items. Our best estimate is that stimulus contributed somewhere in the mid-single digits to our first quarter sales comps. 
Even factoring in the transitory benefits, we believe the underlying health of our business is structurally advantaged. Trends towards higher spending and consumables continued through the quarter with pet, bird and livestock feeds showing significant growth from last year. We saw growth in the quarter despite lapping last year's strong stock up buying that occurred late in the first quarter of 2020 at the start of the pandemic. 
As we've said for the past few quarters, we see the growth in our C.U.E. categories as more evidence of an enduring consumer shift to higher pet adoptions and ownership, new customer hobbies like backyard poultry and gardening, along with trip consolidation. For the first quarter, our gross margin increased by 148 basis points to 35.2% of sales, which resulted in gross profit increasing to nearly $984 million in the first quarter. This quarter marked the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion.  
Consistent with the trends since the beginning of the pandemic, this quarter's increase was primarily driven by a lower level of sales promotions and clearance activity. We also benefited from a positive product mix towards higher-margin categories. And consistent with our guidance, we received approximately 40 basis points of benefit from vendor funding for the field activity support teams, or FAST initiative. These factors were partially offset by higher transportation costs, which was a headwind for gross margin. Domestic and import freight costs have increased significantly as well as fuel costs. And we expect these trends to continue throughout 2021. 
SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 27%, an improvement of 103 basis points. This improvement was primarily attributable to significant leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the strong increase in our comparable store sales. This leverage was partially offset by 3 factors: Higher incentive compensation given the strong sales performance, COVID-related costs, and higher operating expenses to support the elevated volumes. COVID-related costs were approximately $28 million, generally in line with prior quarters, as we continue to take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of our team members and customers. Additional overtime, temporary labor and other costs were also incurred to maintain high service levels. 
Operating profit dollars more than doubled compared to prior year to $231 million, an operating profit margin of 8.3%, an improvement of 251 basis points. Net income was $181 million, an increase of 117%. Diluted EPS was $1.55, representing an increase of 118% versus the first quarter of 2020. During the first quarter, we returned $314 million to shareholders through the combination of our share repurchases and dividends. 
Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong. Merchandise inventories were $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of about 2% in average inventory per store. This level of inventory is still lighter than we would like, given the momentum of the business. And we are working with our suppliers and our vendors to build stock to support this momentum. The added supply chain costs and freight expense necessary to rebuild inventory is reflected in our updated guidance we provided. 
Moving now to our guidance for 2021. The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccine rollout will have on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results remains uncertain. We continue to plan for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes, remaining nimble and adjusting as necessary. Our updated guidance reflects the strong results from the first quarter and the positive momentum we see in our business continuing into the second quarter. While the current environment and momentum are both favorable, we recognize that COVID-19 pandemic is not completely behind us and that economic conditions can change quickly. Please keep in mind that the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance. 
Against the backdrop of what we know today, we are updating our guidance to a net sales range of $11.4 billion to $11.7 billion, with comparable store sales growth of 5% to 8%. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.4% to 9.7% of sales, a step-up from our prior guidance. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $7.05 to $7.40. This compares to our previous earnings range of $6.50 to $6.90 per diluted share. 
Compared to our initial outlook for the year, our forecast does reflect higher transportation costs and product inflation. We experienced increasing pressures from these factors during the first quarter and expect them to continue to be a headwind throughout 2021. In addition, we have a unique opportunity with the positive customer trends and momentum in the business. We are committed to investing in store and supply chain labor as we look to provide legendary customer service to meet our customers' expectations. 
I want to share additional context on our outlook for the second quarter. While we begin to lap more challenging sales and earnings comps, we currently see sales momentum continue, partially fueled by stimulus payments. We expect a positive sales comp in the second quarter in the mid single-digit range. Please keep in mind, we'll be cycling our strongest gross margin performance of the prior year in Q2, where we benefited from minimal promotional or clearance activity as well as a favorable product mix. We are expecting gross margin decline in Q2 due to higher transportation costs, a less favorable product mix and a slight return to promotional activity. We also anticipate a modest onetime headwind in the second quarter relating to the rollout of our enhanced Neighbor's Club loyalty program. 
In terms of SG&A for the second quarter, COVID-related expenses are expected to moderate from the Q1 levels, but are forecasted to be slightly higher than original expectations entering the year, along with higher labor cost to support these elevated volumes. For the second half of 2021, we anticipate tailwinds such as stimulus payments to moderate and performance to be more in line with our original guidance, expecting a modest decline in comp sales. Longer term, we continue to believe the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the halves of the year. 
As I've stated before, a key component of our financial model is the strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. In January, we increased our annual dividend by 30% from $0.40 a share to $0.52. For 2021, we anticipate share repurchases in a range of $700 million to $800 million. 
In summary, it is an exciting time at Tractor Supply. We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and see positive momentum carrying into the second quarter. We see an opportunity to retain the loyalty of our longtime and newer customers by investing in our business to maintain everyday low prices and improve customer service, strengthen our supply chain and grow our digital commerce, all in support of our commitment to driving strong shareholder returns for the long term. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Hal."

I'd like to spend the next portion of the call covering some of the key customer trends we're seeing in the business, providing an update on our Life Out Here strategy and highlighting our spring programs. 
Our customer base is experiencing robust, broad-based shopping patterns that provide significant opportunities for growth. These types of trends can simply be described as once in a generation. We're seeing growth in all our customer segments and across all value tiers of spending with strong retention of existing and new customers. The fastest growth customer segment is our core farm and ranch. This segment is very healthy as rural economies, for the most part, were less impacted by the pandemic and are recovering at a steeper and more robust rate. Importantly, we're gaining wallet share with our core customer as our highest and medium spend customer tiers are outpacing our lower spend customer tier. 
As mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong new customer growth and notably, are also seeing strong customer retention. As an example, for our new customers from the first quarter of 2020 last year, more than 50% have returned to shop with Tractor Supply. This is about 300 basis points higher than the cohort from the first quarter of 2019. 
We are seeing significant growth in our millennial shoppers. Over the last 12 months, we've seen a 400 basis point shift in the customer age cohorts of 18 to 45 years old. This demographic has long resisted many of the traditional generational norms, things like household formation and homeownership. But the pandemic has shocked this generation and accelerated their embracement of these types of activities. There continues to be a net migration out of urban areas, largely driven by the millennial segment. The most robust homeownership growth is in the millennial cohort, with the growth coming in suburban and rural areas. We believe the growth in this customer segment has staying power and could be a structural game changer for us. 
Another structural customer trend that is working to our advantage is the significant increase in pet-owning households and number of pets adopted. Compared to the overall U.S. household pet ownership of approximately 2/3, our customers over-index in pet ownership by about 10 points. And our current survey work with our customers indicate 25% have recently acquired and adopted a new pet. New companion animal ownership acts as an annuity for our business as these puppies and kittens grow up and have growing life cycle needs. We're also uniquely positioned to offer a growing menu of services such as pet wash, vet clinics, prescriptions and televet services. Whether it is more food treats, toys, containment and more, the humanization of pet provides us with future opportunities for growth. 
These customer trends are an indication that we continue to benefit from the numerous tailwinds, such as pet ownership, the millennial urban exodus, backyard poultry, home standing and home as an oasis. We believe many of these consumer trends will be enduring shifts well into the future. Our brand momentum is stronger than ever and we're investing to ensure we continue to play offense in the context of these trends. 
We are making excellent progress on our Life Out Here strategy and initiatives. At the beginning of April, we announced the relaunch of our Neighbor's Club program to be even bigger and better. When we launched Neighbor's Club nationwide in 2017, our vision was to create a unique Out Here community for our customers and a place for them to connect with us. The Neighbor's Club has permitted us to show appreciation to our loyal customers and to accumulate actionable customer data that has allowed us to deliver to our customers more relevant and personalized communications. Over the last 4 years, our loyalty program has served us well to be able to thank participating customers for being loyal customers, provide rewards and special offers they value, learn more about their purchasing trends and interest and ultimately, increase customer loyalty to Tractor Supply stores. Today, our Neighbor's Club program has over 20 million members and is comprised of our most valuable customers. It is a perfect time to upgrade the program with the introduction of points and 3 tiers of status. Now, neighbors, can earn points on their purchases and redeem them for more rewards. They can earn their way to different levels, so that when they spend, they earn more. With the new features of Neighbor's Club, we believe we have more tools and features than ever to help facilitate upward migration and spending and mitigate downward migration of spending by our members. 
The changes to Neighbor's Club were specifically based on our customers' feedback. The new rewards and benefits of Neighbor's Club are relevant to the customers' lifestyle, such as trailer rentals and shipping benefits. We believe that the new Neighbor's Club benefits, we have an opportunity to support our customers in a more meaningful way. This, in turn, will provide us a platform for multiyear trajectory for growth as a clear business driver for us. 
More broadly, we are aggressively advancing our Life Out Here strategy. The FAST team is at scale and providing significant improvement in the execution of our merchandising initiatives. We continue to forecast about 150 to 200 side lot transformations to occur this year. As of today, we have over 40 stores operating and continue to refine our learnings for future build-outs, of which 35 are currently under construction. 
Project Fusion store remodels are also on track for completion of 150 to 200 stores this year. In addition, new stores are being built as Fusion stores with improved layout, signage, SKU expansion and adjacencies. While still early, we're very pleased with our customers' response to both the side lot transformation and the Project Fusion store layout. 
Now turning to Spring. Our stores in e-commerce are well positioned to take advantage of the seasonal change to serve our customers. We remain committed to being the zero-turn headquarters with our market-leading assortment from Toro, Bad Boy and Cub Cadet. We have substantially expanded our assortment in grilling, raised bed garden and other backyard categories. And to capture share of wallet in the lawn and garden category, we have expanded our offerings on core products like long handled tools, wheelbarrows, trailers and tillers. And chick days are underway with millions of customers relying on us for their poultry passions. Leveraging our localization efforts, we're expanding our tool crow to an additional 400 stores. 
And on the product innovation front, with Carhart to open a new store within a store concept. This concept was created with our customer at the center of the shopping experience. And by partnering with Carhart to double our selection, our stores have even more of what makes Tractor Supply a destination for workwear. The new store within a store concept will roll out in more than 100 Tractor Supply stores in 2021 with additional stores to be added next year. 
To wrap up, I couldn't be prouder of the Tractor Supply team as they've remained agile in the face of a very challenging operating environment. My thanks and appreciation go out to each of them for helping to take care of each other and our customers, while operating in a record-setting pace. We have an incredibly strong business and foundation. We see more positive macro factors than we did at the beginning of the year. Customers are shopping with us in record numbers, and we're investing in multiple initiatives to retain them and provide more reasons to shop with us in the future. We participate in a large and attractive market that we're working to expand further with initiatives such as side lot that will add to our product offering. By doing the right thing for our team members and customers, we're executing our Life Out Here strategy and building a stronger company for our shareholders.

Can you give us a sense for where you think those customers were shopping before Tractor Supply? Or is it more likely they're just new to the farm and ranch retail industry, and as a result, you're grabbing a disproportionate share of those incremental new customers?

As you mentioned, we've seen a significant amount of new customers shopping with us over the last 12-plus months with above-average retention rates continuing to hold. And as we mentioned, over 50% of the Q1 2020 cohort has shopped us again in the last 12 months. So very strong retention. 
When we look at the additional customer data, I'd highlight 2 big drivers of the new customers. First would be in the core farm and ranch. And that very much is a market share gain, where these are customers that have land, have animals, have had -- our value proposition has appealed to them over time. And for a variety of reasons, they're choosing to now shop with Tractor Supply. And I think that has a lot to do with the investments we've made in technology, the investments we've made in safety and health and cleanliness in our stores and certainly, the focus we've had on inventory and customer service. 
And then the second thing I'd bring up is kind of the millennial customer, which we highlighted in our prepared remarks. This segment had a very large increase as a percentage of our sales in Q1. And really, when we look at the data, it really is around the migration of people out of urban environments into suburban and rural environments. And that generation starting to kind of take -- form households, buy homes, and as part of that, the Out Here lifestyle is part of the aspiration that they have when they moved out to the suburbia or when they moved out to rural America. And we do really feel like this is a structural trend that will continue to provide growth for us as we look out the balance of this year and beyond."

Is it right to think that your -- the difference is all going to come from -- you're getting about 1,000 basis points of stimulus benefit in 2Q, and you probably won't get that in 3Q or 4Q?

And the reason I'd point that out is, last year, some of the drivers in Q2 that we're about to lap were with the pandemic, you saw transportation costs and certain commodity prices actually declining. And so that was really a favorable item in there. We are now lapping that first quarter where there was really no promotional or clearance activity. In Q1, the factors that were drivers that we pointed out in Q1, such as the favorable product mix is the last quarter where before we start lapping some of that favorable product mix where the discretionary higher-margin items were a big portion of the mix. 
So to give you the level of quantifying of it coming off of that basis, I'd give you the 4 key factors, and I'll put it in order of magnitude. Lapping those lower transportation costs with higher transportation costs right now would be the first. Lapping a favorable product mix in Q2 last year, where the discretionary higher-margin items were a much higher percent than Q, would be second. The inflation impact and then followed by, as I mentioned, the onetime Neighbor's Club impact for launching the points and rewards-based program is a great way of summarizing it."

We are very pleased with the performance of our online business, as we noted in our press release and in our prepared remarks, our fourth quarter now of over 100% growth in the business and its penetration rates co",568,"Yes, Kate, and thanks for your question. We are very pleased with the performance of our online business, as we noted in our press release and in our prepared remarks, our fourth quarter now of over 100% growth in the business and its penetration rates continue to increase as an overall percent of our sales. Buy Online Pickup in Store continues to remain approximately 75% of our digital sales. And with curbside pickup, still being about 75% of that Buy Online Pickup in Store. So that's -- so the customer behavior, even with the growth, continues to kind of stay similar to what it has been in the past. But what we are seeing is just a much more -- our execution, both from the customer order, all the way through to customer pickup, is just much more efficient than it was this time last year. And that's really due to all the investments that we've made and just the outstanding execution by the team. 
And I'll give a brief example of that. We rolled out our first mobile app last year in the summertime. We now have over 1 million downloads of that app, and it's becoming a material portion of our digital sales. As the customer does a Buy Online Pickup in Store order in our app, they can note the type of vehicle they're driving, the model, the color and then any special pickup requirements they have, like maybe opening up the back of an SUV and putting it in there without even engaging with a customer. Then, as soon as the order is placed, we have headsets in our stores for every single team member. That task, within moments, after the order is placed, to sit down to that store, the team member acknowledges, and well over 90% of our orders are now being picked in less than an hour. As soon as the order -- the order is completed by the team member, they then check it in with our mobile handheld, which we doubled the capacity of those in our stores last year, and then they take the order up to BOPUS Lockers, which we just rolled out in November of last year. The average store has 3. And then the customer gets a notification saying it's ready. On their way into our store, we have an On My Way functionality the customer can hit that. As soon as the customer enters our parking lot, the team member gets a notification saying they're ready for the order to be picked up. And then, in the headset, it will actually tell them, Kurt Barton, in a white Ford F-150 is ready for their order, and they'll walk right out, and they will drop the order in the back of the SUV, as it was indicated. We're doing well over 90% of that in minutes now. And then, they take the handheld device out there, complete the order because we've rolled out additional Wi-Fi access points on the front and the customer drives off. And that is a big percentage of our orders, the customer scenario I just articulated. And the vast majority of the technology as well as the operational components of that are all new from last year. And so just real kudos to the team for really just implementing a large number of technologies last year as well as operational procedures."

Peter, I'd say our data sets that we're looking at as it relates to kind of the kind of the urban departure into rural and suburban is really a combination of our own data, plus what we're pulling in from external data sources. And if you look at the millennial population in general, this is one that for over almost 10, 15 years now, I think all of us have been wondering if that generation will eventually conform to normal generational activities like householding and buying homes and such. And I do think that the pandemic really shocked that generation, and you're pulling forward now 3 or 4 years of those sorts of activities into a year. If you look at home purchases, if you look at household formations, that generation is spiking above all the other generations in those activities. And the urban home purchases that generation are declining, but rural and suburban are increasing. And we see that in our data set as well as we talked about the millennial cohort increasing by 4 percentage points as a percent of our business in the first quarter. And we're seeing it in our stores in the products that they're buying and in the way they're engaging. I think we've mentioned in the past, we sold 11 million birds last year, and half of those birds went to new customers. And it just shows you a category like poultry, which we're far and away the market share leader in and it's a category that really had a renaissance -- went through a renaissance last year and it's continuing this year in our stores. And you see a lot of new customers coming in buying coops, buying birds, and buying everything that goes along necessary for that passion. And then they're taking it out to their new homes in the suburban rural areas and enjoying the Out Here lifestyle."

And then, if you think about the digital enhancements we made, that's really about staying ahead of the customer as well. And then, also the investment we've made in our brand over the last year.

As Kurt mentioned there, we really had strong momentum coming out of Q1 and exiting Q1. And while we would love more inventory, obviously, as we said there to continue, obviously, to drive sales. We feel very good about our position to continue to drive these sales here in Q2. 
And I'd really bucket the inventory position that we think about really in kind of 3 primary buckets. The first bucket would be kind of our C.U.E.-based product. The team has done an absolutely excellent job making sure that we can continue to stay in stock and be that dependable supplier. And we feel that we can definitely continue to make sure that we can take care of that shopper and customer that's coming in. 
Big ticket is really the second primary bucket, and that's where we really saw that strong demand exiting Q1. And so I would say early in Q2, that's where we were really focused on here, replanning that product that we could bring that in to make sure that we could continue that momentum. And that product's fall in and have been flowing into stores. 
And then third is more on our import side. And the import side is where we did see a little bit more delays as it relates to our inventory position. Most of that is in, call it, our drive aisle type of category. So if you go in our stores, some of the decor, some of the discretionary type areas, those items have been flowing in nicely. Actually, it's really putting us in a great position as we're entering here in the peak of Q2 to make sure our center courts are going to be locked and loaded and full and ready to drive sales. And then we also talked about the quality of inventories better than it's ever been. I mean, our clearance position is in an incredibly good spot. So as you think about that 2% comp inventory, it's also doing healthy quality inventory to drive future sales. So feel really good about where we are to continue to drive that momentum here in Q2."

I'll start, and then I'll let Seth respond to the last part of your question in there. 
So our vendors have certainly been strong supporters of us to be able to fund the cost of the FAST program as we proceed with that. And that's really our commitment. This team is there to help merchandise and help ensure the sale of that product. And it has been a strong contributor. One of the areas that has been an early win in the Life Out Here strategy. And so our vendor funding that we anticipated that funding has really began and started to flow through the P&L, pretty consistent about 40 basis points quarter -- throughout all 4 quarters of the year on the gross margin side. 
The only thing I'll remind you is that we said in the back half of last year, that we would begin to make the investments in the SG&A to build that team, and that cost actually went through the P&L unfunded. And so, the SG&A cost today for FAST is larger than the funding. And as we begin to build this program, it will eventually neutralize over the years. But for this year, there will be starting to lap in the third and fourth quarters some costs on there. But again, for the year, it will average out about 40 basis points of incremental in SG&A, with 40 basis points of benefit on vendor funding. It will differ between the quarters a bit. 
And then, I know Seth can go ahead and talk about the investment."

As Kurt mentioned, just one of the big wins with our Life Out Here strategy. And I just say the timing of the FAST program could not have been better to roll this out with the record volumes that are going through our stores today. Execution has been absolutely excellent among the store teams. Our planogram resets right now are on time, in full, north of 95%, which is a major -- it's a really good improvement from the past. And it's allowing our store teams really to focus on the cleanliness as well as to take care of our customers, which has also been a great win for our supplier partners as well. I mean, they're there to sell products, take care of them and offer that customer service. 
And then finally, from a merchant perspective, we plan to have record number of planogram resets occurring throughout the course of this year. And we were able to uptick that last year. And as we've been able to operate, and we have been operating in this record sales volume windows, our merchants in the past, we did not have a great avenue at times to go after opportunistic buys, things of that nature to really be able to fill in our drive aisles. And we've been able to leverage the FAST team as well as our supplier partners to go after those kind of opportunistic buys so that we can really maximize the sales trends that are out there. So I would just say, overall, I'm just incredibly pleased by the FAST program and just really big high marks to the team that's out there for standing this up and taking care of our supplier base."

2021 is off to a great start for Tractor Supply. I'm extremely proud and appreciative of the hard work by the more than 42,000 Tractor Supply and Petsense team members. Once again, they took care of each other and tirelessly served our customers, who depend on us to live the Out Here lifestyle. 
I also want to thank all of our supply chain and vendor partners. We've been operating in the COVID-19 environment for over a year now, and the Tractor Supply system has more than risen to the occasion as they strive to serve our mission and values every single day. 
While we anticipated that we would have our strongest growth of the year in the first quarter, our results were significantly ahead of our expectations. When you couple this performance with the continuing momentum we are seeing in the second quarter, the positive macro environment and our strong customer trends, we are adjusting our comp outlook to mid- to high single-digit growth in 2021. Kurt will share more details on the improved financial outlook for the year across our key financial metrics. 
Throughout the pandemic, our utmost priority has been the health and safety of our team members and customers. We continue to incur significant incremental expense for items like paid time-off, masks and testing. We remain committed to following the advice of the CDC and other medical professionals to protect our team and customers. 
As we enter the vaccination phase, we are committed to helping our team members who choose to get vaccinated to do so. We are providing a onetime payment of $50 and allowing time-off as needed for all team members who elect to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. To further alleviate the barriers to receiving a vaccine, we have partnered with a third-party provider to facilitate on-site vaccination at our 8 distribution centers and store support center. 
During the quarter, we also announced our entry into an agreement to acquire Orscheln Farm and Home, a retailer with 167 stores across 11 states. This is an exciting step for Tractor Supply as we look to expand our footprint in the Midwest with the high-quality assets of Orscheln Farm and Home. We have always had great respect for Barry Orscheln and team for the strong connection they have with customers in the communities they serve, along with their industry knowledge and capabilities. With our shared values and passion for the Out Here lifestyle, we look forward to bringing together our highly complementary cultures and teams to realize the long-term value and benefit that we expect this acquisition to deliver over time. 
As we previously disclosed, we received a second request from the SEC as part of their review of the transaction and are cooperating with that confidential review. Accordingly, we are limited in the comments we can make about the transaction at this time. 
I hope you all saw our release this week with our updated ESG tear sheet for 2020, which provides new and updated performance metrics and context related to our environmental sustainability efforts, our commitment to our team members and communities and corporate governance. This report helps us provide detailed information and progress on our ESG journey. In addition, we laid out our commitment to provide new targets in the fall this year as it relates to our greenhouse gas emission plan and our aspirational goals for diversity, equity, inclusion. These initiatives make great business sense for Tractor Supply. As a purpose-driven company, setting targets for ourselves creates long-term value and our potential to have a positive impact on the world. We remain committed to constant improvement on this journey. 
Now let's turn to the business review for the first quarter of 2021. We had exceptional net sales gains of 42.5%, with comparable store sales up 38.6%. We materially benefited in the quarter from transitory factors such as stimulus spending, favorable weather and inflation. Importantly, however, the underlying foundation of our business is robust, and we're gaining share across all categories, online and in stores and also with existing customers and new customers. Our Neighbor's Club membership reached 20 million-member strong. This is an important milestone for our loyalty program as we know that they are customers that shop us more frequently and they spend more money with us. 
We saw 2.5 million new customers shop with us in the quarter, and that's an increase of over 30% over last year. Reengaged customers also exhibited strong growth, up over 12% from the first quarter of 2020. And customer retention for both our new and reengaged customers continues to run above last year. 
We saw strong growth across all product categories and geographic regions of the country. Comps for each month of the quarter were above 30%. And our growth was well balanced between transactions and ticket growth. The business, like the last few quarters, continues to be very consistent and stable. 
For the fourth quarter, our e-commerce saw strong, triple-digit growth and increased significantly as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we did last year to improve our omnichannel capabilities continues to resonate with our customers. Ongoing improvements to the customer experience for better search capabilities and enhanced personalization are being recognized by our customers. 
As we've experienced in the last several quarters, we continue to see strong performance and market share gains in our consumable, usable and edible categories with growth in the mid-20% range. More specifically, we continue to be very encouraged by the trends we're seeing within our pet and poultry categories, where we're driving shopping frequency and market share gains. Over the last 15 months, our unaided brand awareness scores are up 17 percentage points. I believe these types of metrics serve as leading indicators of our brand health and future spending patterns of our customers. 
We continue to execute our shift away from print advertising to brand building and digital marketing. We're currently airing our national TV spring advertising campaign that highlights the strengths of Tractor Supply's offering to serve the seasonal needs of our customers to take care of their land, pets and animals. Overall, the strong first quarter highlighted the unique advantages that we have at Tractor Supply. Our team members delivered exceptional results in a generation-defining moment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kurt to discuss some of the details of the first quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year."
329501,710485080,2255853,"Tractor Supply Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Tractor Supply Company","Executives","Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. We're excited to be starting fiscal 2021 on such a positive note as we performed well ahead of our expectations. Let me share some further color on our strong first quarter results and our upward revision",1550,"Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. We're excited to be starting fiscal 2021 on such a positive note as we performed well ahead of our expectations. Let me share some further color on our strong first quarter results and our upward revisions to our guidance for the year. 
Our record first quarter earnings were driven by positive momentum in all areas of the business. Comp sales increased 38.6% as the trends we experienced over the past year continued throughout the first quarter of 2021. Traffic increased 21%, and average ticket grew 17.6%. All geographic areas reported sales gains of at least 30% positive comparison to last year. 
Big-ticket purchases had robust growth, up strong double digits that well outpaced our average comp sales increase. Safes, fencing, utility vehicles, trailers and outdoor power equipment, such as the zero-turn mowers, were some of the notable gainers in the quarter. As Hal mentioned, we did benefit from more transitory factors like stimulus payments, favorable weather and inflation that had a positive impact on the sales in the quarter. In total, we estimate that about 1/3 of our comparable store sales growth in the first quarter is attributable to these transitory factors. 
Our best estimate is that more favorable weather for the quarter contributed about 400 basis points to comps. Both January and February were colder than last year, with February being the coldest month in 30 years, while the last few weeks of March turned to a favorable spring weather in many of our markets. We also saw retail price inflation, primarily in commodities, which contributed around 300 basis points to our comp sales performance. 
The impact of stimulus payments is more difficult to quantify, but we recognize that consumers had more cash to spend during the quarter, and we believe Tractor Supply benefited from this in Q1. Towards the end of the quarter, in line with the timing of stimulus payments, we saw customer spending at elevated levels, especially in big-ticket items. Our best estimate is that stimulus contributed somewhere in the mid-single digits to our first quarter sales comps. 
Even factoring in the transitory benefits, we believe the underlying health of our business is structurally advantaged. Trends towards higher spending in consumables continued through the quarter with pet, bird and livestock feeds showing significant growth from last year. We saw growth in the quarter despite lapping last year's strong stock-up buying that occurred late in the first quarter of 2020 at the start of the pandemic. As we've said for the past few quarters, we see the growth in our C.U.E. categories as more evidence of an enduring consumer shift to higher pet adoptions and ownership, new customer hobbies like backyard poultry and gardening, along with trip consolidation. 
For the first quarter, our gross margin increased by 148 basis points to 35.2% of sales, which resulted in gross profit increasing to nearly $984 million in the first quarter. This quarter marked the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion.  
Consistent with the trend since the beginning of the pandemic, this quarter's increase was primarily driven by a lower level of sales promotions and clearance activity. We also benefited from a positive product mix towards higher-margin categories. And, consistent with our guidance, we received approximately 40 basis points of benefit from vendor funding for the Field Activity Support Teams, or FAST, initiative. 
These factors were partially offset by higher transportation costs, which was a headwind for gross margin. Domestic and import freight costs have increased significantly as well as fuel costs. And we expect these trends to continue throughout 2021. 
SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 27%, an improvement of 103 basis points. This improvement was primarily attributable to significant leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the strong increase in our comparable store sales. This leverage was partially offset by 3 factors: higher incentive compensation given the strong sales performance, COVID-related costs and higher operating expenses to support the elevated volumes. COVID-related costs were approximately $28 million, generally in line with prior quarters', as we continued to take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of our team members and customers. Additional overtime, temporary labor and other costs were also incurred to maintain high service levels. 
Operating profit dollars more than doubled compared to prior year to $231 million, an operating profit margin of 8.3%, an improvement of 251 basis points. 
Net income was $181 million, an increase of 117%. 
Diluted EPS was $1.55, representing an increase of 118% versus the first quarter of 2020. 
During the first quarter, we returned $314 million to shareholders through the combination of our share repurchases and dividends. 
Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong. Merchandise inventories were $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of about 2% in average inventory per store. This level of inventory is still lighter than we would like given the momentum of the business, and we are working with our suppliers and our vendors to build stock to support this momentum. The added supply chain costs and freight expense necessary to rebuild inventory is reflected in our updated guidance we provided. 
Moving now to our guidance for 2021. The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccine rollout will have on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results remains uncertain. We continue to plan for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes, remaining nimble and adjusting as necessary. Our updated guidance reflects the strong results from the first quarter and the positive momentum we see in our business continuing into the second quarter. While the current environment and momentum are both favorable, we recognize that COVID-19 pandemic is not completely behind us and that economic conditions can change quickly. Please keep in mind that the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance. 
Against the backdrop of what we know today, we are updating our guidance to a net sales range of $11.4 billion to $11.7 billion, with comparable store sales growth of 5% to 8%. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.4% to 9.7% of sales, a step-up from our prior guidance. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $7.05 to $7.40. This compares to our previous earnings range of $6.50 to $6.90 per diluted share. 
Compared to our initial outlook for the year, our forecast does reflect higher transportation costs and product inflation. We experienced increasing pressures from these factors during the first quarter and expect them to continue to be a headwind throughout 2021. In addition, we have a unique opportunity with the positive customer trends and momentum in the business. We are committed to investing in store and supply chain labor as we look to provide legendary customer service to meet our customers' expectations. 
I want to share additional context on our outlook for the second quarter. While we begin to lap more challenging sales and earnings comps, we currently see sales momentum continue, partially fueled by stimulus payments. We expect a positive sales comp in the second quarter in the mid single-digit range. Please keep in mind we'll be cycling our strongest gross margin performance of the prior year in Q2, where we benefited from minimal promotional or clearance activity as well as a favorable product mix. We are expecting gross margin decline in Q2 due to higher transportation costs, a less favorable product mix and a slight return to promotional activity. We also anticipate a modest onetime headwind in the second quarter relating to the rollout of our enhanced Neighbor's Club loyalty program. 
In terms of SG&A for the second quarter, COVID-related expenses are expected to moderate from the Q1 levels but are forecasted to be slightly higher than original expectations entering the year, along with higher labor cost to support these elevated volumes. 
For the second half of 2021, we anticipate tailwinds such as stimulus payments to moderate and performance to be more in line with our original guidance, expecting a modest decline in comp sales. Longer term, we continue to believe the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter but by the halves of the year. 
As I've stated before, a key component of our financial model is the strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. In January, we increased our annual dividend by 30% from $0.40 a share to $0.52. For 2021, we anticipate share repurchases in a range of $700 million to $800 million. 
In summary, it is an exciting time at Tractor Supply. We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and see positive momentum carrying into the second quarter. We see an opportunity to retain the loyalty of our longtime and newer customers by investing in our business to maintain everyday low prices and improve customer service, strengthen our supply chain and grow our digital commerce, all in support of our commitment to driving strong shareholder returns for the long term. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Hal."

I'd like to spend the next portion of the call covering some of the key customer trends we're seeing in the business, providing an update on our Life Out Here strategy and highlighting our spring programs. 
Our customer base is experiencing robust, broad-based shopping patterns that provide significant opportunities for growth. These types of trends can simply be described as once in a generation. We're seeing growth in all our customer segments and across all value tiers of spending with strong retention of existing and new customers. 
The fastest-growth customer segment is our core farm and ranch. This segment is very healthy as rural economies, for the most part, were less impacted by the pandemic and are recovering at a steeper and more robust rate. Importantly, we're gaining wallet share with our core customer as our highest- and medium-spend customer tiers are outpacing our lower-spend customer tier. 
As mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong new customer growth and notably are also seeing strong customer retention. As an example, for our new customers from the first quarter of 2020 last year, more than 50% have returned to shop with Tractor Supply. This is about 300 basis points higher than the cohort from the first quarter of 2019. 
We are seeing significant growth in our millennial shoppers. Over the last 12 months, we've seen a 400 basis point shift in the customer age cohorts of 18 to 45 years old. This demographic has long resisted many of the traditional generational norms, things like household formation and homeownership. But the pandemic has shocked this generation and accelerated their embracement of these types of activities. There continues to be a net migration out of urban areas largely driven by the millennial segment. The most robust homeownership growth is in the millennial cohort, with the growth coming in suburban and rural areas. We believe growth in this customer segment has staying power and could be a structural game changer for us. 
Another structural customer trend that is working to our advantage is the significant increase in pet-owning households and number of pets adopted. Compared to the overall U.S. household pet ownership of approximately 2/3, our customers over-index in pet ownership by about 10 points. And our current survey work with our customers indicate 25% have recently acquired and adopted a new pet. New companion animal ownership acts as an annuity for our business as these puppies and kittens grow up and have growing life cycle needs. We're also uniquely positioned to offer a growing menu of services such as pet wash, vet clinics, prescriptions and televet services. Whether it's more food, treats, toys, containment and more, the humanization of pet provides us with future opportunities for growth. 
These customer trends are an indication that we continue to benefit from the numerous tailwinds such as pet ownership, the millennial urban exodus, backyard poultry, homesteading and home as an oasis. We believe many of these consumer trends will be enduring shifts well into the future. Our brand momentum is stronger than ever, and we're investing to ensure we continue to play offense in the context of these trends. 
We are making excellent progress on our Life Out Here strategy and initiatives. At the beginning of April, we announced the relaunch of our Neighbor's Club program to be even bigger and better. When we launched Neighbor's Club nationwide in 2017, our vision was to create a unique Out Here community for our customers and a place for them to connect with us. The Neighbor's Club has permitted us to show appreciation to our loyal customers and to accumulate actionable customer data that has allowed us to deliver to our customers more relevant and personalized communications. 
Over the last 4 years, our loyalty program has served us well to be able to thank participating customers for being loyal customers, provide rewards and special offers they value, learn more about their purchasing trends and interest and ultimately increase customer loyalty to Tractor Supply stores. Today, our Neighbor's Club program has over 20 million members and is comprised of our most valuable customers. 
It is a perfect time to upgrade the program with the introduction of points and 3 tiers of status. Now, neighbors, can earn points on their purchases and redeem them for more rewards. They can earn their way to different levels so that when they spend, they earn more. With the new features of Neighbor's Club, we believe we have more tools and features than ever to help facilitate upward migration in spending and mitigate downward migration of spending by our members. 
The changes to Neighbor's Club were specifically based on our customers' feedback. The new rewards and benefits of Neighbor's Club are relevant to the customer's lifestyle such as trailer rentals and shipping benefits. We believe with the new Neighbor's Club benefits, we have an opportunity to support our customers in a more meaningful way. This, in turn, will provide us a platform for multiyear trajectory for growth as a clear business driver for us. 
More broadly, we are aggressively advancing our Life Out Here strategy. The FAST team is at scale in providing significant improvement in the execution of our merchandising initiatives. We continue to forecast about 150 to 200 side lot transformations to occur this year. As of today, we have over 40 stores operating and continue to refine our learnings for future build-outs, of which 35 are currently under construction. 
Project Fusion store remodels are also on track for completion of 150 to 200 stores this year. In addition, new stores are being built as Fusion stores with improved layout, signage, SKU expansion and adjacencies. While still early, we're very pleased with our customers' response to both the side lot transformation and the Project Fusion store layout. 
Now turning to spring. Our stores in e-commerce are well positioned to take advantage of the seasonal change to serve our customers. We remain committed to being the zero-turn headquarters with our market-leading assortment from Toro, Bad Boy and Cub Cadet. We have substantially expanded our assortment in grilling, raised bed garden and other backyard categories. And to capture share of wallet in the lawn and garden category, we have expanded our offerings on core products like long-handled tools, wheelbarrows, trailers and tillers. And Chick Days are underway with millions of customers relying on us for their poultry passion. Leveraging our localization efforts, we're expanding our tool corral to an additional 400 stores. 
And on the product innovation front, we're partnering with Carhartt to open a new store-within-a-store concept. This concept was created with our customer at the center of the shopping experience. And by partnering with Carhartt to double our selection, our stores have even more of what makes Tractor Supply a destination for workwear. The new store-within-a-store concept will roll out in more than 100 Tractor Supply stores in 2021 with additional stores to be added next year. 
To wrap up, I couldn't be prouder of the Tractor Supply team as they've remained agile in the face of a very challenging operating environment. My thanks and appreciation go out to each of them for helping to take care of each other and our customers while operating at a record-setting pace. 
We have an incredibly strong business and foundation. We see more positive macro factors than we did at the beginning of the year. Customers are shopping with us in record numbers, and we're investing in multiple initiatives to retain them and provide more reasons to shop with us in the future. 
We participate in a large and attractive market that we're working to expand further with initiatives such as side lots that will add to our product offering. By doing the right thing for our team members and customers, we're executing our Life Out Here strategy and building a stronger company for our shareholders. 
Now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

As you mentioned, we've seen a significant amount of new customers shopping with us over the last 12-plus months with above-average retention rates continuing to hold. And as we mentioned, over 50% of the Q1 2020 cohort has shopped us again in the last 12 months. So very strong retention. 
When we look at the additional customer data, I'd highlight 2 big drivers of the new customers. First will be in the core farm and ranch. And that very much is a market share gain, where these are customers that have land, have animals, have had -- our value proposition has appeal to them over time and, for a variety of reasons, they're choosing to now shop with Tractor Supply. And I think that has a lot to do with the investments we've made in technology, the investments we've made in safety and health and cleanliness in our stores and certainly the focus we've had on inventory and customer service. 
And then the second thing I'd bring up is kind of the millennial customer, which we highlighted in our prepared remarks. This segment had a very large increase as a percentage of our sales in Q1. And really, when we look at the data, it really is around the migration of people out of urban environments into suburban and rural environments. And that generation is starting to kind of take -- form households, buy homes. And as part of that, the Out Here lifestyle is part of the aspiration that they have when they moved out to the suburbia or when they moved out to rural America. And we do really feel like this is a structural trend that will continue to provide growth for us as we look out the balance of this year and beyond."

Is it right to think that your -- the difference is all going to come from your getting about 1,000 basis points of stimulus benefit in 2Q and you probably won't get that in 3Q or 4Q?

And that's really a great way to reconcile to it. And the reason I'd point that out is last year, some of the drivers in Q2 that we're about to lap were with the pandemic, you saw transportation costs and certain commodity prices actually declining. And so that was really a favorable item in there. We are now lapping that first quarter where there was really no promotional or clearance activity. 
In Q1, the factors that were drivers that we pointed out in Q1, such as the favorable product mix, is the last quarter where -- before we start lapping some of that favorable product mix where the discretionary, higher-margin items were a big portion of the mix. 
So to give you the level of quantifying of it coming off of that basis, I'd give you the 4 key factors, and I'll put it in order of magnitude. Lapping those lower transportation costs with higher transportation costs right now would be the first. Lapping a favorable product mix in Q2 last year, where the discretionary higher-margin items were a much higher percent than Q, would be second. The inflation impact and then followed by, as I mentioned, the onetime Neighbor's Club impact for launching the points and rewards-based program is a great way of summarizing it."

We are very pleased with the performance of our online business. As we noted in our press release and in our prepared remarks, our fourth quarter now of over 100% growth in the business and its penetration rates continued to increase as an overall percent of our sales. 
Buy Online Pickup in Store continues to remain approximately 75% of our digital sales and with curbside pickup still being about 75% of that Buy Online Pickup in Store. So that's -- so the customer behavior, even with the growth, continues to kind of stay similar to what it has been in the past. 
But what we are seeing is just a much more -- our execution, both from the customer order all the way through to customer pickup, is just much more efficient than it was this time last year. And that's really due to all the investments that we've made and just the outstanding execution by the team. 
And I'll give a brief example of that. We rolled out our first mobile app last year in the summertime. We now have over 1 million downloads of that app, and it's becoming a material portion of our digital sales. 
As the customer does a Buy Online Pickup in Store order in our app, they can note their -- the type of vehicle they're driving, the model, the color and then any special pickup requirements they have like maybe opening up the back of an SUV and putting it in there without even engaging with the customer. 
Then, as soon as the order is placed, we have Theatro headsets in our stores for every single team member. That task, within moments after the order is placed to sit down to that store, the team member acknowledges, and well over 90% of our orders are now being picked in less than an hour. As soon as the order is completed by the team member, they then check it in with our mobile handheld, which we doubled the capacity of those in our stores last year, and then they take the order up to BOPIS Lockers, which we just rolled out in November of last year. The average store has 3. And then the customer gets a notification saying it's ready. 
On their way into our store, we have an On My Way functionality. The customer can hit that. As soon as the customer enters our parking lot, the team member gets a notification saying they're ready for the order to be picked up. And then in their Theatro headset, it will actually tell them, Kurt Barton in a white Ford F-150 is ready for their order. And they'll walk right out, and they will drop the order in the back of the SUV, as it was indicated. 
We're doing well over 90% of that in minutes now. And then they take the handheld device out there, complete the order because we've rolled out additional WiFi access points on the front, and the customer drives off. And that is a big percentage of our orders, the customer scenario I just articulated. And the vast majority of the technology as well as the operational components of that are all new from last year. And so just real kudos to the team for really just implementing a large number of technologies last year as well as operational procedures."

And if you look at the millennial population in general, this is one that for over -- almost 10, 15 years now, I think all of us have been wondering if that generation will eventually conform to normal generational activities like householding and buying homes and such. And I do think that the pandemic really shocked that generation, and you're pulling forward now 3 or 4 years of those sorts of activities into a year. 
And if you look at home purchases, if you look at household formation, that generation is spiking above all the other generations in those activities. And the urban home purchases, that generation are declining, but rural and suburban are increasing. And we see that in our dataset as well as we talked about the millennial cohort increasing by 4 percentage points as a percent of our business in the first quarter. And we're seeing it in our stores in the products that they're buying and in the way they're engaging. I think we've mentioned in the past we sold 11 million birds last year, and half of those birds went to new customers. And it just shows you a category like poultry, which we're far and away the market share leader in, and -- it's a category that really had a renaissance -- went through a renaissance last year and it's continuing this year in our stores.

But they are -- it's a really strong customer group for us, and we're really pleased with the results we've had in the last year and excited about the ongoing developments in the program."

Yes, as Kurt mentioned there, we really had strong momentum coming out of Q1 and exiting Q1. And while we would love more inventory, obviously, as we said, there's -- continue, obviously, to drive sales. We feel very good about our position to continue to drive these sales here in Q2. 
And I'd really bucket the inventory position that we think about really in kind of 3 primary buckets. The first bucket would be kind of our C.U.E. [indiscernible]-based product. The team has done an absolutely excellent job making sure that we can continue to stay in stock and be that dependable supplier. And we feel that we can definitely continue to make sure that we can take care of that shopper and customer that's coming in. 
Big ticket is really the second primary bucket, and that's where we really saw that strong demand exiting Q1. And so I would say early in Q2, that's where we were really focused on here, replanning that product so that we could bring that in to make sure that we could continue that momentum. And that product's flowing and has been flowing into stores. 
And then third is more on our import side. And the import side is where we did see a little bit more delays as it relates to our inventory position. Most of that is in, call it, our drive aisle type of category. So if you go in our stores, some of the decor, some of the discretionary type areas, those items have been flowing in nicely. Actually, it's really putting us in a great position as we're entering here in the peak of Q2 to make sure our center courts are going to be locked and loaded and full and ready to drive sales. 
And then we also talked about the quality of inventory is better than it's ever been. I mean our clearance position is in an incredibly good spot. So as you think about that 2% comp inventory, it's also doing it on a healthy quality inventory to drive future sales. So feel really good about where we are to continue to drive that momentum here in Q2."

This team is there to help merchandise and help ensure the sale of that product. And it has been a strong contributor, one of the areas that has been an early win in the Life Out Here strategy. 
And so our vendor funding, yes, we anticipated that funding has really began and started to flow through the P&L. Pretty consistent, about 40 basis points quarter -- throughout all 4 quarters of the year on the gross margin side. 
The only thing I'll remind you is that we said in the back half of last year that we would begin to make the investments in the SG&A to build that team, and that cost actually went through the P&L unfunded. And so, the SG&A cost today for FAST is larger than the funding. And as we begin to build this program, it will eventually neutralize over the years. But for this year, there will be starting to lap in the third and fourth quarters some costs on there. But again, for the year, it'll average out about 40 basis points of incremental in SG&A with 40 basis points of benefit on vendor funding. It'll differ per -- between the quarters a bit. 
And then I know Seth can go ahead and talk about the investment."

And I just say the timing of the FAST program could not have been better to roll this out with the record volumes that are going through our stores today. Execution has been absolutely excellent among the store teams. Our planogram resets right now are on time, in full, north of 95%, which is a major -- it's a really good improvement from the past, and it's allowing our store teams really to focus on the cleanliness as well as to take care of our customers, which has also been a great win for our supplier partners as well. I mean they're there to sell products, take care of them and offer that customer service. 
And then finally, from the merchant perspective, we plan to have record number of planogram resets occurring throughout the course of this year. And we were able to uptick that last year. And as we've been able to operate, and we have been operating in this record sales volume windows, our merchants in the past, we did not have a great avenue at times to go after opportunistic buys, things of that nature to really be able to fill in our drive aisles. 
And we've been able to leverage the FAST team as well as our supplier partners to go after those kind of opportunistic buys so that we can really maximize the sales trends that are out there. So I would just say overall, just incredibly pleased by the FAST program and just really big, high marks to the team that's out there for standing this up and taking care of our supplier base."

Thanks go out to the more than 45,000 Tractor Supply team members for their ongoing commitment to each other, our customers in the out here lifestyle. The team has been through a lot together over the last 15 months as an essential needs-based retailer, including necessary but cumbersome health and safety measures, surge in volumes, the rollout of our Life Out Strategy, supply chain disruptions, numerous digital investments and more. 
The team has risen to each challenge to be there as the dependable supplier to our customers and the communities we call home. Thank you to the team for another great quarter. I would also like to say thank you to our vendor and supply chain partners as we work together to overcome the challenges in the global supply chain network. Together, we were able to support our customers as the dependable supplier for their out here lifestyle. 
Over the first 12 months of the pandemic through the first quarter of 2021, our sales grew approximately 35% or $3 billion. In the second quarter of 2021, as we are now comping the comp, we are pleased this momentum and all the underlying trends have remained and continue to sustain. 
Looking at the second quarter, the Tractor Supply team delivered a very strong performance that exceeded our expectations as we achieved a 10.5% comparable store sales growth for the quarter and a 41% 2 years back. Our results proved yet again Tractor Supply's unique competitive advantages. 
Our relentless focus on being the dependable supplier for the Out Here Lifestyle is embedded in our purpose as a company. Our Life Out Here Strategy is still in the early days, and we are seeing positive trends from our initiatives. We're excited by the momentum. 
We remain committed to investing in our team members as we believe they are a key competitive differentiator with our customers. Just last month, we increased pay for nearly 27,000 of our tenured hourly store team members and also raised our minimum wage to $11.25 per hour. Our team members continue to make tractor supply, the special place that it is, investing in our team members is not only the right thing to do, but it's also a way to recognize their role in driving our business forward. 
Now turning to our results for the second quarter of 2021. Our net sales grew approximately 13.4%. Comparable store sales grew 10.5%, driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 6% and transaction count increase of 4.5%. Diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $3.19. Importantly, the underlying foundation of our business is robust. 
For the quarter, every week had positive comps. Our growth was broad-based across regions and product categories. We continue to gain share across all categories, online and in stores. For instance, in Q2, we experienced comparable store growth in our consumable, usable and edible categories that was well above our overall comparable store sales. 
E-commerce recorded its largest ever quarter of sales. The work we have done over the last year to improve our e-commerce capabilities has certainly resonated with our customers. In just under a year, our mobile app already has more than 1.6 million downloads and now represents over 10% of our e-commerce sales. 
Given our strong performance year-to-date, coupled with our outlook for the balance of the year, we are raising our sales and earnings guidance for the year. Kurt will share more details on our revised outlook later in the call. 
Regarding our pending acquisition of Osland Farm & Home that we announced in February, we are working cooperatively with the SEC on their second request. We look forward to the benefits this transaction will offer customers with improved products and competitive pricing. 
We have previously shared key observations of our customer behaviors based on our market data and research and I would like to update you on that today. Overall, our customer metrics remain very healthy, with both traffic and spending increasing at a balanced rate. So let's run through some of the insights that are most relevant. 
First, we are seeing broad continued strength across our customer base. More customers than ever are shopping tractor supply. And these customers are making more trips than ever and are spending more money per trip than ever. We are seeing strong retention of customers that have shopped us over the last 12 months. 
Our retention rates continue to run above historical trends. The conversion of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program to a points-based rewards is resonating with our customers. Year-over-year, we've added nearly 5 million new members to the program. 
In our Neighbor's Club members, they're spending about 3x the rate of nonmembers and they're comping at a rate well above the chain average. Neighbor's Club members accounted for about 65% of our sales, and that's a step-up from where we've been running prior to the relaunch of the program. 
We've grown our high-value customer base in the program by about 15% year-to-date, with customers migrating upward in spending significantly outpacing any downward spending. The retention rate of our most valuable customers is running north of 95%. New customers are joining the Neighbor's Club program at a rate of nearly 30% and significantly above the rate from last year. And the new customers we are acquiring as compared to our core customers are continuing to skew younger. 
We're seeing significant growth in our millennial shoppers. Our trends this quarter for the customer age cohorts of 18 years to 45 years old were in line with the first quarter. And we continue to believe that the growth in this customer segment has staying power. 
Much like last quarter, the types of trends we're seeing can simply be described as once in a generation. We believe key aspects to our customer service, such as a convenient place to shop, product assortment, legendary customer service and in-stock levels are important to keeping these existing and new customers engaged with our brands. 
On the macro front, the economy remains strong and key trends continue to work in our favor, such as rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption and a self-reliant lifestyle movement, including DIY trends and hobbies like gardening, backyard poultry and pet adoptions. While the cost environment remains elevated across imports, domestic freight, commodities, and labor wages, the merchant team has been aggressively advocating for our customers. Where necessary, we are taking price increases to pass through some of the cost pressures that we cannot offset. 
We are closely monitoring the price elasticity to ensure that we are focused on product unit trends. The team is doing an excellent job navigating this environment. Over the past few months, we have navigated unprecedented conditions. As the country opens back up, the Out Here Lifestyle remains incredibly relevant. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt to review the quarter in more depth and our outlook before I come back to give insight on our Life Out Here Strategy and other drivers of the second half of 2021."
329501,715371356,2347546,"Tractor Supply Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2021",2021-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Tractor Supply Company","Executives","Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call today. As Hal shared many details on the second quarter, in my time on the call today, I'd like to go into some of the specifics around our financial performance and our increased outlook for the full ye",1345,"Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call today. 
As Hal shared many details on the second quarter, in my time on the call today, I'd like to go into some of the specifics around our financial performance and our increased outlook for the full year. We are very pleased with our performance. These results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business and our strategic initiatives. For the quarterly cadence, April and June were the strongest months of the comp store sales performance. 
All geographic regions and all major merchandising categories had comp store sales growth. We believe the underlying health of our business is structurally advantaged. A great example of this is the strength in our consumable, usable and edible products. Our CUE represent the strength of our core business and what drives trips to the store. 
For the fifth consecutive quarter in a row, CUE had comp store sales growth above 15%. Key subcategories such as poultry, livestock feed and dry dog food were among the strongest categories with comp sales all greater than 25%. Of note, we are seeing strong retention rates of our new customers across every species of livestock and companion animal. For example, poultry, a hallmark home setting category for Tractor Supply has the highest retention rate of the animal species for new customers and new to the category. 
Our big ticket categories, which were going against significant growth in the prior year. continue to have strong comp sales performance above the chain average. This was driven by strength in zero turn mowers, safes, utility vehicles and trailers. 
Lastly, inflation. Contributed about 350 to 400 basis point to comparable store sales in the quarter. Our second quarter gross margin rate was 35.8%, a decrease of 67 basis points. Year-over-year, the gross margin drivers are principally 3 items: first, higher freight costs that all of retailers experiencing; second, an initial impact from the relaunch of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program; and third, a more normalized CUE product mix. 
Our price management program partially offset these factors as we look to mitigate the impact of inflation and other cost pressures. Consistent with our guidance, we received approximately 40 basis points benefit from vendor funding for the Field Activity Support Teams or FAST initiative, which was launched in the second half last year. 
Of note, we continue to see favorability in the frequency and depth of promotions as we are committed to being true to our everyday low pricing strategy and continue to see strong demand for our product categories. For comparison, our gross margin rate this quarter was still about 90 basis points above our Q2 2019 rate of 34.9%. 
Our second quarter SG&A expense ratio, including depreciation and amortization, improved by 6 basis points to 22.3%. This improvement was primarily attributable to lower COVID-19 pandemic response costs and decreased incentive compensation as well as good leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in our comparable store sales. Partially offsetting this leverage were higher wage rates additional store labor hours to ensure we are providing great customer service and investments in our Life Out Here Strategic initiatives. 
The offset to our FAST initiative benefiting gross margin was approximately 40 basis points of incremental SG&A expense for the labor costs for the team. Much like our gross margin rate, our SG&A performance compares favorably to Q2 2019 when our SG&A expense ratio was 22.7%. 
Operating profit increased 8.5% with operating profit margin of 13.5% and on the quarter. Net income was $370 million, an increase of 9.3%. Diluted EPS was $3.19, an increase of 10%. 
Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong. Merchandise inventories were $1.99 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing a 14% increase in average inventory per store. The increase principally reflects growth to support the robust sales trends along with the impact of inflation. 
Our supply chain and our vendors are executing at a very high level to meet the customers' current demands. We finished the quarter with $1.41 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $500 million revolver. 
Moving now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021. Looking ahead, while the trends in our business provide additional confidence in the structural nature of the tailwind, we remain aware that the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccine rollout can have further impact on the broader economy the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results. 
With still some measure of uncertainty, we continue to plan for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes and will remain nimble and adjust as necessary. Our updated guidance reflects the strong results in the first half of the year and the positive momentum we see in our business continuing into the second half of 2021. 
Please note that the prospective acquisition of Orlen [indiscernible] Farm & Home is not included in our guide. So against the backdrop of what we know today, we are updating our guidance to a net sales range of $12.1 billion to $1.23 billion with comparable store sales growth in the range of 11% to 13%. 
For the year, we forecasted operating margin of 9.7% to 9.9% of sales, a step-up from our prior guidance. Diluted EPS is now forecast in the range of $7.70 to $8. This compares to our previous earnings range of $7.05 to $7.40 per diluted share. We have a unique opportunity with the positive customer trends and momentum in the business. 
We are committed to investing in store and supply chain labor as we look to provide legendary customer service to meet our customers' expectations. While we continue to lap challenging sales and earnings comps we expect positive sales comp in both the third and fourth quarter with the third quarter of a few points higher than the fourth quarter. 
Please keep in mind, we will continue to cycle strong gross margin performance of the prior year where we benefited from minimal promotional or clearance activity as well as favorable product mix, where CUE products represented a smaller portion of sales. 
Much like results in the second quarter, we are expecting gross margin decline in the back half of the year due to higher transportation costs and continued strength in acute products. Our guidance assumes promotional activity comparable to last year in Q3, with Q4 seeing some shift back to normalizing promotions during the holiday season. 
While we are dealing with significantly higher transportation costs, a mix shift to CUE and cost of goods increases, we continue to see benefit from a pullback in promotions and are seeing less price elasticity from consumers as we adjust prices. We believe we are effectively navigating impacts to our gross margin. The strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a hallmark of Tractor Supply. 
We have raised our outlook for capital spending to now be in the range of $500 million to $600 million to reflect higher construction and raw material costs for store projects and increased technology investments for the customer experience. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchase.
For 2021, we remain on track for anticipated share repurchases in a range of $700 million to $800 million. This year will mark a milestone with approximately $1 billion return to shareholders due the combination of share repurchases and dividends. To wrap up, we are very pleased with our performance in the first half of the year and see positive momentum carrying into the second half of 2021. And we continue to build relevance and market share both today and over time. We are excited about the investments ahead of us to better serve our customers from new stores, Project Fusion remodels and our side lot transformation. We are strengthening our supply chain and growing our digital commerce, all in support of our commitment to driving strong shareholder returns for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Hal."

We continue to operate from a position of strength and are committed to investing in the business. Our Life Out Here Strategy is designed to capitalize on the attractive opportunity that we see in our nearly $110 billion total addressable market. 
We are transforming our stores through our Project Fusion remodel and silo transformation, optimizing our technology in store and online and investing in how we operate our stores. I'm incredibly proud of the progress the team has made in advancing our strategic priorities, especially amid a global pandemic and running the business at an elevated rate. 
So let me share with you an update on how a few of our top initiatives are progressing. I'll start with the field activity support team. A 1,200-plus person organization that is designed to improve store labor productivity. Example task of the FAST team includes execution of merchandising programs like center court, end caps, clip strips, planogram resets, seasonal programs and our sales-driving initiatives. 
Rolled out in the third quarter of last year. This team has made great progress in improving execution of our merchandising activity, which represents the second largest body of work for our store team members. Year-to-date, the execution of TAC by the FAST team is running at 97% or nearly 33 points higher than our base year of 2019. The FAS team is allowing the store teams to spend more time on customer service and improve their in-store execution. 
We believe the FAST team will continue to contribute to comparable store sales well into the future. Turning next to our Project Fusion store remodel program. Recall our Project Fusion is our state-of-the-art space productivity program designed to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base and give new customers that may other shop with us in the past, more reasons to visit. 
We now have more than 160 stores in the new layout and the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Our customers are taking note of things like the improved shopping experience in our remodels. And specifically in our customer intercept surveys, they're calling out better organization, improved merchandise selection, cleaner and brighter and easier to navigate factors. While the majority of the remodels have been completed more recently, we are very pleased with the early read of our customer response and the comp lift of the remodel is running in line with our expectations. 
Given the size of our store base, this is a multiyear opportunity to continually refresh our store base and further drive comp sales. Another component of our space productivity program is the transformation of our side lot. Typically, there's as much space outside of our stores in the side lot as we have inside the store. The productivity of this space is substantially below the chain average. 
We're in the midst of a multiyear project to transform our side lot with an expanded product offering and an enhanced shopping experience. With this investment, the side lot space is leveraged to offer a wider product offering in the lawn and garden categories, enter new categories and offer greater convenience through the expansion of our Buy Online Pickup in Store capabilities for drive-through pickup. 
We also continue to see a positive halo effect from the Garden Center to the existing store and vice versa. Addition of product categories, increased ease of shopping and new services provides us with even more ways to continue to keep our existing customers engage at Tractor Supply and attract new customers to the brand. 
Our ability to drive higher sales per square foot through the transformation of our side lot remains a significant opportunity. We currently have about 60 side lot transformations completed and we anticipate having greater than 150 complete as we exit 2021. In these early remodels, we're learning a great deal about our customers' appetite for our expanded lawn and garden assortment and even more excited than we embarked on the initial test pilots. 
The team has done a great job laying the foundation of our Life Out Here strategy as we scale our transformational initiatives. Beyond our multiyear strategic initiatives, at Tractor Supply, we are always focused on having the seasonally appropriate offerings to support our customers. 
Wrapping up the summer season, we're exiting the quarter with our -- with clean inventory with the seasonal change over. We continue to focus on enhancing our product offerings for the transition to the important fall and winter season. Across all areas of the store and online, we have fall-centric merchandising and marketing plans in place to keep our customers engaged. Whether it's the launch of our pet appreciation week in September to the rollout of our Deer hunting planogram set or our focus on heating products for the change in temperature, our customers know that they can count on tractor supply for the relevant products that they need to live life out here. 
We are leveraging new lines and innovation across drilling, safe and home and decor. In addition, Ridgecut, our exclusive brand and performance workwear will be expanded across new categories and into women's workwear. These product expansions are relevant to both new and existing customers and will help retain our growing customer base. 
Across all parts of the store, we have exciting products for the fall and winter as we shift gears to ramp up for our customers' needs to care for their land, home, animals and pets as colder weather comes. On the marketing front, we're making continued investments to drive our brand awareness. 
As part of our plans, we're excited to announce the new multiyear partnership to be the official Life Out Here partner for the professional bull riders effective this season. The partnership includes a flagship presence on the PBR tour that host over 200 events per year, a Tractor Supply branded broadcast booth during the pre show on CBS, an in-arena broadcast activation and local customer activation. 
PBR will also produce and distribute custom content for our social media channels. We're very excited to support our customers' passion for this dynamic and rapidly growing sport. Again, on marketing, given the strong millennial trends we have been experiencing. We're investing in marketing to continue to attract and nurture this important demographic. 
Given that the millennial customer cohort may not be as familiar with our brand, we are executing marketing plans to introduce Tractor Supply to this next generation of customers. Just last month, we launched a new campaign, targeting millennials the media channels like Pandora, YouTube and other streaming services. This campaign is called, Welcome to Life Out Here. and introduces this new audience to what lies ahead in our stores and the lifestyle we help support. 
The focus is on key categories such as pet, backyard poultry, gardening and self-reliance. With the primary goal to drive awareness, the millennial campaign has delivered significant impressions since the launch. Early results show best-in-class performance in ad recall and awareness relative to traditional benchmarks. We believe this indicates that we are resonating with this audience, and it is driving consideration for Tractor Supply. 
To summarize, we've delivered strong results year-to-date and made significant progress with our strategic initiatives. We have confidence that our strategy and execution will allow us to continue to build a stronger tractor supply. With our purposeful actions, we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger company. It's an exciting time at Tractor Supply. My appreciation goes out to each and every 1 of our more than 45,000 Tractor Supply team members for their dedication to our mission and values. And with that, operator, we would now like to open the line for questions."

And like kind of all loyalty programs we try as we created in this case, 3 tiers we tried to kind of reasonably distribute it with kind of a decreasing proportion across each of the 3 buckets. And then we also try to create tier levels that would naturally encourage upward migration and discourage downward migration. I'd say a few things. As we talked about on the call, our Neighbor's Club members now account for over 65% of our sales. Our retention rate on our Neighbor's Club members is over 80%, very strong retention rate on an annualized basis. And as we said, our highest -- our third tier of spending, which is the Neighbor's Club premium plus the retention rates there are over 95%. And so we're seeing significant upward migration, we're seeing reduced downward migration and the final thing I'll make a mention of is that our Neighbor's Club members, they make 2 more trips a quarter on average than our non-Neighbor's Club members. And our Neighbor's Club members had spent over $1,000 a year. We've got almost $2.5 million of those, and that's increasing kind of on a daily basis. So it's a very robust program with its 21-plus million members. We've seen over 5 million members join us in the last 12 months. We're seeing outstanding retention. We're seeing excellent migration. As we migrate them, their retentions are holding and actually improving. And we've seen a significant response positive response to the rollout of the new program.

And I'd say, I think as we're all watching how COVID is playing out, that's certainly not the case. And so I'd also say though that our business continues to evolve, then the -- and if you think back to them, we were talking about 50-50 on structural versus transitory in terms of trends. And I think we'd lean more towards structural now in the way we view our trends. If you think about pet, if you think about the millennial customer, if you think about home setting kind of rural revitalization, categories like poultry, as an example. So last year, as we've said several times, we sold 11 million birds. Half of those were to new customers. we're seeing, as mentioned by her in his prepared remarks, outstanding retention those customers last year, the shop that's on poultry coming back again this year. In fact, that retention rate is higher than any other animal feed or pet. So I mean, it just shows you that the trends that began last year are really resonating and resilient. And that momentum that we're seeing with our customers and in our business and with the lifestyle, the out your lifestyle that we appeal to is holding incredibly strong. And I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that between Q2 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021, we had grown $3 billion and 34% comp and we were kind of coming into Q2. I think like many companies, but certainly us wondering how we would cap the comp and we had guided to kind of flattish at the beginning of the year for that and perhaps even a little down and to finish with a plus 10.5% certainly exceeded our expectations. And it's really all about the underlying trends to strengthen our consumer behavior, new customers and the appeal of that out her lifestyle and I think there's still a lot of uncertainty in the out years and quarters. But I would say we feel more confident in the structural orientation of the trends than we did last October."

We are looking to accelerate and would see us shifting some of the supply chain investments earlier in the next few years. And so there may be higher than average in '21, '22, even '23.

Yes, I'd start with the fact that we're confident we're taking share really across every major category that we have in the business, both in stores and online. If you look at the profile between new customers, existing customers, both are showing strong comp transaction growth, average ticket growth. And as I said in my prepared remarks, more customers are shopping Tractor than ever. They're visiting us more frequently and they're shopping -- they're spending more when they're shopping us. What I would say is we participate in a very attractive large $110 billion market where our share kind of based on our new guidance would be fairly above 10%. There's a lot of share gain out there and also a lot of share to still be competed with. We're dominantly very focused on our customer and just making sure that the initiatives and the actions that we take are out there to create the best customer experience that we can whether that's investments in our team members to drive that legendary customer service or investments in inventory to ensure we're in stock for our customers. I would say, as it relates to the promotional environment, we've not -- we've had very little to no promotions in Q1 and Q2 of this year and that's our expectation really for the balance of the year. And I really expect the competitive environment to remain similar for no other reason because of the supply/demand situation that's out there and the global supply chain is disrupted, as I've seen it in my 25-plus years in retail. And everyone is working hard to just keep inventory in their stores. And I think that mindset would prevail over any sort of promotional kind of share kind of push that anyone has. I'd also just comment that we don't directly compete with really any primary retailer, being a lifestyle retailer, one of our benefits is that we play across a handful of large categories that are uniquely tailored to our customer. But typically, when we're competing with other companies, it's on a one-off category basis, and we really appeal to that whole lifestyle. But I don't anticipate an increase in the promotional environment in the market or certainly for us, anywhere near on the near or medium-term horizon."

Let me give a quick backdrop, and that will lead towards the back half. But we entered the year expecting 100 to 200 basis points of retail inflation throughout the year that quickly produced in Q1 closer to 300 basis points, principally from commodities. And then as we shifted into Q2 at the 350, 450 basis points of retail benefit from inflation, one, it demonstrates the ability, as Hal mentioned, to be able to adjust pricing appropriately. But the increase in Q2 over Q1 was principally related to transportation costs and other noncommodity type based cost increases. We see the back half of the year staying at elevated levels. And we would anticipate that the numbers in Q2, it would be at that level and potentially at moderately higher levels throughout the back half. And in this inflation environment, I always like to remind that our merchants and our business, we deal with inflation and deflation every year and they're managing this excellent. And we feel we've got the ability right now in the in the consumer sentiment, the less price elasticity and their behavior to be able to manage the inflation written very well throughout this year."

And starting out with both Fusion and Side Lot. We're very pleased with the results. And we've made a lot of progress over the last 6 to 9 months on both of these efforts. We've rolled out, as we mentioned, we've got over 60 -- 160 Fusions done, over 60 silo transformations done. In addition to the work on those individual stores, we've brought the project management in-house. We're reducing our construction times and lowering costs, and we see lots of opportunity to continue to do that as we move particularly on the sideline. We've iterated on the plans several times and keep optimizing the format every -- as we roll it out. But we are very pleased with the results, with the progress we made in both. On the results, what I'd say is we typically, I think, kind of historically in retail, it's the same in all my experiences. You start to really get a good feel for how the remodel lift is playing out kind of 3 to 4 months after the store kind of reopens and the remodels and complete. Most of our remodels hadn't been opened that long. So we're really kind of waiting over the next 3 to 6 months to start to see how that data set plays out. But what I'd say is for the stores that have been open kind of over that period of time, they are at the levels that we anticipated in our initial business case. And we have more of those on the Fusion than we do on the Side Lot. But we're very pleased with the results of both projects. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, the customer excitement around us becoming more of a destination in Garden has been more significant than we even anticipated, and we're even more bullish on that as we move forward. As it relates to the penetration of the kind of how long. We'll -- I think you can expect to hear us share more of that over time. But I'd say directly over about a 5-year time frame, you should think about kind of the Fusion stores. For the most -- the vast majority of our stores having Fusion. And on Side Lot really around that 60% to 70%. I think we're feeling more bullish around getting more of our store base done with Fusion and may be worried in 6 months ago, just the way that project is going cost that we're doing at it, they were doing it for the early read on the lift we're seeing, and then the need just to continue to kind of remodel our store base."

And even as the -- we certainly say as a nation is we've seen this delta variant pick up. We've not seen any impact on our trends, whether at a national level or at a regional level. And that's very similar to what we observed last year. And I think it's almost -- you hate to say it, but I think the the lack of mobility sometimes driven by these outbreaks actually plays to the benefit of Tractor Supply. I think it's demonstrated that when folks are spending more time at their homes with their families, their pets, their animals, their land they buy and track of supply to be kind of that one-stop shop resource for them to continue all those hobbies that they love and they're just spending more time doing those hobbies. And so while we certainly want and wish the country returned to normal as fast as possible, the delta variant, we don't see it as a potential threat, if anything, maybe some upside to it from our business results -- from a business results

And as I mentioned in -- we do an awareness survey of our customers twice a year. In our last earnings calls, I mentioned our unbranded awareness in November of 2019 was 37% and then 18 months later, right, as we're exiting Q1, it was up to 51%. So we've seen a I'm sorry, a 17-point increase, 34% to 51%, a 17-point increase in our unaided brand awareness. Much of that is obviously our core customer, but a lot of it is also the millennial customer. And as we mentioned last quarter, we saw a 4-point increase in our millennial customer penetration year-over-year. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, that trend continued in Q2. So we think the work we're doing in marketing is broadening the aperture of consumers' understanding of tractor supply and driving and aided awareness and kind of driving footsteps into our stores. As we said, we continue to have strong comp transactions across the board. And we're really excited about the the partnership with PBR, we think it's a category that resonates well with our customer. And 1 over 200 activities a year that we can do a lot of activation across the areas of the country where our customers are, and it will be a great partnership. As I also mentioned in our prepared remarks, also we have launched a large marketing campaign targeted towards the millennials. And up until now, the majority of our bubble in marketing has been TV and kind of Facebook base. And on TV, it's really been around news media. And we think that's been very successful for our core customers. Those are the major places that they engage with media. The millennial customer, as we all know, engages in different types of media. They're on Pandora, Spotify, YouTube. And so what does let us do is actually create a very different creative concept called Welcome the Life Out Here, explain who Tractor Supply is and then talk about those first 2, 3 hobbies that they might engage in backyard poultry, backyard gardening, pest. Things like that. They're kind of starter categories, if you will, in Life Out Here. We're very excited about that work. And the initial feedback from customers is outstanding. And just hats off to the marketing team for all the work they've done to really drive awareness of our business and drive footsteps into our store."

And 2 questions, margin second half and then our ability to be nimble and some of the profitability enhancement opportunity. So on the second half, when we look at the operating margins, here's how we view it and frame it up. Our gross margin in the pandemic was really the source of the in the operating margin. And we view the second half really about the gross margin performance. We anticipate Q3's gross margin performance where we've got more visibility to Q3 at this point, very much similar in line with the performance of Q2. As we get further into the second half of the year, we've taken a fairly prudent approach. There's more uncertainty beyond one more quarter. And we've always given a little bit more certainty on the most recent or the most nearest quarter. But in the second half, we recognized -- for the fourth quarter, we recognized supply chain disruptions, inflation factors as well as the the holiday season and what level of competitive nature. And so we've certainly reflected some of those uncertainties in the fourth quarter. And the operating margin on the back half of the year really rides on our performance with the gross margin. And as I said earlier, second quarter shows, we've really been able to manage in this environment very well. The business is structurally very sound. We have a lot of confidence in our business in our back half. And if some of the uncertainties don't play out, we acknowledge there's potentially some upside to the guidance that we've given. In regards to flexibility, as we always have strong profit improvement process going on. And a few of the factors that we are focused on right now where we've got some ability to be able to adjust would be in the supply chain, the work that we're doing to reduce stem miles and to continue to just lever the size of this organization drive efficiency in there as well as our ability to be nimble on variable cost. If there's any sort of shift in the momentum of the business, we're able to shift very well in regards to variable costs in both distribution and stores to be able to adjust on that. We've got a solid profit improvement initiative that is driving some of the efficiencies. And these are the active offsets that we have going on to be able to help us maintain operating margins well above the 2019 ranges while we're making important investments in the business."

We've said that we anticipate over time as we cycle the pandemic, the expected somewhat normalization on some of those factors, the promo, the clearance. While we do anticipate and are very disciplined in holding to an everyday low pricing and giving our customers the best price we can, our long-term guidance assumes some normalization. Now we acknowledge that with our guide shows that a second year in 2021, we'll maintain operating margins above that long-term target range. And so as we get further through 2021, we certainly, as we manage this business, see as things start to normalize we'll address the long-term expectations on gross margin. But we're going to always continue to offer strong everyday low pricing, we're going to focus on gaining market share and focus on driving unit growth. So price is going to be very important to us in leveraging the strength of the size of our business to have an efficient and nimble supply chain. So as we get more visibility, we'll certainly acknowledge the gross margin, operating margin trends compared to our long-term target.

We're in the process of rolling out new handheld devices for every team member inside the stores as well. Those sorts of investments are enabled by our scale and they're enabled -- and they're really focused on helping us great gain and capture market share and drive top line sales. And as we've talked many times, I mean, our main goal is to grow at a rate faster than the market. That's what's implied in our long-term operating trends. And that's how our business is performing now. And then on the operating profit rate, as we've said, we've been able to -- our outlook is to hold SG&A flat or down. And we've been -- we've done that over the last 6 quarters and anticipate continuing to do so. So as we've grown our sales and grown our sales base, we've been reinvesting in the business but doing at a point where we're not deleveraging there. And whether it's in the capital line, in our team member line, and we view our team members as a strategic asset. We are a customer service-driven retailer. We are not a retailer where you're going to walk in, pick the item you want, go to a self-checkout and never talk to someone loading your car yourself and drive away, right? We are going to help you pick the item. We're going to greet you. We're going to check you out, and we're going to help you load it in your car. And that's going to drive sustainable share gain for us. And then on the gross margin rate side, I think we continue to be very pleased that the promotional environment remains very little to none. And our inventory position where it is, we're just requiring little to no clearance activity as well. Our hope is that the longer that sustains itself the more structural that becomes. Right now, we are in a high-cost freight and import environment. That's reflected in our guidance. And we're very pleased with the low promotional nature is allowing us to offset those freight and import to allow us to give the guidance that we've given right now and fully acknowledge. As Kurt said, that if sales remain at the rates that they are in Q2 that there would be upside to the guidance that we've given. But we just thought it was prudent at this point to kind of provide the guidance that we have just given the continued level of uncertainty out there."

My thanks go out to the more than 45,000 Tractor Supply team members for their ongoing commitment to each other, our customers in the Out Here Lifestyle. The team has been through a lot together over the last 15 months as an essential needs-based retailer, including necessary but cumbersome health and safety measures, surge in volumes, the rollout of our Life Out Here strategy, supply chain disruptions, numerous digital investments and more.  The team has risen to each challenge to be there as the dependable supplier to our customers and the communities we call home. Thank you to the team for another great quarter. 
I would also like to say thank you to our vendor and supply chain partners as we work together to overcome the challenges in the global supply chain network. Together, we were able to support our customers as the dependable supplier for their Out Here Lifestyle.  
Over the first 12 months of the pandemic through the first quarter of 2021, our sales grew approximately 35% or $3 billion. In the second quarter of 2021, as we are now comping the comp, we are pleased this momentum and all the underlying trends have remained and continue to sustain. 
Looking at the second quarter, the Tractor Supply team delivered a very strong performance that exceeded our expectations as we achieved a 10.5% comparable store sales growth for the quarter and a 41% 2 years back. Our results proved yet again Tractor Supply's unique competitive advantages. Our relentless focus on being the dependable supplier for the Out Here Lifestyle is embedded in our purpose as a company. Our Life Out Here strategy is still in the early days, and we are seeing positive trends from our initiatives. We're excited by the momentum.  
We remain committed to investing in our team members as we believe they are a key competitive differentiator with our customers. Just last month, we increased pay for nearly 27,000 of our tenured hourly store team members and also raised our minimum wage to $11.25 per hour. Our team members continue to make Tractor Supply the special place that it is. Investing in our team members is not only the right thing to do, but it's also a way to recognize their role in driving our business forward.  
Now turning to our results for the second quarter of 2021. Our net sales grew approximately 13.4%. Comparable store sales grew 10.5% driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 6% and transaction count increase of 4.5%. Diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $3.19. Importantly, the underlying foundation of our business is robust. 
For the quarter, every week had positive comps. Our growth was broad-based across regions and product categories. We continue to gain share across all categories, online and in stores. For instance, in Q2, we experienced comparable store growth in our consumable, usable and edible categories that was well above our overall comparable store sales.  E-commerce recorded its largest ever quarter of sales. The work we have done over the last year to improve our e-commerce capabilities have certainly resonated with our customers. In just under a year, our mobile app already has more than 1.6 million downloads and now represents over 10% of our e-commerce sales. 
Given our strong performance year-to-date, coupled with our outlook for the balance of the year, we are raising our sales and earnings guidance for the year. Kurt will share more details on our revised outlook later in the call.  
Regarding our pending acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home that we announced in February, we are working cooperatively with the SEC on their second request. We look forward to the benefits this transaction will offer customers with improved products and competitive pricing.  
We have previously shared key observations of our customer behaviors based on our market data and research, and I would like to update you on that today.  Overall, our customer metrics remain very healthy with both traffic and spending increasing at a balanced rate. So let's run through some of the insights that are most relevant.  
First, we are seeing broad, continued strength across our customer base. More customers than ever are shopping Tractor Supply. And these customers are making more trips than ever and are spending more money per trip than ever. We are seeing strong retention of customers that have shopped us over the last 12 months.  Our retention rates continue to run above historical trends. The conversion of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program to a points-based rewards is resonating with our customers. Year-over-year, we've added nearly 5 million new members to the program.  
In our Neighbor's Club members, they're spending about 3x the rate of nonmembers and they're comping at a rate well above the chain average. Neighbor's Club members accounted for about 65% of our sales, and that's a step-up from where we've been running prior to the relaunch of the program.  We've grown our high-value customer base in the program by about 15% year-to-date with customers migrating upward in spending significantly outpacing any downward spending. The retention rate of our most valuable customers is running north of 95%. 
New customers are joining the Neighbor's Club program at a rate of nearly 30%, significantly above the rate from last year. And the new customers we are acquiring as compared to our core customers are continuing to skew younger.  We're seeing significant growth in our millennial shoppers. Our trends this quarter for the customer age cohorts of 18 years to 45 years old were in line with the first quarter. And we continue to believe that the growth in this customer segment has staying power.  
Much like last quarter, the types of trends we're seeing can simply be described as once in a generation. We believe key aspects to our customer service, such as a convenient place to shop, product assortment, legendary customer service and in-stock levels, are important to keeping these existing and new customers engaged with our brands.  
On the macro front, the economy remains strong and key trends continue to work in our favor, such as rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption and a self-reliant lifestyle movement, including DIY trends and hobbies like gardening, backyard poultry and pet adoptions. 
While the cost environment remains elevated across imports, domestic freight, commodities and labor wages, the merchant team has been aggressively advocating for our customers' needs. Where necessary, we are taking price increases to pass through some of the cost pressures that we cannot offset.  We are closely monitoring the price elasticity to ensure that we are focused on product unit trends. 
The team is doing an excellent job navigating this environment. Over the past few months, we have navigated unprecedented conditions. As the country opens back up, the Out Here Lifestyle remains incredibly relevant.  
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt to review the quarter in more depth and our outlook before I come back to give insights on our Life Out Here strategy and other drivers of the second half of 2021."
329501,715371356,2347635,"Tractor Supply Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2021",2021-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Tractor Supply Company","Executives","Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call today.  As Hal shared many details on the second quarter, in my time on the call today, I'd like to go into some of the specifics around our financial performance and our increased outlook for the full y",1342,"Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call today.  
As Hal shared many details on the second quarter, in my time on the call today, I'd like to go into some of the specifics around our financial performance and our increased outlook for the full year. We are very pleased with our performance. These results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business and our strategic initiatives. 
For the quarterly cadence, April and June were the strongest months of the comp store sales performance.  All geographic regions and all major merchandising categories had comp store sales growth. We believe the underlying health of our business is structurally advantaged. A great example of this is the strength in our consumable, usable and edible products. 
Our CUE products represent the strength of our core business and what drives trips to the store. For the fifth consecutive quarter in a row, CUE had comp store sales growth above 15%. Key subcategories, such as poultry, livestock feed and dry dog food, were among the strongest categories with comp sales all greater than 25%. 
Of note, we are seeing strong retention rates of our new customers across every species of livestock and companion animal. For example, poultry, a hallmark home-setting category for Tractor Supply, has the highest retention rate of the animal species for new customers and new to the category.  Our big-ticket categories, which were going against significant growth in the prior year, continue to have strong comp sales performance above the chain average. This was driven by strength in zero-turn mowers, safes, utility vehicles and trailers.  
Lastly, inflation contributed about 350 to 400 basis point to comparable store sales in the quarter. Our second quarter gross margin rate was 35.8%, a decrease of 67 basis points. Year-over-year, the gross margin drivers are principally 3 items: first, higher freight costs that all of retail is experiencing; second, an initial impact from the relaunch of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program; and third, a more normalized CUE product mix.  Our price management program partially offset these factors as we look to mitigate the impact of inflation and other cost pressures. 
Consistent with our guidance, we received approximately 40 basis points benefit from vendor funding for the Field Activity Support Teams, or FAST, initiative, which was launched in the second half last year. Of note, we continue to see favorability in the frequency and depth of promotions as we are committed to being true to our everyday low pricing strategy and continue to see strong demand for our product categories. 
For comparison, our gross margin rate this quarter was still about 90 basis points above our Q2 2019 rate of 34.9%.  Our second quarter SG&A expense ratio, including depreciation and amortization, improved by 6 basis points to 22.3%. This improvement was primarily attributable to lower COVID-19 pandemic response costs and decreased incentive compensation as well as good leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in our comparable store sales. Partially offsetting this leverage were higher wage rates, additional store labor hours to ensure we are providing great customer service and investments in our Life Out Here strategic initiatives.  
The offset to our FAST initiative benefiting gross margin was approximately 40 basis points of incremental SG&A expense for the labor costs for the team. Much like our gross margin rate, our SG&A performance compares favorably to Q2 2019 when our SG&A expense ratio was 22.7%.  Operating profit increased 8.5% with operating profit margin of 13.5% on the quarter. Net income was $370 million, an increase of 9.3%. Diluted EPS was $3.19, an increase of 10%.   
Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong. Merchandise inventories were $1.99 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing a 14% increase in average inventory per store. The increase principally reflects growth to support the robust sales trends along with the impact of inflation.  Our supply chain and our vendors are executing at a very high level to meet the customers' current demands. We finished the quarter with $1.41 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $500 million revolver.  
Moving now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021. Looking ahead, while the trends in our business provide additional confidence in the structural nature of the tailwind, we remain aware that the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccine rollout can have further impact on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results.  With still some measure of uncertainty, we continue to plan for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes and will remain nimble and adjust as necessary. Our updated guidance reflects the strong results in the first half of the year and the positive momentum we see in our business continuing into the second half of 2021.  
Please note that the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance. So against the backdrop of what we know today, we are updating our guidance to a net sales range of $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion with comparable store sales growth in the range of 11% to 13%.  For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.7% to 9.9% of sales, a step-up from our prior guidance. Diluted EPS is now forecast in the range of $7.70 to $8. This compares to our previous earnings range of $7.05 to $7.40 per diluted share. 
We have a unique opportunity with the positive customer trends and momentum in the business.  We are committed to investing in store and supply chain labor as we look to provide legendary customer service to meet our customers' expectations. While we continue to lap challenging sales and earnings comps, we expect positive sales comp in both the third and fourth quarter with the third quarter a few points higher than the fourth quarter.  
Please keep in mind, we will continue to cycle strong gross margin performance of the prior year where we benefited from minimal promotional or clearance activity as well as favorable product mix where CUE products represented a smaller portion of sales.  Much like the results in the second quarter, we are expecting gross margin decline in the back half of the year due to higher transportation costs and continued strength in CUE products.  Our guidance assumes promotional activity comparable to last year in Q3 with Q4 seeing some shifts back to normalizing promotions during the holiday season.  
While we are dealing with significantly higher transportation costs, a mix shift to CUE and cost of goods increases, we continue to see benefit from a pullback in promotions and are seeing less price elasticity from consumers as we adjust prices. We believe we are effectively navigating impacts to our gross margin. The strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a hallmark of Tractor Supply. 
We have raised our outlook for capital spending to now be in the range of $500 million to $600 million to reflect higher construction and raw material costs for store projects and increased technology investments for the customer experience.  We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases.  For 2021, we remain on track for anticipated share repurchases in a range of $700 million to $800 million. This year will mark a milestone with approximately $1 billion return to shareholders due to combination of share repurchases and dividends. 
To wrap up, we are very pleased with our performance in the first half of the year and see positive momentum carrying into the second half of 2021. We continue to build relevance and market share both today and over time. We are excited about the investments ahead of us to better serve our customers from new stores, Project Fusion remodels and our side lot transformation. We are strengthening our supply chain and growing our digital commerce, all in support of our commitment to driving strong shareholder returns for the long term. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Hal."

Tractor Supply has thrived over the last 15 months. We continue to operate from a position of strength and are committed to investing in the business. Our Life Out Here strategy is designed to capitalize on the attractive opportunity that we see in our nearly $110 billion total addressable market. We are transforming our stores through our Project Fusion remodel and side lot transformation, optimizing our technology in store and online and investing in how we operate our stores. 
I'm incredibly proud of the progress the team has made in advancing our strategic priorities, especially amid a global pandemic and running the business at an elevated rate. So let me share with you an update on how a few of our top initiatives are progressing. I'll start with the Field Activity Support Team, a 1,200-plus person organization that is designed to improve store labor productivity. Example task of the FAST team includes execution of merchandising programs like center court, endcaps, clip strips, planogram resets, seasonal programs and our sales-driving initiatives. 
Rolled out in the third quarter of last year, this team has made great progress in improving execution of our merchandising activity, which represents the second largest body of work for our store team members. Year-to-date, the execution attack by the FAST team is running at 97% or nearly 33 points higher than our base year of 2019. The FAST team is allowing the store teams to spend more time on customer service and improve their in-store execution.  We believe the FAST team will continue to contribute to comparable store sales well into the future. 
Turning next to our Project Fusion store remodel program. Recall our Project Fusion is our state-of-the-art space productivity program designed to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base and give new customers that may not have shopped with us in the past more reasons to visit. 
We now have more than 160 stores in the new layout, and the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Our customers are taking note of things like the improved shopping experience in our remodels. And specifically in our customer intercept surveys, they're calling out better organization, improved merchandise selection, cleaner and brighter and easier to navigate factors. 
While the majority of the remodels have been completed more recently, we are very pleased with the early read of our customer response and the comp lift of the remodel is running in line with our expectations.  Given the size of our store base, this is a multiyear opportunity to continually refresh our store base and further drive comp sales. 
Another component of our space productivity program is the transformation of our side lot. Typically, there's as much space outside of our stores in the side lot as we have inside the store. The productivity of this space is substantially below the chain average.  We're in the midst of a multiyear project to transform our side lot with an expanded product offering and an enhanced shopping experience. 
With this investment, the side lot space is leveraged to offer a wider product offering in the lawn and garden categories, enter new categories and offer greater convenience through the expansion of our buy online, pick up at store capabilities or drive-through pickup.  We also continue to see a positive halo effect from the garden center to the existing store and vice versa. 
The addition of product categories, increased ease of shopping and new services provides us with even more ways to continue to keep our existing customers engaged to Tractor Supply and attract new customers to the brand.  Our ability to drive higher sales per square foot through the transformation of our side lot remains a significant opportunity. We currently have about 60 side lot transformations completed, and we anticipate having greater than 150 complete as we exit 2021. In these early remodels, we're learning a great deal about our customers' appetite for our expanded lawn and garden assortment and we're even more excited than we embarked on the initial test pilots. 
The team has done a great job laying the foundation of our Life Out Here strategy as we scale our transformational initiatives. Beyond our multiyear strategic initiatives, at Tractor Supply, we are always focused on having the seasonally appropriate offerings to support our customers. 
Wrapping up the summer season, we're exiting the quarter with our -- with clean inventory for the seasonal changeover. We continue to focus on enhancing our product offerings for the transition to the important fall and winter season. Across all areas of the store and online, we have fall-centric merchandising and marketing plans in place to keep our customers engaged. Whether it's the launch of our Pet Appreciation Week in September to the rollout of our deer hunting planogram set or our focus on heating products for the change in temperature, our customers know that they can count on Tractor Supply for the relevant products that they need to live Life Out Here.  
We are leveraging new items and innovation across grilling, safe and home and decor. In addition, Ridgecut, our exclusive brand of performance workwear, will be expanded across new categories and into women's workwear. These product expansions are relevant to both new and existing customers and will help retain our growing customer base.  Across all parts of the store, we have exciting products for the fall and winter as we shift gears to ramp up for our customers' needs to care for their land, home, animals and pets as colder weather comes. 
On the marketing front, we're making continued investments to drive our brand awareness. As part of our plans, we're excited to announce the new multiyear partnership to be the official Life Out Here partner for the Professional Bull Riders effective this season. The partnership includes a flagship presence on the PBR tour that host over 200 events per year, a Tractor Supply branded broadcast booth during the preshow on CBS, an in-arena broadcast activation and local customer activation.  PBR will also produce and distribute custom content for our social media channels. We're very excited to support our customers' passion for this dynamic and rapidly growing sport. 
Again, on marketing, given the strong millennial trends we have been experiencing, we're investing in marketing to continue to attract and nurture this important demographic.  Given that the millennial customer cohort may not be as familiar with our brand, we are executing marketing plans to introduce Tractor Supply to this next generation of customers. Just last month, we launched a new campaign targeting millennials and media channels like Pandora, YouTube and other streaming services. This campaign is called Welcome to Life Out Here and introduces this new audience to what lies ahead in our stores and the lifestyle we help support.  The focus is on key categories such as pet, backyard poultry, gardening and self-reliance. 
With the primary goal to drive awareness, the millennial campaign has delivered significant impressions since the launch. Early results show best-in-class performance in ad recall and awareness relative to traditional benchmarks. We believe this indicates that we are resonating with this audience, and it is driving consideration for Tractor Supply. 
To summarize, we've delivered strong results year-to-date and made significant progress with our strategic initiatives. We have confidence that our strategy and execution will allow us to continue to build a stronger Tractor Supply. With our purposeful actions, we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger company. It's an exciting time at Tractor Supply. My appreciation goes out to each and every one of our more than 45,000 Tractor Supply team members for their dedication to our mission and values. 
And with that, operator, we would now like to open the line for questions."

And then we also tried to create tier levels that would naturally encourage upward migration and discourage downward migration. 
I'd say a few things. As we talked about on the call, our Neighbor's Club members now account for over 65% of our sales. Our retention rate on our Neighbor's Club members is over 80%, very strong retention rate on an annualized basis. And as we said, our highest -- our third tier of spending, which is the Neighbor's Club premium, plus the retention rates there are over 95%. So we're seeing significant upward migration. We're seeing reduced downward migration. 
And the final thing I'll make a mention of is that our Neighbor's Club members, they make 2 more trips a quarter on average than our non-Neighbor's Club members. And our Neighbor's Club members had spent over $1,000 a year. We've got almost 2.5 million of those, and that's increasing kind of on a daily basis. 
So it's a very robust program with its 21-plus million members. We've seen over 5 million members join us in the last 12 months. We're seeing outstanding retention. We're seeing excellent migration. As we migrate them, their retentions are holding and actually improving. And we've seen a significant response, positive response to the rollout of the new program. As mentioned in our prepared remarks, since the rollout of the program, our Neighbor's Club members are significantly outcomping our overall chain average."

I'd say if you track back to our October earnings -- enhanced earnings day last year, kind of implied a bit in the graphic curve showed was a bit more of a return to normal mentality at some point that was more abrupt in nature.  And I'd say, I think as we're all watching how COVID's playing out, that's certainly not the case. 
And so I'd also say, though, that our business continues to evolve. And the -- and if you think back then, we were talking about 50-50 on structural versus transitory in terms of trends. And I think we'd lean more towards structural now in the way we view our trends if you think about pet, if you think about the millennial customer, if you think about home setting kind of rural revitalization, categories like poultry, as an example. 
So last year, as we've said several times, we sold 11 million birds. Half of those were to new customers. We're seeing, as mentioned by Kurt in his prepared remarks, outstanding retention of those customers last year that shopped with us on poultry coming back again this year. In fact, that retention rate is higher than any other animal feed or pet. 
So I mean it just shows you that the trends that began last year are really resonating and resilient. And that momentum that we're seeing with our customers and in our business and with the lifestyle, the Out Here lifestyle that we appeal to is holding incredibly strong. 
And I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that between Q2 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021, we had grown $3 billion and 34% comp. And we were kind of coming into Q2, I think like many companies, but certainly us, wondering how we would cap the comp and we had guided to kind of flattish at the beginning of the year for that and perhaps even a little down and to finish with a plus 10.5% certainly exceeded our expectations. 
And it's really all about the underlying trends to strengthen our consumer behavior, new customers and the appeal of that Out Here lifestyle. And I think there's still a lot of uncertainty in the out years and quarters, but I would say we feel more confident in the structural orientation of the trends than we did last October."

On the cadence over the next few years, as we pointed out back in October when we launched our new long-term targets and the Life Out Here strategy, we said that we've got consistency in our investment in the existing stores as we drive productivity with Fusion and Side Lot, but that where there may be some variation would be on the supply chain as we grow our supply chain, particularly new distribution centers. 
And so as you've heard us in the last couple of quarters emphasize the importance of our investment in our supply chain, we are looking to accelerate and would see us shifting some of the supply chain investments earlier in the next few years. And so there may be higher than average in '21, '22, even '23. But over the period of time, it still averages out about the 5-year expectation that we gave. And the important thing is the recognition and our confidence in the structural nature of this business and therefore, the importance of our timing of investments in the supply chain. 
So I see '21 and '22 pretty consistent in potential on capital as we emphasize ensuring the strength of our supply chain."

I'd start with the fact that we're confident we're taking share really across every major category that we have in the business both in stores and online. If you look at the profile between new customers, existing customers, both are showing strong comp transaction growth, average ticket growth. And as I said in my prepared remarks, more customers are shopping Tractor Supply than ever. They're visiting us more frequently and they're shopping -- they're spending more when they're shopping us. 
What I would say is we participate in a very attractive, large $110 billion market where our share kind of based on our new guidance would be fairly above 10%. There's a lot of share gain out there and also a lot of share to still be competed with. We're dominantly very focused on our customer and just making sure that the initiatives and the actions that we take are out there to create the best customer experience that we can whether that's investments in our team members to drive that legendary customer service or investments in inventory to ensure we're in stock for our customers. 
I would say as it relates to the promotional environment, we've not -- we've had very little to no promotions in Q1 and Q2 of this year. And that's our expectation really for the balance of the year. And I really expect the competitive environment to remain similar for no other reason because of the supply/demand situation that's out there. And the global supply chain is disrupted, as I've seen it in my 25-plus years in retail. And everyone is working hard to just keep inventory in their stores. And I think that mindset would prevail over any sort of promotional kind of share kind of push that anyone has. 
I'd also just comment that we don't directly compete with really any primary retailer. Being a lifestyle retailer, one of our benefits is that we play across a handful of large categories that are uniquely tailored to our customer. But typically, when we're competing with other companies, it's on a one-off category basis, and we really appeal to that whole lifestyle. But I don't anticipate an increase in the promotional environment in the market or certainly for us anywhere near on -- the near or medium-term horizon."

Let me give a quick backdrop and that will lead towards the back half. But we entered the year expecting 100 to 200 basis points of retail inflation throughout the year that quickly produced in Q1 closer to 300 basis points principally from commodities. 
And then as we shifted into Q2 at the 350 to 450 basis points of retail benefit from inflation, one, it demonstrates the ability, as Hal mentioned, to be able to adjust pricing appropriately. But the increase from -- in Q2 over Q1 was principally related to transportation costs and other noncommodity-type-based cost increases.  We see the back half of the year staying at elevated levels. And we would anticipate that the numbers in Q2, it would be at that level and potentially at moderately higher levels throughout the back half. 
And in this inflation environment, I always like to remind that our merchants in our business, we deal with inflation and deflation every year, and they're managing this excellent. And we feel we've got the ability right now in the consumer sentiment, the less price elasticity and their behavior to be able to manage the inflation very well throughout this year."

I'd start out with both Fusion and side lot. We're very pleased with the results. And we've made a lot of progress over the last 6 to 9 months on both of these efforts. We've rolled out, as we mentioned, we've got over 60 -- 160 Fusions done, over 60 side lot transformations done. In addition to the work on those individual stores, we've brought the project management in-house, we're reducing our construction times and lowering costs. And we see lots of opportunity to continue to do that as we move forward, particularly on the side lot. We've iterated on kind of the plans several times and keep optimizing the format every -- as we roll it out. But we are very pleased with the results -- with the progress we made in both. 
On the results, what I'd say is we typically -- I think kind of historically in retail, it's the same in all my experiences. You start to really get a good feel for how the remodel lift is playing out kind of 3 to 4 months after the store kind of reopens and the remodels then complete. Most of our remodels hadn't been opened that long. So we're really kind of waiting over the next 3 to 6 months to start to see how that data set plays out. But what I'd say is for the stores that have been open kind of over that period of time, they are at the levels that we anticipated in our initial business case. 
So -- and we have more of those on the Fusion than we do on the side lot. But we're very pleased with the results of both projects. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, the customer excitement around us as becoming more of a destination in garden has been more significant than we even anticipated, and we're even more bullish on that as we move forward. 
As it relates to the penetration of the kind of how long, we'll -- I think you can expect to hear us share more of that over time. But I'd say, directionally, over about a 5-year time frame, you should think about kind of the Fusion stores, for the most -- the vast majority of our stores having Fusion and on side lot really around that 60% to 70%. I think we're feeling more bullish around getting more of our store base done with Fusion than may be worried in 6 months ago just the way that project is going, the cost that we're doing at it -- that we're doing it for, the early read on the lift we're seeing, and then the need just to continue to kind of remodel our store base."

And even as the -- we certainly, as a nation, we've seen this delta variant pick up. We've not seen any impact on our trends whether at a national level or at a regional level. And that's very similar to what we observed last year. 
And I think it's almost -- I hate to say it, but I think the lack of mobility sometimes driven by these outbreaks actually plays to the benefit of Tractor Supply. I think it's demonstrated that when folks are spending more time at their homes with their families, their pets, their animals, their land, they buy in Tractor Supply to be kind of that one-stop shop resource for them to continue all those hobbies that they love and they're just spending more time doing those hobbies.

And as I mentioned in -- we do an awareness survey of our customers twice a year. In our last earnings calls, I mentioned our unaided branded awareness in November of 2019 was 37% and then 18 months later, right, as we're exiting Q1, it was up to 51%. 
So we've seen a 14 point income -- sorry, a 17-point increase, 34% to 51%, a 17-point increase in our unaided brand awareness. Much of that is obviously our core customer, but a lot of it is also the millennial customer. And as we mentioned last quarter, we saw a 4-point increase in our millennial customer penetration year-over-year. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that trend continued in Q2. 
So we think the work we're doing in marketing is broadening the aperture of consumers' understanding of Tractor Supply and driving unaided awareness and kind of driving footsteps into our stores. As we said, we continue to have strong comp transactions across the board. 
And we're really excited about the partnership with PBR. We think it's a category that resonates well with our customer. And 1 -- with over 200 activities a year that we can do a lot of activation across the areas of the country where our customers are, and it will be a great partnership. 
As I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're -- also, we have launched a large marketing campaign targeted towards the millennials. And up until now, the majority of our bubble on marketing has been TV and kind of Facebook-based. And on TV, it's really been around news media. And we think that's been very successful for our core customers. Those are the major places that they engage with media. 
The millennial customer, as we all know, engages in different types of media. They're on Pandora, Spotify, YouTube. And so what this lets us do is actually create a very different creative concept called Welcome to Life Out Here, explain who Tractor Supply is and then talk about those first 2, 3 hobbies that they might engage in: backyard, poultry, backyard gardening, pets, things like that. They're kind of starter categories, if you will, in Life Out Here. 
We're very excited about that work. And the initial feedback from customers is outstanding. And just hats off to the marketing team for all the work they've done to really drive awareness of our business and drive footsteps into our store."

And two questions, margin second half and then our ability to be nimble and some of the profitability enhancement opportunity. 
So on the second half, when we look at the operating margins, here's how we view it and frame it up. Our gross margin in the pandemic was really the source of the beat in the operating margin. And we view the second half really about the gross margin performance. We anticipate Q3's gross margin performance where we've got more visibility to Q3 at this point, very much similar in line with the performance of Q2. 
As we get further into the second half of the year, we've taken a fairly prudent approach. There's more uncertainty beyond one more quarter. And we've always given a little bit more certainty on the most recent or the most nearest quarter. But in the second half, we recognized -- or the fourth quarter, we recognized supply chain disruptions, inflation factors as well as the holiday season and what level of competitive nature. 
And so we've certainly reflected some of those uncertainties in the fourth quarter. And the operating margin on the back half of the year really rides on our performance with the gross margin. And as I said earlier, and second quarter shows, we've really been able to manage in this environment very well. The business is structurally very sound. We have a lot of confidence in our business in our back half. And if some of the uncertainties don't play out, we acknowledge there's potentially some upside to the guidance that we've given. 
In regards to flexibility, as -- we always have strong profit improvement process going on. And a few of the factors that we are focused on right now where we've got some ability to be able to adjust would be in the supply chain, the work that we're doing to reduce stem miles and to continue to just lever the size of this organization, drive efficiency in there as well as our ability to be nimble on variable costs. If there's any sort of shift in the momentum of the business, we're able to shift very well in regards to variable costs in both distribution and stores to be able to adjust on that. 
We've got a solid profit improvement initiative that is driving some of the efficiencies. And these are the active offsets that we have going on to be able to help us maintain operating margins well above the 2019 ranges while we're making important investments in the business."

Now we acknowledge that if -- with our guide that shows that a second year in 2021, we'll maintain operating margins above that long-term target range. 
And so as we go -- as we get further through 2021, we certainly, as we manage this business, see as things start to normalize, we'll address the long-term expectations on gross margin.

And again, thanks for joining the call today. And yes, I'd say a few things. First off, on the sale advantage, I'd say, it predominantly gives us an opportunity in the market with our 8 distribution centers moving towards 11, the relationships that we have with our vendors and the meaningfulness of that, with the technology investments we're able to make. As an example, every single one of our team members  wears a Theatro headset that really creates an optimal customer service experience in the stores. We're in the process of rolling out new handheld devices for every team member inside the stores as well. 
Those sorts of investments are enabled by our scale, and they're enabled -- and they're really focused on helping us create, gain and capture market share and drive top line sales. And as we've talked many times, I mean our main goal is to grow at a rate faster than the market. That's what's implied in our long-term operating trends. And that's how our business is performing now. 
And then on the operating profit rate, as we've said, we've been able to -- our outlook is to hold SG&A flat or down. And we've been -- we've done that over the last 6 quarters and anticipate continuing to do so.  So as we've grown our sales and grown our sales base, we've been reinvesting in the business but doing at a point where we're not deleveraging there. 
And it's -- whether it's in the capital line or in our team member line, and we view our team members as a strategic asset. We are a customer service-driven retailer. We are not a retailer where you're going to walk in, pick the item you want, go to a self-checkout and never talk to someone, load it in your car yourself and drive away, right? We are going to help you pick the item. We're going to greet you. We're going to check you out, and we're going to help you load it in your car. And that's going to drive sustainable share gain for us. 
And then on the gross margin rate side, I think we continue to be very pleased that the promotional environment remains very little to none. And our inventory position where it is, where it's just requiring little to no clearance activity as well, our hope is that the longer that sustains itself, the more structural that becomes. 
Right now, we are in a high-cost freight and import environment, that's reflected in our guidance. And we're very pleased with the low promotional nature that's allowing us to offset those freight and import to allow us to give the guidance that we've given right now and fully acknowledge, as Kurt said, that if sales remain at the rates that they are in Q2, that there would be upside to the guidance that we've given. But we just thought it was prudent at this point to kind of provide the guidance that we have just given, the continued level of uncertainty out there."

The Tractor Supply team delivered strong results for the third quarter, with net sales up 15.8%, comparable store sales increase of 13.1% and diluted earnings per share of 20.4%.",1268,"Thank you, Mary Winn, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. The Tractor Supply team delivered strong results for the third quarter, with net sales up 15.8%, comparable store sales increase of 13.1% and diluted earnings per share of 20.4%. The team is doing an outstanding job navigating a very dynamic and challenging operating environment. We continue to benefit from many market trends that we see as very structurally sound. We have strength in our customer base. We're gaining market share across our categories. We continue to advance our Life Out Here strategy. Our business has never been stronger and we see tremendous opportunities for growth ahead of us. 
As we've consistently shared with you over the last 18 months, our strong results are a testament to our 45,000-plus team members. And I'd like to thank them for all their efforts in the quarter. They kept each other safe as we went through another COVID-19 wave and navigated through broad-based supply chain disruptions and cost of goods increases and navigated and managed through a tight labor market. Through it all, they've been resilient and persevered to deliver strong customer satisfaction scores, including all-time high [ view raw scores ]. 
Our team members are our greatest strategic asset and a key competitive differentiator with our customers. Our loyal and highly engaged team members have helped us fare better than most as far as staffing across our stores and DCs. Back in June, we raised our minimum opening wage to $11.25 per hour. Our recent wage actions bring our average hourly wage rate at our stores to nearly $15 per hour as we exit the year, with our DC at a higher rate. The investments we have made in store labor are being recognized by our customers by the overall customer satisfaction scores that I just mentioned. 
I'd also like to say thank you to our vendors and supply chain partners as we work together to overcome challenges in the global supply chain network. And together, we've been very focused on controlling what we can control to deliver these results. Across our network, we've been nimble and been able to navigate the unprecedented supply chain environment and macro issues, including inflationary pressures. And the team has done a great job addressing issues, ranging from import container shortages and port delays, driver shortages, higher freight rates and a multitude of other supply chain constraints. 
To mitigate these challenges, the team has leveraged dedicated containerships, pop-up DCs expansion of mixing centers and direct-to-store shipments. Despite these challenges, our inventory is in good shape, and our in-stock rates finished above last year at the end of the quarter. Our diversified vendor base, with only about 12% direct import, is a strong point of differentiation for us during these supply chain times. 
Given our scale and sophistication, we believe that our network is a competitive advantage to being the dependable supplier for the Out Here Lifestyle. Categories in which we participate and the Out Here Lifestyle that we serve, continue to have elevated consumer spending levels well above pre-COVID levels. We fully anticipate that the environment we're in is going to continue for the foreseeable future. And consequently, we think that the sales growth that we've seen is structurally sound, given the changes in consumer behavior and the lifestyle investments that are now much more ingrained in the consumer psyche. 
These structural trends that continue to work in our favor include things like world revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption, and a self-reliant lifestyle movement, including DIY trends and investments in hobbies like gardening, backyard poultry and, of course, pet ownership. For many workers, the return to office has been pushed out until next year, and even then, will very likely be in a hybrid environment at most employers. And at this point, our customers will have been ingrained for over 2 years. As such, we anticipate that their behaviors are much more sustainable and structural.  
To provide some color on our results, let me share a few other highlights of the third quarter. Like the second quarter, every week had positive comps. Also like the second quarter, our growth was broad-based across regions and product categories. Our e-commerce business continues to experience strong momentum with double-digit sales increases of over 40%. And in just under 1 year, our mobile app already has more than 2 million downloads and now represents over 10% of our e-commerce sales. We continue to gain share across all categories. This has been a consistent trend for multiple quarters now, and this share gain has been both online and in stores. The share gain has been aided by the increase in our unaided brand awareness, which has improved by 21 percentage points since November of 2019. This improvement, combined with positive trends in our overall customer satisfaction, are a significant contributor to the share gains we are experiencing. 
Also consistent from previous quarters, all customer segments were strong with notable strength in our core farm and ranch, which is the largest and most important of our customer base. At the same time, our digital ad campaign to target millennials is supporting the significant growth we are seeing in this important demographic. We think the relevancy of traction supply to the millennial customers has staying power, given the structural changes in the market and our customer behaviors, and we're certainly seeing that consistently quarter after quarter in our data as our average age of customer trends down. 
For the year, more customers than ever have shopped at Tractor Supply. These customers are making more trips and are spending more money per trip. And our new customer retention remained very strong. Our Neighbor's Club loyalty program continues to exceed our expectations, with year-over-year sales growth of these members north of 20%. We exited the quarter with more than 22 million Neighbor's Club members. These members are spending more than about 3x the rate of nonmembers, with Neighbor's Club members now accounting for nearly 70% of our sales. This continues to be a step-up from where we've been running prior to the relaunch of the program and sequential improvement over the second quarter of this year. The number of high-value customers in the program grew almost 30% for the quarter, and we continue to experience retention rate in excess of 95% for our high-value customers. These strong results demonstrate that the changes to Neighbor's Club continued to gain traction with our customers. 
Given our robust performance through the third quarter, along with our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again raising our sales and earning guidance for 2021, and Kurt will share more details on our improved outlook later in the call. Regarding our pending acquisition of Orscheln Farm & Home, we continue to work cooperatively with the FTC as it continues to review the proposed transaction. We look forward to the benefits this transaction will offer customers with improved product offering and competitive pricing. 
As has been the case over the last 18 months, I'm incredibly proud of the way our entire Tractor Supply team has managed to stay focused on taking care of each other and our customers. Our long-term opportunities remain very exciting. Our goal has been to emerge from the pandemic stronger. Over the course of the last year, since rolling out our Life Out Here strategy, we have gotten stronger through this pandemic. And we believe that we're going to emerge from an even stronger and better positioned as we execute our strategy. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt."

Once again, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business and our strategic initiatives. As Hal shared, we continue to believe the underlying health of our business is",1116,"Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Once again, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business and our strategic initiatives. As Hal shared, we continue to believe the underlying health of our business is very strong. 
Third quarter comp store sales of 13.1%, representing a 39.9% 2-year stack, were driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 9.5% and transaction count increase of 3.6%. An example of the structural advantage we have is the ongoing strength in our consumable, usable and edible products. Our key products represent the strength of our core business and what drives trips to the store. Once again, Q outperformed the chain average comp sales. And for the sixth consecutive quarter in a row, Q had comp sales growth at or above 15%. 
Key subcategories such as poultry, livestock feed and dry dog food were among the strongest categories with broad-based strength. Our big ticket categories, which were going against significant growth in the prior year, continued to have solid comp store sales performance in line with the chain average. This was driven by strength in trailers, recreational and utility vehicles, safes and zero-turn mowers. Inflation contributed about 700 basis points to comparable store sales. As you've heard from the retail sector and others, the cost environment remains elevated across imports, domestic freight, commodities and labor wages. 
Our merchant team has been aggressively advocating for our customers. Where necessary, we are taking price increases to pass through some of the cost pressures that we cannot offset. Our merchant and supply chain teams are currently navigating this challenging and disruptive environment extremely well. As we closely monitor our customers' purchasing behaviors, we are focused on product unit trends and are committed to being priced right every day. 
Our third quarter gross margin rate was 36%, a decrease of 41 basis points versus last year. For comparison, our gross margin rate this quarter was still about 100 basis points above our Q3 2019 rate of 35%. Year-over-year, the gross margin drivers were principally 3 items: first, higher product cost inflation; second, elevated freight costs, inclusive of domestic and import costs; and third, a more normalized product mix shift in Q. All of retail is working through the drivers of inflation and freight costs. The Tractor Supply team effectively offset a significant portion through our price management program. 
Additionally, we continue to see favorability in the frequency and depth of promotions. This is due to our commitment to our everyday low pricing strategy and a continued strong demand for our product categories. The benefit from vendor funding for the field activity support teams for our FAST initiative, which was launched in the second half of last year was consistent with our guidance. Our third quarter SG&A expense ratio, including depreciation and amortization, improved by 58 basis points versus last year to 26.1%. This improvement as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to good leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in our comparable store sales, along with lower COVID-19 pandemic response costs and decreased incentive compensation. Partially offsetting this leverage were higher wage rates, incremental store labor hours to ensure we are providing great customer service and investments in our Life Out Here strategic initiatives. 
Given the elevated volumes and current operating environment, we also incurred select discrete costs such as incremental team member benefits, pop-up DCs and the timing of our annual sales meeting, which normally occurs in the first quarter. The offset to our FAST initiative benefiting gross margin was approximately 20 basis points of incremental SG&A expense for the labor cost for the team as we are now cycling the initial investment to launch the program last year. 
Much like our gross margin rate, our SG&A performance compares favorably to Q3 2019. We've had about 70 basis point favorable expense ratio since then. Operating profit increased about 18%, with operating profit margin of nearly 10% in the quarter. Diluted EPS was $1.95, an increase of 20.4% from the third quarter of last year. 
Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong. At the end of the quarter, our merchandise inventories were $2.2 billion, representing an 11.7% increase year-over-year in average inventory per store. The increase principally reflects growth to support the robust sales trends along with the impact of inflation. 
Moving now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021. We continue to operate in a time of heightened uncertainty regarding the pandemic. Despite this uncertainty, including product cost inflation and supply chain constraints, we are raising our full year outlook. Our updated guidance reflects the strong results for the first 3 quarters of the year and the positive and structural momentum we see in our business continuing into the fourth quarter. 
Against the backdrop of what we know today, we are forecasting fiscal 2021 net sales centered around $12.6 billion with comparable store sales growth of about 16%. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 10.2% to 10.3%, a step-up from our prior guidance. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $8.40 to $8.50. This compares to our previous earnings range of $7.70 to $8 per diluted share. Within this updated guidance, we are forecasting comparable store sales growth for the fourth quarter of 8% to 10%. 
Two modeling points to keep in mind. The prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm & Home is not included in our guidance. And as you start to roll forward your models for 2022, please keep in mind that next year will have a 53rd week for us. This week is typically a low volume week of sales, given that it follows the Christmas holidays. We have a unique opportunity with the positive customer trends and momentum in the business. And with that, we are committed to investing in store and supply chain labor as we look to provide a legendary customer experience across all channels. 
The strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a position of strength for Tractor Supply. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2021, we remain on track for anticipated share repurchases in a range of $750 million to $800 million. This year will mark a milestone, with approximately $1 billion returned to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends. 
In summary, our results proved yet again Tractor Supply's unique competitive advantages. Our relentless focus on being the dependable supplier for the Out Here Lifestyle is embedded in our purpose as a company. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hal."

Now I'd like to share with you an update on our recent ESG announcement as well as provide updates on our Fusion and Side Lot strategic initiatives, which are key parts of our Life Out Here strategy. 
At a time of urgency and action on climate change and social justice, we just announced new goals that are the next step in our long-standing commitment to sustainability, stewardship and opportunity. By 2040, we are committing to achieve net zero carbon emissions across all our operations. As part of our social commitments, we are prioritizing and accelerating our initiatives and actions for diversity, equity and inclusion. At Tractor Supply, we are focused on cultivating an environment of inclusion, where diversity of all kinds is appreciated and valued. I invite you to learn more on our dedicated ESG website. 
Turning next to our Life Out Here strategy. As a reminder, we've been executing against 5 key strategic initiatives this year as part of our overall strategy. And those initiatives are Neighbor's Club, Digital, FAST, Fusion and Side Lot. The strategy and its initiatives are designed to capitalize on the attractive opportunity that we see in our nearly $110 billion total addressable market. Our Project Fusion and Side Lot model transformations represent significant investments in our stores. These store level investments are designed to grow our market share and drive the productivity of both existing and new stores as part of our Life Out Here strategy. 
So let's start with our Project Fusion store remodel program. As a quick reminder, Project Fusion is our state-of-the-art space productivity program designed to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base and give customers that may not have shopped with us in the past more reasons to shop. We anticipate having about 15% of our total store base in the new Fusion layout by year-end. We've reduced the time to complete Fusion remodels by 50% since the beginning of the year and, in turn, allowing us to minimize the disruption to the store operations and our customers' shopping experience. 
Our customers are taking note of the improved layout, the ease of shopping and our new product offerings. Specifically, in our customer intercept surveys, they call out better organization, improved merchandise selection, cleaner and brighter aisle and easier to navigate layout. Categories seeing the strongest lift in sales include areas like apparel, companion animal and power tools. Given the size of our store base, this is a multiyear opportunity to continually refresh our store base and further drive comp sales through productivity. 
Another significant component of our space productivity efforts is the transformation of our Side Lot. Again, as a reminder, typically, there's as much space outside of our stores in the side lot as we have on the inside of our store, and the productivity of this space is substantially below the chain average. We're in the midst of a multiyear project to transform our side lot with an expanded product offering and an enhanced shopping experience. With this investment, the side lot space is leveraged to offer a wider product offering in the lawn and garden categories, enter new categories with a garden center and offer greater convenience through the expansion of our buy online, pick up in store capabilities for drive-through pickup. 
In select locations that meet sales volume thresholds, we're also adding a feed room to help deliver the bag feed demand. And as a reminder, we're the largest seller of bag feed in the country. We also continue to see a positive halo effect from the garden center to the existing store and vice versa. The addition of product categories increased ease of shopping and new services provides us with even more ways to continue to keep our existing customers engage with Tractor Supply and attract new customers also to the brand. 
Our ability to drive higher sales per square foot through the transformation of our silo space remains a significant opportunity. We anticipate having about 150 Side Lots complete across the chain as we exit 2021. In these early remodels, we're learning a great deal about our customers' appetite for an expanded lawn and garden assortment. And we're even more excited than we were when we embarked on the initial test pilot late last year. As with our Fusion remodels, we continue to reduce the project time line also here by about 50% and minimizing the disruption to our customers and store teams as we implement our findings from our test and learn process. While still early on, we are very positive about the continued refinement and learning. 
While implementing construction projects of this scope and scale has been very challenging in the current macroenvironment, we're making progress in our ability to significantly reduce construction costs, the construction time and the corresponding disruption at the store site. While the majority of the remodels have been completed more recently, we are very pleased with the early read on sales lift. Post the disruption period, we're seeing lifts of low single digits for Fusion remodels and mid-single digits for combo stores, which have both fusion and Pivot remodels. We expect continued improvements in these results as the stores normalize and are forecasting year 1 lift of mid-single digits for Fusion and high single digits for combo stores, which is on track for the expectations we had as we began these projects. 
Over the course of the last year, the team has done a great job operating the business at elevated levels, navigating unprecedented challenges and also executing our transformational initiatives to support our Life Out Here strategy. And to wrap up, our results clearly underscore that our strategies are working, that the team is navigating the challenges effectively and that we're emerging from the pandemic stronger than before. We're extremely optimistic about our future. 
As we enter one of the busiest periods in retail, my thanks and sincere appreciation go out to each of the more than 45,000 Tractor Supply team members for their dedication and commitment to our mission and values. And with that, operator, we would like to open the lines for questions."

Yes, on gross margins, we're very pleased both with our short-term results, kind of this past quarter on gross margin and also very optimistic about the long-term nature of our gross margins. On the short term, we've had significant amount of cost coming through our business, whether that's in cost of goods as it relates to raw -- kind of raw materials and commodity-based goods, also vendors passing along costs related to labor and freight, we've also seen freight cost increase as well as well as the costs related to imports. The team has done an excellent job navigating those costs, finding offsets, productivity measures really being the advocate for the customer to keep prices as low as possible. 
That said, as Kurt mentioned, we did have inflation to the tune of 7% in the quarter, which helped us offset a lot of those costs and deliver the gross margin results that we did in the quarter, which sequentially from a gap to last year improved from Q2. Long term, as we talked about on several of our calls, the question is really around promotional intensity and the clearance intensity -- a clearance intensity in the business. And those 2 remain at the same levels as they have over the last 6 quarters, very low. We remain very focused on everyday low price, we remain very focused on delivering value every single day to our customers. And we see it playing out that way for the foreseeable future. We have no plans for significant promotional intensity  in Q4 and we think that we'll remain in a very supply-constrained environment as we move into the first half of next year. And that, too, will continue to limit any sort of promotional intensity in the market. 
And a couple of years in now with minimal promotional intensity, I think that bodes well for being able to maintain kind of a low promotional kind of structure going forward. And so as I said, again, we're very pleased with our short-term gross margin results and also very optimistic about the structural nature of our long-term gross margin."

Second thing I'll talk about is the consistency of our business. And the third, I'll talk about is share gain. In the broad macro trends, all the trends that we saw in Q2 of last year really have all sustained themselves. And I think there are certain retailers and other businesses that had -- that saw the benefit as it relates to kind of COVID behavior early to mid last year and that weighs. 
And I think that's not been the case for us, whether it's things like rural revitalization, which is a bit more of a permanent in -- as people move and whether it's things like pet ownership and adoption, again, permanent and more so in nature. Whether it's home setting and just kind of the self-reliance mentality, we're seeing those as more permanent behaviors and really no matter what data set you look at, whether it's home purchases, whether it's mobility, whether it's pet ownership, any sort of qualitative data on where people are spending their money, they all reinforce the structural nature of those trends. 
The second thing I'd point to is the consistency, as I mentioned, our business has been remarkably consistent month-to-month, week-to-week, by category and by region. And that's been regardless of whether or not we've been in COVID surges or whether or not certain states have been more locked down or less. And then also new customers who are finding the lifestyle that we serve, to be kind of what they're seeking in this time. And we're gaining share really across the board on all of our categories in that context. So I'd point to those 3 things that give us real confidence. There's a set of COVID [indiscernible] that were early on and have seen some of that wane. And then there's another set that are seeing it much more structural and sustained and I very much put it with the [indiscernible]"

Thanks for joining the call. When you look ahead over the next couple of months, just a little bit more broadly, other than just outside of the energy cost as well, we're really excited about the opportunity that lies ahead based of, of all the macro benefits that Hal just discussed. And I'd love to just highlight a couple things that we'd love to see to drive our business over this holiday season and to maximize and capitalize on that opportunity. 
When we think about that, we are really excited about how the team and the merchandising team continues to execute on our portfolio strategy, leveraging the fact team. We are doing a record number of resets throughout the year, not just, call it, pre-holiday, but continuing in that reset and the new item activity as we go through the quarter.
And for holiday, specifically, over the next couple of months, we're really excited about the momentum we're seeing in some of these new customer trends as well as our core customers that are coming to us for categories more broadly than maybe they have in the past, things like apparel and footwear. And we're seeing expansions like in key brands that consumers are really resonating with brands like [ Colombia ] and [ Eriett ], Carhart, even our own brand like Ridgecut, where we're expanding into the women's line up, where that shopper is now coming to us where they weren't in the past where we can continue to drive market share in those categories. 
We're also seeing that with that rural revitalization consumers come to us for outdoor activities even here in the fall. So things like patio heaters, grills, even like wildlife and UTV is driving that demand. We're still seeing strength across the board there. And then we're going to continue to focus on our Q activity where customers are coming to us for footsteps. So with a record number of pet adoptions over the last few years, we continue to be extremely excited about the momentum that we have in our pet business holistically as well as the Q business, and we're going to be looking to drive that throughout the whole holiday season. 
So I know it's a little bit broader than just kind of the energy market question there as well, but also where we see it as we come through, like we're seeing activity across our consumer base be very consistent with what we've seen over the last few quarters, and they're really resonating with the new items, the new categories as well as the new partnerships that we're continuing to establish."

We take a look at where those costs are contributing, both in transportation and product costs, and we look at our portfolio, Seth and the merchant team manages the shopping patterns for -- from the customers as well as making sure that in key traffic driving areas, we've got great everyday low pricing.

My question really is, moving forward, do you still need a 3% comp or so to lever your expenses?

And to your point, right now, we're seeing really strong momentum in the business. And that does elevate our ability to leverage on the cost, but we're also using that to the point that Hal made and that I made in our prepared remarks that we definitely see this as a tremendous opportunity. We're investing from a position of strength. So our continued outlook about managing SG&A to flattish over time, we'll still be our outlook and the way we're managing this business.

We're seeing the results of our investments in the business. As we shared today, the Fusion stores and the Side Lot stores are performing very well. As they mature and begin to normalize, we're seeing the results right in line with what our expected -- our kind of business model and business plan for them were.

Orschlen is not considered in any of the numbers or the guidance that we've given. In regards to the depreciation of the expense structure, so COVID expenses have been elevated from the level that we entered the year into, just because the pandemic with the Delta variant and others have lingered, they're at lower levels than we saw in comparable quarters last year. But we continue to emphasize having a safe and clean environment for our customers and our team members. 
The incentive comp with the outperformance this year, while at lower levels than last year, continue to be above target. And so as you think about going forward, those are items for us as in future years, those are leverage points. And if -- like in this year, while there's incentive comp above target, the performance gives leverage above and beyond the level that we're paying an incentive comp. So it's net an overall leverage this year. And next year, those will be favorable items to compare against. 
The depreciation expense, as I mentioned earlier, the growth rate that were -- that I quoted and referring to, is very much in line with what we expected in our long-range plan when we launched the Life Out Here strategy and talked about a 3- to 5-year plan. And so with the elevated sales, I mean, we feel very comfortable with a 20% growth rate in depreciation because that's where those investments are at, does not include Orschlen, and again, we're very comfortable with the management we've got and what we have visibility on our expenses for the fourth quarter and even the near term beyond that."

The add that I would make to that is as it relates to the Side Lot with the Garden Center, we have a couple of stores that are -- that went through kind of year 2 of spring, we saw kind of outsized gains in those, which is in line again with our expectation that we would see more of a maturity curve with the garden center than we would with the inside of the store Fusion remodel. We think that -- we expect and what we're seeing in the Fusion remodel is more of an immediate impact with kind of the maturity curve being more of a 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-month maturity curve, whereas with the Garden Center, we're seeing a nice, strong immediate impact. But then we're also seeing kind of 12 to 18 months kind of continuation of that maturity curve. 
But yes, the results are very much in line, nice positive lift already even a few months into each of the remodels. And then we see even continued lift as we complete kind of year 1 of those remodels, whether it's Fusion or the combo."

I'll hit kind of 3 things on Side Lot and then I'll just briefly touch base on fusion productivity. On the Side Lot, the 3 things I'll talk about is the Garden Center, I'll talk about BOPIS, and then I'll talk",868,"Chuck, and thanks for joining the call today. I'll hit kind of 3 things on Side Lot and then I'll just briefly touch base on fusion productivity. On the Side Lot, the 3 things I'll talk about is the Garden Center, I'll talk about BOPIS, and then I'll talk about our feed rooms. 
So first, on the Garden Center, our customers key data set is that the category that we least address from a destination perspective, that they most engage in is live goods and garden. And so that's really what the Garden Center strategy is all about, is creating another queue destination category in our business. And -- but we're seeing that in our results. I'd say we're more excited now about the prospects for kind of adding to our fleet to Garden Center than we were even this time last year. 
And just kind of tactically, the behavior we're seeing our customers is exactly what you expect. It's a little less around beautification like what you might see in a more of a home improvement store in terms of the core product and much more about fruits and vegetables and shrubs and trees, all those sorts of things that really speak to Life Out Here, whether it's the gardening you do in your backyard or whether it's the shrubs and the trees you're planning along your fence line and in your land. And we have significant convenient kind of advantages for our customers from a location perspective. So the Garden Centers are performing very well, and we're just getting started, both on the build-out of those obviously, but also with our relationships with our live goods vendors and the assortments tailoring it by store. 
The second thing is on BOPIS drive-thru. We are seeing incredibly high levels of drive-through behavior from our customers. And we're seeing in some of our stores that have been open for 4, 5, 6, 8 months now, we're seeing 50%, 60%, 75% of the buy online, pick-up in store being drive-through. And just that extra convenience factor you're seeing with customers, and then that's driving repeat behavior. And so really pleased with how that's evolving and the behavior we're seeing from our customers is consistent with what the feature was when we rolled it out. 
And then lastly is the feed room. So we are the largest seller of bag feed in the country. And if you think about our average store volumes and the growth we've seen in those store volumes, combined with the outsized performance in queue, that's put a lot of stress on our stores as it relates to the receipt of bag goods, getting it out under the store staying in stock for our customers and then being able to kind of get that on to customers' trucks and out towards -- get them on their way. and the feed rooms have provided valuable capacity and also allowed us to effectively from a cost perspective, serve that customer because we're not touching the bags 2 and 3, 4x. We're able to leverage our mixing centers in a way that they're designed now. 
And so all 3 of those things are really coming together. We're seeing excellent performance across all 3 exactly as we designed them and built them. And we're continuing to use our test and learn to tweak it along the way. And as you think about our productivity as we move forward, we're still committed to our comps kind of outpacing overall retail and outpacing the Life Out Here market that we define as that $110 billion market. And so you can expect continued productivity improvements on our same-store sales in an outsized way as we move forward, even in spite of 6 consecutive quarters now with double-digit comps, we still have that expectation moving forward. 
One other thing I just -- while I've got the mic here, so to speak, I'd like to just step back and reference, it's a bit about kind of our long-term kind of op margin leverage, as Kurt was talking about. What I'd say is if you look at our long-term guidance, because there are several questions on this topic. We -- our long-term guidance that we announced last year had 6% to 7% sales growth and 8% to 10% earnings per diluted share, which implies continued leverage on the business as we move forward. And we're not in a state of normalcy right now. Obviously, with our comps being the 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. But what I would say, the spirit of the continued leverage you are seeing in our results. 
And that is the expectation we have of our business, whether we're seeing outsized costs from labor and outsized costs from freight and cost of goods, or whether that's in a more normal environment. And so we're holding ourselves accountable to executing in that way regardless of the environment that we're in. And just wanted to clarify that. I think Kurt's point around 3% comp and whether that's a point of leverage, is still accurate in a normal environment. But we still -- even in a kind of ""nonnormal environment"" still accept that same challenge."

The Tractor Supply team delivered strong results for the third quarter, with net sales up 15.8%, comparable store sales increase of 13.1% and diluted earnings per share of 20.4%.",1265,"Thank you, Mary Winn, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. The Tractor Supply team delivered strong results for the third quarter, with net sales up 15.8%, comparable store sales increase of 13.1% and diluted earnings per share of 20.4%. 
The team is doing an outstanding job navigating a very dynamic and challenging operating environment. We continue to benefit from many market trends that we see as very structurally sound. We have strength in our customer base. We're gaining market share across our categories. We continue to advance our Life Out Here strategy. Our business has never been stronger and we see tremendous opportunities for growth ahead of us.  
As we've consistently shared with you over the last 18 months, our strong results are a testament to our 45,000-plus team members. And I'd like to thank them for all their efforts in the quarter. They kept each other safe as we went through another COVID-19 wave and navigated through broad-based supply chain disruptions and cost of goods increases and navigated and managed through a tight labor market. Through it all, they've been resilient and persevered to deliver strong customer satisfaction scores, including all-time high GURA scores.
Our team members are our greatest strategic asset and a key competitive differentiator with our customers. Our loyal and highly engaged team members have helped us fare better than most as far as staffing across our stores and DCs. 
Back in June, we raised our minimum opening wage to $11.25 per hour. Our recent wage actions bring our average hourly wage rate at our stores to nearly $15 per hour as we exit the year, with our DC at a higher rate. The investments we have made in store labor are being recognized by our customers by the overall customer satisfaction scores that I just mentioned. 
I'd also like to say thank you to our vendors and supply chain partners as we work together to overcome challenges in the global supply chain network. And together, we've been very focused on controlling what we can control to deliver these results. Across our network, we've been nimble and been able to navigate the unprecedented supply chain environment and macro issues, including inflationary pressures. And the team has done a great job addressing issues, ranging from import container shortages and port delays, driver shortages, higher freight rates and a multitude of other supply chain constraints.  
To mitigate these challenges, the team has leveraged dedicated containerships, pop-up DCs, expansion of mixing centers and direct-to-store shipments. Despite these challenges, our inventory is in good shape, and our in-stock rates finished above last year at the end of the quarter. Our diversified vendor base, with only about 12% direct import, is a strong point of differentiation for us during these supply chain times.  
Given our scale and sophistication, we believe that our network is a competitive advantage to being the dependable supplier for the Out Here Lifestyle. Categories in which we participate and the Out Here Lifestyle that we serve continue to have elevated consumer spending levels well above pre-COVID levels. We fully anticipate that the environment we're in is going to continue for the foreseeable future. And consequently, we think that the sales growth that we've seen is structurally sound, given the changes in consumer behavior and the lifestyle investments that are now much more ingrained in the consumer psyche.  
These structural trends that continue to work in our favor include things like rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption, and a self-reliant lifestyle movement, including DIY trends and investments in hobbies like gardening, backyard poultry and, of course, pet ownership. For many workers, the return to office has been pushed out until next year. And even then, we'll very likely be in a hybrid environment as most employers. And at this point, our customers will have been ingrained for over 2 years. As such, we anticipate that their behaviors are much more sustainable and structural.   
To provide some color on our results, let me share a few other highlights of the third quarter. Like the second quarter, every week had positive comps. Also like the second quarter, our growth was broad-based across regions and product categories. Our e-commerce business continues to experience strong momentum with double-digit sales increases of over 40%. And in just under 1 year, our mobile app already has more than 2 million downloads and now represents over 10% of our e-commerce sales. 
We continue to gain share across all categories. This has been a consistent trend for multiple quarters now, and this share gain has been both online and in stores. The share gain has been aided by the increase in our unaided brand awareness, which has improved by 21 percentage points since November of 2019. This improvement, combined with positive trends in our overall customer satisfaction, are a significant contributor to the share gains we are experiencing.  
Also consistent from previous quarters, all customer segments were strong with notable strength in our core farm and ranch, which is the largest and most important of our customer base. At the same time, our digital ad campaign to target millennials is supporting the significant growth we are seeing in this important demographic. We think the relevancy of Tractor Supply to the millennial customers has staying power, given the structural changes in the market and our customer behaviors, and we're certainly seeing that consistently quarter after quarter in our data as our average age of customer trends down.  
For the year, more customers than ever have shopped at Tractor Supply. These customers are making more trips and are spending more money per trip. And our new customer retention remained very strong. Our Neighbor's Club loyalty program continues to exceed our expectations, with year-over-year sales growth of these members north of 20%. We exited the quarter with more than 22 million Neighbor's Club members. These members are spending more than about 3x the rate of nonmembers, with Neighbor's Club members now accounting for nearly 70% of our sales. This continues to be a step-up from where we've been running prior to the relaunch of the program and sequential improvement over the second quarter of this year. 
The number of high-value customers in the program grew almost 30% for the quarter, and we continue to experience retention rate in excess of 95% for our high-value customers. These strong results demonstrate that the changes to Neighbor's Club continued to gain traction with our customers.  
Given our robust performance through the third quarter, along with our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again raising our sales and earning guidance for 2021, and Kurt will share more details on our improved outlook later in the call. 
Regarding our pending acquisition of Orscheln Farm & Home, we continue to work cooperatively with the FTC as it continues to review the proposed transaction. We look forward to the benefits this transaction will offer customers with improved product offering and competitive pricing.  
As has been the case over the last 18 months, I'm incredibly proud of the way our entire Tractor Supply team has managed to stay focused on taking care of each other and our customers. Our long-term opportunities remain very exciting. Our goal has been to emerge from the pandemic stronger. Over the course of the last year, since rolling out our Life Out Here strategy, we have gotten stronger through this pandemic. And we believe that we're going to emerge from it even stronger and better positioned as we execute our strategy.  
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt."

Once again, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business and our strategic initiatives.

Once again, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business and our strategic initiatives. As Hal shared, we continue to believe the underlying health of our business is very strong.  
Third quarter comp store sales of 13.1%, representing a 39.9% 2-year stack, were driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 9.5% and transaction count increase of 3.6%. An example of the structural advantage we have is the ongoing strength in our consumable, usable and edible products. Our key products represent the strength of our core business and what drives trips to the store. Once again, CUE outperformed the chain average comp sales. And for the sixth consecutive quarter in a row, CUE had comp sales growth at or above 15%.  
Key subcategories such as poultry, livestock feed and dry dog food were among the strongest categories with broad-based strength. Our big ticket categories, which were going against significant growth in the prior year, continued to have solid comp store sales performance, in line with the chain average. This was driven by strength in trailers, recreational and utility vehicles, safes and zero turn mowers. 
Inflation contributed about 700 basis points to comparable store sales. As you've heard from the retail sector and others, the cost environment remains elevated across imports, domestic freight, commodities and labor wages. Our merchant team has been aggressively advocating for our customers. Where necessary, we are taking price increases to pass through some of the cost pressures that we cannot offset. 
Our merchant and supply chain teams are currently navigating this challenging and disruptive environment extremely well. As we closely monitor our customers' purchasing behaviors, we are focused on product unit trends and are committed to being priced right every day.  
Our third quarter gross margin rate was 36%, a decrease of 41 basis points versus last year. For comparison, our gross margin rate this quarter was still about 100 basis points above our Q3 2019 rate of 35%. Year-over-year, the gross margin drivers were principally 3 items: first, higher product cost inflation; second, elevated freight costs, inclusive of domestic and import costs; and third, a more normalized product mix shift in CUE. All of retail is working through the drivers of inflation and freight costs. The Tractor Supply team effectively offset a significant portion through our price management program.  
Additionally, we continue to see favorability in the frequency and depth of promotions. This is due to our commitment to our everyday low pricing strategy and a continued strong demand for our product categories. The benefit from vendor funding for the field activity support teams, or our FAST initiative, which was launched in the second half of last year was consistent with our guidance. 
Our third quarter SG&A expense ratio, including depreciation and amortization, improved by 58 basis points versus last year to 26.1%. This improvement as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to good leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in our comparable store sales, along with lower COVID-19 pandemic response costs and decreased incentive compensation. Partially offsetting this leverage were higher wage rates, incremental store labor hours to ensure we're providing great customer service and investments in our Life Out Here strategic initiatives.  
Given the elevated volumes and current operating environment, we also incurred select discrete costs such as incremental team member benefits, pop-up DCs and the timing of our annual sales meeting, which normally occurs in the first quarter. The offset to our FAST initiative benefiting gross margin was approximately 20 basis points of incremental SG&A expense for the labor cost for the team as we are now cycling the initial investment to launch the program last year.  
Much like our gross margin rate, our SG&A performance compares favorably to Q3 2019. We've had about 70 basis point favorable expense ratio since then. Operating profit increased about 18%, with operating profit margin of nearly 10% in the quarter. Diluted EPS was $1.95, an increase of 20.4% from the third quarter of last year.  
Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong. At the end of the quarter, our merchandise inventories were $2.2 billion, representing an 11.7% increase year-over-year in average inventory per store. The increase principally reflects growth to support the robust sales trends along with the impact of inflation.  
Moving now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021. We continue to operate in a time of heightened uncertainty regarding the pandemic. Despite this uncertainty, including product cost inflation and supply chain constraints, we are raising our full year outlook. Our updated guidance reflects the strong results for the first 3 quarters of the year and the positive and structural momentum we see in our business continuing into the fourth quarter. Against the backdrop of what we know today, we are forecasting fiscal 2021 net sales centered around $12.6 billion, with comparable store sales growth of about 16%.  
For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 10.2% to 10.3%, a step-up from our prior guidance. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $8.40 to $8.50. This compares to our previous earnings range of $7.70 to $8 per diluted share. Within this updated guidance, we are forecasting comparable store sales growth for the fourth quarter of 8% to 10%.  
Two modeling points to keep in mind. The prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm & Home is not included in our guidance. And as you start to roll forward your models for 2022, please keep in mind that next year will have a 53rd week for us. This week is typically a low-volume week of sales, given that it follows the Christmas holidays. We have a unique opportunity with the positive customer trends and momentum in the business. And with that, we are committed to investing in store and supply chain labor as we look to provide a legendary customer experience across all channels.  
The strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a position of strength for Tractor Supply. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2021, we remain on track for anticipated share repurchases in a range of $750 million to $800 million. This year will mark a milestone, with approximately $1 billion returned to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends.  
In summary, our results proved yet again Tractor Supply's unique competitive advantages. Our relentless focus on being the dependable supplier for the Out Here Lifestyle is embedded in our purpose as a company. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Hal."

Now I'd like to share with you an update on our recent ESG announcement as well as provide updates on our Fusion and Side Lot strategic initiatives, which are key parts of our Life Out Here strategy.  At a time of urgency and action on cli",1025,"Thanks, Kurt. Now I'd like to share with you an update on our recent ESG announcement as well as provide updates on our Fusion and Side Lot strategic initiatives, which are key parts of our Life Out Here strategy.  
At a time of urgency and action on climate change and social justice, we just announced new goals that are the next step in our long-standing commitment to sustainability, stewardship and opportunity. By 2040, we are committing to achieve net zero carbon emissions across all our operations. As part of our social commitments, we are prioritizing accelerating our initiatives and actions for diversity, equity and inclusion. At Tractor Supply, we are focused on cultivating an environment of inclusion, where diversity of all kinds is appreciated and valued. I invite you to learn more on our dedicated ESG website.  
Turning next to our Life Out Here strategy. As a reminder, we've been executing against 5 key strategic initiatives this year as part of our overall strategy. And those initiatives are Neighbor's Club, Digital, FAST, Fusion and Side Lot. The strategy and these initiatives are designed to capitalize on the attractive opportunity that we see in our nearly $110 billion total addressable market. 
Our Project Fusion and Side Lot model transformations represent significant investments in our stores. These store-level investments are designed to grow our market share and drive the productivity of both existing and new stores as part of our Life Out Here strategy.  
So let's start with our Project Fusion store remodel program. As a quick reminder, Project Fusion is our state-of-the-art space productivity program, designed to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base and give customers that may not have shopped with us in the past more reasons to shop. We anticipate having about 15% of our total store base in the new Fusion layout by year-end. We've reduced the time to complete Fusion remodels by 50% since the beginning of the year and, in turn, allowing us to minimize the disruption to the store operations and our customers' shopping experience.
Our customers are taking note of the improved layout, the ease of shopping and our new product offerings. Specifically, in our customer intercept surveys, they call out better organization, improved merchandise selection, cleaner and brighter aisle and easier to navigate layout. Categories seeing the strongest lift in sales include areas like apparel, companion animal and power tools. Given the size of our store base, this is a multiyear opportunity to continually refresh our store base and further drive comp sales through productivity. 
Another significant component of our space productivity efforts is the transformation of our Side Lot. Again, as a reminder, typically, there's as much space outside of our stores in the Side Lot as we have on the inside of our store. And the productivity of this space is substantially below the chain average. We're in the midst of a multiyear project to transform our Side Lot with an expanded product offering and an enhanced shopping experience. With this investment, the Side Lot space is leveraged to offer a wider product offering in the lawn and garden categories, and our new categories with the garden center and offer greater convenience through the expansion of our buy online, pick up in store capabilities or drive-through pickup.  
In select locations that meet sales volume thresholds, we're also adding a feed room to help deliver the bag feed demand. And as a reminder, we're the largest seller of bag feed in the country. We also continue to see a positive halo effect from the garden center to the existing store and vice versa. The addition of product categories increased ease of shopping and new services, provides us with even more ways to continue to keep our existing customers engage with Tractor Supply and attract new customers also to the brand.  
Our ability to drive higher sales per square foot through the transformation of our Side Lot space remains a significant opportunity. We anticipate having about 150 Side Lots complete across the chain as we exit 2021. In these early remodels, we're learning a great deal about our customers' appetite for an expanded lawn and garden assortment. And we're even more excited than we were when we embarked on the initial test pilot late last year. 
As with our Fusion remodels, we continue to reduce the project timeline also here by about 50% and minimizing the disruption to our customers and store teams as we implement our findings from our test and learn process. While still early on, we are very positive about the continued refinement and learning.  
While implementing construction projects of this scope and scale has been very challenging in the current macro environment, we're making progress in our ability to significantly reduce construction costs, the construction time and the corresponding disruption at the store site. While the majority of the remodels have been completed more recently, we are very pleased with the early read on sales lift. 
Post the disruption period, we're seeing lifts of low single digits for Fusion remodels and mid-single digits for combo stores, which have both Fusion and Side Lot remodels. We expect continued improvements in these results as the stores normalize and are forecasting year 1 lift of mid-single digits for Fusion and high single digits for combo stores, which is on track for the expectations we had as we began these projects.  
Over the course of the last year, the team has done a great job operating the business at elevated levels, navigating unprecedented challenges and also executing our transformational initiatives to support our Life Out Here strategy. And to wrap up, our results clearly underscore that our strategies are working, that the team is navigating the challenges effectively and that we're emerging from the pandemic stronger than before. We're extremely optimistic about our future.

Yes, on gross margins, we're very pleased both with our short-term results, kind of the past quarter on gross margin, and also very optimistic about the long-term nature of our gross margins. On the short term, we've had significant amount of cost coming through our business, whether that's in cost of goods as it relates to raw materials, commodity-based goods, also vendors passing along costs related to labor and freight. We've also seen freight cost increase as well as well as the costs related to imports. The team has done an excellent job navigating those costs, finding offsets, productivity measures really being the advocate for the customer to keep prices as low as possible. 
That said, as Kurt mentioned, we did have inflation to the tune of 7% in the quarter, which helped us offset a lot of those costs and deliver the gross margin results that we did in the quarter, which sequentially, from a gap to last year, improved from Q2. 
Long term, as we talked about on several of our calls, the question is really around the promotional intensity and the clearance intensity -- clearance ad intensity in the business. And those 2 remain at the same levels as they have over the last 6 quarters, very low. We remain very focused on everyday low price, we remain very focused on delivering value every single day to our customers. And we see it playing out that way for the foreseeable future. We have no plans for significant promotional intensity in Q4 and we think that we'll remain in a very supply-constrained environment as we move into the first half of next year. And that, too, will continue to limit any sort of promotional intensity in the market. 
And a couple of years in now, with minimal promotional intensity, I think that bodes well for being able to maintain kind of a low promotional kind of structure going forward. And so as I said, again, we're very pleased with our short-term gross margin results and also very optimistic about the structural nature of our long-term gross margin."

Absolute -- to your point, acknowledge that absent the write-down on Petsense that we did a 10.1% op profit in 2020 and our guidance for 2021 here at 10.2% to 10.3%, that both of those exceed our long-term targets. We certainly don't want to get ahead of ourselves here in the third quarter. What we've commented on is that we're in the midst of our annual planning for 2022. It's -- at the same time, we're also just always looking at our long-term targets. And it's very natural for us to be reviewing that over the next few months. 
And so when we have more news on that, we'll certainly let folks know. But again, I think we're in a period where there's a significant amount of opportunity ahead and we're very pleased with the results we put up this quarter, the outlook we have for the balance of the year and also excited about the long-term opportunity that we still see out there in our $110 billion market as we're gaining significant share in it.

Second thing I'll talk about is the consistency of our business. And the third I'll talk about is share gain. In the broad macro trends, all the trends that we saw in Q2 of last year really have all sustained themselves. And I think there are certain retailers and other businesses that had -- that saw the benefit as it relates to kind of COVID behavior early to mid last year, and that wanes. 
And I think that's not been the case for us. Whether it's things like rural revitalization, which is a bit more of a permanent in -- as people move, and whether it's things like pet ownership and adoption, again, permanent and more so in nature. Whether it's home setting and just kind of the self-reliance mentality. We're seeing those as more permanent behaviors. And really no matter what data set you look at, whether it's home purchases, whether it's mobility, whether it's pet ownership, any sort of qualitative data on where people are spending their money, they all reinforce the structural nature of those trends. 
The second thing I'd point to is the consistency. As I mentioned, our business has been remarkably consistent month-to-month, week-to-week, by category and by region. And that's been regardless of whether or not we've been in COVID surges or whether or not certain states have been more locked down or less in lockdown. And that I think just, again, speaks to the structural orientation.
And lastly, we're gaining significant share, really in almost evert category in our business. And we're seeing that share gain in our customers who have shut us. And as they come to us now with the confidence that we're in stock, with the right level of customer service and at the right price. 
And then also, new customers who are finding the lifestyle that we serve to be kind of what they're seeking in this time. And we're gaining share really across the board on all of our categories in that context. So I'd point to those 3 things that give us real confidence in the structural orientation of our business. And as I said, I think it -- there's a set of COVID winners that were early on and have seen some of that wane. And then there's another set that are seeing it much more structural and sustained, and I very much put us at the top of that second camp."

Thanks for joining the call. When we look ahead over the next couple of months, just a little bit more broadly, other than just outside of the energy cost as well, we're really excited about the opportunity that lies ahead based off all the macro benefits that Hal just discussed. And I'd love to just highlight a couple of things that we'd love to see to drive our business over this holiday season and to maximize and capitalize on that opportunity. 
When we think about that, we are really excited about how the team and the merchandising team continues to execute on our portfolio strategy, leveraging the fact team. We are doing a record number of resets throughout the year, not just, call it, pre-holiday, but continuing in that reset and the new item activity as we go through the quarter.
And for holiday, specifically, over the next couple of months, we're really excited about the momentum we're seeing in some of these new customer trends as well as our core customers that are coming to us for categories more broadly than maybe they have in the past, things like apparel and footwear. And we're seeing expansions like in key brands that consumers are really resonating with, with brands like Columbia and Harriet, Carhartt, even our own brand like Ridgecut, where we're expanding into the women's lineup, where that shopper is now coming to us where they weren't in the past, where we can continue to drive market share in those categories. 
We're also seeing that with that rural revitalization, consumers come to us for outdoor activities even here in the fall. So things like patio heaters, grills, even like wildlife and UTV is driving that demand. We're still seeing strength across the board there. And then we're going to continue to focus on our CUE activity, where customers are coming to us for footsteps. So with a record number of pet adoptions over the last few years, we continue to be extremely excited about the momentum that we have in our pet business holistically, as well as the CUE business, and we're going to be looking to drive that throughout the whole holiday season. 
So I know it's a little bit broader than just kind of the energy market question here as well, but also where we see it as we're coming through, we're seeing activity across our consumer base be very consistent with what we've seen over the last few quarters, and they're really resonating with the new items, the new categories as well as the new partnerships that we're continuing to establish."

In regards to how we handle that, it really is more of a portfolio approach. We take a look at where those costs are contributing, both in transportation and product costs, and we look at our portfolio. Seth and the merchant team manages the shopping patterns for -- from the customers as well as making sure that in key traffic driving areas, we've got great everyday low pricing.

And to your point, right now, we're seeing really strong momentum in the business.

We think that there's significant further opportunity as we look out to continue to grow in an outsized way and take share. And we're committed to going after that share and continuing to grow. 
As -- that said, we'd acknowledge 2 straight years of performance above 10% op margin, that's above our long-term guidance. And as we go through our 2022 annual planning process, we'll be -- that will help us really think through our long-term guidance and the relevance of that as we look forward. But right now, it is our long-term guidance. 
What I would say is as it relates to investments, we're very bullish on our investments. We're very focused on excellent capital allocation. We're seeing the results of our investments in the business. As we shared today, the Fusion stores and the Side Lot stores are performing very well. As they mature and begin to normalize, we're seeing the results right in line with what our expected -- our kind of business model and business plan for them were.

And I think as we see how that continues to evolve into early next year, you can expect to hear more from us on that. But again, we remain very bullish on our opportunity. Very pleased with our business. It's never been stronger and we're excited about both the short-term and long-term potential inside of it."

Orscheln is not considered in any of the numbers or the guidance that we've given. In regards to the depreciation of the expense structure, so COVID expenses have been elevated from the level that we entered the year into, just because the pandemic with the Delta variant and others have lingered, they're at lower levels than we saw in comparable quarters last year, but we continue to emphasize having a safe and clean environment for our customers and our team members. 
The incentive comp, with the outperformance this year, while at lower levels than last year, continue to be above target. And so as you think about going forward, those are items for us as in future years, those are leverage points. And if -- like in this year, while there's incentive comp above target, the performance gives leverage above and beyond the level that we're paying an incentive comp. So it's net and overall leverage this year. And next year, those will be favorable items to compare against. 
The depreciation expense, as I mentioned earlier, the growth rate that were -- that I quoted and referring to, is very much in line with what we expected in our long-range plan when we launched the Life Out Here strategy and talked about a 3- to 5-year plan. And so with the elevated sales, I mean, we feel very comfortable with a 20% growth rate in depreciation because that's where those investments are at, does not include Orscheln, and again, we're very comfortable with the management we've got and what we have visibility on our expenses for the fourth quarter and even the near term beyond that."

The add that I'd make to that is just as is typical with a store remodel, there's a little bit of disruption. There's disruption that happens during the remodel. Particularly with the current supply chain environment, there's a little disruption that's occurring still even after the remodel of some kind of fixtures and other types of things come in, sometimes a little late. That -- and then we start to see the lift happen as customers get used to shopping the new layout and find the new categories and the new brands and the new -- kind of the new remodel. 
And so what we're seeing is kind of what we would expect, which is kind of every week, every month that goes by, post kind of the rebrand opening of the remodel, that the performance of the store continues to improve. And that's the case with both combo stores and the Fusion remodels. 
The adder that I would make to that is as it relates to the Side Lot with the garden center, we have a couple of stores that are -- that went through kind of year 2 of spring. We saw kind of outsized gains in those, which is in line, again, with our expectation that we would see more of a maturity curve with the garden center than we would with the inside of the store Fusion remodel. 
We think that what we expect and what we're seeing in the Fusion remodel is more of an immediate impact with kind of the maturity curve being more of a 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-month maturity curve, whereas with the garden center, we're seeing a nice, strong immediate impact. But then we're also seeing kind of 12, 18 months kind of continuation of that maturity curve. 
But yes, the results are very much in line, nice positive lift already even a few months into each of the remodels. And then we see even continued lift as we complete kind of year 1 of those remodels, whether it's Fusion or the combo."

On the Side Lot, the 3 things I'll talk about is the Garden center, I'll talk about BOPIS, and then I'll talk ab",870,"Chuck, thanks for joining the call today. I'll hit kind of 3 things on Side Lot, and then I'll just briefly touch base on Fusion productivity. On the Side Lot, the 3 things I'll talk about is the Garden center, I'll talk about BOPIS, and then I'll talk about our feed rooms. 
So first, on the garden center. Our customers' key data set is that the category that we least address from a destination perspective, that they most engage in is live goods and garden. And so that's really what the garden center strategy is all about, it's creating another CUE destination category in our business. And -- but we're seeing that in our results. I'd say we're more excited now about the prospects for kind of adding to our fleet in garden center than we were even this time last year. 
And just kind of tactically, the behavior we're seeing our customers is exactly what you'd expect. It's a little less around beautification, like what you might see in a more of a home improvement store in terms of the core product, and much more about fruits and vegetables and shrubs and trees, all those sorts of things that really speak to Life Out Here, whether it's the gardening you do in your backyard or whether it's the shrubs and the trees you're planning along your fence line and in your land. And we have significant convenient kind of advantages for our customers from a location perspective. So the garden centers are performing very well, and we're just getting started, both on the build-out of those, obviously, but also with our relationships with our live goods vendors and the assortments tailoring it by store. 
The second thing is on BOPIS drive-thru. We are seeing incredibly high levels of drive-through behavior from our customers. And we're seeing, in some of our stores that have been open for 4, 5, 6, 8 months now, we're seeing 50%, 60%, 75% of the buy online, pick-up in store being drive-through. And just that extra convenience factor you're seeing with customers, and then that's driving repeat behavior. And so really pleased with how that's evolving and the behavior we're seeing from our customers is consistent with what the feature was when we rolled it out. 
And then lastly is the feed room. So we are the largest seller of bag feed in the country. And if you think about our average store volumes and the growth we've seen in those store volumes, combined with the outsized performance in CUE, that's put a lot of stress on our stores as it relates to the receipt of bag goods, getting it out onto the store, staying in stock for our customers and then being able to kind of get that on to customers' trucks and out the -- towards -- get them on their way. And the feed rooms have provided valuable capacity and also allowed us to effectively, from a cost perspective, serve that customer because we're not touching the bags 2 and 3, 4x. We're able to leverage our mixing centers in a way that they're designed now. 
And so all 3 of those things are really coming together. We're seeing excellent performance across all 3, exactly as we designed them and built them. And we're continuing to use our test and learn to tweak it along the way. 
And as you think about our productivity as we move forward, we're still committed to our comps kind of outpacing overall retail and outpacing the Life Out Here market that we define as that $110 billion market. And so you can expect continued productivity improvements on our same-store sales in an outsized way as we move forward. Even in spite of 6 consecutive quarters now with double-digit comps, we still have that expectation moving forward. 
One other thing I just -- while I've got the mic here, so to speak, I'd like to just step back and reference. It's a bit about kind of our long-term kind of op margin leverage, as Kurt was talking about. What I'd say is if you look at our long-term guidance, because there are several questions on this topic, we -- and our long-term guidance that we announced last year had 6% to 7% sales growth and 8% to 10% earnings per diluted share, which implies continued leverage on the business as we move forward. And we're not in a state of normalcy right now, obviously, with our comps being the 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. But what I would say, the spirit of the continued leverage, you are seeing in our results. 
And that is the expectation we have of our business, whether we're seeing outsized costs from labor and outsized costs from freight and cost of goods, or whether that's in a more normal environment. And so we're holding ourselves accountable to executing in that way regardless of the environment that we're in. And just wanted to clarify that. I think Kurt's point around 3% comp and whether that's a point of leverage is still accurate in a normal environment. But we still -- even in a kind of ""non-normal environment"" still accept that same challenge."
