Happy New Year to all of you, and I hope this moment finds you all in good health. 
With that, let's go ahead and get started on Slide 3. There are a lot of words to describe 2020, most of which wouldn't be nice to say in public. But when I look at how we executed on our priorities in the midst of this pandemic, I keep coming back to one word, and that's resilient. 
We added 1.5 million postpaid phones during the year, our most net adds in a decade and our highest-value subscribers. We reduced churn, streamlined operations and have the nation's fastest wireless network. 
For the second year in a row, we added more than 1 million fiber subscribers as customers move to our higher-speed services. And perhaps most remarkable during this pandemic, we launched HBO Max. And about 7 months later, we had more than 41 million HBO Max and HBO domestic subscribers, 2 years ahead of the plan we shared with you in October of 2019. 
Our resilient portfolio of subscription businesses continued to generate strong cash flows, more than $27 billion, to support our ability to invest in our growth areas and sustain the dividend. In fact, we finished the year with our total dividend payout ratio at a very comfortable level. And on debt management, we made material progress in 2020 by reducing debt maturities over the next 5 years by about 50% and lowering our weighted average interest rate on debt to about 4%. 
We continue to transform the business to drive efficiencies. Our cost-cutting initiatives generated about $2 billion in savings in 2020, dollars we invested back into the business to drive subscriber growth and move our transformation initiatives forward. 
In mobility, we streamlined distribution, shifted some stores to third-party dealers and closed others. Total calls into our call centers are down by 30 million as we saw a dramatic shift to online transactions by our customer base. We retired more than 30 products in our portfolio and consolidated operations to capitalize on reduced complexity. 
We took our first steps and reduced our real estate footprint by more than 9 million square feet with more work underway in our longer-term operating model. We also realigned and streamlined our WarnerMedia operations to better deliver on HBO Max and the future of how consumers want to view content. 
Those are a few of our 2020 highlights. Let's talk about our 2021 priorities on Slide 4. We have 3 priorities this year. Number one is straightforward: grow our direct customer relationships. That begins with the vital connectivity services we provide and the strength of our network. We've had the overall fastest wireless network in the nation every quarter for the last 2 years according to Ookla and the fastest nationwide 5G network in the second half of 2020 after our nationwide 5G launch. It shows the strength of our low-band spectrum portfolio. 
Our fiber Net Promoter Scores continue to be materially better than cables and are helping drive strong subscriber trends and higher penetration rates. There is strong demand for the reliability and speeds our fiber product provides. 
Beyond our core connectivity services, we're focused on our goal to establish relationships with most U.S. households, and HBO Max is the key here. Through our software-based entertainment platforms, we can learn more about our customers and create long-lasting emotional connections with our award-winning storytelling capabilities. 
Our second priority is the same as last year, and that's continuing to transform our operations to be more effective and efficient. We're restructuring businesses, sunsetting legacy networks, reducing corporate staffing levels and overall benefit costs. As a result, we're positioned to enter the post-pandemic world as a more agile and efficient company. 
Our third priority is about continuing to be deliberate and strategic with how we allocate capital. We plan to use free cash flow after dividends for the next couple of years to pay down debt. We remain focused on monetizing noncore assets and using those funds for debt reduction as well. We're committed to sustaining our dividend at current levels, and we'll give top priority to debt reduction at this time. 
In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made the last 2 quarters. Despite COVID-19 challenges, we're seeing growth where we want to see growth, and we're successfully redirecting our investments to support those areas. We have more work to do, but I'm confident we're on the right path. 
Before I hand it over to John, I want to acknowledge that I'm sensitive to the reality that there's much going on in and around the business. I know inside AT&T, we're working hard to reposition the company. So I can imagine you're working equally hard to keep up with us. To that end, I want to let you know we plan to host a virtual investor event in the second half of the quarter, where our leadership team will provide more insight into our business plans. And we'll have a lot of time for discussion and your questions. Look for more to come on that soon. 
With that, I'll turn it over to John to discuss the more detailed results from the quarter. John?"
100231,692776409,2182073,"AT&T Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our fourth quarter subscriber metrics. Wireless subscriber growth was the best it's been in years.

Let me start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our fourth quarter subscriber metrics. Wireless subscriber growth was the best it's been in years. We had 1.2 million postpaid net adds, including 800,000 postpaid phones. Postpaid phone churn was the second lowest quarter on record, coming in at 0.76%. 
Our fiber momentum also continues. We added more than 270,000 fiber subscribers in the quarter. HBO Max subscriber growth continues to outpace original estimates. We added nearly 7 million total subscribers for HBO Max and HBO in 2020 alone. The trend of premium video declines continues to improve. If you exclude the impact of Keep America Connected on third quarter net adds, our premium video net adds improved sequentially for the fifth quarter in a row. 
Let's now look at our consolidated and segment results, starting with our financial summary on Slide 7. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.75. That included COVID impacts to revenues from lower television licensing and production, changes to the theatrical release slate and lower international roaming. Combined, COVID had an estimated $0.08 of EPS impact to fourth quarter, which we did include in our adjusted results. 
We've made the decision to operate our broadband and legacy voice operations separate from our video business unit and have recast our Entertainment Group results accordingly. In conjunction with this change in operations, we have reassessed the book values of our video assets, including goodwill and other long-lived assets. As a result, we recorded a pretax noncash impairment of $15.5 billion. 
Additionally, we adjusted for an actuary loss to our benefit plans and a write-off of production and other content inventory at WarnerMedia, stemming from the continued shutdown of theaters and film releases going on HBO Max. We'll provide more information in our SEC filings and on our website and in our annual report. 
Revenues were down from a year ago, with gains in mobility partially offsetting pressure from WarnerMedia and video, but revenues were up sequentially. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of about $200 million in revenue primarily in our Latin America segment. 
Cash flows for the quarter and the year underscore our resilient customer base and liquidity. Cash from operations came in at $10.1 billion for the quarter and $43.1 billion for the year. Free cash flow was $7.7 billion for the quarter and $27.5 billion for 2020. 
For the full year, our total dividend payout ratio was just under 55%. Gross capital investment was about $20 billion in 2020, and we continue to invest heavily in our growth areas even during a pandemic. In addition, we invested about $800 million in HBO Max in the fourth quarter and about $2.1 billion for the full year. 
Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communications segment on Slide 8. Our Communications business showed revenue growth this quarter, thanks to a strong performance in mobility. We told you we intended to give our best customers our best prices and offers, and you are seeing the benefits of that logic. Strong subscriber gains and people moving to unlimited plans help drive service revenue growth in the quarter, even with continuing pressure in international roaming. More than 60% of our postpaid phone base is on an unlimited plan. 
Churn has been impressive. The last 2 quarters have been our lowest postpaid phone churn quarters on record. And for the full year, a remarkable 16 basis point improvement in postpaid phone churn. Our successful retention approach does require some upfront investment, but the lower churn levels and improved subscriber count make this the right economic trade. 
As I mentioned, we have split the Entertainment Group into 2 reporting units, broadband and video. And a full reconciliation of the 2 units is in our support documents. But for comparative purposes, here are the trends in Entertainment Group the way you have been used to seeing them. 
We had our best AT&T Fiber fourth quarter net adds even with more challenges associated with the pandemic, and penetration continues to grow. It's now at 34%. In our video unit, premium video losses were improved year-over-year, thanks to lower churn and our focus on high-value customers. 
We continue to drive ARPU growth in both video and IP broadband. In fact, premium video ARPU was up more than 5%. Our business wireline team continues to effectively manage the transition of the business and deliver solid results amidst the pandemic. Solid cost management is the key to delivering solid EBITDA all year long. 
Let's move to WarnerMedia and Latin America results, which are on Slide 9. WarnerMedia continues to be impacted by the pandemic as we've seen across that entire industry. We did see solid gains in subscription revenues, thanks to the rapid growth of HBO Max. We now have 41 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers and about 61 million worldwide as we prepare for the international launch of HBO Max later this year. And we now have more than 10 million customers who combined one or more of our connectivity products with HBO Max or HBO. 
Advertising revenues also grew driven by political advertising and CNN, which was #1 in all of cable viewership, not just news in the fourth quarter. Because of the pandemic, we introduced a unique 1-year plan in which Warner Bros. will continue to exhibit films theatrically worldwide while adding an exclusive 1-month access period on HBO Max, simultaneous with the film's domestic release. 
Our goal is to make the best of a very challenging situation for all involved. That includes filmmakers and talent, theater owners and most importantly, the moviegoing public. 
Our Latin American operations continue to work to recover from the pandemic. We added more than 500,000 subscribers in Mexico and almost 50,000 subscribers in Vrio, helped in part by our over-the-top offering in Brazil. 
Latin America revenues continue to be challenged by FX, slow economies and COVID. Even with this, Mexico EBITDA improved year-over-year for the second quarter in a row, and Vrio continues to generate positive EBITDA and cash flow on a constant currency basis. 
Now let's go to Slide 11 for our 2021 guidance. Last year was a difficult year for us to forecast for obvious reasons. There remain uncertainties in 2021 with the rate and pace of recovery from the pandemic around the globe, impacting media, travel and employment. Against that backdrop, our current outlook for 2021 is as follows. 
We expect consolidated revenue growth of about 1% with wireless service revenue growth of 2% and a gradual improvement in WarnerMedia's top line. As noted previously, we plan to reinvest all our savings from our transformation efforts to support our customer count momentum in our growth businesses. Combined with ongoing declines in our premium video segment, this could lead to adjusted EBITDA declining slightly in 2021 versus this year. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be stable with 2020. We expect gross capital investment in the $21 billion range and net CapEx of about $18 billion. The primary difference between the 2 is from vendor financing initiatives we have in place and anticipated FirstNet reimbursements. 
Free cash flow has been resilient for us even during the pandemic, and we expect that resiliency to continue in 2021 with a $26 billion range target for free cash flow. We'll also continue to focus on bringing down debt. As John mentioned, we expect to use free cash flow dollars after dividends to pay down debt. We continue to look for opportunities to monetize assets and apply those proceeds to paying down debt, including Crunchyroll, which we expect to close later this year. 
We do plan to provide an update on our leverage outlook and longer-term debt ratio target once the auction quiet period ends. As 2020 showed us, things can change quickly. However, we are encouraged by our ability to adapt to those changes while driving increased customer counts, generating strong cash flows, investing in areas of strategic focus, all while maintaining a disciplined approach to our capital allocation and shareholder return strategies. 
As John mentioned, we plan to have a virtual analyst event later in the quarter to talk about this more. Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for Q&A."

On the macro side, the one thing we saw at the end of last year was customers' willingness to pay. Our bad debts were really quite solid, quite positive trends, both on the consumer and the corporate side. So while we're not getting overly excited, it was a positive sense. 
What we have built into our plans are, if you will, more of the kind of current environment for the next 6 months with some second half and really close to the fourth quarter pickup in pandemic relief activities. So we'll see more theatergoing probably in the fourth quarter than we did this year. We'll see some more travel, but in no way did we envision a hockey stick or any kind of dramatic increase. It's really much more of a general staying the course. There is some slight improvement but staying the course. 
Secondly, with -- the one thing I'd add though is the cash collections have been strong and have been resilient, feel really good about that. So that gives us some comfort. 
Secondly, with regard to the CapEx, I'd say it this way. As you look at the kind of the gross capital being put in the ground, it's up $1 billion. There will be some changes in what we spent last year, i.e., I continue to expect the -- a little bit lighter on the video satellite-type side of the business because of the success of AT&T TV and our focus on churn reduction as opposed to gross heads. There'll be some more money there. 
I think you'll see us -- we've continued to spend money on wireless, but we're well into and well completed with the FirstNet build. So we'll have some ability to manage there. 
The next piece though is we will see an increase in the fiber build and the opportunity to add some more sales opportunities to that inventory. I don't know, John, did I miss anything from your perspective?"

That's kind of what we've got the team tasked to do to give you a sense of what that increase will be. 
And I think the only other thing I would comment on relative to the wireless spend overall, the shift that's occurring, we put a tremendous amount of capacity out over the last several years in combination with a lot of the work we spoke to you about with FirstNet upgrades. And there's a kind of a shift in mix going on within the wireless building. 
We're now moving away from what I would call capacity that's on existing spectrum bands and starting to see ourselves prefer possibly using other spectrum that may come into service at some point in time, et cetera. So we got a little bit of a dynamic going on in the shift that's in the overall wireless program."

And the teams are already out turning things up. 
We had the conversation last quarter. I don't want to repeat myself, but we shared with you that this build is a little bit different than when we initially started because we have wire centers that are already fiber-capable. The infrastructure is in place. We're going back in and picking up the next adjacent neighborhood or the next successive area. And as a result of that, the speed to get up and moving is not the lift that it was the first time we started ramping up on this. So we've got a little bit smoother dynamic around it than what you might think because of the increase in the fiber dynamic."

Quite frankly, it's really the efforts we've had to increase our sales capabilities, add new customers, the amounts that we built out in the prior years. It also has to do with the recognition that we are providing HBO Max for all of our gig customers, and so there's an intercompany charge there. It's within the umbrella of AT&T and the economics are there, so we feel good about it. But that's also in there. 
I would tell you, as you all know, the network infrastructure customer service like fiber is a long-term game, and we've gone through the process many times, feel very good about the long-term returns and the efforts. But yes, we're going to be spending some money as we did last year to invest in that customer growth. 
You saw the 600,000 plus, 650,000 or so net adds last 6 months. And we feel very good about that particularly when we look at the churn numbers, particularly when we look at the customer satisfaction, the NPS scores. So completely or completely support the fact. But yes, there is some investment there. 
With regard to the AVOD, we are expecting to launch our international version of the HBO Max later this year as well as the AVOD. I'm not ready to give any dates. John, I don't know if you want to say anything more."

And I think I would point out equally as important as the Latin America launch of HBO Max that we've been working really hard on and be an important driver for us on future growth and getting ourselves embedded into the international front on a unified platform and approach to things. So you should expect, as we get into the second quarter, there's going to be a lot of activity and change going on here. 
One of the reasons we're kind of trying to pinpoint the exact date on it is, as you know, we've been working through pandemic-related production issues. And ramping that back up has been a pretty significant path. The team has done a remarkable job getting ourselves back into that business and working through the dynamics safely. 
It puts a little bit of overhead on things in terms of speed of production and what we're able to do. And there's a bit of rework that goes on with trying to work around the limitations of a pandemic-based environment. As a result of that, we're still fighting through getting the pipeline dropping the content at the right rate and pace that we wanted to. And the first quarter this year continues to be a bit of a stretch in that regard as we cycled back into production. 
Our expectations are that we start to hit our stride as we get into the second quarter, and it's really important as we put these new iterations to the product, we know that we have ourselves in a good position in terms of the content inventory. And so as we're kind of going hand-to-mouth on these right now, John, we'll be a little bit more discrete on when we announce what's coming out and exactly what month simply because it's just that tough and that much of a battle literally show by show to get this stuff done and get it into the funnel, and we're working hard to do that. 
And we hope we're past any of the unexpected dynamics like the California closures that went on over the last several weeks that put a couple of twists and turns in the road, and we've got the worst behind us. But I'm a little chased right now with everything on the pandemic. So I don't want to overpromise anything."

We've done some really good stuff and had some really good progress on self-funding a lot of what we've been doing in the market. But we're not self-funding all of it yet. 
And so our continued work on trying to manage the efficiency and effectiveness of this business so that we can be in a more aggressive posture in the market is something that this team is working on every quarter. And we've tried to be diligent and reasonable in our guidance to you and make sure that we have high confidence in what we share. 
But what I'm turning back to the management team is a task that I'd say is more aggressive. And to the extent that this management team delivers, and they have been doing a remarkable job of doing that over the last several quarters. Does that mean that, that's going to give us more room to do more in the market and continue to maintain a posture that I think is totally appropriate, bringing in high-value customers, the right kind of customers we want, going down the swim lanes that we set up for ourselves that we think we have a unique place to be, which is winning in the public sector with our FirstNet abilities, using our deep enterprise customer relationships to go deeper into the customer base with affinity programs, ensuring that we're getting the mass market with attractive offers like HBO Max and what's associated with that, that is -- it brought in a really attractive gross add pool and trading our embedded base well, that is the strategy. And we're going to continue to do that. 
I think you're seeing it to be the industry leader insuring this quarter, I think we called it right. We said that we don't have customers that are upset about our network. They like it. We don't have customers that are upset about our service. They're satisfied with our service. 
We had customers who are interested in finding new devices. We shared with you that we had a little bit more agent population on device longevity than the rest of the industry. We've been targeting how we do that. I think getting the new 30-year lease on life, the 30-month lease on life with these customers, I wish it was 30 years, it's in a very appropriate exchange for the franchise right now given everything we have in front of us."

First and foremost, what we've said and we'll continue to say is free cash flow in excess of dividends is going to go to pay down debt. Proceeds from the sale of assets is going to pay down debt. 
The reality of it is we would prefer to be able to give you more information about a leverage target. We can't do that at this time because of the status of the C-band auction and our inability to comment on. That's all we're trying to tell you is that we understand that we would normally give it to you, that would be appropriate. But because the FCC rules, we can't. So we will commit that we will update it when it's possible. That's the story. 
I think the one thing that I'd repeat, though, is $27.5 billion last year, $26 billion, we're guiding for next year, $15 billion dividend, lot of money they're used to pay down debt. That's what -- the message we want to give you, and the proceeds from things like Crunchyroll going to use to pay down debt. 
So we feel good about what we've done over the last 3 years with regard to managing the debt, and we feel really good about our ability going forward. But the comment about leverage is just -- it's appropriate for us to give to, we can't because of the rules around the C-band auction."

And so that compare is going to be compared to, if you will, 2.5 months of international roaming. So that will be one set. 
The next 3 quarters will presumably be without the international roaming. So the numbers will be different. That's one. And I'd just say that to you. So I don't want to get into quarterly analysis because I just don't want to confuse things we talked about the full year. 
Secondly, the real story on the service revenue is customer growth. And quite frankly, we talk about the 1.2 million of postpaid net adds, the 1.5 million of -- 1.2 million postpaid net adds last quarter, 1.5 million of voice net adds mostly in the last 6 months, all of that. 
But the reality is, too, we have close to 16 million total wireless connection net adds during the quarter -- during the year when you include all connections. And we're seeing -- and we believe that our strategies, the ones John just talked about with treating our best customers with the best offers and things like that have the opportunity to win for us the best network and so forth. And so we're optimistic about the ability to continue to grow that customer base. That's what's driving the service revenues. 
With regard to the ARPU growth, the continued opportunities go into the upscaling of these packages with a great opportunity to offer HBO Max, which has certainly got tailwinds behind it and the success of it. You saw the 7 million HBO adds, best we've had in not only 10 years, but the best in the total 10 years, better than the total last 10 years. That is going to -- we believe that, that kind of packaging with wireless is going to help and such that we're going to be able to grow it and then grow the ARPU from getting people to buy up just from the mobile share plans and to unlimited, but the buy up for the basic unlimited all the way up to the elite. 
That's the story. We're not giving specific percentages, dollars, but that's what builds that confidence in wireless service revenue growth, which really drives the overall growth of the company's 1% guidance on revenue growth. That and some tailwinds from the comeback of WarnerMedia."

And then the second conversation, we've just finished the first month of the HBO Max experience with Wonder Woman commensurate with the theatrical release. And this is obviously going to happen like 11 more times over the course of 2021 as you kind of do the day date thing with the movie slate. If we multiply what happened with Wonder Woman times 11 over the course of 2021, what does that look like for Warner Bros. from a revenue and profit standpoint relative to what maybe 2019 would have looked like in a more normal year?"

Obviously, what I'll say on that is we assume that we're running the business as we portrayed it to you. And we have been debating how we wanted to set up our operations for video for some time. And I think part of this, when we step back and think about why we made this change is we figure we're at a life cycle change in these products, that getting management teams focused in this way will be the best way to maximize value in the discrete product lines. 
And so in the video case, we've seen a pretty dramatic change in what's occurring in the market. And there's a variety of things driving it. You all know about the declines in the pay TV life cycle. But we also have the dynamic that's starting to occur, which I think is a really important one to understand where we're starting to see pay TV disconnect a little bit from broadband as virtual MVPDs start up. Our own product itself, in many respects, has a virtual characteristic to it. And it's a fairly mature offering. 
And so getting the management team really focused on what to do in the latter stages of the life cycle of a mature product and ensuring that we manage it effectively, I think, is a wise thing to do for that product on a stand-alone basis. And that's one driver behind why we made that decision. 
The second driver behind why we made this decision is I believe we're at the front end of a dynamic of customers wanting to ensure that they have connectivity and broadband access no matter where they go, and they want a simpler model around that. And I think about our business being in a very unique position for both businesses and consumers to deliver on that promise. And the innovation that's going to be necessary from a product perspective,and then pairing that with what are the new complementary products and services that customers might want to bundle or use with that connectivity, I think, is a new play, and that's a new growth for us. 
And to get them another part of the management team really focused on that aspect of our business is how we simplify unified connectivity for our customer base, whether a consumer or business, whether fixed or mobile, starting to think about what those virtual-type add-ons are to that product that come with a very different delivery mechanism than what we've historically seen when we've been bundling what I would call these high overhead, premise intensive visit-type services that we've traditionally had in the bundle and play into that is the strength and position for growth is the second part of why we want the management team set up the way we have it right now and focused on that going forward. 
And that just makes sense for how we're operating the business because of the time and place and where we are. And we are absolutely comfortable that that's the right call for how to operate our business moving forward. And I will tell you, I'm not going to speculate on anything structural or M&A-oriented. We never do, and I'm not going to now. But I believe that what we're doing here is if the goal is to always run an asset for maximum value creation, this is the right strategy to run the asset for maximum value creation. John?"

So I think where we are is that there's a difference between what I'll call a tentpole release and a nontentpole release. And Wonder Woman and the nature of that production value and what occurs is different than the balance of many of the other movies in our slate. We have other tentpole releases that occur throughout the 2021 release schedule. They are going to be equally as buzzworthy as Wonder Woman. 
And we have in between those other high-quality offerings that fill that in that cater to maybe sometimes a less broad audience. And that's the power of doing what we did in bringing the entire slate out to our end user base. So we're going to see a little bit of spikiness in what occurs. And I don't think it's fair to say if we're going to put, call it, 17, 18, whatever, movies we ultimately settle on in the release structure for the year, we're not going to see the kind of subscriber spikes that maybe we saw in December and early January every time we put a movie out, but that really isn't the design intent of the plan. 
We have -- but we do have an opportunity to build marketing and promotion opportunities around those bigger releases that have broader buzz and broader application across the customer base. And we're going to take every advantage of doing that. And we're going to work filling in the niche between it. 
This -- I think I want to stress, this is a unique year, and we did this as a unique year. And probably appropriate to make a comment that in some cases, I'll say maybe the dynamic of the media and the press was a little oversold or a little intense on both ends of the spectrum around this from my point of view. 
We told you when the team decided to make this move that we thought it was appropriate for this moment in time. And the team made the call, and I think it was a bold and aggressive swing. It was done with a lot of thought as to what needed to occur in the subscriber base and the balance of the value of the franchises between our theatrical and our streaming business. 
It was certainly nice to have a streaming business to present us this option of how we use this content. But part of that call was just built on the dynamic of what we thought the theatrical moviegoing audiences were going to look like in 2021. And since we articulated that, I would say the data points have come in that have been very consistent with the set of assumptions that we had at the front end of that. 
I mean just the last several weeks, you've seen other studios continuing to snowplow releases, moving them out of the first half of the year, moving them into the second half of the year, which further cements our point of view that we're going to see a very crowded theatrical field as we get into late 2021 and early 2022. And we don't believe that magically just because there's more content showing up in theaters all at the same time that, that's going to dramatically increase the size of the moviegoing population at that time. 
And so as we indicated by making the write-off, we felt like we had a little bit of a spoiling asset here that needed to be moved -- used more effectively. And this was the right economic call that balances across both sides. And we think using it to balance out long-lived subscribers that build out a scaled platform that allow us to have options on our distribution and using this unfortunate set of circumstances around the pandemic for an opportunity, make lemonade out of lemons, was the right call in this case. 
And I think we all have to understand, we step back and think about the theatrical business. I mean nobody went to theaters in 2020 for the most part. It was a pandemic. Just like nobody got on airplanes, and nobody went to hotels, and nobody goes to restaurants. And all of those businesses had a little bit of dislocation because of that, and the theatrical business have a little bit of dislocation. And I applaud the team for the move they made and trying to make the best of this circumstance for our circumstance around having a really strong theatrical slate that can help our streaming product. 
Could we have maybe done some things a little bit differently and how we got through the front end of it? Any time you're first in something, there's no map. You're a trailblazer. There's nothing perfect for you to read. And I think that there's -- there were some things on the margin that maybe we do a little bit differently. But at the end of the day, it's going to get down to making sure people are fairly compensated and treated well. And I think we know how to do that. I think we've been good to the theater owners in the perspective that the exhibitors now have a planned and routine set of releases coming to them at a time when they really, as we've talked about, have other studios, snowplowing. 
I think in the end, this will ultimately shape up to be a good thing across the board as we get through the emotional aspects that are bound to be there in a high anxiety environment like the pandemic. And all things having been said with what we've seen in the front end of the numbers, what our experience has been, we are delivering on this in a way that we expected. It's pretty consistent with the value shifts that we expected and feel pretty good about where we are in the early innings of this. So John, why don't you go ahead and..."

More importantly, for everybody on the call, I think at the Analyst Day, we'll get the team. Jason and his team will get the opportunity to talk to you about some of the further plans and go through that. 
Dave, your other question, I think, was with regard to the planning process. The guidance we've given here today, but for the exclusion of any commentary on C-band is what we have as assets in our portfolio as of January 1 and owning them for the full year other than Crunchyroll, other than the already held for sale termination of Crunchyroll. 
And so yes, there is free cash flow in here from the video business. I won't give you a specific number on that, Dave. But you can assume based on the results of the business last year, it's probably going to be a lower number inclusive next year than it is this year for the changes in customer base and so forth. 
But it is a business as usual, what I would call kind of business planning approach. All that being said, feel really good about the free cash flow position. And particularly, as I mentioned in an earlier question, cash came in strong at the end of the year with regard to the fourth quarter, with regard to customer activity, both on the corporate business side as well as the consumer side. And you guys can see it in our bad debts, which are remarkably low. 
Team did a really great job of weeding out fraud and weeding out -- and focusing on the best customers, and it's showing up in our numbers. So I think -- hopefully, that answers your question, David. Thanks for the earlier comment about my retirement. It will be a change, but it will be interesting."

It's obviously encouraging to see that you're going to be picking up the pace of the build-out this year. But even after building out 2 million additional homes passed, that would still be a small subset of the number of customer locations in your total wireline footprint. How do you think about what portion of that footprint, which I think has 60 million households in it, is potentially attractive in terms of being a great demo and having economics to reach them that generate a compelling return for you? In other words, for how long can you keep adding 2 million homes a year to your footprint? 
And am I even asking this question correctly because as you build out your 5G footprint, which is really a national 5G network using layers of spectrum across multiple bands, it would seem like wireless will increasingly be a viable technology for reaching households beyond your traditional footprint. How do you think about the fixed wireless opportunity? And maybe how do you just think about the ability to be a provider of high-speed residential broadband across the country?"

If I think",1007,"So Brett, the -- I'm going to sound like a broken record, but it's really important on these long-lived investments that we be pretty consistent internally, so that the management team can get to a consistent level of execution year-over-year. If I think about what has traditionally happened in outside plant access technology upgrades, I've been through a series of them over my career. And I don't think this one is going to be a whole lot different. 
There's always the first 1/3 of the customer base that's kind of the low-hanging fruit slam dunk that is the part of the customer base that you cut your teeth on, get your processes squared away on, get the vendor community up the first part of the cost curve. And it's like the no-brainer economically, and you kind of make your decision that, that's where you're going to start. And I would say we went through that largely through that first 1/3 in the investment we've made over the last several years. 
Then what happens is as you get your -- up the learning curve, and the vendors start to scale and you start to get confidence in your economics and your business processes start to improve, and you start to see the marginal economics improve on the subscriber, which is what you're going to start to see happen on some of those broadband numbers on the fiber base that we've broken out for you as we move forward here over time, the next 1/3 becomes the opportunity. And we're into that -- the middle innings of the game, if you want. It's the next 30% to 60% of the customer base that we can work our way through, and you look at the economics around it, that makes sense. 
Then you get into that last 1/3, and it's always the hardest part. And I think in many instances, you're still sitting with the last 1/3 that in parts of the rural America that still really don't have effective broadband options. And oftentimes, it's policy. Sometimes it's a technology breakthrough that gets that last 1/3. 
And I would tell you right now, if you wanted me to prognosticate, are you going to build fiber to that last 1/3? I don't think I'd want to prognosticate that, that's a place that we're likely to go in the near term. Absent some kind of major subsidy construct that comes into place, I actually believe, candidly, even if there was subsidy put in, it would be a better use of taxpayer money to do something that was more hybrid-oriented than the technologies that are applied and not exclusively lean on fiber in that space. 
But we're several innings out from that actually coming to pass, and we'll have time to work through it. Right now working in the middle innings of the game, and the next 30% of the customer base is where our focus is at. And as I shared with you on the previous call, it's 2 million this year. The team executes well, we can do more than 2 million and start to ramp that up. 
And when we demonstrate to the investor base, we're getting the kind of returns that you all like and you should cheer us on to do that and be very supportive of us moving down that path. And it's my intent to characterize that and show that to you. 
In terms of how I think about the wireless and fixed base, I've got maybe a little different view on this, and I'll maybe step back and think about it from a macro level. If you go back and you look at consumption that's occurred and customer bases, whether it be wireless-centric, data use or fixed-centric data use, they've all been growing. And they grow at a pretty consistent level. 
And if you go and you talk to experts around consumer behavior over the next 10 years and you look at what's going on inside the household of, for example, just one major trend of people moving away from what used to be broadcast or multicast streams efficiently delivered to unicast streams, discrete streams to one device. And you just look at what's happening in consumer behavior over that, there is a substantial amount of video traffic to be moved to unicast. It's going to drive a massive amount of consumption. 
And this ratio between mobile and fixed consumption has been about 10:1 for many years. This is not new. And I got to -- I believe that, that ratio, it may not be perfectly 10:1, but there's still going to be a pretty consistent gap between mobile and fixed consumption. In other words, there's still a lot of traffic to be moved, given consumer shifts and how they're using products and services. 
And so as I sit back and think about things, I think about hybrid access technologies has been important. But I don't know that the most ideal way to build a network is going to be to use fixed wireless to take on the bulk of what occurs in the 4 walls of a business or a home, given the consumer behavior trends we're going to see over the next 10 years. And I think still having a very dense and rich fiber infrastructure is going to be necessary to be an effective network provider over time. 
It doesn't mean there won't be some segments of the population. And my son, who lives on his own in an apartment in a metro urban area that might actually be an individual that could work on an all wireless portion of his life in his 20s when he's independent and single and in a single-dwelling unit household, and maybe that's a little bit different surrogate arrangement that has a wireless tail on it or is a robust wireless LAN inside of a managed dwelling unit. But I still think reach and penetration of fiber is going to be important as we move forward."

We have fiber to the neighborhood in many, many locations, and taking fiber-to-the-home is the second step. We haven't done that yet. So if you think about our VDSL, if you think about our new greenfield builds, if you think about the neighborhood next to the VDSL, there was next to where we've got fiber the prem, those are the opportunities. And that VDSL footprint is 35 million. And when you add the fiber to it, it's greater than that. That will give you kind of a framework for something that we could efficiently do just what John said about building out the 2 million this year. That's where a lot of the focus is going to be. 
So I think of that as the way to think about the opportunity for us. And yes, we have that ability. We need to continue the sales momentum. That's going to be really critically important to make it work. But in line with that, that's, I think, a focus of easy capability for us."

Look, I think it's inevitable that we're now back into the wood-saw approach of a new administration. And a new belief that despite 4 years of not a single data point to suggest that we have a problem to solve, nobody blocking anybody, nobody throttling anybody, nobody bought, doing anything inappropriate in terms of use of service and disclosing how they're offering services to customers, we're going to go through another regulatory bloodletting over this. I expect it to happen, and we're going to watch the cycle repeat itself. 
And one would hope at some point that there's a recent discussion around a policy that gets us away from this web sign and allows everybody to kind of have a more consistent and stable approach. I don't know that, that's going to happen, but we're certainly going to try and push and discuss it. 
Where I think the third rail is on this issue is the dynamic around what happens to the freedom of people who invest in competitive markets to price their products and services appropriately. And if we stay away from that third rail, if the kind of latitude is in there to be able to price and do the right things in the market where competitive markets exist, then I think everything will probably, at the end of the day, be okay. 
But if for some reason, policy goes down a path of that isn't the case, it hasn't in the past even when Title II is in place, we have the latitude to do what I felt like we needed to do. But if, for some reason, policy went further to try to solve a problem that doesn't exist, I have to step back and ask ourselves how we're allocating capital around that and evaluate where that comes out and ask if it's the right place for us to go for our shareholders based on that dynamic and that very important lever for us being taken away. 
So variable, I'd say, in the market, not lever. So that's how I think about it right now. I actually step back and from a policy perspective, ironically, think about what's happened over the course of the last year or 2 and the dynamics that are going on right now where the issue is looking at metering and monitoring speech and what's occurring for people's access to platforms, that -- there are more real and significant data points and how that's affecting society than anything to do with how Internet service providers are delivering bandwidth in the homes. But I'll leave it to smarter people to meet and figure that one out."

And I think about that broadly is, while today, we talk about it as an SVOD evolving to an AVOD offer. I've mentioned this before, I view it as a really important foundation for broader customer relationships. I mean this is the first big foray of maybe legacy AT&T thinking about having broader relationships with the customer base at a relatively low price point SKU that isn't exclusively dependent on infrastructure. 
And to the extent we are successful at having that relationship with most U.S. households, if we don't use that as an opportunity as a springboard for us to start thinking about how we extend those customer relationships across other opportunities either to own and operate content or engagement with a customer or to use the platform as a means for others to distribute, we'd be losing a huge opportunity. And so I think well, there's all kinds of things we want to do around the edge and making sure that we work with the right hyperscalers to virtualize and give our customers the opportunity to gain access into infrastructure so that they can run their compute environments and their application environments effectively. That's all important, and that's all meat-and-potato stuff we need to do on a network. 
But I think about owning some degree of engagement with the customer, a relationship, a means to build with them, having them interact with your service so that you have insights as to who they are, what they like, what they do, what their proclivities are, being able to emotionally attach with them, having a software platform that allows you to build the next building block of a product that extends into engagement, that talks about dynamics of changing consumption in social and interactive, I think this is a really important dynamic for the health of our business. And I know it's longer term in nature. And I'm well aware of the folks who have maybe a tighter orientation to financial return question, why would you be pushing as hard as you are in this area? It's because I feel pretty strongly about that. 
And I think building large subscription basis of customers that pay us every month for something has been kind of the hallmark of this business. We have a really attractive dynamic in that in our overall revenues and profitability today. We need to evolve that into what the next step is, and this is just one of those steps in making that happen."

Happy New Year to all of you, and I hope this moment finds you all in good health.
With that, let's go ahead and get started on Slide 3. There are a lot of words to describe 2020, most of which wouldn't be nice to say in public. But when I look at how we executed on our priorities in the midst of this pandemic, I keep coming back to one word, and that's resilient.
We added 1.5 million postpaid phones during the year, our most net adds in a decade and our highest-value subscribers. We reduced churn, streamlined operations and have the nation's fastest wireless network.
For the second year in a row, we added more than 1 million fiber subscribers as customers move to our higher-speed services. And perhaps most remarkable during this pandemic, we launched HBO Max. And about 7 months later, we had more than 41 million HBO Max and HBO domestic subscribers, 2 years ahead of the plan we shared with you in October of 2019.
Our resilient portfolio of subscription businesses continued to generate strong cash flows, more than $27 billion, to support our ability to invest in our growth areas and sustain the dividend. In fact, we finished the year with our total dividend payout ratio at a very comfortable level. And on debt management, we made material progress in 2020 by reducing debt maturities over the next 5 years by about 50% and lowering our weighted average interest rate on debt to about 4%.
We continue to transform the business to drive efficiencies. Our cost-cutting initiatives generated about $2 billion in savings in 2020, dollars we invested back into the business to drive subscriber growth and move our transformation initiatives forward.
In mobility, we streamlined distribution, shifted some stores to third-party dealers and closed others. Total calls into our call centers are down by 30 million as we saw a dramatic shift to online transactions by our customer base. We retired more than 30 products in our portfolio and consolidated operations to capitalize on reduced complexity.
We took our first steps and reduced our real estate footprint by more than 9 million square feet with more work underway in our longer-term operating model. We also realigned and streamlined our WarnerMedia operations to better deliver on HBO Max and the future of how consumers want to view content.
Those are a few of our 2020 highlights. Let's talk about our 2021 priorities on Slide 4. We have 3 priorities this year. Number one is straightforward: grow our direct customer relationships. That begins with the vital connectivity services we provide and the strength of our network. We've had the overall fastest wireless network in the nation every quarter for the last 2 years according to Ookla and the fastest nationwide 5G network in the second half of 2020 after our nationwide 5G launch. It shows the strength of our low-band spectrum portfolio.
Our fiber Net Promoter Scores continue to be materially better than cables and are helping drive strong subscriber trends and higher penetration rates. There is strong demand for the reliability and speeds our fiber product provides.
Beyond our core connectivity services, we're focused on our goal to establish relationships with most U.S. households, and HBO Max is the key here. Through our software-based entertainment platforms, we can learn more about our customers and create long-lasting emotional connections with our award-winning storytelling capabilities.
Our second priority is the same as last year, and that's continuing to transform our operations to be more effective and efficient. We're restructuring businesses, sunsetting legacy networks, reducing corporate staffing levels and overall benefit costs. As a result, we're positioned to enter the post-pandemic world as a more agile and efficient company.
Our third priority is about continuing to be deliberate and strategic with how we allocate capital. We plan to use free cash flow after dividends for the next couple of years to pay down debt. We remain focused on monetizing noncore assets and using those funds for debt reduction as well. We're committed to sustaining our dividend at current levels, and we'll give top priority to debt reduction at this time.
In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made the last 2 quarters. Despite COVID-19 challenges, we're seeing growth where we want to see growth, and we're successfully redirecting our investments to support those areas. We have more work to do, but I'm confident we're on the right path.
Before I hand it over to John, I want to acknowledge that I'm sensitive to the reality that there's much going on in and around the business. I know inside AT&T, we're working hard to reposition the company. So I can imagine you're working equally hard to keep up with us. To that end, I want to let you know we plan to host a virtual investor event in the second half of the quarter, where our leadership team will provide more insight into our business plans, and we'll have a lot of time for discussion and your questions. Look for more to come on that soon.
With that, I'll turn it over to John to discuss the more detailed results from the quarter. John?"

Let me start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our fourth quarter subscriber metrics. Wireless subscriber growth was the best it's been in years.

Let me start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our fourth quarter subscriber metrics. Wireless subscriber growth was the best it's been in years. We had 1.2 million postpaid net adds, including 800,000 postpaid phones. Postpaid phone churn was the second lowest quarter on record, coming in at 0.76%.
Our fiber momentum also continues. We added more than 270,000 fiber subscribers in the quarter. HBO Max subscriber growth continues to outpace original estimates. We added nearly 7 million total subscribers for HBO Max and HBO in 2020 alone. The trend of premium video declines continues to improve. If you exclude the impact of Keep America Connected on third quarter net adds, our premium video net adds improved sequentially for the fifth quarter in a row.
Let's now look at our consolidated and segment results, starting with our financial summary on Slide 7. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.75. That included COVID impacts to revenues from lower television licensing and production, changes to the theatrical release slate and lower international roaming. Combined, COVID had an estimated $0.08 of EPS impact to fourth quarter, which we did include in our adjusted results.
We've made the decision to operate our broadband and legacy voice operations separate from our video business unit and have recast our Entertainment Group results accordingly. In conjunction with this change in operations, we have reassessed the book values of our video assets, including goodwill and other long-lived assets. As a result, we recorded a pretax noncash impairment of $15.5 billion.
Additionally, we adjusted for an actuarial loss to our benefit plans and a write-off of production and other content inventory at WarnerMedia, stemming from the continued shutdown of theaters and film releases going on HBO Max. We'll provide more information in our SEC filings and on our website and in our annual report.
Revenues were down from a year ago, with gains in mobility partially offsetting pressure from WarnerMedia and video, but revenues were up sequentially. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of about $200 million in revenue primarily in our Latin America segment.
Cash flows for the quarter and the year underscore our resilient customer base and liquidity. Cash from operations came in at $10.1 billion for the quarter and $43.1 billion for the year. Free cash flow was $7.7 billion for the quarter and $27.5 billion for 2020.
For the full year, our total dividend payout ratio was just under 55%. Gross capital investment was about $20 billion in 2020, and we continue to invest heavily in our growth areas even during a pandemic. In addition, we invested about $800 million in HBO Max in the fourth quarter and about $2.1 billion for the full year.
Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communications segment on Slide 8. Our Communications business showed revenue growth this quarter, thanks to a strong performance in mobility. We told you we intended to give our best customers our best prices and offers, and you are seeing the benefits of that logic. Strong subscriber gains and people moving to unlimited plans help drive service revenue growth in the quarter, even with continuing pressure in international roaming. More than 60% of our postpaid phone base is on an unlimited plan. 
Churn has been impressive. The last 2 quarters have been our lowest postpaid phone churn quarters on record. And for the full year, a remarkable 16 basis point improvement in postpaid phone churn. Our successful retention approach does require some upfront investment, but the lower churn levels and improved subscriber counts make this the right economic trade. 
As I mentioned, we have split the Entertainment Group into 2 reporting units, broadband and video, and a full reconciliation of the 2 units is in our support documents. But for comparative purposes, here are the trends in Entertainment Group the way you have been used to seeing them. We had our best AT&T Fiber fourth quarter net adds, even with more challenges associated with the pandemic. And penetration continues to grow. It's now at 34%. In our video unit, premium video losses were improved year-over-year, thanks to lower churn and our focus on high-value customers. We continue to drive ARPU growth in both video and IP broadband. In fact, premium video ARPU was up more than 5%. 
Our business wireline team continues to effectively manage the transition of the business and deliver solid results amidst the pandemic. Solid cost management is the key to delivering solid EBITDA all year long. 
Let's move to WarnerMedia and Latin America results, which are on Slide 9. WarnerMedia continues to be impacted by the pandemic as we've seen across that entire industry. We did see solid gains in subscription revenues, thanks to the rapid growth of HBO Max. We now have 41 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers and about 61 million worldwide as we prepare for the international launch of HBO Max later this year. And we now have more than 10 million customers who combine 1 or more of our connectivity products with HBO Max or HBO.
Advertising revenues also grew, driven by political advertising and CNN, which was #1 in all of cable viewership, not just news in the fourth quarter. Because of the pandemic, we introduced a unique 1-year plan in which Warner Bros. will continue to exhibit films theatrically worldwide while adding an exclusive 1-month access period on HBO Max, simultaneous with the film's domestic release. Our goal is to make the best of a very challenging situation for all involved. That includes filmmakers and talent, theater owners and most importantly, the moviegoing public.
Our Latin American operations continue to work to recover from the pandemic. We added more than 500,000 subscribers in Mexico and almost 50,000 subscribers in Vrio, helped in part by our over-the-top offering in Brazil. Latin America revenues continue to be challenged by FX, slow economies and COVID. Even with this, Mexico EBITDA improved year-over-year for the second quarter in a row, and Vrio continues to generate positive EBITDA and cash flow on a constant currency basis. 
Now let's go to Slide 11 for our 2021 guidance. Last year was a difficult year for us to forecast for obvious reasons. There remain uncertainties in 2021 with the rate and pace of recovery from the pandemic around the globe impacting media, travel and employment. 
Against that backdrop, our current outlook for 2021 is as follows. We expect consolidated revenue growth of about 1% with wireless service revenue growth of 2% and a gradual improvement in WarnerMedia's top line. As noted previously, we plan to reinvest all our savings from our transformation efforts to support our customer count momentum in our growth businesses. Combined with ongoing declines in our premium video segment, this could lead to adjusted EBITDA declining slightly in 2021 versus this year. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be stable with 2020. We expect gross capital investment in the $21 billion range and net CapEx of about $18 billion. The primary difference between the 2 is from vendor financing initiatives we have in place and anticipated FirstNet reimbursements.  
Free cash flow has been resilient for us even during the pandemic, and we expect that resiliency to continue in 2021 with a $26 billion range target for free cash flow. 
We'll also continue to focus on bringing down debt. As John mentioned, we expect to use free cash flow dollars after dividends to pay down debt. We continue to look for opportunities to monetize assets and apply those proceeds to paying down debt, including Crunchyroll, which we expect to close later this year. We do plan to provide an update on our leverage outlook and longer-term debt ratio target once the auction quiet period ends.
As 2020 showed us, things can change quickly. However, we are encouraged by our ability to adapt to those changes while driving increased customer counts, generating strong cash flows, investing in areas of strategic focus, all while maintaining a disciplined approach to our capital allocation and shareholder return strategies. As John mentioned, we plan to have a virtual analyst event later in the quarter to talk about this more. 
Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for Q&A."

Any comments just about trends with what CIOs are seeing, et cetera, that underscores that?
And then within the CapEx budget, are there any material changes within your priorities there, for example, your fiber build-out? I know that's a big priority. Is there an opportunity to ramp that up or additional spend on 5G rollout? Any color there would be great."

On the macro side, the one thing we saw at the end of last year was the customers' willingness to pay. Our bad debts were really quite solid, quite positive trends, both on the consumer and the corporate side. So while we're not getting overly excited, it was a positive sense.
What we have built into our plans are, if you will, more of the kind of current environment for the next 6 months with some second half and really close to the fourth quarter pickup in pandemic relief activities. So we'll see more theatergoing probably in the fourth quarter than we did this year. We'll see some more travel, but in no way did we envision a hockey stick or any kind of dramatic increase. It's really much more of a general staying the course. There is some slight improvement but staying the course. 
Secondly, with -- the one thing I'd add though is the cash collections have been strong and have been resilient, feel really good about that. So that gives us some comfort.
Secondly, with regard to the CapEx, I'd say it this way. As you look at the kind of the gross capital being put in the ground, it's up $1 billion. There will be some changes in what we spent last year, i.e., I continue to expect the -- a little bit lighter on the video satellite-type side of the business because of the success of AT&T TV and our focus on churn reduction as opposed to gross heads. So there'll be some more money there.
I think you'll see us -- we've continued to spend money on wireless, but we're well into and well completed with the FirstNet build. So we'll have some ability to manage there.
The next piece though is we will see an increase in the fiber build and the opportunity to add some more sales opportunities to that inventory. I don't know, John, did I miss anything from your perspective?"

And I think the only other thing I would comment on relative to the wireless spend overall, the shift that's occurring, we put a tremendous amount of capacity out over the last several years in combination with a lot of the work we spoke to you about with the FirstNet upgrades. And there's a kind of a shift in mix going on within the wireless building.
We're now moving away from what I would call capacity that's on existing spectrum bands and starting to see ourselves prepped for possibly using other spectrum that may come into service at some point in time, et cetera. So we got a little bit of a dynamic going on in the shift that's in the overall wireless program."

And the teams are already out turning things up. 
We had the conversation last quarter. I don't want to repeat myself, but we shared with you that this build is a little bit different than when we initially started because we have wire centers that are already fiber-capable. The infrastructure is in place. We're going back in and picking up the next adjacent neighborhood or the next successive area. And as a result of that, the speed to get up and moving is not the lift that it was the first time we started ramping up on this. So we've got a little bit smoother dynamic around it than what you might think because of the increase in the fiber dynamic."

It's within the umbrella of AT&T, and the economics are there, so we feel good about it. But that's also in there.  
I would tell you, as you all know, the network infrastructure customer service like fiber is a long-term game, and we've gone through the process many times, feel very good about the long-term returns and the efforts. But yes, we're going to be spending some money as we did last year, to invest in that customer growth.  
You saw the 600,000 plus, 650,000-or-so net adds last 6 months. And we feel very good about that particularly when we look at the churn numbers, particularly when we look at the customer satisfaction, the NPS scores so completely or complete support the fact. But yes, there is some investment there. 
With regard to the AVOD, we are expecting to launch our international version of the HBO Max later this year as well as the AVOD. I'm not ready to give any dates. John, I don't know if you want to say anything more specific."

And I think I would point out equally as important is the Latin America launch of HBO Max that we've been working really hard on and will be an important driver for us on future growth and getting ourselves embedded into the international front on a unified platform and approach to things. So you should expect, as we get into the second quarter, there's going to be a lot of activity and change going on here.
One of the reasons we're kind of trying to pinpoint the exact date on it is, as you know, we've been working through pandemic-related production issues. And ramping that back up has been a pretty significant path. The team has done a remarkable job getting ourselves back into that business and working through the dynamics safely.
It puts a little bit of overhead on things in terms of speed of production and what we're able to do. And there's a bit of rework that goes on with trying to work around the limitations of a pandemic-based environment. As a result of that, we're still fighting through getting the pipeline, dropping the content at the right rate and pace that we wanted to. And the first quarter this year continues to be a bit of a stretch in that regard as we cycle back into production. 
Our expectations are that we start to hit our stride as we get into the second quarter, and it's really important as we put these new iterations of the product now that we have ourselves in a good position in terms of the content inventory. And so as we're kind of going hand-to-mouth on these right now, John, we'll be a little bit more discrete on when we announce what's coming out in exactly what month simply because it's just that tough and that much of a battle, literally show by show, to get this stuff done and get it into the funnel, and we're working hard to do that.  
And we hope we're past any of the unexpected dynamics, like the California closures that went on over the last several weeks that put a couple of twists and turns in the road, and we've got the worst behind us. But yes, I'm a little chased right now with everything on the pandemic. So I don't want to overpromise anything."

We're going to look at our promotion strategies and adjust them accordingly and determine what we need to do to continue to be in a position to maintain and grow share. And it's -- I think it's really important that we continue to have a growing business.  
There's -- the management team is focused on 2 things. We like the momentum. I think we'd like to be a little bit more efficient with the momentum. We've done some really good stuff and had some really good progress on self-funding a lot of what we've been doing in the market. But we're not self-funding all of it yet. 
And so our continued work on trying to manage the efficiency and effectiveness of this business so that we can be in a more aggressive posture in the market is something that this team is working on every quarter. And we've tried to be diligent and reasonable in our guidance to you and make sure that we have high confidence in what we share.
But what I'm turning back to the management team is a task that I'd say is more aggressive. And to the extent that this management team delivers, and they have been doing a remarkable job of doing that over the last several quarters, does that mean that, that's going to give us more room to do more in the market and continue to maintain a posture that I think is totally appropriate? Bringing in high-value customers, the right kind of customers we want. Going down the swim lanes that we set up for ourselves that we think we have a unique place to be, which is winning in the public sector with our FirstNet abilities, using our deep enterprise customer relationships to go deeper into the customer base with affinity programs, ensuring that we're getting the mass market with attractive offers like HBO Max and what's associated with that, that is -- it brought in a really attractive gross add pool and treating our embedded base well, that is the strategy. And we're going to continue to do that.  
I think you're seeing it, to be the industry leader in churn this quarter, I think we called it right. We said that we don't have customers that are upset about our network. They like it. We don't have customers that are upset about our service. They're satisfied with our service.
We have customers who are interested in finding new devices. We shared with you that we had a little bit more aging population on device longevity than the rest of the industry. We've been targeting how we do that. I think getting the new 30-year lease on life -- the 30-month lease on life with these customers -- I wish it was 30 years, it's in a very appropriate exchange for the franchise right now given everything we have in front of us."

We can't do that at this time because of the status of the C-band auction and our inability to comment on. That's all we're trying to tell you is that we understand that we would normally give that to you, that it would be appropriate. But because of the FCC rules, we can't. So we will commit that we will update it when it's past then. That's the story.

And so that compare is going to be compared to, if you will, 2.5 months of international roaming. So that will be one set. 
The next 3 quarters will presumably be without the international roaming. So the numbers will be different. That's one, and I'd just say that to you. So I don't want to get into quarterly analysis. Because I just don't want to confuse things, we talk about the full year. 
Secondly, the real story on the service revenue is customer growth. And quite frankly, we talk about the 1.2 million of postpaid net adds, the 1.5 million of -- 1.2 million postpaid net adds last quarter, the 1.5 million of voice net adds mostly in the last 6 months, all of that. 
But the reality is, too, we have close to 16 million total wireless connection net adds during the quarter -- during the year when you include all connections. And we're seeing -- and we believe that our strategies, the ones John just talked about with treating our best customers with the best offers and things like that have the opportunity to win for us the best network and so forth. And so we're optimistic about the ability to continue to grow that customer base. That's what's driving the service revenues.
With regard to the ARPU growth, the continued opportunities go into the upscaling of these packages with a great opportunity to offer HBO Max, which has certainly got tailwinds behind it and the success of it. You saw the 7 million HBO adds, best we've had in not only 10 years, but the best in the total 10 years, better than the total last 10 years. That is going to -- we believe that, that kind of packaging with wireless is going to help and such that we're going to be able to grow it and then grow the ARPU from getting people to buy up not just from the mobile share plans into unlimited, but to buy up for the basic unlimited all the way up to the Elite. 
That's the story. We're not giving specific percentages, dollars, but that's what builds that confidence in wireless service revenue growth, which really drives the overall growth of the company's 1% guidance on revenue growth, that and some tailwinds from the comeback of WarnerMedia."

And we have been debatin",603,"So let me try to deal with the front end of that, David, and then John can give you a little bit of context on the cash flow. Obviously, what I'll say on that is we assume that we're running the business as we portrayed it to you. And we have been debating how we wanted to set up our operations for video for some time. And I think part of this, when we step back and think about why we made this change is we figure we're at a life cycle change in these products, that getting management teams focused in this way will be the best way to maximize value in the discrete product lines.
And so in the video case, we've seen a pretty dramatic change in what's occurring in the market. And there's a variety of things driving it. You all know about the declines in the pay TV life cycle. But we also have the dynamic that's starting to occur, which I think is a really important one to understand where we're starting to see pay TV disconnect a little bit from broadband as virtual MVPDs start up. Our own product itself, in many respects, has a virtual characteristic to it, and it's a fairly mature offering. 
And so getting the management team really focused on what to do in the latter stages of the life cycle of a mature product and ensuring that we manage it effectively, I think, is a wise thing to do for that product on a stand-alone basis. And that's one driver behind why we made that decision.
The second driver behind why we made this decision is I believe we're at the front end of a dynamic of customers wanting to ensure that they have connectivity and broadband access no matter where they go, and they want a simpler model around that. And I think about our business being in a very unique position for both businesses and consumers to deliver on that promise, and the innovation that's going to be necessary from a product perspective. And then pairing that with what are the new complementary products and services that customers might want to bundle or use with that connectivity I think is a new play, and that's a new growth for us.
And to get another part of the management team really focused on that aspect of our business is how we simplify unified connectivity for our customer base, whether a consumer or a business, whether fixed or mobile, starting to think about what those virtual-type add-ons are to that product that come with a very different delivery mechanism than what we've historically seen when we've been bundling what I would call these high overhead, premise-intensive visit-type services that we've traditionally had in the bundle. And playing to that is the strength and position for growth is the second part of why we want the management team set up the way we have it right now and focused on that going forward.
And that just makes sense for how we're operating the business because of the time and place and where we are. And we are absolutely comfortable that that's the right call for how to operate our business moving forward. And I will tell you, I'm not going to speculate on anything structural or M&A-oriented. We never do, and I'm not going to now. But I believe that what we're doing here is if the goal is to always run an asset for maximum value creation, this is the right strategy to run the asset for maximum value creation. John?"

So I think where we are is that there's a difference between a -- what I'll call a tentpole release and a nontentpole release. And Wonder Woman and the nature of that production value and what occurs in it is different than the balance of many of the other movies in our slate. We have other tentpole releases that occur throughout the 2021 release schedule. They are going to be equally as buzzworthy as Wonder Woman. And we have in between those other high-quality offerings that fill that in, that cater to maybe sometimes a less broad audience. And that's the power of doing what we did in bringing the entire slate out to our end user base. 
So we're going to see a little bit of spikiness in what occurs. And I don't think it's fair to say if we're going to put, call it, 17, 18, whatever, movies we ultimately settle on in the release structure for the year, we're not going to see the kind of subscriber spikes that maybe we saw in December and early January every time we put a movie out, but that really isn't the design and intent of the plan. 
We have -- but we do have an opportunity to build marketing and promotion opportunities around those bigger releases that have broader buzz and broader application across the customer base. And we're going to take every advantage of doing that, and we're going to work filling in the niche between it. 
This -- I think I want to stress. This is a unique year, and we did this as a unique year. And probably appropriate to make a comment that in some cases, I'll say maybe the dynamic of the media and the press was a little oversold or a little intense on both ends of the spectrum around this from my point of view. 
We told you when the team decided to make this move that we thought it was appropriate for this moment in time. And the team made the call, and I think it was a bold and aggressive swing. It was done with a lot of thought as to what needed to occur in the subscriber base and the balance of the value of the franchises between our theatrical and our streaming business. 
It was certainly nice to have a streaming business to present us this option of how we use this content. But part of that call was just built on the dynamic of what we thought the theatrical moviegoing audiences were going to look like in 2021. And since we articulated that, I would say the data points have come in that have been very consistent with the set of assumptions that we had at the front end of that.
I mean just the last several weeks, you've seen other studios continuing to snowplow releases, moving them out of the first half of the year, moving them into the second half of the year, which further cements our point of view that we're going to see a very crowded theatrical field as we get into late 2021 and early 2022. And we don't believe that magically just because there's more content showing up in theaters all at the same time that, that's going to dramatically increase the size of the moviegoing population at that time.
And so as we indicated by making the write-off, we felt like we had a little bit of a spoiling asset here that needed to be moved -- used more effectively. And this was the right economic call to balance this across both sides. And we think using it to balance out long-lived subscribers to build out a scaled platform that allow us to have options in our distribution and using this unfortunate set of circumstances around the pandemic for an opportunity, make lemonade out of lemons, was the right call in this case.
And I think we all have to understand, we step back and think about the theatrical business. I mean nobody went to theaters in 2020 for the most part. It was a pandemic. Just like nobody got on airplanes, and nobody went to hotels, and nobody goes to restaurants. And all of those businesses had a little bit of dislocation because of that, and the theatrical business had a little bit of dislocation. And I applaud the team for the move they made and trying to make the best of this circumstance, for our circumstance around having a really strong theatrical slate that can help our streaming product.
Could we have maybe done some things a little bit differently in how we got through the front end of it? Any time you're first in something, there's no map. You're a trailblazer. There's nothing perfect for you to read. And I think that there's -- there were some things on the margin that maybe we'd do a little bit differently. 
But at the end of the day, it's going to get down to making sure people are fairly compensated and treated well. And I think we know how to do that. I think we've been good to the theater owners in the perspective that the exhibitors now have a planned and routine set of releases coming to them at a time when they really, as we've talked about, have other studios snowplowing. 
I think in the end, this will ultimately shape up to be a good thing across the board as we get through the emotional aspects that are bound to be there in a high anxiety environment like the pandemic. And all things having been said with what we've seen in the front end of the numbers, what our experience has been, we are delivering on this in a way that we expected. It's pretty consistent with the value shifts that we expected and feel pretty good about where we are in the early innings of this. So John, why don't you go ahead and..."

We're 31 days out from Wonder Woman's release, I think. And so we'll continue to follow it. 
More importantly, for everybody on the call, I think at the Analyst Day, we'll get the team. Jason and his team will get the opportunity to talk to you about some of the further plans and go through that.
Dave, your other question, I think, was with regard to the planning process. The guidance we've given here today, but for the exclusion of any commentary on C-band, is what we have as assets in our portfolio as of January 1 and owning them for the full year other than Crunchyroll, other than the already held-for-sale termination of Crunchyroll. 
And so yes, there is free cash flow in here from the video business. I won't give you a specific number on that, Dave. But you can assume based on the results of the business last year, it's probably going to be a lower number inclusive next year than it is this year for the changes in customer base and so forth. But it is a business as usual, what I would call kind of business planning approach. 
All that being said, feel really good about the free cash flow position. And particularly, as I mentioned in an earlier question, cash came in strong at the end of the year with regard to the fourth quarter, with regard to customer activity, both on the corporate business side as well as the consumer side. And you guys can see it in our bad debt, which are remarkably low.
Team did a really great job of weeding out fraud and weeding out -- and focusing on the best customers, and it's showing up in our numbers. So I think -- hopefully, that answers your question, David. Thanks for the earlier comment about my retirement. It will be a change, but it will be interesting."

It's obviously encouraging to see that you're going to be picking up the pace of the build-out this year. But even after building out 2 million additional homes passed, that would still be a small subset of the number of customer locations in your total wireline footprint. 
How do you think about what portion of that footprint, which I think has 60 million households in it, is potentially attractive in terms of being a great demo and having economics to reach them that generate a compelling return for you? In other words, for how long can you keep adding 2 million homes a year to your footprint? 
And am I even asking this question correctly because as you build out your 5G footprint, which is really a national 5G network using layers of spectrum across multiple bands, it would seem like wireless will increasingly be a viable technology for reaching households beyond your traditional footprint. How do you think about the fixed wireless opportunity? And maybe how do you just think about the ability to be a provider of high-speed residential broadband across the country?"

If I think",1013,"So Brett, the -- I'm going to sound like a broken record, but it's really important on these long-lived investments that we be pretty consistent internally, so that the management team can get to a consistent level of execution year-over-year. If I think about what has traditionally happened in outside plant access technology upgrades, I've been through a series of them over my career. And I don't think this one is going to be a whole lot different.
There's always the first 1/3 of the customer base that's kind of the low-hanging fruit, slam dunk, that is the part of the customer base that you cut your teeth on, get your processes squared away on, get the vendor community up the first part of the cost curve. And it's like the no-brainer economically, and you kind of make your decision that, that's where you're going to start. And I would say we went through that largely through that first 1/3 in the investment we've made over the last several years.
Then what happens is as you get your -- up the learning curve, and the vendors start to scale and you start to gain confidence in your economics and your business processes start to improve, and you start to see the marginal economics improve on the subscriber, which is what you're going to start to see happen on some of those broadband numbers on the fiber base that we've broken out for you. As we move forward here over time, the next 1/3 becomes the opportunity. And we're into that -- the middle innings of the game, if you want. It's the next 30% to 60% of the customer base that we can work our way through, and you look at the economics around it, it makes sense. 
Then you get into that last 1/3, and it's always the hardest part. And I mean in many instances, you're still sitting with the last 1/3 that, in parts of the rural America, that still really don't have effective broadband options. And oftentimes, it's policy. Sometimes it's a technology breakthrough that gets that last 1/3. 
And I would tell you right now, if you wanted me to prognosticate, are you going to build fiber to that last 1/3? I don't think I'd want to prognosticate that, that's a place that we're likely to go in the near term, absent some kind of major subsidy construct that comes into place. I actually believe, candidly, even if there was subsidy put in, it would be a better use of taxpayer money to do something that was more hybrid-oriented than the technologies that are applied and not exclusively lean on fiber in that space.
But we're several innings out from that actually coming to pass, and we'll have time to work through it. Right now, we're working in the middle innings of the game, and the next 30% of the customer base is where our focus is at. And as I shared with you on the previous call, it's 2 million this year. If the team executes well, we can do more than 2 million and start to ramp that up.
And when we demonstrate to the investor base that we're getting the kind of returns that you all like, then you should cheer us on to do that and be very supportive of us moving down that path. And it's my intent to characterize that and show that to you. 
In terms of how I think about the wireless and fixed base, I've got maybe a little different view on this, and I'll maybe step back and think about it from a macro level. If you go back and you look at consumption that's occurred in customer bases, whether it be wireless-centric, data use or fixed-centric data use, they've all been growing. And they grow at a pretty consistent level.
And if you go and you talk to experts around consumer behavior over the next 10 years and you look at what's going on inside the household of -- for example, just one major trend of people moving away from what used to be broadcast or multicast streams efficiently delivered to unicast streams, discrete streams to one device. And you just look at what's happening in consumer behavior over that, there is a substantial amount of video traffic to be moved to unicast. It's going to drive up a massive amount of consumption. 
And this ratio between mobile and fixed consumption has been about 10:1 for many years. This is not new. And I got to -- I believe that, that ratio, it may not be perfectly 10:1, but there's still going to be a pretty consistent gap between mobile and fixed consumption. In other words, there's still a lot of traffic to be moved, given consumer shifts and how they're using products and services.
And so as I sit back and think about things, I think about hybrid access technologies as being important. But I don't know that the most ideal way to build a network is going to be to use fixed wireless to take on the bulk of what occurs in the 4 walls of a business or a home, given the consumer behavior trends we're going to see over the next 10 years. And I think still having a very dense and rich fiber infrastructure is going to be necessary to be an effective network provider over time. 
Now it doesn't mean there won't be some segments of the population -- and my son, who lives on his own in an apartment in a metro urban area that might actually be an individual that could work on an all-wireless portion of his life in his 20s when he's independent and single and in a single-dwelling unit household. And maybe that's a little bit different surrogate arrangement that has a wireless tail on it or is a robust wireless LAN inside of a managed dwelling unit. But I still think reach and penetration of fiber is going to be important as we move forward."

And that VDSL footprint is 35 million. And when you add the fiber to it, it's greater than that. That will give you kind of a framework for something that we could efficiently do. Just what John said about building out the 2 million this year, that's where a lot of the focus is going to be.
So I think of that as the way to think about the opportunity for us. And yes, we have that ability. We need to continue the sales momentum. That's going to be really critically important to make it work. But in line with that, that's, I think, a focus of easy capability for us."

I expect it to happen, and we're going to watch the cycle repeat itself. 
And one would hope at some point that there's a recent discussion around a policy that gets us away from this web sign and allows everybody to kind of have a more consistent and stable approach. I don't know that, that's going to happen, but we're certainly going to try and push and discuss it.
Where I think the third rail is on this issue is the dynamic around what happens to the freedom of people who invest in competitive markets to price their products and services appropriately. And if we stay away from that third rail, if the kind of latitude is in there to be able to price and do the right things in the market where competitive markets exist, then I think everything will probably, at the end of the day, be okay.
But if for some reason, policy goes down a path where that isn't the case -- it hasn't in the past even when Title II is in place. We had the latitude to do what I felt like we needed to do. But if, for some reason, policy went further to try to solve a problem that doesn't exist, I have to step back and ask ourselves how we're allocating capital around that and evaluate where that comes out and ask if it's the right place for us to go for our shareholders based on that dynamic and that very important lever for us being taken away so -- or variable, I'd say, in the market, not lever. 
So that's how I think about it right now.

I mean this is the first big foray of maybe legacy AT&T thinking about having broader relationships with the customer base at a relatively low price point SKU that isn't exclusively dependent on infrastructure. 
And to the extent we are successful at having that relationship with most U.S. households, if we don't use that as an opportunity, as a springboard for us to start thinking about how we extend those customer relationships across other opportunities either to own and operate content or engagement with a customer or to use the platform as a means for others to distribute, we'd be losing a huge opportunity. 
And so I think, well, there's all kinds of things we want to do around the edge and making sure that we work with the right hyperscalers to virtualize and give our customers the opportunity to gain access into infrastructure so that they can run their compute environments and their application environments effectively. That's all important, and that's all meat-and-potato stuff we need to do on a network. 
But I think about owning some degree of engagement with the customer, a relationship, a means to build with them, having them interact with your service so that you have insights as to who they are, what they like, what they do, what their proclivities are, being able to emotionally attach with them, having a software platform that allows you to build the next building block of a product that extends into engagement, that talks about dynamics of changing consumption in social and interactive, I think this is a really important dynamic for the health of our business. And I know it's longer term in nature. And I'm well aware of the folks who have maybe a tighter orientation to the financial return question. Why would you be pushing as hard as you are in this area? It's because I feel pretty strongly about that. 
And I think building large subscription bases of customers that pay us every month for something has been kind of the hallmark of this business. We have a really attractive dynamic in that in our overall revenues and profitability today. We need to evolve that into what the next step is, and this is just one of those steps in making that happen."

And he's been a very valued and long-time coworker of mine. 
I think if you think about the fact that he sat in this role as CFO of this company for 9 years, that speaks volumes in and of itself about his character and abilities. That's a tremendous level of longevity for somebody who occupies a role as significant, as pressured and as dynamic as the one that he's had.
I've worked with John for 23 years of his career, which has been a long time, and it's been a pleasure all along the way. I could say a lot of things. Obviously, high integrity, high impact, high functioning and incredibly high regard as a person. We're going to miss him at AT&T. I know you're going to miss him in support of all of you, but we're delighted about what lies ahead for him and his family and Michele in his next chapter and as you would expect, the professionalism in navigating the handoff to what's going to be a very capable successor. I'm just delighted to have Pascal coming in, and look forward to all of you getting to know him. It's gone incredibly smoothly. It's been first rate. And I think as we join you a quarter from now and Pascal takes the reins, you'll see what a nice, smooth and even-keeled transition that's been when we reconvene.

Happy New Year to all of you, and I hope this moment finds you all in good health.
With that, let's go ahead and get started on Slide 3. There are a lot of words to describe 2020, most of which wouldn't be nice to say in public. But when I look at how we executed on our priorities in the midst of this pandemic, I keep coming back to one word, and that's resilient.
We added 1.5 million postpaid phones during the year, our most net adds in a decade and our highest-value subscribers. We reduced churn, streamlined operations and have the nation's fastest wireless network.
For the second year in a row, we added more than 1 million fiber subscribers as customers move to our higher-speed services. And perhaps most remarkable during this pandemic, we launched HBO Max. And about 7 months later, we had more than 41 million HBO Max and HBO domestic subscribers, 2 years ahead of the plan we shared with you in October of 2019.
Our resilient portfolio of subscription businesses continued to generate strong cash flows, more than $27 billion, to support our ability to invest in our growth areas and sustain the dividend. In fact, we finished the year with our total dividend payout ratio at a very comfortable level. And on debt management, we made material progress in 2020 by reducing debt maturities over the next 5 years by about 50% and lowering our weighted average interest rate on debt to about 4%.
We continue to transform the business to drive efficiencies. Our cost-cutting initiatives generated about $2 billion in savings in 2020, dollars we invested back into the business to drive subscriber growth and move our transformation initiatives forward.
In mobility, we streamlined distribution, shifted some stores to third-party dealers and closed others. Total calls into our call centers are down by 30 million as we saw a dramatic shift to online transactions by our customer base. We retired more than 30 products in our portfolio and consolidated operations to capitalize on reduced complexity.
We took our first steps and reduced our real estate footprint by more than 9 million square feet with more work underway in our longer-term operating model. We also realigned and streamlined our WarnerMedia operations to better deliver on HBO Max and the future of how consumers want to view content.
Those are a few of our 2020 highlights. Let's talk about our 2021 priorities on Slide 4. We have 3 priorities this year. Number one is straightforward: grow our direct customer relationships. That begins with the vital connectivity services we provide and the strength of our network. We've had the overall fastest wireless network in the nation every quarter for the last 2 years according to Ookla and the fastest nationwide 5G network in the second half of 2020 after our nationwide 5G launch. It shows the strength of our low-band spectrum portfolio.
Our fiber Net Promoter Scores continue to be materially better than cables and are helping drive strong subscriber trends and higher penetration rates. There is strong demand for the reliability and speeds our fiber product provides.
Beyond our core connectivity services, we're focused on our goal to establish relationships with most U.S. households, and HBO Max is the key here. Through our software-based entertainment platforms, we can learn more about our customers and create long-lasting emotional connections with our award-winning storytelling capabilities.
Our second priority is the same as last year, and that's continuing to transform our operations to be more effective and efficient. We're restructuring businesses, sunsetting legacy networks, reducing corporate staffing levels and overall benefit costs. As a result, we're positioned to enter the post-pandemic world as a more agile and efficient company.
Our third priority is about continuing to be deliberate and strategic with how we allocate capital. We plan to use free cash flow after dividends for the next couple of years to pay down debt. We remain focused on monetizing noncore assets and using those funds for debt reduction as well. We're committed to sustaining our dividend at current levels, and we'll give top priority to debt reduction at this time.
In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made the last 2 quarters. Despite COVID-19 challenges, we're seeing growth where we want to see growth, and we're successfully redirecting our investments to support those areas. We have more work to do, but I'm confident we're on the right path.
Before I hand it over to John, I want to acknowledge that I'm sensitive to the reality that there's much going on in and around the business. I know inside AT&T, we're working hard to reposition the company. So I can imagine you're working equally hard to keep up with us. To that end, I want to let you know we plan to host a virtual investor event in the second half of the quarter, where our leadership team will provide more insight into our business plans, and we'll have a lot of time for discussion and your questions. Look for more to come on that soon.
With that, I'll turn it over to John to discuss the more detailed results from the quarter. John?"

Let me start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our fourth quarter subscriber metrics. Wireless subscriber growth was the best it's been in years.

Let me start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our fourth quarter subscriber metrics. Wireless subscriber growth was the best it's been in years. We had 1.2 million postpaid net adds, including 800,000 postpaid phones. Postpaid phone churn was the second lowest quarter on record, coming in at 0.76%.
Our fiber momentum also continues. We added more than 270,000 fiber subscribers in the quarter. HBO Max subscriber growth continues to outpace original estimates. We added nearly 7 million total subscribers for HBO Max and HBO in 2020 alone. The trend of premium video declines continues to improve. If you exclude the impact of Keep America Connected on third quarter net adds, our premium video net adds improved sequentially for the fifth quarter in a row.
Let's now look at our consolidated and segment results, starting with our financial summary on Slide 7. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.75. That included COVID impacts to revenues from lower television licensing and production, changes to the theatrical release slate and lower international roaming. Combined, COVID had an estimated $0.08 of EPS impact to fourth quarter, which we did include in our adjusted results.
We've made the decision to operate our broadband and legacy voice operations separate from our video business unit and have recast our Entertainment Group results accordingly. In conjunction with this change in operations, we have reassessed the book values of our video assets, including goodwill and other long-lived assets. As a result, we recorded a pretax noncash impairment of $15.5 billion.
Additionally, we adjusted for an actuarial loss to our benefit plans and a write-off of production and other content inventory at WarnerMedia, stemming from the continued shutdown of theaters and film releases going on HBO Max. We'll provide more information in our SEC filings and on our website and in our annual report.
Revenues were down from a year ago, with gains in mobility partially offsetting pressure from WarnerMedia and video, but revenues were up sequentially. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of about $200 million in revenue primarily in our Latin America segment.
Cash flows for the quarter and the year underscore our resilient customer base and liquidity. Cash from operations came in at $10.1 billion for the quarter and $43.1 billion for the year. Free cash flow was $7.7 billion for the quarter and $27.5 billion for 2020.
For the full year, our total dividend payout ratio was just under 55%. Gross capital investment was about $20 billion in 2020, and we continue to invest heavily in our growth areas even during a pandemic. In addition, we invested about $800 million in HBO Max in the fourth quarter and about $2.1 billion for the full year.
Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communications segment on Slide 8. Our Communications business showed revenue growth this quarter, thanks to a strong performance in mobility. We told you we intended to give our best customers our best prices and offers, and you are seeing the benefits of that logic. Strong subscriber gains and people moving to unlimited plans help drive service revenue growth in the quarter, even with continuing pressure in international roaming. More than 60% of our postpaid phone base is on an unlimited plan. 
Churn has been impressive. The last 2 quarters have been our lowest postpaid phone churn quarters on record. And for the full year, a remarkable 16 basis point improvement in postpaid phone churn. Our successful retention approach does require some upfront investment, but the lower churn levels and improved subscriber counts make this the right economic trade. 
As I mentioned, we have split the Entertainment Group into 2 reporting units, broadband and video, and a full reconciliation of the 2 units is in our support documents. But for comparative purposes, here are the trends in Entertainment Group the way you have been used to seeing them. We had our best AT&T Fiber fourth quarter net adds, even with more challenges associated with the pandemic. And penetration continues to grow. It's now at 34%. In our video unit, premium video losses were improved year-over-year, thanks to lower churn and our focus on high-value customers. We continue to drive ARPU growth in both video and IP broadband. In fact, premium video ARPU was up more than 5%. 
Our business wireline team continues to effectively manage the transition of the business and deliver solid results amidst the pandemic. Solid cost management is the key to delivering solid EBITDA all year long. 
Let's move to WarnerMedia and Latin America results, which are on Slide 9. WarnerMedia continues to be impacted by the pandemic as we've seen across that entire industry. We did see solid gains in subscription revenues, thanks to the rapid growth of HBO Max. We now have 41 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers and about 61 million worldwide as we prepare for the international launch of HBO Max later this year. And we now have more than 10 million customers who combine 1 or more of our connectivity products with HBO Max or HBO.
Advertising revenues also grew, driven by political advertising and CNN, which was #1 in all of cable viewership, not just news in the fourth quarter. Because of the pandemic, we introduced a unique 1-year plan in which Warner Bros. will continue to exhibit films theatrically worldwide while adding an exclusive 1-month access period on HBO Max, simultaneous with the film's domestic release. Our goal is to make the best of a very challenging situation for all involved. That includes filmmakers and talent, theater owners and most importantly, the moviegoing public.
Our Latin American operations continue to work to recover from the pandemic. We added more than 500,000 subscribers in Mexico and almost 50,000 subscribers in Vrio, helped in part by our over-the-top offering in Brazil. Latin America revenues continue to be challenged by FX, slow economies and COVID. Even with this, Mexico EBITDA improved year-over-year for the second quarter in a row, and Vrio continues to generate positive EBITDA and cash flow on a constant currency basis. 
Now let's go to Slide 11 for our 2021 guidance. Last year was a difficult year for us to forecast for obvious reasons. There remain uncertainties in 2021 with the rate and pace of recovery from the pandemic around the globe impacting media, travel and employment. 
Against that backdrop, our current outlook for 2021 is as follows. We expect consolidated revenue growth of about 1% with wireless service revenue growth of 2% and a gradual improvement in WarnerMedia's top line. As noted previously, we plan to reinvest all our savings from our transformation efforts to support our customer count momentum in our growth businesses. Combined with ongoing declines in our premium video segment, this could lead to adjusted EBITDA declining slightly in 2021 versus this year. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be stable with 2020. We expect gross capital investment in the $21 billion range and net CapEx of about $18 billion. The primary difference between the 2 is from vendor financing initiatives we have in place and anticipated FirstNet reimbursements.  
Free cash flow has been resilient for us even during the pandemic, and we expect that resiliency to continue in 2021 with a $26 billion range target for free cash flow. 
We'll also continue to focus on bringing down debt. As John mentioned, we expect to use free cash flow dollars after dividends to pay down debt. We continue to look for opportunities to monetize assets and apply those proceeds to paying down debt, including Crunchyroll, which we expect to close later this year. We do plan to provide an update on our leverage outlook and longer-term debt ratio target once the auction quiet period ends.
As 2020 showed us, things can change quickly. However, we are encouraged by our ability to adapt to those changes while driving increased customer counts, generating strong cash flows, investing in areas of strategic focus, all while maintaining a disciplined approach to our capital allocation and shareholder return strategies. As John mentioned, we plan to have a virtual analyst event later in the quarter to talk about this more. 
Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for Q&A."

On the macro side, the one thing we saw at the end of last year was the customers' willingness to pay. Our bad debts were really quite solid, quite positive trends, both on the consumer and the corporate side. So while we're not getting overly excited, it was a positive sense.
What we have built into our plans are, if you will, more of the kind of current environment for the next 6 months with some second half and really close to the fourth quarter pickup in pandemic relief activities. So we'll see more theatergoing probably in the fourth quarter than we did this year. We'll see some more travel, but in no way did we envision a hockey stick or any kind of dramatic increase. It's really much more of a general staying the course. There is some slight improvement but staying the course. 
Secondly, with -- the one thing I'd add though is the cash collections have been strong and have been resilient, feel really good about that. So that gives us some comfort.
Secondly, with regard to the CapEx, I'd say it this way. As you look at the kind of the gross capital being put in the ground, it's up $1 billion. There will be some changes in what we spent last year, i.e., I continue to expect the -- a little bit lighter on the video satellite-type side of the business because of the success of AT&T TV and our focus on churn reduction as opposed to gross heads. So there'll be some more money there.
I think you'll see us -- we've continued to spend money on wireless, but we're well into and well completed with the FirstNet build. So we'll have some ability to manage there.
The next piece though is we will see an increase in the fiber build and the opportunity to add some more sales opportunities to that inventory. I don't know, John, did I miss anything from your perspective?"

And I think the only other thing I would comment on relative to the wireless spend overall, the shift that's occurring, we put a tremendous amount of capacity out over the last several years in combination with a lot of the work we spoke to you about with the FirstNet upgrades. And there's a kind of a shift in mix going on within the wireless building.
We're now moving away from what I would call capacity that's on existing spectrum bands and starting to see ourselves prepped for possibly using other spectrum that may come into service at some point in time, et cetera. So we got a little bit of a dynamic going on in the shift that's in the overall wireless program."

And the teams are already out turning things up. 
We had the conversation last quarter. I don't want to repeat myself, but we shared with you that this build is a little bit different than when we initially started because we have wire centers that are already fiber-capable. The infrastructure is in place. We're going back in and picking up the next adjacent neighborhood or the next successive area. And as a result of that, the speed to get up and moving is not the lift that it was the first time we started ramping up on this. So we've got a little bit smoother dynamic around it than what you might think because of the increase in the fiber dynamic."

With regard to the broadband piece, quite frankly, it's really the efforts we've had to increase our sales capabilities, add new customers, the amounts that we built out in the prior years. It also has to do with the recognition that we are providing HBO Max for all of our gig customers, and so there's an intercompany charge there. It's within the umbrella of AT&T, and the economics are there, so we feel good about it. But that's also in there.  
I would tell you, as you all know, the network infrastructure customer service like fiber is a long-term game, and we've gone through the process many times, feel very good about the long-term returns and the efforts. But yes, we're going to be spending some money as we did last year, to invest in that customer growth.  
You saw the 600,000 plus, 650,000-or-so net adds last 6 months. And we feel very good about that particularly when we look at the churn numbers, particularly when we look at the customer satisfaction, the NPS scores so completely or complete support the fact. But yes, there is some investment there. 
With regard to the AVOD, we are expecting to launch our international version of the HBO Max later this year as well as the AVOD. I'm not ready to give any dates. John, I don't know if you want to say anything more specific."

And I think I would point out equally as important is the Latin America launch of HBO Max that we've been working really hard on and will be an important driver for us on future growth and getting ourselves embedded into the international front on a unified platform and approach to things. So you should expect, as we get into the second quarter, there's going to be a lot of activity and change going on here.
One of the reasons we're kind of trying to pinpoint the exact date on it is, as you know, we've been working through pandemic-related production issues. And ramping that back up has been a pretty significant path. The team has done a remarkable job getting ourselves back into that business and working through the dynamics safely.
It puts a little bit of overhead on things in terms of speed of production and what we're able to do. And there's a bit of rework that goes on with trying to work around the limitations of a pandemic-based environment. As a result of that, we're still fighting through getting the pipeline, dropping the content at the right rate and pace that we wanted to. And the first quarter this year continues to be a bit of a stretch in that regard as we cycle back into production. 
Our expectations are that we start to hit our stride as we get into the second quarter, and it's really important as we put these new iterations of the product now that we have ourselves in a good position in terms of the content inventory. And so as we're kind of going hand-to-mouth on these right now, John, we'll be a little bit more discrete on when we announce what's coming out in exactly what month simply because it's just that tough and that much of a battle, literally show by show, to get this stuff done and get it into the funnel, and we're working hard to do that.  
And we hope we're past any of the unexpected dynamics, like the California closures that went on over the last several weeks that put a couple of twists and turns in the road, and we've got the worst behind us. But yes, I'm a little chased right now with everything on the pandemic. So I don't want to overpromise anything."

We're going to look at our promotion strategies and adjust them accordingly and determine what we need to do to continue to be in a position to maintain and grow share. And it's -- I think it's really important that we continue to have a growing business.  
There's -- the management team is focused on 2 things. We like the momentum. I think we'd like to be a little bit more efficient with the momentum. We've done some really good stuff and had some really good progress on self-funding a lot of what we've been doing in the market. But we're not self-funding all of it yet. 
And so our continued work on trying to manage the efficiency and effectiveness of this business so that we can be in a more aggressive posture in the market is something that this team is working on every quarter. And we've tried to be diligent and reasonable in our guidance to you and make sure that we have high confidence in what we share.
But what I'm turning back to the management team is a task that I'd say is more aggressive. And to the extent that this management team delivers, and they have been doing a remarkable job of doing that over the last several quarters, does that mean that, that's going to give us more room to do more in the market and continue to maintain a posture that I think is totally appropriate? Bringing in high-value customers, the right kind of customers we want. Going down the swim lanes that we set up for ourselves that we think we have a unique place to be, which is winning in the public sector with our FirstNet abilities, using our deep enterprise customer relationships to go deeper into the customer base with affinity programs, ensuring that we're getting the mass market with attractive offers like HBO Max and what's associated with that, that is -- it brought in a really attractive gross add pool and treating our embedded base well, that is the strategy. And we're going to continue to do that.  
I think you're seeing it, to be the industry leader in churn this quarter, I think we called it right. We said that we don't have customers that are upset about our network. They like it. We don't have customers that are upset about our service. They're satisfied with our service.
We have customers who are interested in finding new devices. We shared with you that we had a little bit more aging population on device longevity than the rest of the industry. We've been targeting how we do that. I think getting the new 30-year lease on life -- the 30-month lease on life with these customers -- I wish it was 30 years, it's in a very appropriate exchange for the franchise right now given everything we have in front of us."

The reality of it is we would prefer to be able to give you more information about a leverage target. We can't do that at this time because of the status of the C-band auction and our inability to comment on. That's all we're trying to tell you is that we understand that we would normally give that to you, that it would be appropriate. But because of the FCC rules, we can't. So we will commit that we will update it when it's past then. That's the story. 
I think the one thing that I'd repeat, though, is $27.5 billion last year, $26 billion we're guiding for next year, $15 billion dividend, a lot of money to use to pay down debt. That's what -- the message we want to give you, and the proceeds from things like Crunchyroll going to use to pay down debt.

And so that compare is going to be compared to, if you will, 2.5 months of international roaming. So that will be one set. 
The next 3 quarters will presumably be without the international roaming. So the numbers will be different. That's one, and I'd just say that to you. So I don't want to get into quarterly analysis. Because I just don't want to confuse things, we talk about the full year. 
Secondly, the real story on the service revenue is customer growth. And quite frankly, we talk about the 1.2 million of postpaid net adds, the 1.5 million of -- 1.2 million postpaid net adds last quarter, the 1.5 million of voice net adds mostly in the last 6 months, all of that. 
But the reality is, too, we have close to 16 million total wireless connection net adds during the quarter -- during the year when you include all connections. And we're seeing -- and we believe that our strategies, the ones John just talked about with treating our best customers with the best offers and things like that have the opportunity to win for us the best network and so forth. And so we're optimistic about the ability to continue to grow that customer base. That's what's driving the service revenues.
With regard to the ARPU growth, the continued opportunities go into the upscaling of these packages with a great opportunity to offer HBO Max, which has certainly got tailwinds behind it and the success of it. You saw the 7 million HBO adds, best we've had in not only 10 years, but the best in the total 10 years, better than the total last 10 years. That is going to -- we believe that, that kind of packaging with wireless is going to help and such that we're going to be able to grow it and then grow the ARPU from getting people to buy up not just from the mobile share plans into unlimited, but to buy up for the basic unlimited all the way up to the Elite. 
That's the story. We're not giving specific percentages, dollars, but that's what builds that confidence in wireless service revenue growth, which really drives the overall growth of the company's 1% guidance on revenue growth, that and some tailwinds from the comeback of WarnerMedia."

And what in the $26 billion of free cash flow guidance is coming from the satellite video business today? 
And then the second conversation, we've just finished the first month of the HBO Max experience with Wonder Woman commensurate with the theatrical release. And this is obviously going to happen like 11 more times over the course of 2021 as you kind of do the day, date thing with the movie slate. If we multiply what happened with Wonder Woman times 11 over the course of 2021, what does that look like for Warner Bros. from a revenue and profit standpoint relative to what maybe 2019 would have looked like in a more normal year?"

Obviously, what I'll say on that is we assume that we're running the business as we portrayed it to you. And we have been debating how we wanted to set up our operations for video for some time. And I think part of this, when we step back and think about why we made this change is we figure we're at a life cycle change in these products, that getting management teams focused in this way will be the best way to maximize value in the discrete product lines.
And so in the video case, we've seen a pretty dramatic change in what's occurring in the market. And there's a variety of things driving it. You all know about the declines in the pay TV life cycle. But we also have the dynamic that's starting to occur, which I think is a really important one to understand where we're starting to see pay TV disconnect a little bit from broadband as virtual MVPDs start up. Our own product itself, in many respects, has a virtual characteristic to it, and it's a fairly mature offering. 
And so getting the management team really focused on what to do in the latter stages of the life cycle of a mature product and ensuring that we manage it effectively, I think, is a wise thing to do for that product on a stand-alone basis. And that's one driver behind why we made that decision.
The second driver behind why we made this decision is I believe we're at the front end of a dynamic of customers wanting to ensure that they have connectivity and broadband access no matter where they go, and they want a simpler model around that. And I think about our business being in a very unique position for both businesses and consumers to deliver on that promise, and the innovation that's going to be necessary from a product perspective. And then pairing that with what are the new complementary products and services that customers might want to bundle or use with that connectivity I think is a new play, and that's a new growth for us.
And to get another part of the management team really focused on that aspect of our business is how we simplify unified connectivity for our customer base, whether a consumer or a business, whether fixed or mobile, starting to think about what those virtual-type add-ons are to that product that come with a very different delivery mechanism than what we've historically seen when we've been bundling what I would call these high overhead, premise-intensive visit-type services that we've traditionally had in the bundle. And playing to that is the strength and position for growth is the second part of why we want the management team set up the way we have it right now and focused on that going forward.
And that just makes sense for how we're operating the business because of the time and place and where we are. And we are absolutely comfortable that that's the right call for how to operate our business moving forward. And I will tell you, I'm not going to speculate on anything structural or M&A-oriented. We never do, and I'm not going to now. But I believe that what we're doing here is if the goal is to always run an asset for maximum value creation, this is the right strategy to run the asset for maximum value creation. John?"

So I think where we are is that there's a difference between a -- what I'll call a tentpole release and a nontentpole release. And Wonder Woman and the nature of that production value and what occurs in it is different than the balance of many of the other movies in our slate. We have other tentpole releases that occur throughout the 2021 release schedule. They are going to be equally as buzzworthy as Wonder Woman. And we have in between those other high-quality offerings that fill that in, that cater to maybe sometimes a less broad audience. And that's the power of doing what we did in bringing the entire slate out to our end user base. 
So we're going to see a little bit of spikiness in what occurs. And I don't think it's fair to say if we're going to put, call it, 17, 18, whatever, movies we ultimately settle on in the release structure for the year, we're not going to see the kind of subscriber spikes that maybe we saw in December and early January every time we put a movie out, but that really isn't the design and intent of the plan. 
We have -- but we do have an opportunity to build marketing and promotion opportunities around those bigger releases that have broader buzz and broader application across the customer base. And we're going to take every advantage of doing that, and we're going to work filling in the niche between it. 
This -- I think I want to stress. This is a unique year, and we did this as a unique year. And probably appropriate to make a comment that in some cases, I'll say maybe the dynamic of the media and the press was a little oversold or a little intense on both ends of the spectrum around this from my point of view. 
We told you when the team decided to make this move that we thought it was appropriate for this moment in time. And the team made the call, and I think it was a bold and aggressive swing. It was done with a lot of thought as to what needed to occur in the subscriber base and the balance of the value of the franchises between our theatrical and our streaming business. 
It was certainly nice to have a streaming business to present us this option of how we use this content. But part of that call was just built on the dynamic of what we thought the theatrical moviegoing audiences were going to look like in 2021. And since we articulated that, I would say the data points have come in that have been very consistent with the set of assumptions that we had at the front end of that.
I mean just the last several weeks, you've seen other studios continuing to snowplow releases, moving them out of the first half of the year, moving them into the second half of the year, which further cements our point of view that we're going to see a very crowded theatrical field as we get into late 2021 and early 2022. And we don't believe that magically just because there's more content showing up in theaters all at the same time that, that's going to dramatically increase the size of the moviegoing population at that time.
And so as we indicated by making the write-off, we felt like we had a little bit of a spoiling asset here that needed to be moved -- used more effectively. And this was the right economic call to balance this across both sides. And we think using it to balance out long-lived subscribers to build out a scaled platform that allow us to have options in our distribution and using this unfortunate set of circumstances around the pandemic for an opportunity, make lemonade out of lemons, was the right call in this case.
And I think we all have to understand, we step back and think about the theatrical business. I mean nobody went to theaters in 2020 for the most part. It was a pandemic. Just like nobody got on airplanes, and nobody went to hotels, and nobody goes to restaurants. And all of those businesses had a little bit of dislocation because of that, and the theatrical business had a little bit of dislocation. And I applaud the team for the move they made and trying to make the best of this circumstance, for our circumstance around having a really strong theatrical slate that can help our streaming product.
Could we have maybe done some things a little bit differently in how we got through the front end of it? Any time you're first in something, there's no map. You're a trailblazer. There's nothing perfect for you to read. And I think that there's -- there were some things on the margin that maybe we'd do a little bit differently. 
But at the end of the day, it's going to get down to making sure people are fairly compensated and treated well. And I think we know how to do that. I think we've been good to the theater owners in the perspective that the exhibitors now have a planned and routine set of releases coming to them at a time when they really, as we've talked about, have other studios snowplowing. 
I think in the end, this will ultimately shape up to be a good thing across the board as we get through the emotional aspects that are bound to be there in a high anxiety environment like the pandemic. And all things having been said with what we've seen in the front end of the numbers, what our experience has been, we are delivering on this in a way that we expected. It's pretty consistent with the value shifts that we expected and feel pretty good about where we are in the early innings of this. So John, why don't you go ahead and..."

We're 31 days out from Wonder Woman's release, I think. And so we'll continue to follow it. 
More importantly, for everybody on the call, I think at the Analyst Day, we'll get the team. Jason and his team will get the opportunity to talk to you about some of the further plans and go through that.
Dave, your other question, I think, was with regard to the planning process. The guidance we've given here today, but for the exclusion of any commentary on C-band, is what we have as assets in our portfolio as of January 1 and owning them for the full year other than Crunchyroll, other than the already held-for-sale termination of Crunchyroll. 
And so yes, there is free cash flow in here from the video business. I won't give you a specific number on that, Dave. But you can assume based on the results of the business last year, it's probably going to be a lower number inclusive next year than it is this year for the changes in customer base and so forth. But it is a business as usual, what I would call kind of business planning approach. 
All that being said, feel really good about the free cash flow position. And particularly, as I mentioned in an earlier question, cash came in strong at the end of the year with regard to the fourth quarter, with regard to customer activity, both on the corporate business side as well as the consumer side. And you guys can see it in our bad debt, which are remarkably low.
Team did a really great job of weeding out fraud and weeding out -- and focusing on the best customers, and it's showing up in our numbers. So I think -- hopefully, that answers your question, David. Thanks for the earlier comment about my retirement. It will be a change, but it will be interesting."

It's obviously encouraging to see that you're going to be picking up the pace of the build-out this year. But even after building out 2 million additional homes passed, that would still be a small subset of the number of customer locations in your total wireline footprint. 
How do you think about what portion of that footprint, which I think has 60 million households in it, is potentially attractive in terms of being a great demo and having economics to reach them that generate a compelling return for you? In other words, for how long can you keep adding 2 million homes a year to your footprint? 
And am I even asking this question correctly because as you build out your 5G footprint, which is really a national 5G network using layers of spectrum across multiple bands, it would seem like wireless will increasingly be a viable technology for reaching households beyond your traditional footprint. How do you think about the fixed wireless opportunity? And maybe how do you just think about the ability to be a provider of high-speed residential broadband across the country?"

If I think",1013,"So Brett, the -- I'm going to sound like a broken record, but it's really important on these long-lived investments that we be pretty consistent internally, so that the management team can get to a consistent level of execution year-over-year. If I think about what has traditionally happened in outside plant access technology upgrades, I've been through a series of them over my career. And I don't think this one is going to be a whole lot different.
There's always the first 1/3 of the customer base that's kind of the low-hanging fruit, slam dunk, that is the part of the customer base that you cut your teeth on, get your processes squared away on, get the vendor community up the first part of the cost curve. And it's like the no-brainer economically, and you kind of make your decision that, that's where you're going to start. And I would say we went through that largely through that first 1/3 in the investment we've made over the last several years.
Then what happens is as you get your -- up the learning curve, and the vendors start to scale and you start to gain confidence in your economics and your business processes start to improve, and you start to see the marginal economics improve on the subscriber, which is what you're going to start to see happen on some of those broadband numbers on the fiber base that we've broken out for you. As we move forward here over time, the next 1/3 becomes the opportunity. And we're into that -- the middle innings of the game, if you want. It's the next 30% to 60% of the customer base that we can work our way through, and you look at the economics around it, it makes sense. 
Then you get into that last 1/3, and it's always the hardest part. And I mean in many instances, you're still sitting with the last 1/3 that, in parts of the rural America, that still really don't have effective broadband options. And oftentimes, it's policy. Sometimes it's a technology breakthrough that gets that last 1/3. 
And I would tell you right now, if you wanted me to prognosticate, are you going to build fiber to that last 1/3? I don't think I'd want to prognosticate that, that's a place that we're likely to go in the near term, absent some kind of major subsidy construct that comes into place. I actually believe, candidly, even if there was subsidy put in, it would be a better use of taxpayer money to do something that was more hybrid-oriented than the technologies that are applied and not exclusively lean on fiber in that space.
But we're several innings out from that actually coming to pass, and we'll have time to work through it. Right now, we're working in the middle innings of the game, and the next 30% of the customer base is where our focus is at. And as I shared with you on the previous call, it's 2 million this year. If the team executes well, we can do more than 2 million and start to ramp that up.
And when we demonstrate to the investor base that we're getting the kind of returns that you all like, then you should cheer us on to do that and be very supportive of us moving down that path. And it's my intent to characterize that and show that to you. 
In terms of how I think about the wireless and fixed base, I've got maybe a little different view on this, and I'll maybe step back and think about it from a macro level. If you go back and you look at consumption that's occurred in customer bases, whether it be wireless-centric, data use or fixed-centric data use, they've all been growing. And they grow at a pretty consistent level.
And if you go and you talk to experts around consumer behavior over the next 10 years and you look at what's going on inside the household of -- for example, just one major trend of people moving away from what used to be broadcast or multicast streams efficiently delivered to unicast streams, discrete streams to one device. And you just look at what's happening in consumer behavior over that, there is a substantial amount of video traffic to be moved to unicast. It's going to drive up a massive amount of consumption. 
And this ratio between mobile and fixed consumption has been about 10:1 for many years. This is not new. And I got to -- I believe that, that ratio, it may not be perfectly 10:1, but there's still going to be a pretty consistent gap between mobile and fixed consumption. In other words, there's still a lot of traffic to be moved, given consumer shifts and how they're using products and services.
And so as I sit back and think about things, I think about hybrid access technologies as being important. But I don't know that the most ideal way to build a network is going to be to use fixed wireless to take on the bulk of what occurs in the 4 walls of a business or a home, given the consumer behavior trends we're going to see over the next 10 years. And I think still having a very dense and rich fiber infrastructure is going to be necessary to be an effective network provider over time. 
Now it doesn't mean there won't be some segments of the population -- and my son, who lives on his own in an apartment in a metro urban area that might actually be an individual that could work on an all-wireless portion of his life in his 20s when he's independent and single and in a single-dwelling unit household. And maybe that's a little bit different surrogate arrangement that has a wireless tail on it or is a robust wireless LAN inside of a managed dwelling unit. But I still think reach and penetration of fiber is going to be important as we move forward."

And that VDSL footprint is 35 million. And when you add the fiber to it, it's greater than that. That will give you kind of a framework for something that we could efficiently do. Just what John said about building out the 2 million this year, that's where a lot of the focus is going to be.
So I think of that as the way to think about the opportunity for us. And yes, we have that ability. We need to continue the sales momentum. That's going to be really critically important to make it work. But in line with that, that's, I think, a focus of easy capability for us."

I expect it to happen, and we're going to watch the cycle repeat itself. 
And one would hope at some point that there's a recent discussion around a policy that gets us away from this web sign and allows everybody to kind of have a more consistent and stable approach. I don't know that, that's going to happen, but we're certainly going to try and push and discuss it.
Where I think the third rail is on this issue is the dynamic around what happens to the freedom of people who invest in competitive markets to price their products and services appropriately. And if we stay away from that third rail, if the kind of latitude is in there to be able to price and do the right things in the market where competitive markets exist, then I think everything will probably, at the end of the day, be okay.
But if for some reason, policy goes down a path where that isn't the case -- it hasn't in the past even when Title II is in place. We had the latitude to do what I felt like we needed to do. But if, for some reason, policy went further to try to solve a problem that doesn't exist, I have to step back and ask ourselves how we're allocating capital around that and evaluate where that comes out and ask if it's the right place for us to go for our shareholders based on that dynamic and that very important lever for us being taken away so -- or variable, I'd say, in the market, not lever. 
So that's how I think about it right now. I actually step back and -- from a policy perspective, ironically, think about what's happened over the course of the last year or 2 and the dynamics that are going on right now where the issue is looking at metering and monitoring speech and what's occurring for people to access the platforms, that -- there are more real and significant data points in how that's affecting society than anything to do with how Internet service providers are delivering bandwidth in the homes. But I'll leave it to smarter people to meet and figure that one out."

And I think about that broadly as, while today, we talk about it as an SVOD evolving to an AVOD offer. I've mentioned this before, I view it as a really important foundation for broader customer relationships. I mean this is the first big foray of maybe legacy AT&T thinking about having broader relationships with the customer base at a relatively low price point SKU that isn't exclusively dependent on infrastructure. 
And to the extent we are successful at having that relationship with most U.S. households, if we don't use that as an opportunity, as a springboard for us to start thinking about how we extend those customer relationships across other opportunities either to own and operate content or engagement with a customer or to use the platform as a means for others to distribute, we'd be losing a huge opportunity. 
And so I think, well, there's all kinds of things we want to do around the edge and making sure that we work with the right hyperscalers to virtualize and give our customers the opportunity to gain access into infrastructure so that they can run their compute environments and their application environments effectively. That's all important, and that's all meat-and-potato stuff we need to do on a network. 
But I think about owning some degree of engagement with the customer, a relationship, a means to build with them, having them interact with your service so that you have insights as to who they are, what they like, what they do, what their proclivities are, being able to emotionally attach with them, having a software platform that allows you to build the next building block of a product that extends into engagement, that talks about dynamics of changing consumption in social and interactive, I think this is a really important dynamic for the health of our business. And I know it's longer term in nature. And I'm well aware of the folks who have maybe a tighter orientation to the financial return question. Why would you be pushing as hard as you are in this area? It's because I feel pretty strongly about that. 
And I think building large subscription bases of customers that pay us every month for something has been kind of the hallmark of this business. We have a really attractive dynamic in that in our overall revenues and profitability today. We need to evolve that into what the next step is, and this is just one of those steps in making that happen."

Happy New Year to all of you, and I hope this moment finds you all in good health.
With that, let's go ahead and get started on Slide 3. There are a lot of words to describe 2020, most of which wouldn't be nice to say in public. But when I look at how we executed on our priorities in the midst of this pandemic, I keep coming back to one word, and that's resilient.
We added 1.5 million postpaid phones during the year, our most net adds in a decade and our highest-value subscribers. We reduced churn, streamlined operations and have the nation's fastest wireless network.
For the second year in a row, we added more than 1 million fiber subscribers as customers move to our higher-speed services. And perhaps most remarkable during this pandemic, we launched HBO Max. And about 7 months later, we had more than 41 million HBO Max and HBO domestic subscribers, 2 years ahead of the plan we shared with you in October of 2019.
Our resilient portfolio of subscription businesses continued to generate strong cash flows, more than $27 billion, to support our ability to invest in our growth areas and sustain the dividend. In fact, we finished the year with our total dividend payout ratio at a very comfortable level. And on debt management, we made material progress in 2020 by reducing debt maturities over the next 5 years by about 50% and lowering our weighted average interest rate on debt to about 4%.
We continue to transform the business to drive efficiencies. Our cost-cutting initiatives generated about $2 billion in savings in 2020, dollars we invested back into the business to drive subscriber growth and move our transformation initiatives forward.
In mobility, we streamlined distribution, shifted some stores to third-party dealers and closed others. Total calls into our call centers are down by 30 million as we saw a dramatic shift to online transactions by our customer base. We retired more than 30 products in our portfolio and consolidated operations to capitalize on reduced complexity.
We took our first steps and reduced our real estate footprint by more than 9 million square feet with more work underway in our longer-term operating model. We also realigned and streamlined our WarnerMedia operations to better deliver on HBO Max and the future of how consumers want to view content.
Those are a few of our 2020 highlights. Let's talk about our 2021 priorities on Slide 4. We have 3 priorities this year. Number one is straightforward: grow our direct customer relationships. That begins with the vital connectivity services we provide and the strength of our network. We've had the overall fastest wireless network in the nation every quarter for the last 2 years according to Ookla and the fastest nationwide 5G network in the second half of 2020 after our nationwide 5G launch. It shows the strength of our low-band spectrum portfolio.
Our fiber Net Promoter Scores continue to be materially better than cables and are helping drive strong subscriber trends and higher penetration rates. There is strong demand for the reliability and speeds our fiber product provides.
Beyond our core connectivity services, we're focused on our goal to establish relationships with most U.S. households, and HBO Max is the key here. Through our software-based entertainment platforms, we can learn more about our customers and create long-lasting emotional connections with our award-winning storytelling capabilities.
Our second priority is the same as last year, and that's continuing to transform our operations to be more effective and efficient. We're restructuring businesses, sunsetting legacy networks, reducing corporate staffing levels and overall benefit costs. As a result, we're positioned to enter the post-pandemic world as a more agile and efficient company.
Our third priority is about continuing to be deliberate and strategic with how we allocate capital. We plan to use free cash flow after dividends for the next couple of years to pay down debt. We remain focused on monetizing noncore assets and using those funds for debt reduction as well. We're committed to sustaining our dividend at current levels, and we'll give top priority to debt reduction at this time.
In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made the last 2 quarters. Despite COVID-19 challenges, we're seeing growth where we want to see growth, and we're successfully redirecting our investments to support those areas. We have more work to do, but I'm confident we're on the right path.
Before I hand it over to John, I want to acknowledge that I'm sensitive to the reality that there's much going on in and around the business. I know inside AT&T, we're working hard to reposition the company. So I can imagine you're working equally hard to keep up with us. To that end, I want to let you know we plan to host a virtual investor event in the second half of the quarter, where our leadership team will provide more insight into our business plans, and we'll have a lot of time for discussion and your questions. Look for more to come on that soon.
With that, I'll turn it over to John to discuss the more detailed results from the quarter. John?"

Let me start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our fourth quarter subscriber metrics. Wireless subscriber growth was the best it's been in years. We had 1.2 million postpaid net adds, including 800,000 postpaid phon",1376,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 6 with a quick look at our fourth quarter subscriber metrics. Wireless subscriber growth was the best it's been in years. We had 1.2 million postpaid net adds, including 800,000 postpaid phones. Postpaid phone churn was the second lowest quarter on record, coming in at 0.76%.
Our fiber momentum also continues. We added more than 270,000 fiber subscribers in the quarter. HBO Max subscriber growth continues to outpace original estimates. We added nearly 7 million total subscribers for HBO Max and HBO in 2020 alone. The trend of premium video declines continues to improve. If you exclude the impact of Keep America Connected on third quarter net adds, our premium video net adds improved sequentially for the fifth quarter in a row.
Let's now look at our consolidated and segment results, starting with our financial summary on Slide 7. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.75. That included COVID impacts to revenues from lower television licensing and production, changes to the theatrical release slate and lower international roaming. Combined, COVID had an estimated $0.08 of EPS impact to fourth quarter, which we did include in our adjusted results.
We've made the decision to operate our broadband and legacy voice operations separate from our video business unit and have recast our Entertainment Group results accordingly. In conjunction with this change in operations, we have reassessed the book values of our video assets, including goodwill and other long-lived assets. As a result, we recorded a pretax noncash impairment of $15.5 billion.
Additionally, we adjusted for an actuarial loss to our benefit plans and a write-off of production and other content inventory at WarnerMedia, stemming from the continued shutdown of theaters and film releases going on HBO Max. We'll provide more information in our SEC filings and on our website and in our annual report.
Revenues were down from a year ago, with gains in mobility partially offsetting pressure from WarnerMedia and video, but revenues were up sequentially. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of about $200 million in revenue primarily in our Latin America segment.
Cash flows for the quarter and the year underscore our resilient customer base and liquidity. Cash from operations came in at $10.1 billion for the quarter and $43.1 billion for the year. Free cash flow was $7.7 billion for the quarter and $27.5 billion for 2020.
For the full year, our total dividend payout ratio was just under 55%. Gross capital investment was about $20 billion in 2020, and we continue to invest heavily in our growth areas even during a pandemic. In addition, we invested about $800 million in HBO Max in the fourth quarter and about $2.1 billion for the full year.
Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communications segment on Slide 8. Our Communications business showed revenue growth this quarter, thanks to a strong performance in mobility. We told you we intended to give our best customers our best prices and offers, and you are seeing the benefits of that logic. Strong subscriber gains and people moving to unlimited plans help drive service revenue growth in the quarter, even with continuing pressure in international roaming. More than 60% of our postpaid phone base is on an unlimited plan. 
Churn has been impressive. The last 2 quarters have been our lowest postpaid phone churn quarters on record. And for the full year, a remarkable 16 basis point improvement in postpaid phone churn. Our successful retention approach does require some upfront investment, but the lower churn levels and improved subscriber counts make this the right economic trade. 
As I mentioned, we have split the Entertainment Group into 2 reporting units, broadband and video, and a full reconciliation of the 2 units is in our support documents. But for comparative purposes, here are the trends in Entertainment Group the way you have been used to seeing them. We had our best AT&T Fiber fourth quarter net adds, even with more challenges associated with the pandemic. And penetration continues to grow. It's now at 34%. In our video unit, premium video losses were improved year-over-year, thanks to lower churn and our focus on high-value customers. We continue to drive ARPU growth in both video and IP broadband. In fact, premium video ARPU was up more than 5%. 
Our business wireline team continues to effectively manage the transition of the business and deliver solid results amidst the pandemic. Solid cost management is the key to delivering solid EBITDA all year long. 
Let's move to WarnerMedia and Latin America results, which are on Slide 9. WarnerMedia continues to be impacted by the pandemic as we've seen across that entire industry. We did see solid gains in subscription revenues, thanks to the rapid growth of HBO Max. We now have 41 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers and about 61 million worldwide as we prepare for the international launch of HBO Max later this year. And we now have more than 10 million customers who combine 1 or more of our connectivity products with HBO Max or HBO.
Advertising revenues also grew, driven by political advertising and CNN, which was #1 in all of cable viewership, not just news in the fourth quarter. Because of the pandemic, we introduced a unique 1-year plan in which Warner Bros. will continue to exhibit films theatrically worldwide while adding an exclusive 1-month access period on HBO Max, simultaneous with the film's domestic release. Our goal is to make the best of a very challenging situation for all involved. That includes filmmakers and talent, theater owners and most importantly, the moviegoing public.
Our Latin American operations continue to work to recover from the pandemic. We added more than 500,000 subscribers in Mexico and almost 50,000 subscribers in Vrio, helped in part by our over-the-top offering in Brazil. Latin America revenues continue to be challenged by FX, slow economies and COVID. Even with this, Mexico EBITDA improved year-over-year for the second quarter in a row, and Vrio continues to generate positive EBITDA and cash flow on a constant currency basis. 
Now let's go to Slide 11 for our 2021 guidance. Last year was a difficult year for us to forecast for obvious reasons. There remain uncertainties in 2021 with the rate and pace of recovery from the pandemic around the globe impacting media, travel and employment. 
Against that backdrop, our current outlook for 2021 is as follows. We expect consolidated revenue growth of about 1% with wireless service revenue growth of 2% and a gradual improvement in WarnerMedia's top line. As noted previously, we plan to reinvest all our savings from our transformation efforts to support our customer count momentum in our growth businesses. Combined with ongoing declines in our premium video segment, this could lead to adjusted EBITDA declining slightly in 2021 versus this year. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be stable with 2020. We expect gross capital investment in the $21 billion range and net CapEx of about $18 billion. The primary difference between the 2 is from vendor financing initiatives we have in place and anticipated FirstNet reimbursements.  
Free cash flow has been resilient for us even during the pandemic, and we expect that resiliency to continue in 2021 with a $26 billion range target for free cash flow. 
We'll also continue to focus on bringing down debt. As John mentioned, we expect to use free cash flow dollars after dividends to pay down debt. We continue to look for opportunities to monetize assets and apply those proceeds to paying down debt, including Crunchyroll, which we expect to close later this year. We do plan to provide an update on our leverage outlook and longer-term debt ratio target once the auction quiet period ends.
As 2020 showed us, things can change quickly. However, we are encouraged by our ability to adapt to those changes while driving increased customer counts, generating strong cash flows, investing in areas of strategic focus, all while maintaining a disciplined approach to our capital allocation and shareholder return strategies. As John mentioned, we plan to have a virtual analyst event later in the quarter to talk about this more. 
Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for Q&A."

On the macro side, the one thing we saw at the end of last year was the customers' willingness to pay. Our bad debts were really quite solid, quite positive trends, both on the consumer and the corporate side. So while we're not getting overly excited, it was a positive sense.
What we have built into our plans are, if you will, more of the kind of current environment for the next 6 months with some second half and really close to the fourth quarter pickup in pandemic relief activities. So we'll see more theatergoing probably in the fourth quarter than we did this year. We'll see some more travel, but in no way did we envision a hockey stick or any kind of dramatic increase. It's really much more of a general staying the course. There is some slight improvement but staying the course. 
Secondly, with -- the one thing I'd add though is the cash collections have been strong and have been resilient, feel really good about that. So that gives us some comfort.
Secondly, with regard to the CapEx, I'd say it this way. As you look at the kind of the gross capital being put in the ground, it's up $1 billion. There will be some changes in what we spent last year, i.e., I continue to expect the -- a little bit lighter on the video satellite-type side of the business because of the success of AT&T TV and our focus on churn reduction as opposed to gross heads. So there'll be some more money there.
I think you'll see us -- we've continued to spend money on wireless, but we're well into and well completed with the FirstNet build. So we'll have some ability to manage there.
The next piece though is we will see an increase in the fiber build and the opportunity to add some more sales opportunities to that inventory. I don't know, John, did I miss anything from your perspective?"

And I think the only other thing I would comment on relative to the wireless spend overall, the shift that's occurring, we put a tremendous amount of capacity out over the last several years in combination with a lot of the work we spoke to you about with the FirstNet upgrades. And there's a kind of a shift in mix going on within the wireless building.
We're now moving away from what I would call capacity that's on existing spectrum bands and starting to see ourselves prepped for possibly using other spectrum that may come into service at some point in time, et cetera. So we got a little bit of a dynamic going on in the shift that's in the overall wireless program."

And the teams are already out turning things up. 
We had the conversation last quarter. I don't want to repeat myself, but we shared with you that this build is a little bit different than when we initially started because we have wire centers that are already fiber-capable. The infrastructure is in place. We're going back in and picking up the next adjacent neighborhood or the next successive area. And as a result of that, the speed to get up and moving is not the lift that it was the first time we started ramping up on this. So we've got a little bit smoother dynamic around it than what you might think because of the increase in the fiber dynamic."

It's within the umbrella of AT&T, and the economics are there, so we feel good about it. But that's also in there.  
I would tell you, as you all know, the network infrastructure customer service like fiber is a long-term game, and we've gone through the process many times, feel very good about the long-term returns and the efforts. But yes, we're going to be spending some money as we did last year, to invest in that customer growth.  
You saw the 600,000 plus, 650,000-or-so net adds last 6 months. And we feel very good about that particularly when we look at the churn numbers, particularly when we look at the customer satisfaction, the NPS scores so completely or complete support the fact. But yes, there is some investment there. 
With regard to the AVOD, we are expecting to launch our international version of the HBO Max later this year as well as the AVOD. I'm not ready to give any dates. John, I don't know if you want to say anything more specific."

And I think I would point out equally as important is the Latin America launch of HBO Max that we've been working really hard on and will be an important driver for us on future growth and getting ourselves embedded into the international front on a unified platform and approach to things. So you should expect, as we get into the second quarter, there's going to be a lot of activity and change going on here.
One of the reasons we're kind of trying to pinpoint the exact date on it is, as you know, we've been working through pandemic-related production issues. And ramping that back up has been a pretty significant path. The team has done a remarkable job getting ourselves back into that business and working through the dynamics safely.
It puts a little bit of overhead on things in terms of speed of production and what we're able to do. And there's a bit of rework that goes on with trying to work around the limitations of a pandemic-based environment. As a result of that, we're still fighting through getting the pipeline, dropping the content at the right rate and pace that we wanted to. And the first quarter this year continues to be a bit of a stretch in that regard as we cycle back into production. 
Our expectations are that we start to hit our stride as we get into the second quarter, and it's really important as we put these new iterations of the product now that we have ourselves in a good position in terms of the content inventory. And so as we're kind of going hand-to-mouth on these right now, John, we'll be a little bit more discrete on when we announce what's coming out in exactly what month simply because it's just that tough and that much of a battle, literally show by show, to get this stuff done and get it into the funnel, and we're working hard to do that.  
And we hope we're past any of the unexpected dynamics, like the California closures that went on over the last several weeks that put a couple of twists and turns in the road, and we've got the worst behind us. But yes, I'm a little chased right now with everything on the pandemic. So I don't want to overpromise anything."

We're going to look at our promotion strategies and adjust them accordingly and determine what we need to do to continue to be in a position to maintain and grow share. And it's -- I think it's really important that we continue to have a growing business.  
There's -- the management team is focused on 2 things. We like the momentum. I think we'd like to be a little bit more efficient with the momentum. We've done some really good stuff and had some really good progress on self-funding a lot of what we've been doing in the market. But we're not self-funding all of it yet. 
And so our continued work on trying to manage the efficiency and effectiveness of this business so that we can be in a more aggressive posture in the market is something that this team is working on every quarter. And we've tried to be diligent and reasonable in our guidance to you and make sure that we have high confidence in what we share.
But what I'm turning back to the management team is a task that I'd say is more aggressive. And to the extent that this management team delivers, and they have been doing a remarkable job of doing that over the last several quarters, does that mean that, that's going to give us more room to do more in the market and continue to maintain a posture that I think is totally appropriate? Bringing in high-value customers, the right kind of customers we want. Going down the swim lanes that we set up for ourselves that we think we have a unique place to be, which is winning in the public sector with our FirstNet abilities, using our deep enterprise customer relationships to go deeper into the customer base with affinity programs, ensuring that we're getting the mass market with attractive offers like HBO Max and what's associated with that, that is -- it brought in a really attractive gross add pool and treating our embedded base well, that is the strategy. And we're going to continue to do that.  
I think you're seeing it, to be the industry leader in churn this quarter, I think we called it right. We said that we don't have customers that are upset about our network. They like it. We don't have customers that are upset about our service. They're satisfied with our service.
We have customers who are interested in finding new devices. We shared with you that we had a little bit more aging population on device longevity than the rest of the industry. We've been targeting how we do that. I think getting the new 30-year lease on life -- the 30-month lease on life with these customers -- I wish it was 30 years, it's in a very appropriate exchange for the franchise right now given everything we have in front of us."

That's all we're trying to tell you is that we understand that we would normally give that to you, that it would be appropriate. But because of the FCC rules, we can't.

And so that compare is going to be compared to, if you will, 2.5 months of international roaming. So that will be one set. 
The next 3 quarters will presumably be without the international roaming. So the numbers will be different. That's one, and I'd just say that to you. So I don't want to get into quarterly analysis. Because I just don't want to confuse things, we talk about the full year. 
Secondly, the real story on the service revenue is customer growth. And quite frankly, we talk about the 1.2 million of postpaid net adds, the 1.5 million of -- 1.2 million postpaid net adds last quarter, the 1.5 million of voice net adds mostly in the last 6 months, all of that. 
But the reality is, too, we have close to 16 million total wireless connection net adds during the quarter -- during the year when you include all connections. And we're seeing -- and we believe that our strategies, the ones John just talked about with treating our best customers with the best offers and things like that have the opportunity to win for us the best network and so forth. And so we're optimistic about the ability to continue to grow that customer base. That's what's driving the service revenues.
With regard to the ARPU growth, the continued opportunities go into the upscaling of these packages with a great opportunity to offer HBO Max, which has certainly got tailwinds behind it and the success of it. You saw the 7 million HBO adds, best we've had in not only 10 years, but the best in the total 10 years, better than the total last 10 years. That is going to -- we believe that, that kind of packaging with wireless is going to help and such that we're going to be able to grow it and then grow the ARPU from getting people to buy up not just from the mobile share plans into unlimited, but to buy up for the basic unlimited all the way up to the Elite. 
That's the story. We're not giving specific percentages, dollars, but that's what builds that confidence in wireless service revenue growth, which really drives the overall growth of the company's 1% guidance on revenue growth, that and some tailwinds from the comeback of WarnerMedia."

And what in the $26 billion of free cash flow guidance is coming from the satellite video business today? 
And then the second conversation, we've just finished the first month of the HBO Max experience with Wonder Woman commensurate with the theatrical release. And this is obviously going to happen like 11 more times over the course of 2021 as you kind of do the day, date thing with the movie slate. If we multiply what happened with Wonder Woman times 11 over the course of 2021, what does that look like for Warner Bros. from a revenue and profit standpoint relative to what maybe 2019 would have looked like in a more normal year?"

Obviously, what I'll say on that is we assume that we're running the business as we portrayed it to you. And we have been debating how we wanted to set up our operations for video for some time. And I think part of this, when we step back and think about why we made this change is we figure we're at a life cycle change in these products, that getting management teams focused in this way will be the best way to maximize value in the discrete product lines.
And so in the video case, we've seen a pretty dramatic change in what's occurring in the market. And there's a variety of things driving it. You all know about the declines in the pay TV life cycle. But we also have the dynamic that's starting to occur, which I think is a really important one to understand where we're starting to see pay TV disconnect a little bit from broadband as virtual MVPDs start up. Our own product itself, in many respects, has a virtual characteristic to it, and it's a fairly mature offering. 
And so getting the management team really focused on what to do in the latter stages of the life cycle of a mature product and ensuring that we manage it effectively, I think, is a wise thing to do for that product on a stand-alone basis. And that's one driver behind why we made that decision.
The second driver behind why we made this decision is I believe we're at the front end of a dynamic of customers wanting to ensure that they have connectivity and broadband access no matter where they go, and they want a simpler model around that. And I think about our business being in a very unique position for both businesses and consumers to deliver on that promise, and the innovation that's going to be necessary from a product perspective. And then pairing that with what are the new complementary products and services that customers might want to bundle or use with that connectivity I think is a new play, and that's a new growth for us.
And to get another part of the management team really focused on that aspect of our business is how we simplify unified connectivity for our customer base, whether a consumer or a business, whether fixed or mobile, starting to think about what those virtual-type add-ons are to that product that come with a very different delivery mechanism than what we've historically seen when we've been bundling what I would call these high overhead, premise-intensive visit-type services that we've traditionally had in the bundle. And playing to that is the strength and position for growth is the second part of why we want the management team set up the way we have it right now and focused on that going forward.
And that just makes sense for how we're operating the business because of the time and place and where we are. And we are absolutely comfortable that that's the right call for how to operate our business moving forward. And I will tell you, I'm not going to speculate on anything structural or M&A-oriented. We never do, and I'm not going to now. But I believe that what we're doing here is if the goal is to always run an asset for maximum value creation, this is the right strategy to run the asset for maximum value creation. John?"

So I think where we are is that there's a difference between a -- what I'll call a tentpole release and a nontentpole release. And Wonder Woman and the nature of that production value and what occurs in it is different than the balance of many of the other movies in our slate. We have other tentpole releases that occur throughout the 2021 release schedule. They are going to be equally as buzzworthy as Wonder Woman. And we have in between those other high-quality offerings that fill that in, that cater to maybe sometimes a less broad audience. And that's the power of doing what we did in bringing the entire slate out to our end user base. 
So we're going to see a little bit of spikiness in what occurs. And I don't think it's fair to say if we're going to put, call it, 17, 18, whatever, movies we ultimately settle on in the release structure for the year, we're not going to see the kind of subscriber spikes that maybe we saw in December and early January every time we put a movie out, but that really isn't the design and intent of the plan. 
We have -- but we do have an opportunity to build marketing and promotion opportunities around those bigger releases that have broader buzz and broader application across the customer base. And we're going to take every advantage of doing that, and we're going to work filling in the niche between it. 
This -- I think I want to stress. This is a unique year, and we did this as a unique year. And probably appropriate to make a comment that in some cases, I'll say maybe the dynamic of the media and the press was a little oversold or a little intense on both ends of the spectrum around this from my point of view. 
We told you when the team decided to make this move that we thought it was appropriate for this moment in time. And the team made the call, and I think it was a bold and aggressive swing. It was done with a lot of thought as to what needed to occur in the subscriber base and the balance of the value of the franchises between our theatrical and our streaming business. 
It was certainly nice to have a streaming business to present us this option of how we use this content. But part of that call was just built on the dynamic of what we thought the theatrical moviegoing audiences were going to look like in 2021. And since we articulated that, I would say the data points have come in that have been very consistent with the set of assumptions that we had at the front end of that.
I mean just the last several weeks, you've seen other studios continuing to snowplow releases, moving them out of the first half of the year, moving them into the second half of the year, which further cements our point of view that we're going to see a very crowded theatrical field as we get into late 2021 and early 2022. And we don't believe that magically just because there's more content showing up in theaters all at the same time that, that's going to dramatically increase the size of the moviegoing population at that time.
And so as we indicated by making the write-off, we felt like we had a little bit of a spoiling asset here that needed to be moved -- used more effectively. And this was the right economic call to balance this across both sides. And we think using it to balance out long-lived subscribers to build out a scaled platform that allow us to have options in our distribution and using this unfortunate set of circumstances around the pandemic for an opportunity, make lemonade out of lemons, was the right call in this case.
And I think we all have to understand, we step back and think about the theatrical business. I mean nobody went to theaters in 2020 for the most part. It was a pandemic. Just like nobody got on airplanes, and nobody went to hotels, and nobody goes to restaurants. And all of those businesses had a little bit of dislocation because of that, and the theatrical business had a little bit of dislocation. And I applaud the team for the move they made and trying to make the best of this circumstance, for our circumstance around having a really strong theatrical slate that can help our streaming product.
Could we have maybe done some things a little bit differently in how we got through the front end of it? Any time you're first in something, there's no map. You're a trailblazer. There's nothing perfect for you to read. And I think that there's -- there were some things on the margin that maybe we'd do a little bit differently. 
But at the end of the day, it's going to get down to making sure people are fairly compensated and treated well. And I think we know how to do that. I think we've been good to the theater owners in the perspective that the exhibitors now have a planned and routine set of releases coming to them at a time when they really, as we've talked about, have other studios snowplowing. 
I think in the end, this will ultimately shape up to be a good thing across the board as we get through the emotional aspects that are bound to be there in a high anxiety environment like the pandemic. And all things having been said with what we've seen in the front end of the numbers, what our experience has been, we are delivering on this in a way that we expected. It's pretty consistent with the value shifts that we expected and feel pretty good about where we are in the early innings of this. So John, why don't you go ahead and..."

More importantly, for everybody on the call, I think at the Analyst Day, we'll get the team. Jason and his team will get the opportunity to talk to you about some of the further plans and go through that.
Dave, your other question, I think, was with regard to the planning process. The guidance we've given here today, but for the exclusion of any commentary on C-band, is what we have as assets in our portfolio as of January 1 and owning them for the full year other than Crunchyroll, other than the already held-for-sale termination of Crunchyroll. 
And so yes, there is free cash flow in here from the video business. I won't give you a specific number on that, Dave. But you can assume based on the results of the business last year, it's probably going to be a lower number inclusive next year than it is this year for the changes in customer base and so forth. But it is a business as usual, what I would call kind of business planning approach. 
All that being said, feel really good about the free cash flow position. And particularly, as I mentioned in an earlier question, cash came in strong at the end of the year with regard to the fourth quarter, with regard to customer activity, both on the corporate business side as well as the consumer side. And you guys can see it in our bad debt, which are remarkably low.
Team did a really great job of weeding out fraud and weeding out -- and focusing on the best customers, and it's showing up in our numbers. So I think -- hopefully, that answers your question, David. Thanks for the earlier comment about my retirement. It will be a change, but it will be interesting."

It's obviously encouraging to see that you're going to be picking up the pace of the build-out this year. But even after building out 2 million additional homes passed, that would still be a small subset of the number of customer locations in your total wireline footprint. 
How do you think about what portion of that footprint, which I think has 60 million households in it, is potentially attractive in terms of being a great demo and having economics to reach them that generate a compelling return for you? In other words, for how long can you keep adding 2 million homes a year to your footprint? 
And am I even asking this question correctly because as you build out your 5G footprint, which is really a national 5G network using layers of spectrum across multiple bands, it would seem like wireless will increasingly be a viable technology for reaching households beyond your traditional footprint. How do you think about the fixed wireless opportunity? And maybe how do you just think about the ability to be a provider of high-speed residential broadband across the country?"

If I think",1013,"So Brett, the -- I'm going to sound like a broken record, but it's really important on these long-lived investments that we be pretty consistent internally, so that the management team can get to a consistent level of execution year-over-year. If I think about what has traditionally happened in outside plant access technology upgrades, I've been through a series of them over my career. And I don't think this one is going to be a whole lot different.
There's always the first 1/3 of the customer base that's kind of the low-hanging fruit, slam dunk, that is the part of the customer base that you cut your teeth on, get your processes squared away on, get the vendor community up the first part of the cost curve. And it's like the no-brainer economically, and you kind of make your decision that, that's where you're going to start. And I would say we went through that largely through that first 1/3 in the investment we've made over the last several years.
Then what happens is as you get your -- up the learning curve, and the vendors start to scale and you start to gain confidence in your economics and your business processes start to improve, and you start to see the marginal economics improve on the subscriber, which is what you're going to start to see happen on some of those broadband numbers on the fiber base that we've broken out for you. As we move forward here over time, the next 1/3 becomes the opportunity. And we're into that -- the middle innings of the game, if you want. It's the next 30% to 60% of the customer base that we can work our way through, and you look at the economics around it, it makes sense. 
Then you get into that last 1/3, and it's always the hardest part. And I mean in many instances, you're still sitting with the last 1/3 that, in parts of the rural America, that still really don't have effective broadband options. And oftentimes, it's policy. Sometimes it's a technology breakthrough that gets that last 1/3. 
And I would tell you right now, if you wanted me to prognosticate, are you going to build fiber to that last 1/3? I don't think I'd want to prognosticate that, that's a place that we're likely to go in the near term, absent some kind of major subsidy construct that comes into place. I actually believe, candidly, even if there was subsidy put in, it would be a better use of taxpayer money to do something that was more hybrid-oriented than the technologies that are applied and not exclusively lean on fiber in that space.
But we're several innings out from that actually coming to pass, and we'll have time to work through it. Right now, we're working in the middle innings of the game, and the next 30% of the customer base is where our focus is at. And as I shared with you on the previous call, it's 2 million this year. If the team executes well, we can do more than 2 million and start to ramp that up.
And when we demonstrate to the investor base that we're getting the kind of returns that you all like, then you should cheer us on to do that and be very supportive of us moving down that path. And it's my intent to characterize that and show that to you. 
In terms of how I think about the wireless and fixed base, I've got maybe a little different view on this, and I'll maybe step back and think about it from a macro level. If you go back and you look at consumption that's occurred in customer bases, whether it be wireless-centric, data use or fixed-centric data use, they've all been growing. And they grow at a pretty consistent level.
And if you go and you talk to experts around consumer behavior over the next 10 years and you look at what's going on inside the household of -- for example, just one major trend of people moving away from what used to be broadcast or multicast streams efficiently delivered to unicast streams, discrete streams to one device. And you just look at what's happening in consumer behavior over that, there is a substantial amount of video traffic to be moved to unicast. It's going to drive up a massive amount of consumption. 
And this ratio between mobile and fixed consumption has been about 10:1 for many years. This is not new. And I got to -- I believe that, that ratio, it may not be perfectly 10:1, but there's still going to be a pretty consistent gap between mobile and fixed consumption. In other words, there's still a lot of traffic to be moved, given consumer shifts and how they're using products and services.
And so as I sit back and think about things, I think about hybrid access technologies as being important. But I don't know that the most ideal way to build a network is going to be to use fixed wireless to take on the bulk of what occurs in the 4 walls of a business or a home, given the consumer behavior trends we're going to see over the next 10 years. And I think still having a very dense and rich fiber infrastructure is going to be necessary to be an effective network provider over time. 
Now it doesn't mean there won't be some segments of the population -- and my son, who lives on his own in an apartment in a metro urban area that might actually be an individual that could work on an all-wireless portion of his life in his 20s when he's independent and single and in a single-dwelling unit household. And maybe that's a little bit different surrogate arrangement that has a wireless tail on it or is a robust wireless LAN inside of a managed dwelling unit. But I still think reach and penetration of fiber is going to be important as we move forward."

Just what John said about building out the 2 million this year, that's where a lot of the focus is going to be.
So I think of that as the way to think about the opportunity for us. And yes, we have that ability. We need to continue the sales momentum. That's going to be really critically important to make it work. But in line with that, that's, I think, a focus of easy capability for us."

Look, I think it's inevitable that we're now back into the wood-saw approach of a new administration. And a new belief that despite 4 years of not a single data point to suggest that we have a problem to solve, nobody blocking anybody, nobody throttling anybody, nobody bought -- doing anything inappropriate in terms of use of service and disclosing how they're offering services to customers, we're going to go through another regulatory bloodletting over this. I expect it to happen, and we're going to watch the cycle repeat itself. 
And one would hope at some point that there's a recent discussion around a policy that gets us away from this web sign and allows everybody to kind of have a more consistent and stable approach. I don't know that, that's going to happen, but we're certainly going to try and push and discuss it.
Where I think the third rail is on this issue is the dynamic around what happens to the freedom of people who invest in competitive markets to price their products and services appropriately. And if we stay away from that third rail, if the kind of latitude is in there to be able to price and do the right things in the market where competitive markets exist, then I think everything will probably, at the end of the day, be okay.
But if for some reason, policy goes down a path where that isn't the case -- it hasn't in the past even when Title II is in place. We had the latitude to do what I felt like we needed to do. But if, for some reason, policy went further to try to solve a problem that doesn't exist, I have to step back and ask ourselves how we're allocating capital around that and evaluate where that comes out and ask if it's the right place for us to go for our shareholders based on that dynamic and that very important lever for us being taken away so -- or variable, I'd say, in the market, not lever. 
So that's how I think about it right now. I actually step back and -- from a policy perspective, ironically, think about what's happened over the course of the last year or 2 and the dynamics that are going on right now where the issue is looking at metering and monitoring speech and what's occurring for people to access the platforms, that -- there are more real and significant data points in how that's affecting society than anything to do with how Internet service providers are delivering bandwidth in the homes. But I'll leave it to smarter people to meet and figure that one out."

And I think about that broadly as, while today, we talk about it as an SVOD evolving to an AVOD offer. I've mentioned this before, I view it as a really important foundation for broader customer relationships. I mean this is the first big foray of maybe legacy AT&T thinking about having broader relationships with the customer base at a relatively low price point SKU that isn't exclusively dependent on infrastructure. 
And to the extent we are successful at having that relationship with most U.S. households, if we don't use that as an opportunity, as a springboard for us to start thinking about how we extend those customer relationships across other opportunities either to own and operate content or engagement with a customer or to use the platform as a means for others to distribute, we'd be losing a huge opportunity. 
And so I think, well, there's all kinds of things we want to do around the edge and making sure that we work with the right hyperscalers to virtualize and give our customers the opportunity to gain access into infrastructure so that they can run their compute environments and their application environments effectively. That's all important, and that's all meat-and-potato stuff we need to do on a network. 
But I think about owning some degree of engagement with the customer, a relationship, a means to build with them, having them interact with your service so that you have insights as to who they are, what they like, what they do, what their proclivities are, being able to emotionally attach with them, having a software platform that allows you to build the next building block of a product that extends into engagement, that talks about dynamics of changing consumption in social and interactive, I think this is a really important dynamic for the health of our business. And I know it's longer term in nature. And I'm well aware of the folks who have maybe a tighter orientation to the financial return question. Why would you be pushing as hard as you are in this area? It's because I feel pretty strongly about that. 
And I think building large subscription bases of customers that pay us every month for something has been kind of the hallmark of this business. We have a really attractive dynamic in that in our overall revenues and profitability today. We need to evolve that into what the next step is, and this is just one of those steps in making that happen."

It's been about 6 weeks since our analyst and Investor Day. So the framework for what we'll cover today will be familiar to you. We have a consistent, deliberate and clear approach to the way we run our business",683,"Thanks, Amir, and good morning, everyone. It's been about 6 weeks since our analyst and Investor Day. So the framework for what we'll cover today will be familiar to you. 
We have a consistent, deliberate and clear approach to the way we run our business. From our market focus areas to our 2021 priority to grow customer relationships, with most U.S. households across these market focus areas, to our capital allocation plans. As you see in our quarterly results, our execution has been sharp, and we have momentum. We continue to grow our customer relationships with strong subscriber growth in Mobility, AT&T Fiber and HBO Max. We also continued to invest both in capital spending and in content. Our ability to drive costs out of our business and deliver strong cash flows has allowed us to invest in strategic growth. 
However, as you can see from the results, we're investing wisely. We've been deliberate and intentional in allocating dollars where they generate returns. This supports the future of our business while also optimizing the returns on strategic opportunities across our portfolio. 
For example, cost transformation efforts in Mobility yield improved year-over-year profits, while we simultaneously invested to drive customer growth. Same at WarnerMedia, where EBITDA was down slightly even with significant increased investment in HBO Max. The restructuring and consolidation of our WarnerMedia business is driving cost savings in our studio operations, networks, sales force and technology. 
Our transformation initiatives across the company are driving efficiencies and freeing up capital to invest in our growth areas, and there is more opportunity ahead of us. 
Our deliberate capital allocation plan allowed us to invest and sustain our dividend at current levels, which we believe is attractive. We're prioritizing cash after dividends to reduce debt. And we continue to monetize noncore assets as we refine our overall business focus, as you saw us do in the quarter, with our announced sale of a controlling interest in DIRECTV and our other video assets. 
Let's look at the progress we made in delivering on our market focus areas on Slide 4. Our customer growth was impressive across Mobility, Fiber and HBO Max, and we're doing it the right way with a focus on growing profitability. 
In Mobility, we added nearly 600,000 postpaid phones in the quarter, our best net add first quarter in more than 10 years. Our subscriber momentum is strong, and we're taking share. Gross adds are up, and our average promotional spend per net add is significantly lower than a year ago. Our transformation program is enabling us to be competitive. At the same time, we're benefiting from a simplified go-to-market strategy and optimized sales and distribution channels. 
Mobility EBITDA was up more than 2%, and service margins increased 100 basis points despite a 2020 first quarter compare where roaming revenues were largely unimpacted. You put it all together, and I believe this demonstrates the formula works. 
AT&T Fiber net adds were strong and penetration levels continue to expand. We've added more than 1 million fiber subscribers in the last 4 quarters. 
IP broadband revenues grew nearly 5% in the quarter, and we're on pace to build out fiber to another 3 million consumer and business customer locations this year. 
HBO Max continues to deliver strong subscriber gains, fueled by the success of our [ day in date ] theatrical strategy and our steadily strengthening post-COVID content slate. 
In the U.S., we've added more than 11 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers in the last 12 months. It's a premium offer with a premium ARPU compared to other streaming platforms. 
And subscription revenues in the first quarter grew about 35% globally for WarnerMedia's Direct-to-Consumer business. 
And we're on track to launch HBO Max internationally and introduce an AVOD product in June. 
Across the board, we're encouraged by our momentum and how our management team is executing against our singular priority to grow customer relationships in our market focus areas. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pascal to discuss the specifics of our first quarter results. Pascal, welcome, and the floor is yours."

Let's begin with our consolidated results on Slide 6. We started the year with growing revenues, earnings and cash flows. Revenues were up from a year ago, with gains in Mobility and WarnerMedia  more than of",1024,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results on Slide 6. 
We started the year with growing revenues, earnings and cash flows. Revenues were up from a year ago, with gains in Mobility and WarnerMedia  more than offsetting declines from video, legacy services and FX. As a reminder, our Communications segment has been recast to exclude our video business. 
For the quarter, Communications EBITDA was essentially flat with the prior year. That demonstrates a marked improvement from the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.86. That's up more than 2% year-over-year. 
We also had a good start to the year with our cash flows. Cash from operations came in at $9.9 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.9 billion, with higher sales of receivables, lower CapEx and interest. 
Our dividend payout ratio was about 63%. CapEx was $4 billion. Gross capital investment was $5.7 billion. 
In addition, WarnerMedia's total cash content investment across all their business this quarter was $4.5 billion, slightly higher than last year. 
As we indicated at our Analyst Day, we are investing in our market focus areas and we're seeing further validation of our strategy in the first quarter results. Therefore, we edged up our gross capital investment expectations to the $22 billion range for the year. Additionally, we increased our expected vendor financing payments given our ability to negotiate favorable terms. 
Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communications segment on Slide 7. Mobility continues to lead the way in our Communications business. We saw a strong customer growth in our postpaid phone base, growing service revenues, growing EBITDA with expanding EBITDA service margin and that's with continued headwinds facing our high-margin international roaming business that we estimate cost us about $100 million in EBITDA this quarter. 
Our simple direct postpaid phone offers continue to resonate with customers. And as John mentioned, our Mobility gross add share is increasing and postpaid phone churn has stayed near record low levels. 
Cost transformation continues to be a big part of the story for Mobility. Our more efficient sales processes and streamlined operations are driving down costs. In fact, our average promotional spend per net adds is significantly lower than a year ago. 
Our cost efforts are also evident in Business Wireline. Cost management has helped expand EBITDA margins as customers transition away from higher-margin legacy services and products. But the product simplification and the resulting cost savings have been key to delivering solid EBITDA. 
Consumer Wireline is another business in transition. We are moving quickly to expand our fiber footprint, and our results show you why that is crucial. 
We added 235,000 AT&T Fiber customers in the quarter. IP broadband ARPU grew 3.2% year-over-year. Our Fiber penetration rate is more than 35% and growing. And total broadband net adds also increased. We expect this to be the trough in terms of year-over-year EBITDA growth. We expect trends to improve from here, driven by IP broadband revenue growth in the mid-single digits for the year. 
Let's move on to WarnerMedia, which is on Slide 8. WarnerMedia results are the first half of what we expect will be a transformational year for the business. Revenues were up nearly 10%. Higher Direct-to-Consumer and advertising revenues drove the growth. And even with higher customer acquisition and content costs associated with HBO Max and higher sports costs, EBITDA was down only slightly. 
Advertising revenues were up more than 18%, driven by return of sports, especially the NCAA championship men's basketball tournament. 
Direct-to-Consumer subscription revenues grew about 35%, reflecting the success of HBO Max. We now have 44.2 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers and nearly 64 million worldwide subscribers. Average monthly revenue per domestic customer is just a little less than $12. And now we have 11 million customers who combine one or more connectivity products with HBO Max or HBO. 
The same-day release of movies in theaters and on HBO Max has been a success. It has provided theaters with a steady flow of content in a pandemic-challenged environment. And it's also been a great catalyst for subscriber growth at HBO Max. 
The success of Godzilla vs Kong at both the box office and on HBO Max bears this out. It had the largest domestic box office of any other movie in the last year while also having the largest viewing audience of any other film or show on HBO Max since launch. And films such as Godzilla vs Kong attract new retail customers who are staying because they enjoy other content on the platform. 
We're really looking forward to the introduction of our international AVOD products planned for HBO Max later in June. We plan to have attractive price points for our AVOD offering, and we expect to lean into our international launch, reaching 60 additional markets by the end of the year. Our aim is to use our differentiated premium content offering to attract global customers. 
Now let's go to Slide 9 for an update on our capital allocation and liquidity. We made our $23 billion C-band spectrum payment since we last talked to you in March. That drove net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 3.1x. We expect this will be our peak leverage level. 
We're still on track to have a sizable reduction in debt by year-end through a combination of strong free cash flows and proceeds from asset monetization. We'll continue to focus on debt reduction. We expect our net debt to adjusted EBITDA to be around 3x by year-end. 
We also continue to actively evaluate other asset monetization opportunities. Our treasury team has also been working tirelessly to lower our cost of debt. Our weighted average cost of debt is down 50 basis points year-over-year, driving about $150 million in lower interest costs in the first quarter. Our weighted average maturity for debt is 16 years at a weighted average cost of 3.8%. About 90% of our debt is at a fixed rate. So we feel we're well protected in an increasing interest rate environment. 
Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A."

So we have combined technology organization, sales function, content production studios.

Could you talk a little bit about kind of what you're seeing on the ground relative to your expectations and how the recent price changes in the Fiber business factor into that game plan? 
And then I guess the second question for Pascal. You effectively lowered your CapEx guidance by boosting your plan to take advantage of vendor financing, but you kept the free cash flow guidance the same, implying lower operating cash flow from a quarter ago. Could you elaborate a little bit on how we kind of square that change in the guidance with what looks like relatively strong performance this quarter?"

And typically, as you know, this is the low watermark for free cash flow delivery. And so we're really pleased with how the business is performing and the customer momentum. 
Rest assured, you should not read into this any more than it is. When we looked at our projections for capital spend, we thought it was appropriate to increase it. But we didn't think at this time of the year, given how early it is, it was appropriate to start to change guidance. We want to maintain some flexibility, but we are really comfortable with our free cash flow guidance, and it has not changed in any way as a result of the change that we've made to CapEx. So there's really nothing more to it than that."

And I'd tell you, Dave, just to kind of maybe put a finer point on what Pascal said. One of the things I'm trying to impress upon with the management team is we want to do things the right way and we want to do things in a sustainable way. And I had",596,"Yes. And I'd tell you, Dave, just to kind of maybe put a finer point on what Pascal said. One of the things I'm trying to impress upon with the management team is we want to do things the right way and we want to do things in a sustainable way. And I had probably a little bit of a cultural shift. We have a very process-driven organization that's very focused on delivering what we ask them to do, and that's a great strength. But sometimes, that means that people are very literal about looking at a number and saying, I will get you that number and maybe don't raise a point that says, if you give me a little bit of flexibility, I could do something a lot more efficiently or effectively for the next 2 years. And I'm really trying hard with the management team to help them understand they have the latitude to do the right thing for the long haul. And that while we want some consistency in how we run the business, there's a limit to doing that with de minimis returns or diminishing returns. 
And so with that, I got to back up what I say to folks. And when they come in and they have compelling ways to think about how we should build or go about deploying, I need to be responsive in ensuring that I give them the latitude to do that. And given the number of things we have underway that we're scaling, including Fiber build, as you asked the question of what we're doing around starting to roll into 5G deployment, et cetera, making sure that we get that latitude in there is really important to me. And I think it's important to supporting them. 
And what I'm seeing on the early days of -- I won't even call it the early days, what I know about our base on our Fiber deployment and what we know about the incremental work is it's, from an operational perspective and a market perspective, all green lights. That's one of the reasons why I'm really comfortable in letting the team run in the way that we're letting them run. 
And I like what I see in terms of our market position. If you look at things like customer lives, churn, customer satisfaction and Net Promoter Scores, and the actual performance of the product, they're all great. And when you start looking at that, you know there's going to be goodness. 
And I told you this before, I've not seen share movement on typical products like this as rapidly as we're able to get share movement once we deploy an area. And I frankly have never seen customer satisfaction levels move up and get to a promoting position in the market as we transition the product as fast as we're seeing. I think both of those things bode really well. 
And as you heard Pascal talk about the opening remarks, we think we're at kind of the bottom of our EBITDA compare. A lot of that is actually being driven by our strategy to start attaching content to broadband. That's been really good in terms of driving those customer lives up. It's driving churn down. It's driving engagement and satisfaction levels higher. We're going to get the benefit of that over the customer life cycle. And as we start to lap that, you're going to start to see our EBITDA dynamics start to creep back up to where we want them. So I feel really good across the board."

Now even within -- without changing the pace and rate of where we are on C-band deployment, which will begin turning markets up late this year, that doesn't mean that in things that we're doing today that can help the 2022 build that we wouldn't make some decisions on -- on deployment. And that is an aspect of some of this -- the capital dynamic we described, but it's not the aspect. There are a variety of things that are playing into it. That's one of several. 
And so as we time certain things, the aggregate amount may be the same, but there's things that we can do today, is we're touching towers and doing things and parts of the infrastructure that, for example, maybe aren't going to be in service until later in '22 that we could do a little more efficiently to preprovision some things and not go back and touch them a second time. So some of that ordering is a dynamic that we're trying to drive through. 
As I've told you, I don't expect that there's going to be any change right now on our deployment plans and the growth from the guidance that we gave you 5 weeks ago. We'll see as we get into this a little bit deeper. As usual, we're in that cycle where technology is relatively new. Vendors have commitments. We're waiting on specific units. Global supply chains are stressed right now across the board. And you asked the question and you do the work and people will give you comfortable answers. But I'm a little skittish. I mean we're seeing dynamics that are occurring in the global supply chain where unexpected things are popping up. And is it possible that we could see certain element shortages that start to crop up as everybody is racing to put stuff up on towers in May. And that's why I want to be a little bit cautious around guiding up or doing anything different until we get a little bit of momentum around that. 
In terms of where we are on the 3.45 end-of-year DoD auction, look, I believe that there could be an opportunity there. We're going to watch it carefully. We've always participated in any spectrum auction that comes forward or looked at it and said does it make sense for the portfolio. And we can see some things that if the valuations are sound valuations, that makes sens for our business, I will tell you in the guidance we've provided you over the next several years, we have plugged in an expectation that we will be in spectrum markets, as we guide down to our 2.5 debt-to-EBITDA level that we projected for you in '24. And so I expect within that plan, we're going to be looking at it and saying, do we like the valuations? And does it make sense? And we do believe some of that spectrum could fit into our network portfolio and be helpful to us down the road if the auction is done in the way we think it's going to be done."

I don't want to get into kind of every 5-week update on those numbers. I think we gave you a good sense of what's happening in our satisfaction that we're well up over 2 hours per day per account. And I think that's a really good place to be, and it certainly is probably higher than our engineered expectations when we launched the product and we'll take that goodness. 
The behaviors of what customers are doing, really, I don't think are dramatically different than what you would see on any other SVOD service. As Pascal mentioned, we clearly have a good reason for them to come in. And we're seeing in the customer data that many are opting to come in because of theatrical slate opportunity. And credit to the team, they've done a remarkable job, not only of engineering that strategy and executing it, carrying it through and it's playing out exactly as we kind of laid out for you and we said we wanted to do it in terms of the mix. We've got more of the year to get through to see what that balance is between theatrical revenues versus SVOD. But when you look at the customer growth on SVOD and you see some of the early data coming back on -- on movies like Kong vs Godzilla in the theater, I think you can all see that there's probably a pretty compelling rising tide lifting all boats in this case. And we feel it's the right call for the moment we were in with the pandemic and really comfortable about that and that drives customer exploration of the product. And once they come in, they do what they do with any other SVOD service. They go to our high-value series. So any of the new scripted series content that we have out there, HBO Originals, HBO Max Originals, they go for the high-profile ones and they start to engage on those. And then guess what else they do? They dig deeper into the library. And there's workhorses in the library, depending on the demographic of the individual, that tends to sustain them around. And because of the good job of marketing the slate for the movies, I think what we're seeing is evidence that they say, well, gosh, I'm now into it 2, 3 weeks, and I know there's another one coming next month that I want to see. I'm sticking around. And so our churn expectations have been consistent with what we expected moving in. 
And so I think it's just the classic approach to managing any SVOD service, although we're playing to our strengths and how we're tiering the content. And we're using theatrical maybe a little bit more heavily than other services might use because that's one of our strong suits, and it always has been with the strength of HBO and the theatrical slate that HBO offered in the core product. 
On the wireless side, I've said this before, I don't want to sound like a broken record, but part of our strength is that we're really able to cover the waterfront on some of the verticals in our distribution strategy. And in particular, we've been particularly strong in using our enterprise business and our business sales force in not only selling into business segments, but ensuring that affinity plans in those areas can reach customers and their families at home for being part of that business that we sell to. 
The strength of FirstNet, which has opened up a vertical that we were under-indexed in and share, and we're seeing really attractive share growth. And again, there's an affinity characteristic that occurs within that vertical. It's not only an affinity characteristic among coworkers. But we've managed to ensure that if somebody chooses to come on for the purpose of their work as a first responder, that they have a lot of incentives to maybe drag their family through that experience with attractive pricing and approach. 
We continue to be strong in our traditional verticals with our iOS-centric customer base, which tends to scale what I would call the better part of the postpaid market. And we haven't lost any edge there. In fact, we've been a little bit stronger. 
And I would tell you, I think we still have room to run. I think we're probably under-indexed in a couple of verticals, especially if we start looking at the Hispanic community, that we can do a little bit better in and how we position our brand and our product, and the team is focusing on those areas. 
So my point of view right now is our momentum is continuing. We're doing better, as you can see from the results. We still have a couple of cards to play to try and sustain that. We've been very consistent in the market with a repetitive offer quarter after quarter. 
You're correct, we have seen our competitors continue to try to compete aggressively. They're mixing and changing their offers pretty frequently. We seem to be very consistent and very stable. And that's a really good place for us to be, and we're going to continue to play our game."

And as you know, we, for market reasons, haven't entirely disclosed everything like pricing, et cetera. And we'll of course do that right before the launch so that we get the maximum benefit of coming into the market. 
Look, I think that there is a segment of the base, and this is particularly true when there are multiple streaming services out there and people are making decisions to reorder their investment in in-home entertainment, that are going to be more price-sensitive. And while we believe HBO Max without commercial interruption as a premium product and warrants what we charge in the market today, we know that, that premium in some cases is high enough that there are people, when they start to say, well, I've got 3 services and I aggregate everything out that maybe I won't make a choice to be in it. And that's particularly true if you look at maybe some younger demographics. And as a result of that, we believe getting the price point down where, for them to get some well-executed advertising, they would look at the product and service and stay within the portfolio streaming services that they may wish to have in their household or in their apartment, that they think that this is a good place to be. 
Another example will be in certain socioeconomic dynamics. So you can expect, for example, we believe the AVOD product actually pairs well with some of our prepaid offers and how we might position it because it tends to line up on a more price-sensitive socioeconomic dynamic. And we think that opens up marketing channel and awareness channel and ultimately an opportunity to drive penetration in other places where, again, customers are a bit more price-sensitive. 
So really, at the end of the day, a customer gets to make a choice. And there's no question if you give a lower price point, you're going to push it down lower and the demos that will ultimately subscribe to it. And I think that's more important as people are making portfolio decisions of multiple services in the household. 
And when you see the reality of an ebb and flow on a Direct-to-Consumer offering, where maybe you hit that period of time where you're not as enamored with the offering that we have on the new content that's in place, having that option to be at a lower price point allows somebody to stick with the service. And we just think it's a really smart place to be for that segment of the market. 
In terms of the channels, what we've been -- I think it's really an important point that you bring up, and I want to stress this. We've been really, really careful about our channel partners. At the end of the day, a Direct-to-Consumer business should be a Direct-to-Consumer business. It should be a business that we have the opportunity to have a direct relationship with the customer, market and sell to them and work with them in the way that we feel is appropriate. 
And so where, in some cases, we were criticized for taking a long time to get certain agreements worked out, you should understand that we were doing that under the principle of we refused to back off on the notion, that we wanted to make sure that our distribution and the way we offered the product was something that we ultimately had the ability to talk to our customers and to bill our customers and make sure that we can manage the life cycle of our customers over time and do these migrations easily and not allow somebody else between us and the user interface of the customer. And not all launches of streaming products have done that and done it in that same fashion. 
And so we've been a little bit more dependent on our owned and operated channels. We've been, I believe, respectful and balanced with our existing distribution partners, where we've certainly consented to their rights to be able to bundle and sell the product, where we can make sure that we manage the customer experience and the user interface as the customer is inside the product. And that we can appropriately inform them and guide them to the right kind of content and have the kind of relationship with them that we should have as a direct owner of that product or service. 
And so you're going to see us use, for example, our own prepaid channels. But you're not going to see us dramatically change our distribution strategy, where just to get volume, we're turning over control and exercise rights of how the product or service is being used. 
We're in discussions with our existing distributors. We intend to make it available to them under very similar constructs to what we did in economic incentives with the subscription product if they choose to do that. And if they choose to carry it forward and it's done in the way that we think is the right balance for our ability to manage that customer, we'll extend it to them. If not, we'll be moving it largely through our owned and operated channels if that's what's required."

The infrastructure bill  -- euphemistically speaking, the infrastructure bill's a little bit of a large, amorphous thing right now. And I think we're in very much the early innings of shaping what it's going to be. I don't pretend that I've got any great insight, that I can predict how the political process will play it out, but I'll give you my opinion on it. 
My opinion is that it will go through some changes. I think, in aggregate, the size of it will probably be different than what it was proposed to be. My sense is that there's enough support on both sides of the aisle that both would like to see broadband spending. If it's a bipartisan approach, I think it would still survive a bipartisan approach. If it ends up not being a bipartisan bill, I think it will still survive not being a bipartisan bill. If you think about how it's executed, I think the White House made a couple of broad statements in the announcement of the policy that were starters. I think you've heard the President say himself that he's open for discussion on things. And I know there's a lot of dialogue going on. 
My sense with that dialogue is that there are members of Congress on both sides of the aisle that maybe have somewhat different views as to how the policy should be executed than what was, at a very high level, laid out in the bill with some suggestion. I don't think it was all that specific. And I think we're actively involved in that discussion right now, talking about our learnings and our understandings of what we think good policy would be. If, in fact, the government chooses to put some subsidy in place around that and some incentives in place, we think it should probably get to a different place than the rough framework that the White House put in place. And we think that there is support on both sides of the aisle and other policy aisles of this administration to try to drive it that way. 
I believe some of the things were frankly not characterized properly. I think when you get underneath the facts of how broadband infrastructure is deployed in the United States today, what occurs when there's 2 players in the market that are offering both capable and robust networks, what the price performance characteristics of the product are, I think vast parts the U.S. broadband market are actually performing incredibly well. 
I think we have an issue that needs to be dealt with on certain degrees of low-income subsidy. Interestingly, voluntarily, several of us in the market, including AT&T, has a voluntary low-income offer that's out there, that it's hard to imagine that a $10 offer, in my view, would be a monopolistic pricing offer. It seems to me that that's a pretty gracious and attractive offer. And if there were the right subsidies put on it, that, that  could be a pretty effective tool of putting more fixed broadband into people's homes. 
I do believe we have some rural areas that the bill needs to deal with, that if the policy is done right on a technology-agnostic way, that we can participate in and grow in. And that clearly is going to take some additional discussion and policy formation to get it into that place. We're in the early innings of it. We're active in it. I think it's going to be something, at the end of the day, like any political process, that there'll be a middle ground that will come up with some opportunity, but probably not everything we'd like. But we'll be active and aggressive in the places that we can go. 
The good news is in the guidance that we've given you, in the core of our business, we have a lot of opportunity for growth in broadband. This would be icing on the cake if we were able to make some headway there. I think we can move forward without this policy to deliver to you what we said we were going to deliver. 
We've been working with the SEC on the -- how the subsidy gets placed out. We've been talking with them about the approach to it. My sense is that they've got their arms around it. They understand how to administer these programs. They are going to do it in a way that I think it will help some of our customers. 
Again, we've got great offers out in the market for low-income customers. In some cases, there's income stress that maybe don't qualify as low income. The SEC plan will help the income stressed, but it will particularly help low income. And that, coupled with the offers we have in the market, I think should be generally helpful moving forward. 
I think we're probably at a peak right now at need. As people return to schools in person, I think there's going to be a little bit of pressure taken off this dynamic moving forward. 
But again, we weren't banking on a lot of government subsidy in the guide we've given you on our our direction. So if it breaks the right way, it will be a good thing for us."

Because that's been a big focus for you guys for a long time. Just wondering if the approach has some room to change. 
And secondly, on the wireless side, when you think about the margins this quarter, I mean, they were obviously pretty good in the context of some of the promotions you guys have run.

I'm always looking for good thoughts on what might be effective in the market. But I will tell you, we've had really good success at pairing our wireless services with our broadband customers. And I will tell you, it's one of the areas  of, frankly, over the last couple of months, really pleased with the team's execution and how we've been working that data set and that customer base to put the right attractive offers in place, and one of those things where because we have a relationship with the customer, we can maybe do some things a little bit differently in the market and how we position what those incentives are for them to put 2 products together than what you might do in a mass market channel nationally, and we feel that, that's a a pretty attractive place for us to go. 
And I mentioned we're having really good success bundling our entertainment Direct-to-Consumer product with broadband and we're seeing really high marks from customers in doing that. That feels really good. That feels to me like a  new version of pay TV with broadband. It feels like a forward-leaning entertainment product and service coupled with broadband, where we know that when we bundle, we drive churn down. Our success has been really strong on that. We've leaned in on that. We're seeing customers receive it really well. But it is really, really good on customer profitability and asset lives when they make that wireless coupling decision. 
I'm not going to kind of say too much, but we believe there are some further customer relations on service integration. We can do between wireless and broadband that makes some things even more attractive moving forward for that customer base. Our product road map, as we move into 2022, starts to introduce some of those and it goes right at the heart of what you're suggesting. And I absolutely believe that will be a winning play. 
But I don't want to oversell it because right now our broadband footprint, as you know, doesn't cover the entire United States. And we do need to be successful in marketing and selling in the entire United States in our wireless business to be successful. 
Why are we doing better on promotional unit costs and dynamics? Consistency of execution is one, as we've not had to change our approach to the market and change our messaging to customers and go to what I would call the expensive approach to on again, off again, on again, off again. Those things cause you to do things like try to retrain salespeople. You have to put incentives and SPIFs in place to get their attention to move through. 
I will tell you, we are operating through our distribution channels in an incredibly consistent fashion, in a way that I look at the numbers and I take great pride to what the team's executed and what they're doing. And it looks like sound management, looks like we're doing the right things and doing them better. 
And when we get the customer in with the right consistent offer, our trusted sales advisers are doing what you would expect trusted sales advisers to do. They're guiding the customer to the right product and service that meets their needs. And sometimes, that product and service and that solution isn't exactly the thing that the customer was motivated to come and explore. And oftentimes, it's a good outcome for our business when that occurs, and that might be a buy up on an unlimited plan to higher rates that allow us to drive ARPU up. It might be bundling another product and service with them. And we're getting the goodness that comes along with that consistent message. It causes customers to explore with us instead of maybe their first inclination, which might have been to go and explore with the competitor and move their service. And that's why the churn levels are so much lower. 
So we're getting really good lift from our promotional spend. We're getting really good performance when you look at how we're managing the device recovery life cycle. It's all good and it's all helping. 
And when you're not driving the volume that we had driven in the past, when we're down at those low gross add levels, guess what, your unit costs are higher per gross add. When you're operating at the levels that we're operating at right now, you get some scale benefits to it. 
So it just -- it all comes together in a way that's really goodness, and that's what you're seeing work through the numbers."

And then secondly, Pascal, as it relates to the guidance, after such a strong quarter, the revenue growth guidance of plus 1% seems pretty conservative as does the EPS expectation that it's flat.

We're not pleased with our performance in places where we don't have fiber, which is why I need additional footprint and why we're headed that direction. But we're incredibly pleased with our ability to compete where we do have it, and it's been pretty consistent in terms of the competitive dynamics around that. In fact, I think we're doing some things right now that are improving our performance overall because our focus in the market and how we're thinking about the integrated customer experience and really what we're now starting to do took us maybe a little too long to get there, but we're thinking beyond the inside of the house is the way I would think about it. We've always built really good networks. And we do a really good job of ensuring that they're consistent, reliable and work well. But the inside of the house is a bit of a a dirty place right now from a data perspective, and it's getting dirtier by the day as customers do more and more, add more devices. And we're now starting to work really hard on how our product and service can help the customer inside the house. That's the result of making our product look more consistent, more reliable and perform better. 
And I think we're in the early innings of that, frankly. And so one of the competitive dynamics that we really want to push on is ensuring that where we used to kind of, I would say, wipe our hands as the problem that occurred on the other side of the network interface in many instances, trying to lean on and embracing that in a way that's helpful to the customer, it makes our product and service work better. And we think that, that's a great way to compete moving forward. And it has a real interesting opportunity to start differentiating the product and service offer moving forward, and I'm pretty optimistic about that, coupled with our fiber infrastructure as we move into '22.

But what I would tell you is second quarter of last year we told you about where we wanted to focus this business and that we wanted to make sure that we were gaining momentum and success in satisfying broadband customers in our wireless business and what we could do in growing fiber and fixed connections and how we grew a forward-leaning entertainment-based product.

And I would submit to you, you can plow through the numbers and see that it's being done in the right way across the board.

We have a consistent, deliberate and clear approach to the way we run our business:",679,"Thanks, Amir, and good morning, everyone. It's been about 6 weeks since our Analyst and Investor Day. So the framework for what we'll cover today will be familiar to you. We have a consistent, deliberate and clear approach to the way we run our business: from our market focus areas to our 2021 priority to grow customer relationships, with most U.S. households across these market focus areas, to our capital allocation plans. 
As you see in our quarterly results, our execution has been sharp, and we have momentum. We continue to grow our customer relationships with strong subscriber growth in Mobility, AT&T Fiber and HBO Max. We also continued to invest both in capital spending and in content. Our ability to drive costs out of our business and deliver strong cash flows has allowed us to invest in strategic growth. 
However, as you can see from the results, we're investing wisely. We've been deliberate and intentional in allocating dollars where they'll generate returns. This supports the future of our business, while also optimizing the returns on strategic opportunities across our portfolio. For example, cost transformation efforts in Mobility yield improved year-over-year profits, while we simultaneously invested to drive customer growth. 
Same at WarnerMedia, where EBITDA was down slightly even with significant increased investment in HBO Max. The restructuring and consolidation of our WarnerMedia business is driving cost savings in our studio operations, networks, sales force and technology. Our transformation initiatives across the company are driving efficiencies and freeing up capital to invest in our growth areas, and there is more opportunity ahead of us. 
Our deliberate capital allocation plan allowed us to invest and sustain our dividend at current levels, which we believe is attractive. We're prioritizing cash after dividends to reduce debt. And we continue to monetize noncore assets as we refine our overall business focus, as you saw us do in the quarter, with our announced sale of a controlling interest in DIRECTV and our other video assets. 
Let's look at the progress we made in delivering on our market focus areas on Slide 4. Our customer growth was impressive across Mobility, Fiber and HBO Max. And we're doing it the right way, with a focus on growing profitability. 
In Mobility, we added nearly 600,000 postpaid phones in the quarter, our best net add first quarter in more than 10 years. Our subscriber momentum is strong, and we're taking share. Gross adds are up, and our average promotional spend per net add is significantly lower than a year ago. Our transformation program is enabling us to be competitive. 
At the same time, we're benefiting from a simplified go-to-market strategy and optimized sales and distribution channels. Mobility EBITDA was up more than 2%, and service margins increased 100 basis points despite a 2020 first quarter compare, where roaming revenues were largely unimpacted. You put it all together, and I believe this demonstrates the formula works. 
AT&T Fiber net adds were strong and penetration levels continue to expand. We've added more than 1 million Fiber subscribers in the last 4 quarters. IP broadband revenues grew nearly 5% in the quarter, and we're on pace to build out Fiber to another 3 million consumer and business customer locations this year. 
HBO Max continues to deliver strong subscriber gains, fueled by the success of our day-and-date theatrical strategy and our steadily strengthening post-COVID content slate. In the U.S., we've added more than 11 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers in the last 12 months. 
It's a premium offer, with a premium ARPU compared to other streaming platforms. And subscription revenues in the first quarter grew about 35% globally for WarnerMedia's Direct-to-Consumer business, and we're on track to launch HBO Max internationally and introduce an AVOD product in June. 
Across the board, we're encouraged by our momentum and how our management team is executing against our singular priority to grow customer relationships in our market focus areas. With that, I'll turn it over to Pascal to discuss the specifics of our first quarter results. 
Pascal, welcome, and the floor is yours."
100231,708658115,2255629,"AT&T Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results on Slide 6. We started the year with growing revenues, earnings and cash flows. Revenues were up from a year ago, with gains in Mobility and WarnerMedia more than off",1023,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results on Slide 6. 
We started the year with growing revenues, earnings and cash flows. Revenues were up from a year ago, with gains in Mobility and WarnerMedia more than offsetting declines from Video, legacy services and FX. As a reminder, our Communications segment has been recast to exclude our Video business. For the quarter, Communications EBITDA was essentially flat with the prior year. That demonstrates a marked improvement from the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.86. That's up more than 2% year-over-year. We also had a good start to the year with our cash flows. Cash from operations came in at $9.9 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.9 billion, with higher sales of receivables, lower CapEx and interest. 
Our dividend payout ratio was about 63%. CapEx was $4 billion. Gross capital investment was $5.7 billion. In addition, WarnerMedia's total cash content investment across all their business this quarter was $4.5 billion, slightly higher than last year. 
As we indicated at our Analyst Day, we are investing in our market focus areas, and we're seeing further validation of our strategy in the first quarter results. Therefore, we edged up our gross capital investment expectations to the $22 billion range for the year. Additionally, we increased our expected vendor financing payments, given our ability to negotiate favorable terms. 
Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communications segment on Slide 7. Mobility continues to lead the way in our Communications business. We saw a strong customer growth in our postpaid phone base, growing service revenues, growing EBITDA, with expanding EBITDA service margin, and that's with continued headwinds facing our high-margin international roaming business that we estimate cost us about $100 million in EBITDA this quarter. 
Our simple, direct postpaid phone offers continue to resonate with customers. And as John mentioned, our Mobility gross adds share is increasing and postpaid phone churn has stayed near record-low levels. Cost transformation continues to be a big part of the story for Mobility. Our more efficient sales processes and streamlined operations are driving down costs. 
In fact, our average promotional spend per net adds is significantly lower than a year ago. Our cost efforts are also evident in Business Wireline. Cost management has helped expand EBITDA margins as customers transition away from higher-margin legacy services and products. But the product simplification and the resulting cost savings have been key to delivering solid EBITDA. 
Consumer Wireline is another business in transition. We are moving quickly to expand our Fiber footprint, and our results show you why that is crucial. We added 235,000 AT&T Fiber customers in the quarter. IP broadband ARPU grew 3.2% year-over-year. 
Our Fiber penetration rate is more than 35% and growing. And total broadband net adds also increased. We expect this to be the trough in terms of year-over-year EBITDA growth. We expect trends to improve from here, driven by IP broadband revenue growth in the mid-single digits for the year. 
Let's move on to WarnerMedia, which is on Slide 8. WarnerMedia results are the first half of what we expect will be a transformational year for the business. Revenues were up nearly 10%. Higher Direct-to-Consumer subscription and advertising revenues drove the growth. 
And even with higher customer acquisition and content costs associated with HBO Max and higher sports costs, EBITDA was down only slightly. Advertising revenues were up more than 18%, driven by return of sports, especially the NCAA championship, Men's Basketball Tournament. Direct-to-Consumer subscription revenues grew about 35%, reflecting the success of HBO Max. 
We now have 44.2 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers and nearly 64 million worldwide subscribers. Average monthly revenue per domestic customer is just a little less than $12. And now we have 11 million customers who combined one or more connectivity products with HBO Max or HBO. 
The same-day release of movies in theaters and on HBO Max has been a success. It has provided theaters with a steady flow of content in a pandemic-challenged environment. And it's also been a great catalyst for subscriber growth at HBO Max. 
The success of Godzilla vs. Kong at both the box office and on HBO Max bears this out. It had the largest domestic box office of any other movie in the last year, while also having the largest viewing audience of any other film or show on HBO Max since launch. And films such as Godzilla vs. Kong attract new retail customers who are staying because they enjoy other content on the platform. 
We're really looking forward to the introduction of our international and AVOD products planned for HBO Max later in June. We plan to have attractive price points for our AVOD offering. And we expect to lean into our international launch, reaching 60 additional markets by the end of the year. Our aim is to use our differentiated premium content offering to attract global customers. 
Now let's go to Slide 9 for an update on our capital allocation and liquidity. We made our $23 billion C-band spectrum payment since we last talked to you in March. That drove net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio to 3.1x. We expect this will be our peak leverage level. 
We're still on track to have a sizable reduction in debt by year-end through a combination of strong free cash flows and proceeds from asset monetization. We'll continue to focus on debt reduction. We expect our net debt to adjusted EBITDA to be around 3x by year-end. 
We also continue to actively evaluate other asset monetization opportunities. Our treasury team has also been working tirelessly to lower our cost of debt. Our weighted average cost of debt is down 50 basis points year-over-year, driving about $150 million in lower interest costs in the first quarter.

But at this time, we're not going to update our guidance beyond what we've said already. But we are really pleased with the performance. And I think what you're seeing is we're putting out a really good product and consumers are responding. 
In terms of WarnerMedia overall, here's a thing to focus on. We've mentioned this several times, but over the course of the last several years, there's been a consistent transformation effort taking out duplicate costs across the organization. So we have combined technology organization, sales function, content production studios. 
So all that is what you're seeing coming through is offsetting the investment that we are making in HBO Max. That was the plan. That was deliberate. And that's what we -- that was our objective, and it's coming through. 
In terms of going forward, I'm not going to comment on what the exact trends are going to be. But again, you should keep -- we have significant transformation savings that should help subsidize some of the investment we're making."

Could you talk a little bit about kind of what you're seeing on the ground relative to your expectations, and how the recent price changes in the Fiber business factor into that game plan? 
And then, I guess, the second question for you, Pascal. You effectively lowered your CapEx guidance by boosting your plan to take advantage of vendor financing, but you kept the free cash flow guidance the same, implying lower operating cash flow from a quarter ago. Could you elaborate a little bit on how we kind of square that change in the guidance with what looks like relatively strong performance this quarter?"

Rest assured, you should not read into this any more than it is. We -- when we looked at our projections for capital spend, we thought it was appropriate to increase it. But we didn't think at this time of the year, given how early it is, it was appropriate to start to change guidance. We want it to maintain some flexibility, but we are really comfortable with our free cash flow guidance. And it has not changed in any way as a result of the change that we've made to CapEx, so there's really nothing more to it than that."

And I'd tell you, Dave, just to kind of maybe put a finer point on what Pascal said. One of the things I'm trying to impress upon with the management team is we want to do things the right way, and we want to do things in a sustainable way. 
And I had probably a little bit of a cultural shift. We have a very process-driven organization that's very focused on delivering what we ask them to do, and that's a great strength. But sometimes, that means that people are very literal about looking at a number and saying, ""I will get you that number,"" and maybe don't raise a point that says, ""If you give me a little bit of flexibility, I could do something a lot more efficiently or effectively for the next 2 years."" 
And I'm really trying hard with the management team to help them understand they have the latitude to do the right thing for the long haul. And that while we want some consistency in how we run the business, there's a limit to doing that with the de minimis returns or diminishing returns. 
And so with that, I got to back up what I say to folks. And when they come in and they have compelling ways to think about how we should build or go about deploying, I need to be responsive in ensuring that I give them the latitude to do that. And given the number of things we have underway that we're scaling, including the Fiber build, as you asked the question and what we're doing around starting to roll into 5G deployment, et cetera, making sure that we get that latitude in there is really important to me. And I think it's important to supporting them. 
And what I'm seeing on the early days of -- I won't even call it the early days, what I know about our base on our Fiber deployment and what we know about the incremental work is it's, from an operational perspective and a market perspective, all green lights. That's one of the reasons why I'm really comfortable in letting the team run in the way that we're letting them run. 
And I like what I see in terms of our market position. If you look at things like customer lives, churn, customer satisfaction and Net Promoter Scores and the actual performance of the product, they're all great. And when you start looking at that, you know there's going to be goodness. 
And I've told you this before, I've not seen share movement on typical products like this as rapidly as we're able to get share movement once we deploy an area. And I frankly have never seen customer satisfaction levels move up and get to a promoting position in the market as we transition the product as fast as we're seeing. I think both of those things bode really well. 
And as you heard Pascal talk about in the opening remarks, we think we're at kind of the bottom of our EBITDA compare. A lot of that is actually being driven by our strategy to start attaching content to broadband. That's been really good in terms of driving those customer lives up. It's driving churn down. It's driving engagement and satisfaction levels higher. 
We're going to get the benefit of that over the customer life cycle. And as we start to lap that, you're going to start to see our EBITDA dynamics start to creep back up to where we want them. So I feel really good across the board."

Now even within -- without changing the pace and rate of where we are on C-band deployment, which will begin turning markets up late this year, that doesn't mean that, in things that we're doing today, that can help the 2022 build, that we wouldn't make some decisions on deployment. 
And that is an aspect of some of this -- the capital dynamic we described, but it's not the aspect. There are a variety of things that are playing into it. That's one of several. 
And so as we time certain things, the aggregate amount may be the same, but there's things that we can do today as we're touching towers and doing things and parts of the infrastructure that, for example, maybe aren't going to be in service until later in '22, that we could do a little more efficiently to preprovision some things and not go back and touch them a second time. So some of that ordering is a dynamic that we're trying to drive through. 
As I've told you, I don't expect that there's going to be any change right now on our deployment plans and the growth from the guidance that we gave you 5 weeks ago. We'll see as we get into this a little bit deeper. As usual, we're in that cycle where technology is relatively new. Vendors have commitments. We're waiting on specific units. 
Global supply chains are stressed right now across the board. And you asked the question, ""Can you do the work?"" And people will give you comfortable answers. But I'm a little skittish. I mean, we're seeing dynamics that are occurring in the global supply chain where unexpected things are popping up. 
And it is possible that we could see certain element shortages that start to crop up as everybody is racing to put stuff up on towers in May. And that's why I want to be a little bit cautious around guiding up or doing anything different until we get a little bit of momentum around that. 
In terms of where we are on the 3.45 end-of-year DoD auction, look, I believe that there could be an opportunity there. We're going to watch it carefully. We've always participated in any spectrum auction that comes forward, or looked at it and said, ""Does it make sense for the portfolio?"" And we can see some things that if the valuations are sound valuations, that makes sense for our business. 
I will tell you, in the guidance we've provided you over the next several years, we have plugged in an expectation that we will be in spectrum markets as we guide down to our 2.5 debt-to-EBITDA level that we projected for you in '24. And so I expect, within that plan, we're going to be looking at it and saying, ""Do we like the valuations, and does it make sense?"" And we do believe some of that spectrum could fit into our network portfolio and be helpful to us down the road if the auction is done in the way we think it's going to be done."

I don't want to get into kind of every 5-week update on those numbers. 
I think we gave you a good sense of what's happening, and our satisfaction that we're well up over 2 hours per day per account. And I think that's a really good place to be. And it certainly is probably higher than our engineered expectations when we launched the product, and we'll take that goodness. 
The behaviors of what customers are doing, really, I don't think are dramatically different than what you would see on any other SVOD service. As Pascal mentioned, we clearly have a good reason for them to come in. And we're seeing in the customer data that many are opting to come in because of theatrical slate opportunity. 
And credit to the team. They've done a remarkable job not only of engineering that strategy and executing it, carrying it through, and it's playing out exactly as we kind of laid out for you when we said we wanted to do it in terms of the mix. We've got more of the year to get through to see what that balance is between theatrical revenues versus SVOD. 
But when you look at the customer growth on SVOD, and you see some of the early data coming back on movies like Kong vs. Godzilla (sic) [ Godzilla vs. Kong ] in the theater, I think you can all see that there's probably a pretty compelling rising tide lifting all boats in this case. And we feel it's the right call for the moment we were in with the pandemic and really comfortable about that. And that drives customer exploration of the product. 
And once they come in, they do what they do with any other SVOD service. They go to our high-value series. So any of the new scripted series content that we have out there, HBO Originals, HBO Max Originals, they go for the high-profile ones, and they start to engage on those. And then guess what else they do? They dig deeper into the library. 
And there's workhorses in the library, depending on the demographic of the individual, that tends to sustain them around. And because of the good job of marketing the slate for the movies, I think what we're seeing is evidence that they say, ""Well, gosh, I'm now into it for 2, 3 weeks, and I know there's another one coming next month that I want to see. I'm sticking around."" And so our churn expectations have been consistent with what we expected moving in. 
And so I think it's just the classic approach to managing any SVOD service, although we're playing to our strengths in how we're tiering the content. And we're using theatrical maybe a little bit more heavily than other services might use because that's one of our strong suits, and it always has been, with the strength of HBO and the theatrical slate that HBO offered in the core product. 
On the wireless side, I've said this before, I don't want to sound like a broken record, but part of our strength is that we're really able to cover the waterfront on some of the verticals in our distribution strategy. And in particular, we've been particularly strong in using our enterprise business and our business sales force in not only selling into business segments, but ensuring that affinity plans in those areas can reach customers and their families at home for being part of that business that we sell to. 
The strength of the FirstNet, which has opened up a vertical that we were under-indexed in, in share, and we're seeing really attractive share growth. And again, there's an affinity characteristic that occurs within that vertical. It's not only an affinity characteristic among coworkers, but we've managed to ensure that if somebody chooses to come on for the purpose of their work as a first responder, that they have a lot of incentives to maybe drag their family through that experience with attractive pricing and approach. 
We continue to be strong in our traditional verticals, with our iOS-centric customer base, which tends to scale what I would call the better part of the postpaid market. And we haven't lost any edge there. In fact, we've been a little bit stronger. 
And I would tell you, I think we still have room to run. I think we're probably under-indexed in a couple of verticals, especially if we start looking at the Hispanic community, that we can do a little bit better in, in how we position our brand and our product. And the team is focusing on those areas. 
So my point of view right now is our momentum is continuing. We're doing better, as you can see from the results. We still have a couple of cards to play to try and sustain that. We've been very consistent in the market, with a repetitive offer quarter after quarter. 
You're correct, we have seen our competitors continue to try to compete aggressively. They're mixing and changing their offers pretty frequently. We seem to be very consistent and very stable, and that's a really good place for us to be. And we're going to continue to play our game."

It's been fairly consistent, and I expect it's going to remain pretty much on this pattern.

Look, I think that there is a segment of the base, and this is particularly true when there are multiple streaming services out there and people are making decisions to reorder their investment in in-home entertainment, that are going to be more price-sensitive. And while we believe HBO Max, without commercial interruption, as a premium product and warrants what we charge in the market today, we know that, that premium, in some cases, is high enough that there are people, when they start to say, ""Well, I've got 3 services, and I aggregate everything out, that maybe I won't make a choice to be in it.""
And that's particularly true if you look at maybe some younger demographics. And as a result of that, we believe getting the price point down where, for them to get some well-executed advertising, they would look at the product and service and stay within the portfolio, streaming services that they may wish to have in their household or in their apartment, that they think that this is a good place to be. 
Another example will be in certain socioeconomic dynamics. So you can expect, for example, we believe the AVOD product actually pairs well with some of our prepaid offers and how we might position it because it tends to line up on a more price-sensitive socioeconomic dynamic. And we think that opens up marketing channel and awareness channel and ultimately an opportunity to drive penetration in other places where, again, customers are a bit more price-sensitive. 
So really, at the end of the day, a customer gets to make a choice. And there's no question if you give a lower price point, you're going to push it down lower in the demos that will ultimately subscribe to it. And I think that's more important as people are making portfolio decisions of multiple services in their household. 
And when you see the reality of an ebb and flow on a Direct-to-Consumer offering, where maybe you hit that period of time where you're not as enamored with the offering that we have on the new content that's in place, having that option to be at a lower price point allows somebody to stick with the service. And we just think it's a really smart place to be for that segment of the market. 
In terms of the channels, what we've been -- and I think it's really an important point that you bring up, and I want to stress this. We've been really, really careful about our channel partners. At the end of the day, a Direct-to-Consumer business should be a Direct-to-Consumer business. It should be a business that we have the opportunity to have a direct relationship with the customer, market and sell to them and work with them in the way that we feel is appropriate. 
And so where, in some cases, we were criticized for taking a long time to getting certain agreements worked out, you should understand that we were doing that under the principle of we refused to back off on the notion. That we wanted to make sure that our distribution and the way we offer the product was something that we ultimately had the ability to talk to our customers, and to bill our customers and make sure that we can manage the life cycle of our customers over time, and do these migrations easily and not allow somebody else between us and the user interface of the customer. And not all launches of streaming products have done that and done it in that same fashion. 
And so we've been a little bit more dependent on our owned and operated channels. We've been, I believe, respectful and balanced with our existing distribution partners, where we've certainly consented to their rights to be able to bundle and sell the product, where we can make sure that we manage the customer experience and the user interface as the customer is inside the product, and that we can appropriately inform them and guide them to the right kind of content and have the kind of relationship with them that we should have as a direct owner of that product or service. 
And so you're going to see us use, for example, our own prepaid channels. But you're not going to see us dramatically change our distribution strategy, where, just to get volume, we're turning over control and exercise rights of how the product or service is being used. 
We're in discussions with our existing distributors. We intend to make it available to them under very similar constructs to what we did in economic incentives with the subscription product, if they choose to do that. And if they choose to carry it forward and it's done in the way that we think is the right balance for our ability to manage that customer, we'll extend it to them. If not, we'll be moving it largely through our owned and operated channels, if that's what's required."

The infrastructure bill -- euphemistically speaking, the infrastructure bill's a little bit of a large, amorphous thing right now. And I think we're in very much the early innings of shaping what it's going to be. I don't pretend that I've got any great insight, that I can predict how the political process will play it out, but I'll give you my opinion on it. 
My opinion is that it will go through some changes. I think, in aggregate, the size of it will probably be different than what it was proposed to be. My sense is that there's enough support on both sides of the aisle that both would like to see broadband spending. If it's a bipartisan approach, I think it would still survive a bipartisan approach. If it ends up not being a bipartisan bill, I think it will still survive not being a bipartisan bill. 
If you think about how it's executed, I think the White House made a couple of broad statements in the announcement of the policy that were starters. I think you've heard the President say himself that he's open for discussion on things. And I know there's a lot of dialogue going on. My sense with that dialogue is that there are members of Congress on both sides of the aisle that maybe have somewhat different views as to how the policy should be executed than what was, at a very high level, laid out in the bill with some suggestion. I don't think it was all that specific. 
And I think we're actively involved in that discussion right now, talking about our learnings and our understandings of what we think good policy would be. If, in fact, the government chooses to put some subsidy in place around that and some incentives in place, we think it should probably get to a different place than the rough framework that the White House put in place. And we think that there is support on both sides of the aisle and other policy aisles of this administration to try to drive it that way. 
I believe some of the things were frankly not characterized properly. I think when you get underneath the facts of how broadband infrastructure is deployed in the United States today, what occurs when there's 2 players in the market that are offering both capable and robust networks, what the price performance characteristics of the product are, I think vast parts the U.S. broadband market are actually performing incredibly well. 
I think we have an issue that needs to be dealt with on certain degrees of low-income subsidy. Interestingly, voluntarily, several of us in the market, including AT&T, has a voluntary low-income offer that's out there, that it's hard to imagine that a $10 offer, in my view, would be a monopolistic pricing offer. It seems to me that that's a pretty gracious and attractive offer. And if there were the right subsidies put on it, that, that could be a pretty effective tool of putting more fixed broadband into people's homes. 
I do believe we have some rural areas that the bill needs to deal with, that if the policy is done right on a technology-agnostic way, that we can participate in and grow in. And that clearly is going to take some additional discussion and policy formation to get it into that place. We're in the early innings of it. We're active in it. I think it's going to be something, at the end of the day, like any political process, that there'll be a middle ground that will come up with some opportunity, but probably not everything we'd like. 
But we'll be active and aggressive in the places that we can go. The good news is, in the guidance that we've given you, in the core of our business, we have a lot of opportunity for growth in broadband. This would be icing on the cake if we were able to make some headway there. I think we can move forward without this policy to deliver to you what we said we were going to deliver. 
We've been working with the SEC on the -- how the subsidy gets placed out. We've been talking with them about the approach to it. My sense is that they've got their arms around it. They understand how to administer these programs. They are going to do it in a way that I think it will help some of our customers. 
Again, we've got great offers out in the market for low-income customers. In some cases, there's income stress that maybe don't qualify as low income. The SEC plan will help the income-stressed, but it will particularly help low income. And that, coupled with the offers we have in the market, I think, should be generally helpful moving forward. 
I think we're probably at a peak right now at need. As people return to schools in person, I think there's going to be a little bit of pressure taken off this dynamic moving forward. But again, we weren't banking on a lot of government subsidy in the guide we've given you on our direction. So if it breaks the right way, it will be a good thing for us."

Because that's been a big focus for you guys for a long time. Just wondering if the approach has some room to change. 
And secondly, on the wireless side. When you think about the margins this quarter, I mean, they were obviously pretty good in the context of some of the promotions you guys have run. And I think you pointed to the promotional costs on a normalized basis per subscriber actually being pretty attractive. Could you just talk about that a little bit more and how that might play out over the course of the year?"

I'm always looking for good thoughts on what might be effective in the market. But I will tell you, yes, we've had really good success at pairing our wireless services with our broadband customers. 
And I will tell you, it's one of the areas of, frankly, over the last couple of months. Really pleased with the team's execution, and how we've been working that data set and that customer base, to put the right attractive offers in place. And one of those things where, because we have a relationship with the customer, we can maybe do some things a little bit differently in the market and how we position what those incentives are, for them to put 2 products together than what you might do in a mass market channel nationally. And we feel that, that's a pretty attractive place for us to go. 
And I mentioned we're having really good success bundling our entertainment Direct-to-Consumer product with broadband. And we're seeing really high marks from customers in doing that. That feels really good. That feels, to me, like a new version of pay-TV with broadband. It feels like a forward-leaning entertainment product and service, coupled with broadband, where we know that when we bundle, we drive churn down. 
Our success has been really strong on that. We've leaned in on that. We're seeing customers receive it really well. But it is really, really good on customer profitability and asset lives when they make that wireless coupling decision. 
I'm not going to kind of say it too much, but we believe there are some further customer relations on service integration we can do between wireless and broadband that makes some things even more attractive moving forward for that customer base. Our product road map, as we move into 2022, starts to introduce some of those, and it goes right at the heart of what you're suggesting. And I absolutely believe that will be a winning play. 
But I don't want to oversell it because, right now, our broadband footprint, as you know, doesn't cover the entire United States. And we do need to be successful in marketing and selling in the entire United States in our wireless business to be successful. 
Why are we doing better on promotional unit costs and dynamics? Consistency of execution is one, as we've not had to change our approach to the market and change our messaging to customers, and go to what I would call the expensive approach to on again, off again, on again, off again. Those things cause you to do things like try to retrain salespeople. You have to put incentives and SPIFFs in place to get their attention to move through. 
I will tell you, we are operating through our distribution channels in an incredibly consistent fashion, in a way that, if I look at the numbers, and I take great pride to what the team's executed and what they're doing, and it looks like sound management, it looks like we're doing the right things and doing them better. 
And when we get the customer in with the right consistent offer, our trusted sales advisers are doing what you would expect trusted sales advisers to do. They're guiding the customer to the right product and service that meets their needs. And sometimes, that product and service and that solution isn't exactly the thing that the customer was motivated to come and explore. 
And oftentimes, that's a -- it's a good outcome for our business when that occurs. And that might be a buy up on an unlimited plan to higher rates that allow us to drive ARPU up. It might be bundling another product and service with them. And we're getting the goodness that comes along with that consistent message. 
It causes customers to explore with us instead of maybe their first inclination, which might have been to go and explore with the competitor and move their service. And that's why the churn levels are so much lower. So we're getting really good lift from our promotional spend. We're getting really good performance when you look at how we're managing the device recovery life cycle. It's all good, and it's all helping. 
And when you're not driving the volume that we had driven in the past, when we're down at those low gross add levels, guess what, your unit costs are higher per gross add. When you're operating at the levels that we're operating at right now, you get some scale benefits to it. So it just -- it all comes together in a way that's really goodness, and that's what you're seeing work through the numbers."

We were not pleased with our performance in places where we don't have fiber, which is why I need additional footprint and why we're headed in that direction. But we're incredibly pleased with our ability to compete where we do have it, and it's been pretty consistent in terms of the competitive dynamics around that. 
In fact, I think we're doing some things right now that are improving our performance overall because of our focus in the market and how we're thinking about the integrated customer experience. And really, what we're now starting to do, it took us maybe a little too long to get there, but we're thinking beyond the side of the house is the way I would think about it. 
We've always built really good networks. And we do a really good job of ensuring that they're consistent, reliable and work well. But the inside of the house is a bit of a dirty place right now from a data perspective, and it's getting dirtier by the day as customers do more and more, add more devices. 
And we're now starting to work really hard on how our product and service can help the customer inside the house. That was the result of making our product look more consistent, more reliable and perform better. And I think we're in the early innings of that, frankly. 
And so one of the competitive dynamics that we really want to push on is ensuring that, where we used to kind of, I would say, wipe our hands as the problem that occurred on the other side of the network interface, in many instances, trying to lean on and embracing that in a way that's helpful to the customer, it makes our product and service work better. And we think that, that's a great way to compete moving forward. And it has a real interesting opportunity to start differentiating the product and service offer moving forward. And I'm pretty optimistic about that, coupled with our fiber infrastructure, as we move into '22. Pascal?"

At the risk of being repetitive, or I guess consistent, depending on your take, the framework for what I want to cover today should be familiar to you. It's been 4 quarters since we articulated a simplified strategy and how we plan on evaluating our success going forward based on 3 priorities.
First, we wanted to grow subscriber relationships through our 3 market focus areas of 5G, fiber and HBO Max. Second, we initiated an effort to transform our business to be effective and efficient in everything we do so that we could allocate increased resources to support these focus areas. And third, we committed to deliberate capital allocation to support increased investment in growth, improve returns, narrow our operating focus and restore flexibility to our balance sheet. To achieve these priorities, we made some difficult near-term decisions to set our businesses up for success in the coming years. And that success is defined by improving our competitive position to the investment in best-in-class products and experiences for our customers. By doing so, we believe the execution of this strategy will drive better returns and profitable long-term growth.
Let's look at what we've achieved in the past year on Slide 4. We made notable progress in each of our priorities. In wireless, we're gaining share, lowering churn and had our best 12 months of postpaid phone net adds in more than a decade. We just posted record quarterly wireless EBITDA. In fiber, Customers have similarly responded to the combination of a premium service at attractive prices, and we've grown our base by more than 1 million subscribers. By year-end, we have expanded our fiber footprint by 3 million consumer and business customer locations. And just over a year after launch, we've grown our domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers by 10.7 million. We transformed HBO from a $6 billion business that was not growing to an $8 billion run rate business that grew at nearly 40% this quarter. We've also made solid initial progress in our cost-transformation efforts, which have produced $2 billion in savings that we've reinvested into our core growth areas. We're streamlining our operations and effectively growing digital fulfillment channels. Our NPS scores have improved significantly, and our fiber customers continue to rate us #1 in customer satisfaction. Churn levels have dropped substantially, too. Our second quarter postpaid phone churn matched a record low. And in broadband, we had our lowest churn on record and the highest second quarter fiber gross adds ever. At WarnerMedia, we continue to deliver great content. In the first half of the year, we introduced hit series, such as Mare of Easttown and Hacks. Our lineup in the back half of the year is even stronger with new seasons of popular series such as Succession, Raised by Wolves, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Love Life. That's on top of the day and date movies we'll have on the platform, such as Space Jam: A New Legacy, The Suicide Squad, Dune and Matrix 4. 
When the Emmy's were announced last week, HBO Max and HBO led the field with 130 nominations, the most of any network or platform. In total, WarnerMedia received more than 180 nominations. I'm really proud of the way the team is executing. And speaking of good execution, we're seeing indications that our DIRECTV deal with TPG might close in the next few weeks ahead of what we expected. Also, we're pleased with the new management team's ability to exceed operational expectations since we announced the transaction. Our intention with WarnerMedia is the same. We want to hit a strong exit velocity for both of these businesses, at which point the combination with the right partner only expands the respective opportunities for success going forward. And we continue to invest in strong levels. More than $60 billion in the last 12 months in 5G wireless, including spectrum, fiber and premium content.
Finally, we announced or closed a number of noncore asset dispositions, supporting our path to balance sheet flexibility. At the same time, we've positioned each of our 3 major businesses, AT&T Communications, WarnerMedia and DIRECTV, the right capital structure, the right assets, the right management team. And in the case of the latter 2, the right partners to optimize their returns to drive material value creation going forward. These decisions were not easy. And in some cases, they compelled us to rethink how to best deliver returns to our shareholders, leading us to balance long-term value creation with an attractive dividend.
As our second quarter results demonstrate, the momentum in our strategic areas of focus is real, supporting our view that we have the right business strategy and capital structure in place for longer-term success. Today, we're updating our 2021 outlook for our consolidated business, but our work is far from over. We know that consistent execution is the only way to win and keep our investors' confidence in the strategy we put forth. I couldn't be more pleased with the progress we're making.
I'll turn it over to Pascal to discuss the details of the quarter. Pascal?"

In the second quarter, we saw impressive growth across Mobility, Fiber and HBO Max. We added nearly 800,000 postpaid phones. That's our best second quarter in more than 10 years. Subscriber momentum continues t",1520,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we saw impressive growth across Mobility, Fiber and HBO Max. We added nearly 800,000 postpaid phones. That's our best second quarter in more than 10 years. Subscriber momentum continues to be strong, and we continue to take share. The gross adds are up, churn is at record low levels, and our average promotional spend per net add is significantly lower than a year ago, thanks to the consistency in our offerings.
The story with Fiber remains much the same. We continue to see solid subscriber growth with most of those customers new to AT&T. And broadband revenues grew more than 8%. HBO Max continues to exceed our expectations. Having surpassed the lower end of our global subscriber target 6 months ahead of plan, we are now raising our expectations to 70 million to 73 million global subscribers by the end of the year. We also launched our domestic ad-supported version of HBO Max as well as our international offering in 39 Latin American territories at the end of the quarter. That sets us up for additional customer growth as our addressable market expands. 
Let's now turn to Slide 7 for our consolidated financial results. Last year, we saw the brunt of the pandemic impact on our Q2 results. While the pandemic is still having some impact on our results, we're seeing our businesses emerge stronger than before, with growth accelerating in our market focus areas. Revenues were up more than $3 billion or 7.6% from a year ago. Gains in WarnerMedia, Mobility and Consumer Wireline more than offset declines in video and legacy business services. Adjusted EBITDA declined mostly due to pandemic impacted timing of sports cost in last year's second quarter. We'll talk more about that in a moment, but we expect most of that to reverse itself next quarter. In fact, we expect consolidated EBITDA to be flat to up modestly next quarter and improving thereafter.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.89. That's up more than 7% year-over-year. This includes about $200 million of pretax gains, principally from mark-to-market gains on benefit plan investments. Adjustments for the quarter included a $4.6 billion pretax noncash write-down of the Vrio assets based on our sales transaction announced yesterday.
Cash flows continue to be resilient. Cash from operations came in at $10.9 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow was $7 billion, even with a $2.4 billion increase in WarnerMedia cash content investment. Our dividend payout ratio was about 55%. Cash flows this quarter were also impacted by the capitalization of interest of about $250 million associated with our recent C-band spectrum purchases, which are recorded as investing activities. This accounting treatment stops once the spectrum is deployed.
Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communications business on Slide 8. Our Communications segment grew revenues, driven by gains in Mobility and Consumer Wireline. Mobility growth continues to accelerate, and we delivered another terrific quarter. Our simple postpaid phone offers continue to resonate with customers. Revenues were up more than 10%, with service revenues growing 5%. Postpaid phone churn marked a record low, and we continue to have strong customer growth, especially in our postpaid phone base. Our postpaid phone customer net adds improved by nearly 1 million year-over-year. And EBITDA is up $200 million, our highest EBITDA quarter on record. This growth came without a material return in international roaming revenues and a difficult comparison to last year's Q2 that included more than $100 million of gains on tower sales. As you think about the balance of the year, keep in mind, we are expecting a normal handset introduction cycle in the third quarter versus last year's fourth quarter launch. Also, on the timing front, we expect our recent agreement with DISH to provide a boost to wireless service revenues in 2022.
Business Wireline continues to deliver consistent margins and solid EBITDA, even as customers transition away from higher-margin legacy services and products. We saw a sequential improvement in both EBITDA and EBITDA margins. Year-over-year comparisons were impacted by benefits related to the pandemic in the year ago quarter. We expect similar challenging comps in the third quarter. However, with continued product rationalization and cost management, we're very comfortable with maintaining Business Wireline margins in the high 30% for the remainder of the year.
Our Fiber growth continues to be solid. We added 246,000 Fiber customers in the quarter. Broadband ARPU grew by 6.1% year-over-year. Our aggregate fiber penetration rate is now more than 36%, up from about 31% a year ago. And nearly 80% of net adds are new AT&T broadband customers. We've reached a major inflection point in our Consumer Wireline business. Broadband revenue growth now surpasses legacy declines. This helped drive Consumer Wireline revenues up 2.9%. We expect broadband revenues to continue to outpace legacy decline. EBITDA trends are also expected to continue improving as we make our way through the second half of the year.
Let's move to WarnerMedia's results, which are on Slide 9. We feel really good about our execution at WarnerMedia coming out of the pandemic. Subscription, advertising and content revenues have accelerated. Customers love HBO Max, and subscriber growth is exceeding expectations. And we had a successful launch of both our ad-supported and international HBO Max offerings late in the quarter. Revenues were up more than 30%, thanks to higher subscription, advertising and content revenues. Direct-to-Consumer subscription revenues grew nearly 40%, reflecting the success of HBO Max. Advertising revenues were up nearly 50%, driven by sports. And upfront negotiations so far have been really strong. Content and other revenues were up 35%, reflecting the recovery of TV production and theatrical releases. The return of sports had a big impact on advertising revenues and EBITDA in the quarter. In fact, sports contributed more than $400 million of advertising revenues, and we incurred sports costs of $1.1 billion in the quarter. So discrete losses from sport increased more than $600 million year-over-year due to last year's suspension of sports in the second quarter. We expect most of that to reverse itself in the third quarter as the prior year third quarter included the restart of the NBA season.
We now have 47 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers and more than 67 million worldwide subscribers, and domestic ARPU is just a little less than $12. Our ad-supported international offerings were launched too late in the quarter to have much of an impact on the second quarter results, but we're enthusiastic about their prospects, given the initial receptivity. As mentioned earlier, we are raising our subscriber growth expectations for the year. We're seeing good momentum, especially in our Latin American markets. We expect most of our subscriber growth for the remainder of the year to be from lower ARPU subscribers in that region. To lean into HBO Max fast start in Latin America, we may push back our launch in some European markets until early 2022. This shift is factored into our revised HBO Max subscriber guidance for the year. 
Now let's shift to guidance. As John mentioned, we updated our consolidated guidance for the year. Let's discuss that on Slide 10. As a reminder, our guidance for 2021 is on a business-as-usual basis and includes a full year contribution from DIRECTV. Based on the momentum we're seeing across our operations, we now expect consolidated revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range, up from the initial 1% guidance. We also expect wireless service revenue growth of 3% for the year, up from about 2%. Adjusted EPS is now expected to increase in the low to mid-single-digit range. That's up from our earlier guidance of stable with 2020. Gross capital investment expectations remain in the $22 billion range, and we now expect about $27 billion in free cash flows for the year.
Also, we now have better clarity on the projected close of the DIRECTV transaction. We expect the transaction to close in early August. Here is the expected impact from excluding 5 months of DIRECTV on the consolidated financial guidance we just laid out. Revenues are expected to be lower by $9 billion. EBITDA is expected to be lower by $1 billion. Free cash flow is also expected to be lower by about $1 billion, equating to $26 billion for the full year. We expect no change to our updated adjusted EPS guidance as benefits from the accounting treatment related to the NFL Sunday ticket are largely expected to be offset by certain fixed costs that were previously allocated to DIRECTV. Capital investment guidance is also expected to remain the same. Obviously, the actual financial impact could vary depending upon DIRECTV's performance, the actual close date and other considerations. We recognize the financial structure of the DIRECTV transaction is complex. That is why we included some incremental details on cash and dividend distribution terms in our press release. Shortly after we close the deal, we plan on providing pro forma historical financials to help your modeling going forward.
Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A."

So first, let me just kind of start out and step back and say having watched some of the comments over the last couple of days going to frame one thing. We have been in the wholesale business since as long as I've been working for this company",902,"Sure, John. So first, let me just kind of start out and step back and say having watched some of the comments over the last couple of days going to frame one thing. We have been in the wholesale business since as long as I've been working for this company, and the wholesale business has been very good to our company, and it's a very important element of how we manage our returns and how we kind of think about attracting the right kind of scale in our business moving forward. And that is both true in the fixed and wireless business. And we've been cognizant of percentages of traffic that we have in various aspects of our business and always try to maintain a balance. And I would say my experience with this company and looking at the relationships we've had from a wholesale perspective, we've always managed to strike relationships that we think are win-win relationships for the parties involved. 
Second thing I would say is I believe that DISH is going to be a company that, in their business model, what they choose to do moving forward is going to be successful one way or the other. And my point of view, when we start thinking about the wholesale business is, when somebody is going to be successful, it's always nice for us to be successful along with them. We think there's an accretive way to do that drives a reasonable return back into the business and, again, manages the balance of that traffic in the aggregate of the business. And I think we've achieved that in this case. And frankly, given the nature of their business and where they are in its maturity and what our interests are and ultimately aggregating as much traffic on our networks is possible, I'm looking forward to demonstrating to DISH that we can be a good partner, that we can carry the right kind of traffic, and we can do things to help them grow their infrastructure over time on parts of our network where they may not have ready access to infrastructure that we can ultimately support them with. And I think that's a good thing for AT&T over the long haul, given the nature of our business and what we've done and the balance that we like to keep between retail and wholesale traffic.
The construct around this particular agreement, as you should think about it is, as you know, it was set up so that, as DISH continues to build their own infrastructure for own and operate, they need places to put traffic. And so while this is a 10-year agreement that's discussed, I think, in the disclosures, is a minimum commitment per year, one should think about this as probably being something that's more front-end loaded than back-end loaded in terms of how that commitment retires. And I think you should also think about it in terms of DISH has established with us a minimum annual commitment. That's not the necessarily the annual commitment or the maximum annual commitment. And a lot of this will be based on our effective performance with them and ultimately what they choose to do in the market. But frankly, we aspire to possibly see that be something greater than what those minimum levels are that have been put in place, but this was a comfortable construct that I think both parties could agree to get started and establish all the practices and processes that are necessary to have an effective wholesale arrangement like this. And I think that we need to demonstrate that we can do well and ultimately see that grow.
And I don't want to speak on behalf of DISH or Charlie. I'm sure he will when he has a chance to comment on that. But I believe one of the reasons they view this as being a good move for them is their assessment of where things were in the industry is they felt like we could be a very capable and more capable partner than their current arrangement. And they have motivations for a business reason to continue to deepen that relationship with us. I would go on to say, as we think about what we do with them on this relationship going forward, there are a lot of options that we can explore. Spectrum is certainly one that's open. We have a variety of spectrum licenses where our existing radio infrastructure can ultimately deploy and put to use some of their spectrum. That's been done through the pandemic. We have options to do some of that as well as we move forward. And look, I don't think any of us know over the course of a longer-term relationship what's going to happen to other regs and specs on spectrum. 
And I think parties will keep their mind open as those evolutions occur and look for some other options to pursue. But right now, we know what we need to do with the wholesale agreement. But frankly, it's really no different than any other wholesale agreement that's in the market like what maybe Verizon does with Cable or what we've done with other entities that have elected to use this on a wholesale basis. Jeff, do you want to add anything to that? Your team did a great job pulling it together. Is there anything you would add?"

And I don't have any reason to suggest it's going to be anything other than that at this point. 
We've had some interesting and pleasant surprises. In some cases, I think we moved through the DIRECTV process a little bit faster than what we had expected. It's not a complicated transaction.

They do this day in and day out for a living, and that is scaled compute. And as you know, over the last several years, our labs, organizations and our network team has been hard at work virtualizing our core network functions.
What this deal essentially does is it brings Microsoft to the edge of our network and supporting our network workloads at a scale level for efficiency.

And I've got to tell you, it just continues to prove to be sustainable. The way I think about it, and I'd encourage you to think about it as 3 simple elements. And the first is we have simplified our offers in the market, and we have remained consistent in our offer constructs over the last 4 quarters, despite really a highly active and a competitive environment. But the second element that I think is sometimes overlooked is our persistent focus on the customer experience. And that is execution across our sales and distribution channels, our newly formed a year ago customer advocacy teams working the grind on, improving the experience of our products and our services. And then our network organization, it just continues to put the capital into the ground and drive for a third year in a row the nation's best network.
And those 2 things combined have responded and continued positive responses from the market and end customers, both our existing subscriber base, as I think all are aware of, but also those of other competitors who are choosing to join the AT&T network. And we've been able to achieve and sustain taking share in multiple segments. It's across the board. It's not in any one particular segment. We're growing in consumer. We're growing in small business. We're growing with our FirstNet position. We're growing in enterprise. And as Pascal mentioned earlier, we've set a 10-year record for net add growth here in the second quarter, but we've also set a record for our churn and the NPS results that customers are giving us for our wireless products and services. And so in short, the customers themselves are telling us that we're doing something great.
When you grow the top line revenue growth through the subscriber growth, remembering that we are third place in market share. We've got just a little over 27.5% of the market. Our growth trajectory right now is roughly 35%, 36% share of net adds. We're doing it also efficiently. And through our transformation program and our distribution optimization, we're able to mine dollars out of the operations to support this growth and drive EBITDA growth at record levels here in the second quarter, year-over-year as well as sequentially

doing a great job. We are satisfied, very -- I feel very strong about our position in the market, but we're staying focused on what customers want. And as long as we're getting the positive response, we're going to stick with it."

Third, look, you got to adjust some of these numbers in the industry when you think about how many customer lines are actually what I would call an economic decision to pay for versus not pay for.

A lot of it on prepaid before AT&T was a larger provider in the prepaid category. So when you evaluated the deal this time with DISH, how did you consider whether or not DISH would be a competitor that may be more complementary to the addressable market that you're going after relative to a competitor that may be going directly after this broad set of customers and revenue that AT&T currently pursues?"

I think we do things that are complementary in terms of we think they're accretive opportunities to bring profitable traffic on the network. But our portfolio of owned and operated services, frankly, covers the breadth of whatever a customer needs. I mean there isn't really a customer base that we could go out and sell an owned and operated service to. And we've been in that position for some period of time. We have a very strong prepaid business, which plays in the value segment. We have a variety of different prepaid offers that are out there. We have great postpaid offers that cover a full gamut of things. So yes, there are other operators out there that on a resale or MVNO basis go and attack other market segments, but I'd like to compete for those customers on an owned and operated basis as well. And that's always been the case.
Now I think where we're at in the U.S. market maybe a little bit different than others is there is kind of a direction towards more owned and operated competition and resale and MVNO operation. And as a result of that occurring, the number of wholesale options, I would say, moving forward in the future, are going to become a little bit more concentrated. And so you're probably going to see where you choose to put that wholesale traffic on your network to be fewer options to go out and pursue different partners. And as a result of that, if you want to continue to have an element of wholesale consistency in your market -- and to Jeff's point, if you have some excess capacity that you can put to use and use it for either a fixed cost coverage or driving up incremental traffic in a place where you have some capacity, you're going to obviously choose to do that. And I think that's the case here.
And as I would also tell you, when you think about this relationship, a broader wholesale capability beyond just the wireless business is a part of this, which is really attractive to us as an infrastructure provider. It's something we do in our core. And there are opportunities for us to think about, again, as we deploy -- as DISH deploys network infrastructure and where they go, for us to do some things that I think are complementary and helpful to both businesses."

It's got the highest NPS scores in the industry. Two, 80% of our net performance here in the first half of the year is actually new relationships to AT&T.

And I think that the 2 things that you guys have outlined is: number one, the cost synergies you've talked about, I think, $1.75 billion to $2 billion by that time. And now you've also mentioned the $1 billion plus in distributions from DIRECTV. I guess 2 questions there. Number one is that, as it relates to Jeff's response in response to Doug's question being 1/3 through the cost transformation, is that effectively 1/3 through getting the $1.75 billion to $2 billion and -- any color there?
And then secondly, I guess, as it relates to the components, is there anything else worth flagging besides those 2 things, the cost synergies and the distribution that helped to kind of bridge that gap to that plus $20 billion?"

Two, currently -- and we've said this on a number of occasions, currently, we are -- the contributions from WarnerMedia are not as meaningful as you may believe right now, given the step-up that we are experiencing in our content spending.

At the risk of being repetitive, or I guess consistent, depending on your take, the framework for what I want to cover today should be familiar to you. It's been 4 quarters since we articulated a simplified strategy and how we plan on evaluating our success going forward based on 3 priorities.
First, we wanted to grow subscriber relationships through our 3 market focus areas of 5G, fiber and HBO Max. Second, we initiated an effort to transform our business to be effective and efficient in everything we do so that we could allocate increased resources to support these focus areas. And third, we committed to deliberate capital allocation to support increased investment in growth, improve returns, narrow our operating focus and restore flexibility to our balance sheet. To achieve these priorities, we made some difficult near-term decisions to set our businesses up for success in the coming years. And that success is defined by improving our competitive position to the investment in best-in-class products and experiences for our customers. By doing so, we believe the execution of this strategy will drive better returns and profitable long-term growth.
Let's look at what we've achieved in the past year on Slide 4. We made notable progress in each of our priorities. In wireless, we're gaining share, lowering churn and had our best 12 months of postpaid phone net adds in more than a decade. We just posted record quarterly wireless EBITDA. In fiber, Customers have similarly responded to the combination of a premium service at attractive prices, and we've grown our base by more than 1 million subscribers. By year-end, we have expanded our fiber footprint by 3 million consumer and business customer locations. And just over a year after launch, we've grown our domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers by 10.7 million. We transformed HBO from a $6 billion business that was not growing to an $8 billion run rate business that grew at nearly 40% this quarter. We've also made solid initial progress in our cost-transformation efforts, which have produced $2 billion in savings that we've reinvested into our core growth areas. We're streamlining our operations and effectively growing digital fulfillment channels. Our NPS scores have improved significantly, and our fiber customers continue to rate us #1 in customer satisfaction. Churn levels have dropped substantially, too. Our second quarter postpaid phone churn matched a record low. And in broadband, we had our lowest churn on record and the highest second quarter fiber gross adds ever. At WarnerMedia, we continue to deliver great content. In the first half of the year, we introduced hit series, such as Mare of Easttown and Hacks. Our lineup in the back half of the year is even stronger with new seasons of popular series such as Succession, Raised by Wolves, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Love Life. That's on top of the day and date movies we'll have on the platform, such as Space Jam: A New Legacy, The Suicide Squad, Dune and Matrix 4. 
When the Emmy's were announced last week, HBO Max and HBO led the field with 130 nominations, the most of any network or platform. In total, WarnerMedia received more than 180 nominations. I'm really proud of the way the team is executing. And speaking of good execution, we're seeing indications that our DIRECTV deal with TPG might close in the next few weeks ahead of what we expected. Also, we're pleased with the new management team's ability to exceed operational expectations since we announced the transaction. Our intention with WarnerMedia is the same. We want to hit a strong exit velocity for both of these businesses, at which point the combination with the right partner only expands the respective opportunities for success going forward. And we continue to invest in strong levels. More than $60 billion in the last 12 months in 5G wireless, including spectrum, fiber and premium content.
Finally, we announced or closed a number of noncore asset dispositions, supporting our path to balance sheet flexibility. At the same time, we've positioned each of our 3 major businesses, AT&T Communications, WarnerMedia and DIRECTV, the right capital structure, the right assets, the right management team. And in the case of the latter 2, the right partners to optimize their returns to drive material value creation going forward. These decisions were not easy. And in some cases, they compelled us to rethink how to best deliver returns to our shareholders, leading us to balance long-term value creation with an attractive dividend.
As our second quarter results demonstrate, the momentum in our strategic areas of focus is real, supporting our view that we have the right business strategy and capital structure in place for longer-term success. Today, we're updating our 2021 outlook for our consolidated business, but our work is far from over. We know that consistent execution is the only way to win and keep our investors' confidence in the strategy we put forth. I couldn't be more pleased with the progress we're making.
I'll turn it over to Pascal to discuss the details of the quarter. Pascal?"

We added nearly 800,000 postpaid phones. That's our best second quarter in more than 10 years. Subscriber momentum continues to be strong, and we continue to take share. The gross adds are up, churn is at record low levels, and our average promotional spend per net add is significantly lower than a year ago, thanks to the consistency in our offerings.
The story with Fiber remains much the same. We continue to see solid subscriber growth with most of those customers new to AT&T. And broadband revenues grew more than 8%. HBO Max continues to exceed our expectations. Having surpassed the lower end of our global subscriber target 6 months ahead of plan, we are now raising our expectations to 70 million to 73 million global subscribers by the end of the year. We also launched our domestic ad-supported version of HBO Max as well as our international offering in 39 Latin American territories at the end of the quarter. That sets us up for additional customer growth as our addressable market expands. 
Let's now turn to Slide 7 for our consolidated financial results. Last year, we saw the brunt of the pandemic impact on our Q2 results. While the pandemic is still having some impact on our results, we're seeing our businesses emerge stronger than before, with growth accelerating in our market focus areas. Revenues were up more than $3 billion or 7.6% from a year ago. Gains in WarnerMedia, Mobility and Consumer Wireline more than offset declines in video and legacy business services. Adjusted EBITDA declined mostly due to pandemic impacted timing of sports cost in last year's second quarter. We'll talk more about that in a moment, but we expect most of that to reverse itself next quarter. In fact, we expect consolidated EBITDA to be flat to up modestly next quarter and improving thereafter.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.89. That's up more than 7% year-over-year. This includes about $200 million of pretax gains, principally from mark-to-market gains on benefit plan investments. Adjustments for the quarter included a $4.6 billion pretax noncash write-down of the Vrio assets based on our sales transaction announced yesterday.
Cash flows continue to be resilient. Cash from operations came in at $10.9 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow was $7 billion, even with a $2.4 billion increase in WarnerMedia cash content investment. Our dividend payout ratio was about 55%. Cash flows this quarter were also impacted by the capitalization of interest of about $250 million associated with our recent C-band spectrum purchases, which are recorded as investing activities. This accounting treatment stops once the spectrum is deployed.
Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communications business on Slide 8. Our Communications segment grew revenues, driven by gains in Mobility and Consumer Wireline. Mobility growth continues to accelerate, and we delivered another terrific quarter. Our simple postpaid phone offers continue to resonate with customers. Revenues were up more than 10%, with service revenues growing 5%. Postpaid phone churn marked a record low, and we continue to have strong customer growth, especially in our postpaid phone base. Our postpaid phone customer net adds improved by nearly 1 million year-over-year. And EBITDA is up $200 million, our highest EBITDA quarter on record. This growth came without a material return in international roaming revenues and a difficult comparison to last year's Q2 that included more than $100 million of gains on tower sales. As you think about the balance of the year, keep in mind, we are expecting a normal handset introduction cycle in the third quarter versus last year's fourth quarter launch. Also, on the timing front, we expect our recent agreement with DISH to provide a boost to wireless service revenues in 2022.
Business Wireline continues to deliver consistent margins and solid EBITDA, even as customers transition away from higher-margin legacy services and products. We saw a sequential improvement in both EBITDA and EBITDA margins. Year-over-year comparisons were impacted by benefits related to the pandemic in the year ago quarter. We expect similar challenging comps in the third quarter. However, with continued product rationalization and cost management, we're very comfortable with maintaining Business Wireline margins in the high 30% for the remainder of the year.
Our Fiber growth continues to be solid. We added 246,000 Fiber customers in the quarter. Broadband ARPU grew by 6.1% year-over-year. Our aggregate fiber penetration rate is now more than 36%, up from about 31% a year ago. And nearly 80% of net adds are new AT&T broadband customers. We've reached a major inflection point in our Consumer Wireline business. Broadband revenue growth now surpasses legacy declines. This helped drive Consumer Wireline revenues up 2.9%. We expect broadband revenues to continue to outpace legacy decline. EBITDA trends are also expected to continue improving as we make our way through the second half of the year.
Let's move to WarnerMedia's results, which are on Slide 9. We feel really good about our execution at WarnerMedia coming out of the pandemic. Subscription, advertising and content revenues have accelerated. Customers love HBO Max, and subscriber growth is exceeding expectations. And we had a successful launch of both our ad-supported and international HBO Max offerings late in the quarter. Revenues were up more than 30%, thanks to higher subscription, advertising and content revenues. Direct-to-Consumer subscription revenues grew nearly 40%, reflecting the success of HBO Max. Advertising revenues were up nearly 50%, driven by sports. And upfront negotiations so far have been really strong. Content and other revenues were up 35%, reflecting the recovery of TV production and theatrical releases. The return of sports had a big impact on advertising revenues and EBITDA in the quarter. In fact, sports contributed more than $400 million of advertising revenues, and we incurred sports costs of $1.1 billion in the quarter. So discrete losses from sport increased more than $600 million year-over-year due to last year's suspension of sports in the second quarter. We expect most of that to reverse itself in the third quarter as the prior year third quarter included the restart of the NBA season.
We now have 47 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers and more than 67 million worldwide subscribers, and domestic ARPU is just a little less than $12. Our ad-supported international offerings were launched too late in the quarter to have much of an impact on the second quarter results, but we're enthusiastic about their prospects, given the initial receptivity. As mentioned earlier, we are raising our subscriber growth expectations for the year. We're seeing good momentum, especially in our Latin American markets. We expect most of our subscriber growth for the remainder of the year to be from lower ARPU subscribers in that region. To lean into HBO Max fast start in Latin America, we may push back our launch in some European markets until early 2022. This shift is factored into our revised HBO Max subscriber guidance for the year. 
Now let's shift to guidance. As John mentioned, we updated our consolidated guidance for the year. Let's discuss that on Slide 10. As a reminder, our guidance for 2021 is on a business-as-usual basis and includes a full year contribution from DIRECTV. Based on the momentum we're seeing across our operations, we now expect consolidated revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range, up from the initial 1% guidance. We also expect wireless service revenue growth of 3% for the year, up from about 2%. Adjusted EPS is now expected to increase in the low to mid-single-digit range. That's up from our earlier guidance of stable with 2020. Gross capital investment expectations remain in the $22 billion range, and we now expect about $27 billion in free cash flows for the year.
Also, we now have better clarity on the projected close of the DIRECTV transaction. We expect the transaction to close in early August. Here is the expected impact from excluding 5 months of DIRECTV on the consolidated financial guidance we just laid out. Revenues are expected to be lower by $9 billion. EBITDA is expected to be lower by $1 billion. Free cash flow is also expected to be lower by about $1 billion, equating to $26 billion for the full year. We expect no change to our updated adjusted EPS guidance as benefits from the accounting treatment related to the NFL Sunday ticket are largely expected to be offset by certain fixed costs that were previously allocated to DIRECTV. Capital investment guidance is also expected to remain the same. Obviously, the actual financial impact could vary depending upon DIRECTV's performance, the actual close date and other considerations. We recognize the financial structure of the DIRECTV transaction is complex. That is why we included some incremental details on cash and dividend distribution terms in our press release. Shortly after we close the deal, we plan on providing pro forma historical financials to help your modeling going forward.
Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A."

100231,712242020,2349321,"AT&T Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2021",2021-07-22,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","Sure, John. So first, let me just kind of start out and step back and say having watched some of the comments over the last couple of days going to frame one thing. We have been in the wholesale business since as long as I've been working for this company",902,"Sure, John. So first, let me just kind of start out and step back and say having watched some of the comments over the last couple of days going to frame one thing. We have been in the wholesale business since as long as I've been working for this company, and the wholesale business has been very good to our company, and it's a very important element of how we manage our returns and how we kind of think about attracting the right kind of scale in our business moving forward. And that is both true in the fixed and wireless business. And we've been cognizant of percentages of traffic that we have in various aspects of our business and always try to maintain a balance. And I would say my experience with this company and looking at the relationships we've had from a wholesale perspective, we've always managed to strike relationships that we think are win-win relationships for the parties involved. 
Second thing I would say is I believe that DISH is going to be a company that, in their business model, what they choose to do moving forward is going to be successful one way or the other. And my point of view, when we start thinking about the wholesale business is, when somebody is going to be successful, it's always nice for us to be successful along with them. We think there's an accretive way to do that drives a reasonable return back into the business and, again, manages the balance of that traffic in the aggregate of the business. And I think we've achieved that in this case. And frankly, given the nature of their business and where they are in its maturity and what our interests are and ultimately aggregating as much traffic on our networks is possible, I'm looking forward to demonstrating to DISH that we can be a good partner, that we can carry the right kind of traffic, and we can do things to help them grow their infrastructure over time on parts of our network where they may not have ready access to infrastructure that we can ultimately support them with. And I think that's a good thing for AT&T over the long haul, given the nature of our business and what we've done and the balance that we like to keep between retail and wholesale traffic.
The construct around this particular agreement, as you should think about it is, as you know, it was set up so that, as DISH continues to build their own infrastructure for own and operate, they need places to put traffic. And so while this is a 10-year agreement that's discussed, I think, in the disclosures, is a minimum commitment per year, one should think about this as probably being something that's more front-end loaded than back-end loaded in terms of how that commitment retires. And I think you should also think about it in terms of DISH has established with us a minimum annual commitment. That's not the necessarily the annual commitment or the maximum annual commitment. And a lot of this will be based on our effective performance with them and ultimately what they choose to do in the market. But frankly, we aspire to possibly see that be something greater than what those minimum levels are that have been put in place, but this was a comfortable construct that I think both parties could agree to get started and establish all the practices and processes that are necessary to have an effective wholesale arrangement like this. And I think that we need to demonstrate that we can do well and ultimately see that grow.
And I don't want to speak on behalf of DISH or Charlie. I'm sure he will when he has a chance to comment on that. But I believe one of the reasons they view this as being a good move for them is their assessment of where things were in the industry is they felt like we could be a very capable and more capable partner than their current arrangement. And they have motivations for a business reason to continue to deepen that relationship with us. I would go on to say, as we think about what we do with them on this relationship going forward, there are a lot of options that we can explore. Spectrum is certainly one that's open. We have a variety of spectrum licenses where our existing radio infrastructure can ultimately deploy and put to use some of their spectrum. That's been done through the pandemic. We have options to do some of that as well as we move forward. And look, I don't think any of us know over the course of a longer-term relationship what's going to happen to other regs and specs on spectrum. 
And I think parties will keep their mind open as those evolutions occur and look for some other options to pursue. But right now, we know what we need to do with the wholesale agreement. But frankly, it's really no different than any other wholesale agreement that's in the market like what maybe Verizon does with Cable or what we've done with other entities that have elected to use this on a wholesale basis. Jeff, do you want to add anything to that? Your team did a great job pulling it together. Is there anything you would add?"

But right now, it's a lot of work with the regulatory agencies and document production and providing information that's responsive to their request so that they can begin their reviews. And all that is underway. There's nothing we see in that that's been particularly problematic, nor is it far enough along where I think you can effectively say that anybody has developed any position or point of view on something. So we continue to move through, and I would tell you, internally, all the normal steps are going on to be prepared operationally for when we would expect an approval. I think, as I indicated when we announced the transaction, Simon, we expected it was going to be next year and probably close to a full year review to get this done. And I don't have any reason to suggest it's going to be anything other than that at this point. 
We've had some interesting and pleasant surprises. In some cases, I think we moved through the DIRECTV process a little bit faster than what we had expected. It's not a complicated transaction. I think that certainly supports it. And if we were to be fortunate enough to do that because of the straightforward nature of the transaction, we'll take it, and we'll be prepared for that if that were to happen. But at this point, I'm expecting it's going to be a full and fulsome review.

And this particular deal that you referenced is just another example of how we choose to partner with companies like Microsoft who have expertise in doing things. They do this day in and day out for a living, and that is scaled compute. And as you know, over the last several years, our labs, organizations and our network team has been hard at work virtualizing our core network functions.
What this deal essentially does is it brings Microsoft to the edge of our network and supporting our network workloads at a scale level for efficiency. And as a partner in this, our engineers and their engineers are developing this solution on a broad scale across the business, across the network. We're going to enjoy some anchor tenant benefits from that. We're not disclosing any specific financial details. But one thing that we are not doing, and I've kind of read this in the trade and the press a bit, is we're not outsourcing our core network functions. We are relying upon Microsoft to develop scale compute and storage capabilities at the edge, while we retain control of our network stack and the kinds of services and products that we're going to offer to the market. 
And as John has shared over the last 4 quarters, our focus here is to put our energy on the things that differentiate our service. And by doing this, it enables us to reallocate resources that we want or attempting to build scale, network, cloud compute capabilities, we rely on Microsoft for that in their Azure for Operators capability going forward.

And I've got to tell you, it just continues to prove to be sustainable. The way I think about it, and I'd encourage you to think about it as 3 simple elements. And the first is we have simplified our offers in the market, and we have remained consistent in our offer constructs over the last 4 quarters, despite really a highly active and a competitive environment. But the second element that I think is sometimes overlooked is our persistent focus on the customer experience. And that is execution across our sales and distribution channels, our newly formed a year ago customer advocacy teams working the grind on, improving the experience of our products and our services. And then our network organization, it just continues to put the capital into the ground and drive for a third year in a row the nation's best network.
And those 2 things combined have responded and continued positive responses from the market and end customers, both our existing subscriber base, as I think all are aware of, but also those of other competitors who are choosing to join the AT&T network. And we've been able to achieve and sustain taking share in multiple segments. It's across the board. It's not in any one particular segment. We're growing in consumer. We're growing in small business. We're growing with our FirstNet position. We're growing in enterprise. And as Pascal mentioned earlier, we've set a 10-year record for net add growth here in the second quarter, but we've also set a record for our churn and the NPS results that customers are giving us for our wireless products and services. And so in short, the customers themselves are telling us that we're doing something great.
When you grow the top line revenue growth through the subscriber growth, remembering that we are third place in market share. We've got just a little over 27.5% of the market. Our growth trajectory right now is roughly 35%, 36% share of net adds. We're doing it also efficiently. And through our transformation program and our distribution optimization, we're able to mine dollars out of the operations to support this growth and drive EBITDA growth at record levels here in the second quarter, year-over-year as well as sequentially. And so this operating leverage that we've achieved gives us confidence that this model is sustainable, but we got a lot of work to do. As I mentioned, we still have a third place share position in the market. We haven't made our way fully through upgrading our existing customer base on unlimited plans. We still are early in the cycle of upgrading our base on the 5G devices. And so teams are doing a great job. We are satisfied, very. I feel very strong about our position in the market, but we're staying focused on what customers want. And as long as we're getting the positive response, we're going to stick with it."

We have not made the choice or decision to launch wide-scale fixed wireless Internet, but rest assured that the strength of our wireless network is providing options for us as we migrate some of our legacy wireline DSL customers off of that technology over to a better technology served up with fiber or wireless. And where it doesn't make sense for us to invest in fiber for the long term in certain demographic areas or market areas, we choose to serve that with wireless, and we'll leverage the 5G existing network that we've got with our sub-6 spectrum strength. Outside of that, we're not disclosing the number of homes covered by the wireless network. We generally measure that in terms of POPs."

But our portfolio of owned",420,"So Mike, on your comment, I think I probably disagree at the front end of your premise. I think we do things that are complementary in terms of we think they're accretive opportunities to bring profitable traffic on the network. But our portfolio of owned and operated services, frankly, covers the breadth of whatever a customer needs. I mean there isn't really a customer base that we could go out and sell an owned and operated service to. And we've been in that position for some period of time. We have a very strong prepaid business, which plays in the value segment. We have a variety of different prepaid offers that are out there. We have great postpaid offers that cover a full gamut of things. So yes, there are other operators out there that on a resale or MVNO basis go and attack other market segments, but I'd like to compete for those customers on an owned and operated basis as well. And that's always been the case.
Now I think where we're at in the U.S. market maybe a little bit different than others is there is kind of a direction towards more owned and operated competition and resale and MVNO operation. And as a result of that occurring, the number of wholesale options, I would say, moving forward in the future, are going to become a little bit more concentrated. And so you're probably going to see where you choose to put that wholesale traffic on your network to be fewer options to go out and pursue different partners. And as a result of that, if you want to continue to have an element of wholesale consistency in your market -- and to Jeff's point, if you have some excess capacity that you can put to use and use it for either a fixed cost coverage or driving up incremental traffic in a place where you have some capacity, you're going to obviously choose to do that. And I think that's the case here.
And as I would also tell you, when you think about this relationship, a broader wholesale capability beyond just the wireless business is a part of this, which is really attractive to us as an infrastructure provider. It's something we do in our core. And there are opportunities for us to think about, again, as we deploy -- as DISH deploys network infrastructure and where they go, for us to do some things that I think are complementary and helpful to both businesses."

Key themes around our transformation and cost takeout are things like optimizing our distribution elements, be it stores and retail locations and indirect agents as well as our digital and our online buy flows. Second area, the transformation is we're now at a point in time where we're managing a higher percentage of our volume through digital than we ever have. And because we perfected some of the elements in our product experiences of the past, we're able to enjoy a lot more self-install and customer self-serve capabilities. And that's required us to work through not only the buy flow experiences online, but also some of the platforms and the technologies that are behind the scenes supporting our frontline resources.
Third, our call center operations and our IT organization are hard at work at just getting plain and simply more efficient per transaction.

And then the other 3 things I'd mention is distribution, obviously, is key. And we certainly lined up a healthy distribution partnerships ahead throughout Latin America. The tech and product works, and it's a modern experience that we're very proud of. And finally, you've got to have the value. So the value proposition is a very strong one in Latin America.

And so my expectations are that our net add performance takes a step up as that inventory comes online. Having said that, the thing that's really strong for us and exciting is: one, product continues to be durable, as you point out. It's the best technology. It's a great price value proposition. It's got the highest NPS scores in the industry. Two, 80% of our net performance here in the first half of the year is actually new relationships to AT&T.

And absolutely, in terms of the response that we've gotten not just from that title, but from all of our day-and-date titles, we feel very good about the response that consumers have given it in the home.
In terms of the things in terms of where things go in the future, I think it's fair to say that -- and I've said this before publicly, I certainly don't anticipate us going back to the way the world was in 2015 or '16 or '17, where windows were quite lengthy between theatrical and home exhibition, whether it was an a la carte transaction or something else. So we'll have shorter windows for a portion of our slate, 45 days specifically. But then Warner Bros. is also going to be producing for 10 motion pictures that will be on HBO Max on day 1.

At the risk of being repetitive, or I guess consistent, depending on your take, the framework for what I want to cover today should be familiar to you. It's been 4 quarters since we articulated a simplified strategy and how we plan on evaluating our success going forward based on 3 priorities.
First, we wanted to grow subscriber relationships through our 3 market focus areas of 5G, fiber and HBO Max. Second, we initiated an effort to transform our business to be effective and efficient in everything we do so that we could allocate increased resources to support these focus areas. And third, we committed to deliberate capital allocation to support increased investment in growth, improve returns, narrow our operating focus and restore flexibility to our balance sheet. To achieve these priorities, we made some difficult near-term decisions to set our businesses up for success in the coming years. And that success is defined by improving our competitive position to the investment in best-in-class products and experiences for our customers. By doing so, we believe the execution of this strategy will drive better returns and profitable long-term growth.
Let's look at what we've achieved in the past year on Slide 4. We made notable progress in each of our priorities. In wireless, we're gaining share, lowering churn and had our best 12 months of postpaid phone net adds in more than a decade. We just posted record quarterly wireless EBITDA. In fiber, customers have similarly responded to the combination of a premium service at attractive prices, and we've grown our base by more than 1 million subscribers. By year-end, we have expanded our fiber footprint by 3 million consumer and business customer locations. And just over a year after launch, we've grown our domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers by 10.7 million. We transformed HBO from a $6 billion business that was not growing to an $8 billion run rate business that grew at nearly 40% this quarter. 
We've also made solid initial progress in our cost-transformation efforts, which have produced $2 billion in savings that we've reinvested into our core growth areas. We're streamlining our operations and effectively growing digital fulfillment channels. Our NPS scores have improved significantly, and our fiber customers continue to rate us #1 in customer satisfaction. Churn levels have dropped substantially, too. Our second quarter postpaid phone churn matched a record low. And in broadband, we had our lowest churn on record and the highest second quarter fiber gross adds ever. At WarnerMedia, we continue to deliver great content. In the first half of the year, we introduced hit series, such as Mare of Easttown and Hacks. And our lineup in the back half of the year is even stronger with new seasons of popular series such as Succession, Raised by Wolves, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Love Life. That's on top of the day and date movies we'll have on the platform, such as Space Jam: A New Legacy, The Suicide Squad, Dune and Matrix 4. 
When the Emmy's were announced last week, HBO Max and HBO led the field with 130 nominations, the most of any network or platform. In total, WarnerMedia received more than 180 nominations. I'm really proud of the way the team is executing. And speaking of good execution, we're seeing indications that our DIRECTV deal with TPG might close in the next few weeks ahead of what we expected. Also, we're pleased with the new management team's ability to exceed operational expectations since we announced the transaction. 
Our intention with WarnerMedia is the same. We want to hit a strong exit velocity for both of these businesses, at which point the combination with the right partner only expands the respective opportunities for success going forward. And we continue to invest at strong levels. More than $60 billion in the last 12 months in 5G wireless, including spectrum, fiber and premium content.
Finally, we announced or closed a number of noncore asset dispositions, supporting our path to balance sheet flexibility. At the same time, we've positioned each of our 3 major businesses, AT&T Communications, WarnerMedia and DIRECTV, the right capital structure, the right assets, the right management team. And in the case of the latter 2, the right partners to optimize their returns to drive material value creation going forward. These decisions were not easy. And in some cases, they compelled us to rethink how to best deliver returns to our shareholders, leading us to balance long-term value creation with an attractive dividend.
As our second quarter results demonstrate, the momentum in our strategic areas of focus is real, supporting our view that we have the right business strategy and capital structure in place for longer-term success. Today, we're updating our 2021 outlook for our consolidated business, but our work is far from over. We know that consistent execution is the only way to win and keep our investors' confidence in the strategy we put forth. I couldn't be more pleased with the progress we're making.
I'll turn it over to Pascal to discuss the details of the quarter. Pascal?"

In the second quarter, we saw impressive growth across Mobility, Fiber and HBO Max. We added nearly 800,000 postpaid phones. That's our best second quarter in more than 10 years. Subscriber momentum continues t",1520,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we saw impressive growth across Mobility, Fiber and HBO Max. We added nearly 800,000 postpaid phones. That's our best second quarter in more than 10 years. Subscriber momentum continues to be strong, and we continue to take share. The gross adds are up, churn is at record low levels, and our average promotional spend per net add is significantly lower than a year ago, thanks to the consistency in our offerings.
The story with Fiber remains much the same. We continue to see solid subscriber growth with most of those customers new to AT&T. And broadband revenues grew more than 8%. HBO Max continues to exceed our expectations. Having surpassed the lower end of our global subscriber target 6 months ahead of plan, we are now raising our expectations to 70 million to 73 million global subscribers by the end of the year. We also launched our domestic ad-supported version of HBO Max as well as our international offering in 39 Latin American territories at the end of the quarter. That sets us up for additional customer growth as our addressable market expand. 
Let's now turn to Slide 7 for our consolidated financial results. Last year, we saw the brunt of the pandemic's impact on our Q2 results. While the pandemic is still having some impact on our results, we're seeing our businesses emerge stronger than before, with growth accelerating in our market focus areas. Revenues were up more than $3 billion or 7.6% from a year ago. Gains in WarnerMedia, Mobility and Consumer Wireline more than offset declines in video and legacy business services. Adjusted EBITDA declined mostly due to pandemic impacted timing of sports cost in last year's second quarter. We'll talk more about that in a moment, but we expect most of that to reverse itself next quarter. In fact, we expect consolidated EBITDA to be flat to up modestly next quarter and improving thereafter.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.89. That's up more than 7% year-over-year. This includes about $200 million of pretax gains, principally from mark-to-market gains on benefit plan investments. Adjustments for the quarter included a $4.6 billion pretax noncash write-down of the Vrio assets based on our sales transaction announced yesterday.
Cash flows continue to be resilient. Cash from operations came in at $10.9 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow was $7 billion, even with a $2.4 billion increase in WarnerMedia cash content investment. Our dividend payout ratio was about 55%. Cash flows this quarter were also impacted by the capitalization of interest of about $250 million associated with our recent C-band spectrum purchases, which are recorded as investing activities. This accounting treatment stops once the spectrum is deployed.
Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communications business on Slide 8. Our Communications segment grew revenues, driven by gains in Mobility and Consumer Wireline. Mobility growth continues to accelerate, and we delivered another terrific quarter. Our simple postpaid phone offers continue to resonate with customers. Revenues were up more than 10%, with service revenues growing 5%. Postpaid phone churn marked a record low, and we continue to have strong customer growth, especially in our postpaid phone base. Our postpaid phone customer net adds improved by nearly 1 million year-over-year. 
And EBITDA is up $200 million, our highest EBITDA quarter on record. This growth came without a material return in international roaming revenues and a difficult comparison to last year's Q2 that included more than $100 million of gains on tower sales. As you think about the balance of the year, keep in mind, we are expecting a normal handset introduction cycle in the third quarter versus last year's fourth quarter launch. Also, on the timing front, we expect our recent agreement with DISH to provide a boost to wireless service revenues in 2022.
Business Wireline continues to deliver consistent margins and solid EBITDA, even as customers transition away from higher-margin legacy services and products. We saw a sequential improvement in both EBITDA and EBITDA margins. Year-over-year comparisons were impacted by benefits related to the pandemic in the year ago quarter. We expect similar challenging comps in the third quarter. However, with continued product rationalization and cost management, we're very comfortable with maintaining Business Wireline margins in the high 30% for the remainder of the year.
Our Fiber growth continues to be solid. We added 246,000 Fiber customers in the quarter. Broadband ARPU grew by 6.1% year-over-year. Our aggregate fiber penetration rate is now more than 36%, up from about 31% a year ago. And nearly 80% of net adds are new AT&T broadband customers. We've reached a major inflection point in our Consumer Wireline business. Broadband revenue growth now surpasses legacy declines. This helped drive Consumer Wireline revenues up 2.9%. We expect broadband revenues to continue to outpace legacy decline. EBITDA trends are also expected to continue improving as we make our way through the second half of the year.
Let's move to WarnerMedia's results, which are on Slide 9. We feel really good about our execution at WarnerMedia coming out of the pandemic. Subscription, advertising and content revenues have accelerated. Customers love HBO Max, and subscriber growth is exceeding expectations. And we had a successful launch of both our ad-supported and international HBO Max offerings late in the quarter. Revenues were up more than 30%, thanks to higher subscription, advertising and content revenues. Direct-to-Consumer subscription revenues grew nearly 40%, reflecting the success of HBO Max. Advertising revenues were up nearly 50%, driven by sports. And upfront negotiations so far have been really strong. Content and other revenues were up 35%, reflecting the recovery of TV production and theatrical releases. 
The return of sports had a big impact on advertising revenues and EBITDA in the quarter. In fact, sports contributed more than $400 million of advertising revenues, and we incurred sports costs of $1.1 billion in the quarter. So discrete losses from sport increased more than $600 million year-over-year due to last year's suspension of sports in the second quarter. We expect most of that to reverse itself in the third quarter as the prior year third quarter included the restart of the NBA season.
We now have 47 million domestic HBO Max and HBO subscribers and more than 67 million worldwide subscribers, and domestic ARPU is just a little less than $12. Our ad-supported international offerings were launched too late in the quarter to have much of an impact on the second quarter results, but we're enthusiastic about their prospects, given the initial receptivity. As mentioned earlier, we are raising our subscriber growth expectations for the year. We're seeing good momentum, especially in our Latin American markets. We expect most of our subscriber growth for the remainder of the year to be from lower ARPU subscribers in that region. To lean into HBO Max fast start in Latin America, we may push back our launch in some European markets until early 2022. This shift is factored into our revised HBO Max subscriber guidance for the year. 
Now let's shift to guidance. As John mentioned, we updated our consolidated guidance for the year. Let's discuss that on Slide 10. As a reminder, our guidance for 2021 is on a business-as-usual basis and includes a full year contribution from DIRECTV. Based on the momentum we're seeing across our operations, we now expect consolidated revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range, up from the initial 1% guidance. We also expect wireless service revenue growth of 3% for the year, up from about 2%. Adjusted EPS is now expected to increase in the low to mid-single-digit range. That's up from our earlier guidance of stable with 2020. Gross capital investment expectations remain in the $22 billion range, and we now expect about $27 billion in free cash flows for the year.
Also, we now have better clarity on the projected close of the DIRECTV transaction. We expect the transaction to close in early August. Here is the expected impact from excluding 5 months of DIRECTV on the consolidated financial guidance we just laid out. Revenues are expected to be lower by $9 billion. EBITDA is expected to be lower by $1 billion. Free cash flow is also expected to be lower by about $1 billion, equating to $26 billion for the full year. We expect no change to our updated adjusted EPS guidance as benefits from the accounting treatment related to the NFL Sunday ticket are largely expected to be offset by certain fixed costs that were previously allocated to DIRECTV. 
Capital investment guidance is also expected to remain the same. Obviously, the actual financial impact could vary depending upon DIRECTV's performance, the actual close date and other considerations. We recognize the financial structure of the DIRECTV transaction is complex. That is why we included some incremental details on cash and dividend distribution terms in our press release. Shortly after we close the deal, we plan on providing pro forma historical financials to help your modeling going forward.
Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A."

So first, let me just kind of start out and step back and say having watched some of the comments over the last couple of days, let me frame one thing. We have been in the wholesale business since as long as I've been working for this company,",901,"Sure, John. So first, let me just kind of start out and step back and say having watched some of the comments over the last couple of days, let me frame one thing. We have been in the wholesale business since as long as I've been working for this company, and the wholesale business has been very good to our company, and it's a very important element of how we manage our returns and how we kind of think about attracting the right kind of scale in our business moving forward. And that is both true in the fixed and wireless business. And we've been cognizant of percentages of traffic that we have in various aspects of our business and always try to maintain a balance. And I would say my experience with this company and looking at the relationships we've had from a wholesale perspective, we've always managed to strike relationships that we think are win-win relationships for the parties involved. 
Second thing I would say is I believe that DISH is going to be a company that, in their business model, what they choose to do moving forward is going to be successful, one way or the other. And my point of view, when we start thinking about the wholesale business is, when somebody is going to be successful, it's always nice for us to be successful along with them. 
We think there's an accretive way to do that drives a reasonable return back into the business and, again, manages the balance of that traffic in the aggregate of the business. And I think we've achieved that in this case. And frankly, given the nature of their business and where they are in its maturity and what our interests are and ultimately aggregating as much traffic on our networks is possible, I'm looking forward to demonstrating to DISH that we can be a good partner, that we can carry the right kind of traffic, and we can do things to help them grow their infrastructure over time on parts of our network where they may not have ready access to infrastructure that we can ultimately support them with. 
And I think that's a good thing for AT&T over the long haul, given the nature of our business and what we've done and the balance that we like to keep between retail and wholesale traffic. The construct around this particular agreement, as you should think about it is, as you know, it was set up so that, as DISH continues to build their own infrastructure for own and operate, they need places to put traffic. And so while this is a 10-year agreement that's discussed, I think, in the disclosures,it's a minimum commitment per year, one should think about this as probably being something that's more front-end loaded than back-end loaded in terms of how that commitment retires. And I think you should also think about it in terms of DISH has established with us a minimum annual commitment. 
That's not the necessarily the annual commitment or the maximum annual commitment. And a lot of this will be based on our effective performance with them and ultimately what they choose to do in the market. But frankly, we aspire to possibly see that be something greater than what those minimum levels are that have been put in place, but this was a comfortable construct that I think both parties could agree to get started and establish all the practices and processes that are necessary to have an effective wholesale arrangement like this. And I think that we need to demonstrate that we can do well and ultimately see that grow.
And I don't want to speak on behalf of DISH or Charlie. I'm sure he will, when he has a chance to comment on that. But I believe one of the reasons they view this as being a good move for them is their assessment of where things were in the industry is. They felt like we could be a very capable and more capable partner than their current arrangement. And they have motivations for a business reason to continue to deepen that relationship with us. 
I would go on to say, as we think about what we do with them on this relationship going forward, there are a lot of options that we can explore. Spectrum is certainly one that's open. We have a variety of spectrum licenses where our existing radio infrastructure can ultimately deploy and put to use some of their spectrum. That's been done through the pandemic. We have options to do some of that as well as we move forward. And look, I don't think any of us know over the course of a longer-term relationship what's going to happen to other regs and specs on spectrum. 
And I think parties will keep their mind open as those evolutions occur and look for some other options to pursue. But right now, we know what we need to do with the wholesale agreement. But frankly, it's really no different than any other wholesale agreement that's in the market like what maybe Verizon does with Cable or what we've done with other entities that have elected to use this on a wholesale basis. Jeff, do you want to add anything to that? Your team did a great job pulling it together. Is there anything you would add?"

And I think you're probably familiar enough with these things. But right now, it's a lot of work with the regulatory agencies and document production, and providing information that's responsive to their request so that they can begin their reviews. And all that is underway. There's nothing we see in that that's been particularly problematic nor is it far enough along, where I think you can effectively say that anybody has developed any position or point of view on something. 
So we continue to move through, and I would tell you, internally, all the normal steps are going on to be prepared operationally for when we would expect an approval. I think, as I indicated when we announced the transaction, Simon, we expected it was going to be next year and probably close to a full year review to get this done. And I don't have any reason to suggest it's going to be anything other than that at this point.  
We've had some interesting and pleasant surprises. In some cases, I think we moved through the DIRECTV process a little bit faster than what we had expected. It's not a complicated transaction. I think that certainly supports it. And if we were to be fortunate enough to do that because of the straightforward nature of the transaction. We'll take it, and we'll be prepared for that if that were to happen. But at this point, I'm expecting it's going to be a full and fulsome review. And we'll run through the process as we normally do and get to the end of it and probably have, as we approach the latter part of it, a little bit more insight for you as to what's going on.

They do this day in and day out for a living, and that is scaled compute. And as you know, over the last several years, our labs, organizations and our network team has been hard at work virtualizing our core network functions. 
What this deal essentially does is it brings Microsoft to the edge of our network and supporting our network workloads at a scaled level for efficiency. And as a partner in this, our engineers and their engineers are developing this solution on a broad scale across the business, across the network. We're going to enjoy some anchor tenant benefits from that. We're not disclosing any specific financial details. But one thing that we are not doing, and I've kind of read this in the trade and the press a bit, is we're not outsourcing our core network functions. We are relying upon Microsoft to develop scale compute and storage capabilities at the edge, while we retain control of our network stack and the kinds of services and products that we're going to offer to the market.  
And as John has shared over the last 4 quarters, our focus here is to put our energy on the things that differentiate our service. And by doing this, it enables us to reallocate resources that we want or attempting to build. Scale, network, cloud compute capabilities, we rely on Microsoft for that in their Azure for Operators capability going forward. And our product development teams, our engineers really work on a service layer and the kinds of products and services that we intend to provide with our fiber and 5G network to consumers and to our enterprise customers."

And I've got to tell you, it just continues to prove to be sustainable. When I think about it, and I'd encourage you to think about it as 3 simple elements. And the first is we have simplified our offers in the market, and we remained consistent in our offer constructs over the last 4 quarters, despite really a highly active and a competitive environment. 
But the second element that I think is sometimes overlooked is our persistent focus on the customer experience. And that is execution across our sales and distribution channels, our newly formed a year ago customer advocacy teams working the grind on, improving the experience of our products and our services. And then our network organization, it just continues to put the capital into the ground and drive, for a third year in a row, the nation's best network.
And those 2 things combined have responded and continued positive responses from the market and the end customers, both our existing subscriber base, as I think all are aware of, but also those of other competitors who are choosing to join the AT&T network. And we've been able to achieve and sustain taking share in multiple segments. It's across the board. It's not in any one particular segment. We're growing in consumer. We're growing in small business. 
We're growing with our FirstNet position. We're growing in enterprise. And as Pascal mentioned earlier, we've set a 10-year record for net add growth here in the second quarter, but we've also set a record for our churn and the NPS results that customers are giving us for our wireless products and services. And so in short, the customers themselves are telling us that we're doing something right.
When you grow the top line revenue growth through the subscriber growth, remembering that we are third place in market share. We've got just a little over 27.5% of the market. Our growth trajectory right now is roughly 35%, 36% share of net adds. We're doing it also efficiently. And through our transformation program and our distribution optimization, we're able to mine dollars out of the operations to support this growth and drive EBITDA growth at record levels here in the second quarter, year-over-year as well as sequentially. And so this operating leverage that we've achieved gives us confidence that this model is sustainable but we've got a lot of work to do. So I mentioned, we sole have a third place share position in the market. We haven't made our way fully through upgrading our existing customer base on unlimited plans.
We still are early in the cycle of upgrading our base on to the 5G devices. And so teams are doing a great job, we are satisfied, very -- I feel very strong about our position in the market, but we're staying focused on what customers want. And as long as we're getting the positive response, we're going to stick with it."

I think, secondly, the postpaid strength, clearly, there's been some suppression in the prepaid market as I think value when things occur, there has been some movement in that direction. Third, look, you got to adjust some of these numbers in the industry when you think about how many customer lines are actually what I would call an economic decision to pay for versus not pay for.

A lot of it on prepaid before AT&T was a larger provider in the prepaid category. So when you evaluated the deal this time with DISH, how did you consider whether or not DISH would be a competitor that may be more complementary to the addressable market that you're going after, relative to a competitor that may be going directly after this same broad set of customers and revenue that AT&T currently pursues?"

We have not made the choice or decision to launch wide-scale fixed wireless Internet, but rest assured that the strength of our wireless network is providing options for us as we migrate some of our legacy wireline DSL customers off of that technology over to a better technology, served up with fiber or wireless. And where it doesn't make sense for us to invest in fiber for the long term in certain demographic areas or market areas, we choose to serve that with wireless, and we'll leverage the 5G existing network that we've got with our sub-6 spectrum strength.

I think we do things that are complementary in terms of we think they're accretive opportunities to bring profitable traffic on the network. But our portfolio of owned and operated services, frankly, covers the breadth of whatever a customer needs. I mean there isn't really a customer base that we couldn't go out and sell an owned and operated service to. And we've been in that position for some period of time. We have a very strong prepaid business, which plays in the value segment. We have a variety of different prepaid offers that are out there. We have great postpaid offers that cover a full gamut of things. So yes, there are other operators out there that on a resale or MVNO basis go and attack other market segments, but I'd like to compete for those customers on an owned and operated basis as well. And that's always been the case.
Now I think where we're at in the U.S. market maybe a little bit different than others is there is kind of a direction towards more owned and operated competition and resale and MVNO operation. And as a result of that occurring, the number of wholesale options, I would say, moving forward in the future, are going to become a little bit more concentrated. And so you're probably going to see where you choose to put that wholesale traffic on your network to be fewer options to go out and pursue different partners. And as a result of that, if you want to continue to have an element of wholesale consistency in your market -- and to Jeff's point, if you have some excess capacity that you can put to use and use it for either a fixed cost coverage or driving up incremental traffic in a place where you have some valid capacity, you're going to obviously choose to do that. And I think that's the case here.
And as I would also tell you, when you think about this relationship, a broader wholesale capability beyond just the wireless business is a part of this, which is really attractive to us as an infrastructure provider. It's something we do in our core. And there are opportunities for us to think about, again, as we deploy -- as DISH deploys network infrastructure and where they go, for us to do some things that I think are complementary and helpful to both businesses."

In terms of learnings from LatAm so far, at an overall level, we're feeling very good about the launch, albeit it was only 2 days before the end of the quarter. And so obviously, we're not sharing details for this call. But in terms of the biggest lessons, number one is the content and the stories that we have on the service. The team did a remarkable job in terms of planning for this launch and making sure that we put our best foot forward in terms of not only original new productions, but also an incredible library.
And then the other 3 things I'd mention is distribution, obviously, is key. And we certainly lined up a healthy distribution partnerships ahead throughout Latin America. The tech and product works, and it's a modern experience that we're very proud of. And finally, you've got to have the value. It's the value proposition, it's a very strong one in Latin America. And so to your last question, Doug, in terms of incrementality in HBO migrations. We're seeing material incremental subscriber additions. And so again, not for this call and not at this moment, but certainly for the next quarter."

Because it certainly seems like that's an opportunity for the company. And then just as a follow-up on the WarnerMedia side, you're 6 months into going day and date with the theatrical slate on HBO Max and in the theaters. I know that was a strategy that was unique to this year, but I was hoping you could give us some insight into what you've learned from that and how that might shape your view on what a more permanent strategy should be in terms of thinking about the theatrical release slate going forward."

We are currently deploying some of the early stages, our next 3 million bill that we've disclosed for this year. As we cited earlier at Analyst Day, the bulk of that inventory is going to come online towards the back half of the year. And so my expectations are that our net add performance takes a step up as that inventory comes online. Having said that, the thing that's really strong for us and exciting is: one, product continues to be durable, as you point out. It's the best technology. It's a great price value proposition. It's got the highest NPS scores in the industry. Two, 80% of our net performance here in the first half of the year is actually new relationships to AT&T. And that's given us an opportunity to move into those households with the best-in-class fixed broadband service as well as offer up some of the other products and services like wireless. And so each of these execution elements, we believe, are going to continue to perform and continue to improve. This is not a quarterly game. This is a long-term plan, and we're just building momentum quarter-to-quarter."

Godzilla vs. Kong, which we released this quarter, it's done over $463 million in revenue at the theaters. And so clearly, motion pictures matter and will continue to matter when it comes to theatrical exhibition. They also matter at home. And absolutely, in terms of the response that we've gotten not just from that title, but from all of our day-and-date titles. We feel very good about the response that consumers have given it in the home.
In terms of the things in terms of where things go in the future, I think it's fair to say that -- and I've said this before publicly. I certainly don't anticipate us going back to the way the world was in 2015 or '16 or '17, where windows were quite lengthy between theatrical and home exhibition, whether it was an a la carte transaction or something else. So we'll have shorter windows for a portion of our slate, 45 days specifically. But then Warner Bros. is also going to be producing for 10 motion pictures that will be on HBO Max on Day 1. And so I think that what you're going to see is this industry continue to evolve and to continue to innovate in ways that not only works for consumers and fans, but also works for our business partners."

I'll be brief because the quarter is largely more of the same. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of consistent progress since we articulated our simplified business strategy and how we plan to measure our progress going forward. 
The close of the DIRECTV transaction this quarter is another important step we've completed to reposition AT&T. I acknowledge, this makes for some extra cycles on comparative analysis. And as we continue to do so, there will be fewer moving parts to assess in better visibility and clarity. In the meantime, it's important not to lose sight of the success we're having, deploying capital into our areas of strategic focus. Bottom line, we're accelerating our historical rates of customer growth in Mobility, Fiber and HBO Max, and customer satisfaction is improving across the board with lower churn and higher NPS scores. 
Mobility is delivering more postpaid phone customers on a rolling 12-month run rate than it has in the prior decade. Our Fiber products are recognized as best-in-class. As we expand our Fiber footprint, we're delivering a superior service and we're growing our share. We're already nearing the low end of our 2021 guidance for global HBO Max and HBO subscribers, despite our long planned intent to no longer seed customer control through Amazon's channels offering. Additionally, customer growth can be attributed in part to our ability to mine out significant cost savings from our operations and reinvest them back into the business. The results are driving Mobility and Consumer Wireline EBITDA growth that we expect to be complemented by margin expansion as our transformation work matures. 
We have clear line of sight to achieving at least half of our $6 billion cost savings run rate target by the end of this year, driven by success with a number of initiatives that we believe also will support improving returns in the coming years. Whether they stem from nearly $1 billion of savings from streamlining our field operations, a similar level of savings from changes made to our procurement processes or $0.5 billion of savings from the rationalization of our retail store footprint, our focus on driving out inefficiencies is showing tangible results. These are just a few of the most significant programs underway. More initiatives that we expect will drive incremental savings and operating leverage are in the investment and implementation phase. 
Finally, as I mentioned, we've closed the DIRECTV transaction and continue to expect the WarnerMedia deal to close by midyear 2022. With these and other dispositions, we monetized or announced plans to monetize more than $55 billion of assets over the past year. The last 5 quarters have been a period of repositioning our business, while also delivering operational results, without repositioning nearing completion that will afford even more focus on continued execution and improved performance. 
We're on track to reach our full year free cash flow guidance in the $26 billion range, and we expect to hit the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance. We're in the early innings of transforming the company and believe that we have significant opportunity ahead of us to expand share in our focus areas and drive better returns, including sustained earnings growth. We continue to strive to earn your confidence 1 quarter at a time, delivering operating performance and shows our momentum is real and sustainable. 
Let me now turn it over to Pascal to discuss the details of the quarter. Pascal?"

Before we get to our consolidated results, let's look at the progress in our market focus areas on Slide 5. As John mentioned, we continued our strong customer momentum in the third quarter with 928,000 postpai",1352,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to our consolidated results, let's look at the progress in our market focus areas on Slide 5. As John mentioned, we continued our strong customer momentum in the third quarter with 928,000 postpaid phone net adds. That's our best net adds quarter in over 10 years. Customers like the strength of our network and our consistent, simple offers. Gross adds are up, churn is low, and we continue to take share and grow our customer base. 
Our Fiber base also continues to expand. Broadband revenues grew by more than 7%, and we now have 5.7 million AT&T Fiber customers, with 3.4 million of them on 1-gig connection. And we saw sequential growth in our Fiber net adds with most of those new to AT&T. 
Let's now look at our HBO Max/HBO global subscribers. As we said last quarter, most of the subscriber additions for the remainder of the year are expected to come from our lower ARPU international base. We've reached nearly 70 million global subscribers, thanks to growth in our international markets. As previously announced, domestic subscribers were down due to our proactive decision to shut down the Amazon wholesale platform. This was partially offset by new wholesale relationships. 
Retail subscriber growth slowed down the timing of new content, but we expect retail subscriber growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter due to strong content slate. We have new seasons of success in the Curb Your Enthusiasm debuting, the return of Sex and the City as well as the much-anticipated premieres of Dune, King Richard and the Matrix Resurrection. Given our upcoming content slate and expanding global footprint, we expect to end the year at the higher end of our year-end global subscriber target. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for our consolidated financial results. The third quarter results reflect the closing of the DIRECTV transaction after the first month of the quarter. We're a smaller company today than we were at the beginning of the quarter, and that is reflected in our results. Excluding DIRECTV revenues, revenues were up about $1.7 billion or 5%, thanks to growth in our market-focused areas. Gains in Mobility, Warner Media and Consumer Wireline more than offset the clients in Business Wireline and from the disposition of other businesses. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.87. That's up more than 14% year-over-year. In addition to merger-amortization adjustments for the quarter, adjustments were made to exclude our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization, a gain on the sale of Playdemic and the an actuarial gain on benefit plans. When you exclude DIRECTV from both periods, adjusted EBITDA was up 3% year-over-year, mostly due to growth in Mobility and strong growth at WarnerMedia, reflecting partial recovery from the pandemic and the timing of sports costs. 
Cash from operations came in at $9.9 billion for the quarter. Spending was up, both year-over-year and sequentially with CapEx of $4.7 billion and gross capital investments totaling $5.7 billion. Free cash flow was $5.2 billion, inclusive of year-over-year increases of $850 million in CapEx and $1.7 billion investment in WarnerMedia cash content. Year-to-date, our content investment has increased by more than $4 billion. Additionally, our leverage position also benefited from $10 billion in asset monetization in the quarter, including our DIRECTV TPG transaction. 
Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communications business on Slide 7. Our Mobility business continues to gain steam. Revenues were up 7% with service revenues growing 4.6%. Postpaid phone churn remained at record low levels, and we had record postpaid phone growth. Prepaid also continued to be a solid performer for us, especially our Cricket brand. We added 249,000 prepaid phones in the quarter. Prepaid phone churn is less than 3%, with Cricket churn even lower. 
Mobility EBITDA is up nearly $300 million or 3.6% year-over-year, driven by growth in service revenues and transformation savings. We expect that growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter. This growth came even with increased volumes, 3G shutdown costs of nearly $200 million, higher costs associated with the return of the iPhone launch into the third quarter and without a material return in international roaming. We expect similar quarterly 3G shutdown costs through the first quarter of 2022. 
Business Wireline continues to deliver consistent margins in the high 30s and solid EBITDA. The business did see some difficult year-over-year comparison, given pandemic-related benefits experienced last year. We have been very aggressive in proactively rationalizing our portfolio of low-margin products. This creates incremental pressure on our near-term revenues. But at the same time, it allows us to focus on our core network and transport services products. It will take several quarters for us to work through this initiative. But as we lap the beginning of this process that began late last year, we should see improving revenue trends in Business Wireline. 
Our Fiber growth was solid. We had our highest Fiber gross adds ever, and we continue to win share wherever we have fiber. We added 289,000 Fiber customers in the quarter, and more than 70% of Fiber net adds are new AT&T broadband customers, and this gives us great confidence as we continue to build out our fiber footprint. 
Last quarter, we reached a major inflection point in our Consumer Wireline business, where broadband revenue growth now surpasses legacy declines. Total Consumer Wireline revenues are up again this quarter, growing 3.4%. This quarter also reached an inflection point on broadband profit as EBITDA grew 3.8%. We expect sequential EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter, but it will be a tougher year-over-year comparison due to a onetime pandemic-related benefit in last year's fourth quarter. 
Let's move to WarnerMedia results, which are on Slide 8. WarnerMedia revenues were up 14%, led by strong DTC growth and content licensing Direct-to-Consumer subscription revenues grew about 25%, reflecting the continued success of HBO Max. Content and other revenues were up 32%, reflecting higher TV licensing and the recovery of TV production and theatrical releases. 
Advertising revenues were down nearly 12%, mostly due to the timing of sports. You may recall that the prior year third quarter included the restart of the NBA Season and the playoffs, which returned to a more traditional schedule this year. This lowered sports cost in the quarter, which helped WarnerMedia grow EBITDA by 13.5%. 
The third quarter also included the impact of more than $200 million in DIRECTV advertising revenue sharing costs. With the close of the DIRECTV transaction, WarnerMedia continues to represent and sell DIRECTV's advertising inventory and now compensates DIRECTV through a revenue-share arrangement. This revenue share is now recorded as an expense to WarnerMedia. 
We launched HBO Max in Latin America late June and have had incredible success. And next week, we are launching new international markets in Spain and the Nordic region, with more new markets to come in 2022. 
Now before we get to your questions, just a few words about guidance. 3 quarters into the year, we feel good about customer momentum and where we stand relative to our guidance provided last quarter. With our strong performance, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be at the high end of our previous guidance of low- to mid-single-digit growth range. And that's with significant costs expected to be incurred in launching HBO Max in Europe. Additionally, we expect more than $350 million of advertising sharing costs associated with WarnerMedia's new advertising sharing arrangement with DIRECTV as well as continued costs associated with shutting down our 3G network. 
Also keep in mind, last year's fourth quarter benefited from the advertising associated with the U.S. presidential election. And as mentioned earlier, we are on track with our free cash flow target of around $26 billion as well. 
In addition to the fourth quarter being a traditionally stronger free cash flow quarter, we expect the FirstNet reimbursement of approximately $1 billion, lower year-over-year cost from the iPhone launch moving up to the third quarter this year and DIRECTV cash distribution of approximately $800 million.

So when you think about all those things, you should get a sense that, from here, the momentum of the business continues, and we feel really good about it. Our customers are growing. Our revenues are growing, and we continue to take costs out of the business. So over time, it's going to translate to improvement in not only top line, but we will see profit growth."

This is Jason on the AVOD question, which is we've been happy with the launch, which was in June of this year. So this is the first full quarter. And we're happy not just in terms of the absolute response, in terms of subscribers, but also because advertising helps lower the price and increase the value for an HBO Max subscription. So we see it as rather strategic, and we're very excited about where that goes. 
One thing that is interesting to note, John, is that until the end of the year, there is a slight difference in the product of ad-supported HBO Max in that the movie, specifically Matrix, King Richard and Dune, are not part of the ad-supported offering. So there will be full content parity starting in late January of 2022. So we're very happy with the results, and we're quite excited about the future as well. 
And then you also asked about our results. If you assume taking into account the Amazon Prime video channels exit, we haven't commented specifically on the size of the subscribers coming from Amazon Prime video channels. But I think it's safe to say that we're very happy with the quarter. When you think about how we've grown 1.9 million worldwide, and even when you think about the Amazon exit, which we think is a very strategic decision that 3 companies really have made so far, which includes Disney and Netflix being the other 2, we feel very good about the quarter."

To address that question, I kind of back out for a second and look at the health of our wireless business in the context of the overall industry and to tell you that our strategy is working here at AT&T. As we demonstrated, it's the fifth consecutive quarter where we have driven some momentum and gaining share our net add strength here in the quarter at 928,000. And that compares to what we have produced back in 2019 in the third quarter of 101,000. And we're driving strong service revenue growth, and we just posted the largest total EBITDA that we've generated out of the wireless business segment. 
The best part about it, Phil, is that our customers are telling us that we're doing a good job. This churn levels that are low are a signal to the service and the value that we're offering. And our NPS feedback that we've received is the highest that we've ever received. 
The sustainability of what we've done here in AT&T, I think, is really important to understand more broadly. It's a question that keeps coming up about our growth relative to competition in the general market. It's important to note that we've optimized our distribution channels. We've expanded the reach of it, and we're now addressing new segments that we were not addressing earlier, and that's helping us drive some of our customer momentum. 
But in combination to that, Phil, we've simplified our rate plans, and we remain consistent in our offers to the market over the last 13 months, if you will. And this really enables the AT&T frontline team members to master their craft, deliver a higher level of service. And that -- this can't be overlooked. This is a key component to what's driving momentum for us at AT&T in our business. 
I'd also point to things like our FirstNet program. We're starting to reach some scale here. Third quarter, we posted the highest net-add quarter since launching the program. We've arrived at a position of leadership and strength in the law enforcement segment under that public safety sector. And so all in all, it's been the operational changes that we've made at AT&T that has driven really strong momentum in our customer counts. 
The promotions that you referred to, there's an aspect of promotions that's just 1 element of this broader strategy. And it's important to note that not all of our customers that are with us, that upgrade or that join us from competitors, take advantage of the promotional offers that you see in the market. We've been at this for a little over a year now. And I can tell you that I've studied the characteristics of the customers that have taken the promotion versus those that have not taken the promotion in our customer base. 
And here's what I can tell you, that those that have participated in our promotional offers have a higher LTV, a better churn and a higher satisfaction score than those that have not. And so we know this is driving accretive value. The industry is healthy. And better than that, the new accounts to AT&T, those that are joining us from our competitors, they exhibit the same kind of characteristics in their financials: higher LTVs, better churn and higher satisfaction than our base. 
So it's not just that we are adding more customers, we know, based on these metrics that we see, that we're adding high-value customers. And don't believe that this is driven uniquely by any kind of subsidy or extra cash flow that happens to be in the marketplace of the general market. It's also, I think, important, Phil, to note that the cost of these promotions as one element of our strategy, it runs through our service revenue. The cost of those promotions run through that in amortization. And so for us to be able suppose this kind of growth in the quarter in this competitive market and drive this kind of solid performance in subscriber revenue, accounting for any cost of the promotions, gives us confidence that we are accreting value. I would take this kind of quarter all day long in a competitive market, and I'm certain that our shareholders are going to be happy with it."
100231,1674833494,2408806,"AT&T Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","And Phil, I'd just add on that. We're not participating or taking EBV dollars on our postpaid subscribers. And I would say in terms of telecommunications in general and the health, there's clearly a stronger consumer out there because of some of the thing",267,"And Phil, I'd just add on that. We're not participating or taking EBV dollars on our postpaid subscribers. And I would say in terms of telecommunications in general and the health, there's clearly a stronger consumer out there because of some of the things that the federal government has done with the pandemic, the prop-up household income, and that's not -- can't last forever. 
However, if you kind of examine where we are in the infrastructure bill, and you think about what is moving from a federal policy perspective on building better infrastructure, whether or not Congress gets that through, of course, is a question. But if you work under assumption that there seems to be some bipartisan view that we need to do the right things around infrastructure and then broadband and connectivity to the Internet seems to come at the top of the list, I would expect that there's going to be some more federal money that moves into the industry next year. And some of it comes in the form of a direct subsidy to what's considered to be low-income households. That definition of low-income households is a fairly generous definition. It's 200% of the poverty line of the bill that was proposed or written. 
So when you start thinking about that, does that mean that a household, at least in terms of making decisions on telecommunications purchases, might be in a strong perspective next year, the economy continues to be reasonably strong. I don't worry about all of a sudden seeing a reversal or turn around the aggregate spending power on telecommunication services."

The general progress on the deal, I think, is consistent with what we would have expected as we walked into it. As we indicated in our opening remarks, we're moving through the steps with the various regulatory agencies, both domestically in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Those processes are moving along at the pace we would have expected and don't see any surprises around it. As you might guess, regulatory agencies are doing their typical overview around that. And we feel really comfortable around the back and forth and what's been produced, the time lines and the milestones we've hit around those things. 
I would not expect that we would be giving details around kind of our view of the construct of the deal until we're a little further along in that process, and we have some degree of visibility that we know that there's going to be a positive affirmation of the deal coming out. And we're getting into that, let's call it the window, where we know we're in the final back and forth to try to get either a consent decree or approval, whichever comes out of it, to get the transaction moving forward. 
You probably have been around the deal long enough to know that we're not at that point right now, and we're probably not going to be at that point until we get into the early part of next year. And once we have some visibility around that and we can step back at that moment, look at where the stock price is, how things are standing in the market at that point in time, and we're starting to get down to that window where people would need to make a decision, then we'll be giving you some visibility around what we think the right path forward is around that. And obviously, we want to see what also transpires here in Washington over the next couple of months. There's chances that policy may change around how different types of distributions or different approaches get taxed. And all that has to be factored into our overall equation of how do we get value back into the shareholders' pocket in the right way. And the more information we have around that, the better informed that will be, and I think the better it will be for shareholders as they move through it. 
But of course, there'll be notice before we close the transaction. I just wouldn't expect that it's going to be months and months and months before we close the transaction because we obviously want some degree of regulatory certainty. 
And where we are with the build, what the first thing I would probably share with everybody is, we're on this path to substantially increase our fiber footprint. And that stretches across both our consumer and our business base. And I think as you've known from past history, this is -- it's not uncommon for us to go through these ramps of infrastructure builds. We've done it many times before. We've recently been through 1 where we went through a multiyear ramp on fiber builds that we kind of started executing around the 2015 time frame. They always, as you move through the front end of them, have a few moments where they're a little bit lumpy and a little bit rocky because that's the nature of it. These are inherently large civil construction projects, and they're spread out across many municipalities. And there's many permitting agencies and all kinds of things that go on in getting everybody kind of ginned up and ready to go at scale, sometimes take some steps. But at the end of the day, we always get there. 
And I think what's important for the investors to understand is we're on this march to get ourselves into a position where we can deploy fiber at scale and move from where we are right now, which is we won an objective of about 3 million passings a year, and we'll ultimately probably ramp that into 5. But we're looking at other options to see if there's capital efficient ways for us to even take that up a little bit further and do more, but we will get there. And I would ask that we probably not rotate on any given 90-day period as to whether or not it was a good 90 days or a bad 90 days. It's a question around whether or not we scale this up and get to the point that we're starting to deliver new homes into the inventory in a regular fashion. And I'm absolutely convinced that the organization is doing that. 
Are we seeing some supply stress right now in certain places is part of the reason why we guided down to 2.5 million this year? The answer to that is yes. It's coming in interesting places. But the great news is when you're the scale player in the market, we work through those faster and with the preferred position than others. And we're seeing that occur, whether it's chipsets for gateways and homes that are necessary to put a WiFi infrastructure and a modem in place or it's fiber components that are necessary or access to civil engineering, I think we're working through all those in a respectable fashion. 
I can give you an example right now. One of the reasons that we had to kind of deal with a guide down was 1 of our fiber providers was struggling a little bit and getting us the prefabricated portions of the infrastructure that go out into the distribution plan, the last mile, if you will, the parts that go up and down alleys and streets that ultimately connect homes into the network. And there's preassembled components that come in that are pretty spliced, that are put out into the network as we receive them from the manufacturer. We have worked through a lot of those issues, and we, in fact, have an awful lot of that infrastructure, if not all of the 2.5 million that will be placed. But there is a connector piece of that infrastructure that moves from the optical node that ultimately ties that into the distribution neighborhood, which we're running a little bit short on right now. And it's literally a very small section of fiber that splices in the larger distribution. It's frankly larger distribution. It's harder to deploy. There's more labor hours in it. It's what requires more permits and more activity out in neighborhoods, but it's that little connector piece, and we're a little bit short on right now. We're working through with the manufacturer in a collaborative way. We have a lot of plans in place to get that done and get the work completed. But it's one of those things where it's going to be nip and tuck right up until the end of everything we put in. 
But if for some reason, we fall a little short on that, we're not talking about missing the substantial portion of the labor. We're talking about missing a connector that has to be put in that can bring up a lot of houses every time we put 1 more of those in on the network. So we feel good about the ramp. We're going to continue to ramp, and we're going to continue to give you insights to the new homes that are coming in. And we also believe, we're in a very unique position, given that we're the largest provider and builder of fiber out there right now that we're in strength in the industry and what we can command in that supply chain, and we've secured the right kind of relationships to get that done."

In terms of your first question, our approach is consistent with what our approach was a quarter ago, 2 quarters ago, 3 quarters ago. And what I mean by that is that, for us, it's business as usual. We're going to be launching in 6 countries next week in Europe, and we're very excited about that. And we've also publicly announced a number of other European country launches in 2022. So our approach is very much what it had been before. And we're excited, if you take a look at the Latin America results, what expansion across the globe can bring. 
In terms of your second question about our motion picture slate and what have we learned. I'll state the obvious, which is not unique to us, is that we're in the middle of a pandemic, and a pandemic obviously presents very unique circumstances. And as you know well, we have been very much leading in the first over the wall, so to speak, in terms of bringing our 2021 slate to customers in a way that can work for them, but also work for exhibition and work for our participants. And so what we've learned is that motion pictures continue to matter. We believe they're going to matter for decades to come, and we're proudly investing in them. 
In terms of the road forward, we've committed to 2022, and that's the visibility that we have. And that is a combination of 2 things. On one side will be a certain slate of motion pictures that will have an exclusive theatrical run, 45 days. That's quite a bit different from where things were, say, 5 years ago in terms of the theatrical run, then they will come to HBO Max. And then we're also going to have a slate of motion pictures from Warner Bros. That will come directly to HBO Max on day 1. So that's -- those are the answers to your 2 questions, Brett. Thank you for asking."

So there's no pulling the foot off the accelerator in that regard. It is -- HBO Max is the foundation of that business moving forward and how the combined company will continue to go to market. And everything that we do right now to make that product better and add customers is a step in the right direction and the consistent direction of where the closed and combined business goes. And we all want the shareholders that own a substantial portion of that company moving forward to have a valuable asset, one that's growing and one that will be successful in the next generation of media.

And yes, there will be some slight degradation in ARPU. But when you look at our overall ARPU, we're still at the high end of the industry. So that's a consideration to keep in mind. These are very profitable lifetime value subscribers. 
As it relates to Business Wireline, we started about a year ago, starting to rationalize low-profit margin products and services. And that effort continues. The goal would be, over time, more and more of our services in the enterprise space are going to come from our core connectivity product, whether it be wireless or fiber. And that's where the growth is going to come. And it's a process we are partway through, but we think as you get through the latter part of this year to early next year, the comps get a little bit easier. I'll ask Jeff to chime in."

If you look at our Business Wireline business, as we reported segment-wise, we are moving customers, many of our enterprise customers through a product mix shift. We've been doing this for a while.

If you look at our Business Wireline business, as we reported segment-wise, we are moving customers, many of our enterprise customers through a product mix shift. We've been doing this for a while. I think it's important to note that, unlike others, we don't report a consolidated business P&L that includes wireless. And we are actually seeing shift to wireless for many services as many of our customers have moved off and over in the pandemic. That's just a general observation. 
More specifically, David, the 3 parts of our business that we're getting to subscriber growth, revenue growth and then EBITDA growth, we've got first to our business -- our Consumer Wireline and our Mobility moving in that direction. And we are at the cusp of getting our Business Wireline business to move in that direction. It's going to take some time because it's going to require some product mix and product development work, specifically areas of the business markets that we at AT&T serve less were underrepresented or more of the medium-sized businesses in the mid-market. And these customers are more inclined to use shared broadband served up by fiber and our business service -- class services that we sell to our top end enterprise accounts are a bit more bespoke and specific networking networks that are not necessarily attractive to the mid-markets. We have been making moves to shift the product mix in demand. 
And as John mentioned earlier, as our fiber expansion, that's not just for consumer but also for business, begins to take footing, you'll see us shift shares of our revenue in Business Wireline more transactional-based and down market with the execution that we know we can deliver. And so it's going to take a few quarters as we work through it. The cost transformation that we're undertaking inside the Communications company, as Pascal mentioned, we're about halfway through the $6 billion in aggregate for the firm. The back half of the transformation program really brings in more operating efficiencies in our Business Wireline segment that we'll see start to accrete to EBITDA growth in that part of our business."

In terms of the wireless business, what you're seeing in terms of the rate in participation for unlimited plans and the higher value plans? And how much opportunity is in front of the company to upsell customers on these higher value plans that you've been marketing? 
And then just secondly, back in -- I think it was March at the Analyst Day, AT&T set a goal for net debt to end the year at $154 billion at 3x leverage, which infers if you just divide the 3 into the net debt, it's about $51.3 billion of EBITDA ex GTV for the year.

There still remains a large opportunity within our base of customers to work them through a more value, higher end of our rate plans. And you're kind of seeing that play out in postpaid phone ARPU. Pascal touched on this a second ago. 
If you think about maintaining the industry-leading, the highest ARPU of any player in the market, even though we're the third player in wireless, being able to do that with some of these promotional offers that are part of our strategy, gives us confidence that we're working our base and our customers up the ARPU stack into higher-value unlimited rate plans. 
We still have large portions of our subscriber base that we have not migrated into those rate plans. And so we expect that to continue pretty much on the course and speed of what the customer wants. We're not driving or forcing any unnatural behavior there. We're letting the customers choose when it's time for them to take advantage of an offer or to move into a new rate plan, and we'll continue to execute that.

So those are very easily discernible. And then if you look at DTV, we've provided extensive pro forma. 
The thing to keep in mind is when we compute net debt-to-EBITDA, we use the trailing 12 months. In this instance, some of it included DTV for part of the year, and it doesn't include DTV for another part of the year. So that's how you're getting to your 3x.

So I would tell you that a lot of the results you're seeing right now, to Jeff's point, is really better execution of the team going back in and working in some of the asset base to actually improve performance overall. 
Yes, now the midpoint of this year, you're now seeing some new inventory come into play, and we're getting a lot better, as Jeff just described, moving through penetration rates faster. And if we, in fact, sustain that, it's going to make the business case even a stronger business case because one of the big sensitivities to payback is rate to penetration. And if we can keep that going, it can be dramatically better than what we think is already a pretty attractive business case. 
And the last point I would make is the nice part about this build in many instances is that we're filling in a little bit of areas that we maybe didn't complete previously. And so as that fill-in occurs, you get some effectiveness on marketing messages, the ability to go into a market and get your particular value proposition effectively communicated, how you deal with your distribution channels through that.

My view is our job is to execute and return to you results that you look at and say those are really impressive and that's great. And that the business, to the extent that we do that, I fully believe there's more opportunity for us to go out and continue to build infrastructure that's highly capable that can attract business. And I think my belief is that this management team, as we demonstrate in the market, we can do that. 
Do I believe there's an opportunity for us as a company to operate at a 5 million a year range kind of at capacity and what we do? I think we can get there. How we get there and how we scale that and what time frame will be an artifact of what we come back to you and tell you in terms of our results and how much progress we're making around them. And we're going to continue to push forward. But as I work with the management team internally, it's kind of how I'm asking them to think about scaling up their business, running their business, sizing their business, creating vendor relationships that allow us to move that path. And that's the -- it's up to us to execute around that to get there. 
The last -- I'll make a comment just on the other piece, and then turn it to Jeff to get to the bulk of it. We've given you guidance on cash flow for 2022, 2023. And there's obviously questions that many of you are asking, ""Well, can they get to that level?"" And you better believe some of the cost savings stuff is dropping to the bottom line because that's how we get to that level. 
So the back end of this program, while we've used the front end of it to actually increase our market effectiveness and be in a better position in terms of our customer growth and volume, the back end of this program is about actually getting a better efficiency that drops to the bottom line that ultimately comes in play and helps us on the cash flow side. And I think that's how you should think about how we've kind of done that. And there's some structural approaches that we're using on the higher longer-term issues like changing out IT infrastructure and data structures, et cetera, that's harder and longer work, but tends to also have more operating leverage once it goes into service, and we get it done. And that's really what's underneath it. Jeff, why don't you go ahead and find any additional color you might want to add, I'm talking."

With that, first of all, thank you all for joining us this morning and appreciate your questions and your interest in the business. And as I said at the start of the call, I think in some respects, the quarter is more of the same. It's been consistent focus and consistent execution. And I would say, I'm really pleased with our progress overall on how the team is executing. There are a lot of moving parts, and there have been some distractions, but I really am pleased across the board, whether in the Communications company and Media company teams have done a remarkable job that staying focused on what their task is at hand. And I only get more excited about that because as we work our way through this process, and some of those distractions drop away, I think the sky is the limit in terms of what these teams can do with even better execution as they hit their stride around things. 
The comment that Phil made, I guess, where I would come out on my point of view of these markets that we're involved in, as I'm actually much more bullish and optimistic about the markets in aggregate. I think there's a reason, there's a substantial amount of investment moving into these industries, and it's because there's a tremendous importance and an inherent value that customers get out of connectivity moving forward. And if I were to think about our businesses on the communications side of the company, we are moving into what I would call the golden age of connectivity and ubiquity and connectivity. I actually feel really optimistic about that, that there's some really smart operators in this industry. They're investing because they have a path to gain return on those things, and they're going to do it in a way that's intelligent and smart. And demand is strong in these industries, and I believe there may be some structural changes that come out of some of the programs that the government is looking at that could make that demand even stronger and more robust. And I believe that if policy is structured appropriately in this country right now, we can see a really strong forward progress in the communications industry that's good for all of us. 
On the media side, I think we are in a very, very unique position with what we've done. We set out, as we started HBO Max with a description of a product that we thought was going to be different, it was going to be a more focused product with a higher degree of quality and a more distinct brand characterization of what we did moving forward. I think if you go out and you look at any third party that's been evaluating that, as the team has gained its stride and continue to iterate on the quality of the product, the quality of the platform, as we move through the pandemic in terms of our ability to bring new content out, the market ratings of engagement, viewership, awards that have come in, indications of time engaged on the platform from third parties have all been recognizing the team on that work. And I absolutely believe it is a unique breed of cat that, when combined with Discovery moving forward, will only strengthen its capabilities to become one of the must-have platforms of consumers moving forward and a tremendous amount of value creation as that customer base is established globally. 
So with that, we'll talk to you as we wrap up the year. I expect to come back and tell you more of the same. And I hope you all have a great fourth quarter and great holidays if I don't talk to you before then."

I'll be brief because the quarter is largely more of the same. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of consistent progress since we articulated our simplified business strategy and how we plan to measure our progress going forward. 
The close of the DIRECTV transaction this quarter is another important step we've completed to reposition AT&T. I acknowledge, this makes for some extra cycles on comparative analysis. And as we continue to do so, there will be fewer moving parts to assess in better visibility and clarity. In the meantime, it's important not to lose sight of the success we're having, deploying capital into our areas of strategic focus. Bottom line, we're accelerating our historical rates of customer growth in Mobility, Fiber and HBO Max, and customer satisfaction is improving across the board with lower churn and higher NPS scores. 
Mobility is delivering more postpaid phone customers on a rolling 12-month run rate than it has in the prior decade. Our Fiber products are recognized as best-in-class. As we expand our Fiber footprint, we're delivering a superior service and we're growing our share. We're already nearing the low end of our 2021 guidance for global HBO Max and HBO subscribers, despite our long planned intent to no longer seed customer control through Amazon's channels offering. Additionally, customer growth can be attributed in part to our ability to mine out significant cost savings from our operations and reinvest them back into the business. The results are driving Mobility and Consumer Wireline EBITDA growth that we expect to be complemented by margin expansion as our transformation work matures. 
We have clear line of sight to achieving at least half of our $6 billion cost savings run rate target by the end of this year, driven by success with a number of initiatives that we believe also will support improving returns in the coming years. Whether they stem from nearly $1 billion of savings from streamlining our field operations, a similar level of savings from changes made to our procurement processes or $0.5 billion of savings from the rationalization of our retail store footprint, our focus on driving out inefficiencies is showing tangible results. These are just a few of the most significant programs underway. More initiatives that we expect will drive incremental savings and operating leverage are in the investment and implementation phase. 
Finally, as I mentioned, we've closed the DIRECTV transaction and continue to expect the WarnerMedia deal to close by midyear 2022. With these and other dispositions, we monetized or announced plans to monetize more than $55 billion of assets over the past year. The last 5 quarters have been a period of repositioning our business, while also delivering operational results, without repositioning nearing completion that will afford even more focus on continued execution and improved performance. 
We're on track to reach our full year free cash flow guidance in the $26 billion range, and we expect to hit the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance. We're in the early innings of transforming the company and believe that we have significant opportunity ahead of us to expand share in our focus areas and drive better returns, including sustained earnings growth. We continue to strive to earn your confidence one quarter at a time, delivering operating performance and shows our momentum is real and sustainable. 
Let me now turn it over to Pascal to discuss the details of the quarter. Pascal?"

Before we get to our consolidated results, let's look at the progress in our market focus areas on Slide 5. As John mentioned, we continued our strong customer momentum in the third quarter with 928,000 postpai",1352,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to our consolidated results, let's look at the progress in our market focus areas on Slide 5. As John mentioned, we continued our strong customer momentum in the third quarter with 928,000 postpaid phone net adds. That's our best net adds quarter in over 10 years. Customers like the strength of our network and our consistent, simple offers. Gross adds are up, churn is low, and we continue to take share and grow our customer base. 
Our Fiber base also continues to expand. Broadband revenues grew by more than 7%, and we now have 5.7 million AT&T Fiber customers, with 3.4 million of them on 1-gig connections. And we saw a sequential growth in our Fiber net adds with most of those new to AT&T. 
Let's now look at our HBO Max/HBO global subscribers. As we said last quarter, most of the subscriber additions for the remainder of the year are expected to come from our lower ARPU international base. We've reached nearly 70 million global subscribers, thanks to growth in our international markets. As previously announced, domestic subscribers were down due to our proactive decision to shut down the Amazon wholesale platform. This was partially offset by new wholesale relationships. 
Retail subscriber growth slowed down the timing of new content, but we expect retail subscriber growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter due to strong content slate. We have new seasons of success in the Curb Your Enthusiasm debuting, the return of Sex and the City as well as the much-anticipated premieres of Dune, King Richard and The Matrix: Resurrection. Given our upcoming content slate and expanding global footprint, we expect to end the year at the higher end of our year-end global subscriber target. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for our consolidated financial results. The third quarter results reflect the closing of the DIRECTV transaction after the first month of the quarter. We're a smaller company today than we were at the beginning of the quarter, and that is reflected in our results. Excluding DIRECTV revenues, revenues were up about $1.7 billion or 5%, thanks to growth in our market-focused areas. Gains in Mobility, Warner Media and Consumer Wireline more than offset the clients in Business Wireline and from the disposition of other businesses. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.87. That's up more than 14% year-over-year. In addition to merger-amortization adjustments for the quarter, adjustments were made to exclude our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization, a gain on the sale of Playdemic and the an actuarial gain on benefit plans. When you exclude DIRECTV from both periods, adjusted EBITDA was up 3% year-over-year, mostly due to growth in Mobility and strong growth at WarnerMedia, reflecting partial recovery from the pandemic and the timing of sports costs. 
Cash from operations came in at $9.9 billion for the quarter. Spending was up, both year-over-year and sequentially with CapEx of $4.7 billion and gross capital investments totaling $5.7 billion. Free cash flow was $5.2 billion, inclusive of year-over-year increases of $850 million in CapEx and $1.7 billion investment in WarnerMedia cash content. Year-to-date, our content investment has increased by more than $4 billion. Additionally, our leverage position also benefited from $10 billion in asset monetization in the quarter, including our DIRECTV-TPG transaction. 
Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communication business on Slide 7. Our Mobility business continues to gain steam. Revenues were up 7% with service revenues growing 4.6%. Postpaid phone churn remained at record low levels, and we had record postpaid phone growth. Prepaid also continued to be a solid performer for us, especially our Cricket brand. We added 249,000 prepaid phones in the quarter. Prepaid phone churn is less than 3%, with Cricket churn even lower. 
Mobility EBITDA is up nearly $300 million or 3.6% year-over-year, driven by growth in service revenues and transformation savings. We expect that growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter. This growth came even with increased volumes, 3G shutdown costs of nearly $200 million, higher costs associated with the return of the iPhone launch into the third quarter and without a material return in international roaming. We expect similar quarterly 3G shutdown costs through the first quarter of 2022. 
Business Wireline continues to deliver consistent margins in the high 30s and solid EBITDA. The business did see some difficult year-over-year comparison, given pandemic-related benefits experienced last year. We have been very aggressive in proactively rationalizing our portfolio of low-margin products. This creates incremental pressure on our near-term revenues. But at the same time, it allows us to focus on our core network and transport services products. It will take several quarters for us to work through this initiative. But as we lap the beginning of this process that began late last year, we should see improving revenue trends in Business Wireline. 
Our Fiber growth was solid. We had our highest Fiber gross adds ever, and we continue to win share wherever we have fiber. We added 289,000 Fiber customers in the quarter, and more than 70% of Fiber net adds are new AT&T broadband customers, and this gives us great confidence as we continue to build out our fiber footprint. 
Last quarter, we reached a major inflection point in our Consumer Wireline business, where broadband revenue growth now surpasses legacy declines. Total Consumer Wireline revenues are up again this quarter, growing 3.4%. This quarter also reached an inflection point on broadband profit as EBITDA grew 3.8%. We expect sequential EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter, but it will be a tougher year-over-year comparison due to a onetime pandemic-related benefit in last year's fourth quarter. 
Let's move to WarnerMedia results, which are on Slide 8. WarnerMedia revenues were up 14%, led by strong DTC growth and content licensing. Direct-to-Consumer subscription revenues grew about 25%, reflecting the continued success of HBO Max. Content and other revenues were up 32%, reflecting higher TV licensing and the recovery of TV production and theatrical releases. 
Advertising revenues were down nearly 12%, mostly due to the timing of sports. You may recall that the prior year third quarter included the restart of the NBA Season and the playoffs, which returned to a more traditional schedule this year. This lowered sports cost in the quarter, which helped WarnerMedia grow EBITDA by 13.5%. 
The third quarter also included the impact of more than $200 million in DIRECTV advertising revenue sharing costs. With the close of the DIRECTV transaction, WarnerMedia continues to represent and sell DIRECTV's advertising inventory and now compensates DIRECTV through a revenue-share arrangement. This revenue share is now recorded as an expense to WarnerMedia. 
We launched HBO Max in Latin America late June and have had incredible success. And next week, we are launching new international markets in Spain and the Nordic region, with more new markets to come in 2022. 
Now before we get to your questions, just a few words about guidance. 3 quarters into the year, we feel good about customer momentum and where we stand relative to our guidance provided last quarter. With our strong performance, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be at the high end of our previous guidance of low- to mid-single-digit growth range. And that's with significant costs expected to be incurred in launching HBO Max in Europe. Additionally, we expect more than $350 million of advertising sharing costs associated with WarnerMedia's new advertising sharing arrangement with DIRECTV as well as continued costs associated with shutting down our 3G network. 
Also keep in mind, last year's fourth quarter benefited from the advertising associated with the U.S. presidential election. And as mentioned earlier, we are on track with our free cash flow target of around $26 billion as well. 
In addition to the fourth quarter being a traditionally stronger free cash flow quarter, we expect the FirstNet reimbursement of approximately $1 billion, lower year-over-year cost from the iPhone launch moving up to the third quarter this year and DIRECTV cash distribution of approximately $800 million.

So when you think about all those things, you should get a sense that, from here, the momentum of the business continues, and we feel really good about it. Our customers are growing. Our revenues are growing, and we continue to take costs out of the business. So over time, it's going to translate to improvement in not only top line, but we will see profit growth."

This is Jason on the AVOD question, which is we've been happy with the launch, which was in June of this year. So this is the first full quarter. And we're happy not just in terms of the absolute response, in terms of subscribers, but also because advertising helps lower the price and increase the value for an HBO Max subscription. So we see it as rather strategic, and we're very excited about where that goes. 
One thing that is interesting to note, John, is that until the end of the year, there is a slight difference in the product of ad-supported HBO Max in that the movie, specifically Matrix, King Richard and Dune, are not part of the ad-supported offering. So there will be full content parity starting in late January of 2022. So we're very happy with the results, and we're quite excited about the future as well. 
And then you also asked about our results. If you assume taking into account the Amazon Prime video channels exit, we haven't commented specifically on the size of the subscribers coming from Amazon Prime video channels. But I think it's safe to say that we're very happy with the quarter.

The best part about it, Phil, is that our customers are telling us that we're doing a good job. This churn levels that are low are a signal to the service and the value that we're offering. And our NPS feedback that we've received is the highest that we've ever received. 
The sustainability of what we've done here in AT&T, I think, is really important to understand more broadly. It's a question that keeps coming up about our growth relative to competition in the general market. It's important to note that we've optimized our distribution channels. We've expanded the reach of it, and we're now addressing new segments that we were not addressing earlier, and that's helping us drive some of our customer momentum. 
But in combination to that, Phil, we've simplified our rate plans, and we remain consistent in our offers to the market over the last 13 months, if you will. And this really enables the AT&T frontline team members to master their craft, deliver a higher level of service. And that -- this can't be overlooked. This is a key component to what's driving momentum for us at AT&T in our business. 
I'd also point to things like our FirstNet program. We're starting to reach some scale here. Third quarter, we posted the highest net-add quarter since launching the program. And we've arrived at a position of leadership and strength in the law enforcement segment under that public safety sector. And so all in all, it's been the operational changes that we've made at AT&T that has driven really strong momentum in our customer counts. 
The promotions that you referred to, there's an aspect of promotions that's just one element of this broader strategy. And it's important to note that not all of our customers that are with us, that upgrade or that join us from competitors, take advantage of the promotional offers that you see in the market. We've been at this for a little over a year now. And I can tell you that I've studied the characteristics of the customers that have taken the promotion versus those that have not taken the promotion in our customer base. 
And here's what I can tell you, that those that have participated in our promotional offers have a higher LTV, a better churn and a higher satisfaction score than those that have not. And so we know this is driving accretive value. The industry is healthy. And better than that, the new accounts to AT&T, those that are joining us from our competitors, they exhibit the same kind of characteristics in their financials, higher LTVs, better churn and higher satisfaction than our base. 
So it's not just that we are adding more customers. We know, based on these metrics that we see, that we're adding high-value customers. And don't believe that this is driven uniquely by any kind of subsidy or extra cash flow that happens to be in the marketplace of the general market. It's also, I think, important, Phil, to note that the cost of these promotions as one element of our strategy, it runs through our service revenue. The cost of those promotions run through that in amortization. And so for us to be able suppose this kind of growth in the quarter in this competitive market and drive this kind of solid performance in subscriber revenue, accounting for any cost of the promotions, gives us confidence that we are accreting value. I would take this kind of quarter all day long in a competitive market, and I'm certain that our shareholders are going to be happy with it."

We're not participating or taking EBB dollars on our postpaid subscribers. And I would say in terms of telecommunications, in general, and the health, there's clearly a stronger consumer out there because of some of the things that the federal government has done with the pandemic, the prop-up household income, and that's not -- can't last forever. 
However, if you kind of examine where we are in the infrastructure bill, and you think about what is moving from a federal policy perspective on building better infrastructure, whether or not Congress gets that through, of course, is a question. But if you work under assumption that there seems to be some bipartisan view that we need to do the right things around infrastructure, and then broadband and connectivity to the Internet seems to come at the top of the list. I would expect that there's going to be some more federal money that moves into the industry next year. And some of it comes in the form of a direct subsidy to what's considered to be low-income households. That definition of low-income households is a fairly generous definition. It's 200% of the poverty line of the bill that was proposed or written. 
So when you start thinking about that, does that mean that a household, at least in terms of making decisions on telecommunications purchases, might be in a strong perspective next year? The economy continues to be reasonably strong. I don't worry about all of a sudden seeing a reversal or turn around the aggregate spending power on telecommunication services."

The general progress on the deal, I think, is consistent with what we would have expected as we walked into it. As we indicated in our opening remarks, we're moving through the steps with the various regulatory agencies, both domestically in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Those processes are moving along at the pace we would have expected and don't see any surprises around it. As you might guess, regulatory agencies are doing their typical overview around that. And we feel really comfortable around the back and forth and what's been produced, the time lines and the milestones we've hit around those things. 
I would not expect that we would be giving details around kind of our view of the construct of the deal until we're a little further along in that process, and we have some degree of visibility that we know that there's going to be a positive affirmation of the deal coming out. And we're getting into that, let's call it the window, where we know we're in the final back and forth to try to get either a consent decree or approval, whichever comes out of it, to get the transaction moving forward. 
You probably have been around the deal long enough to know that we're not at that point right now, and we're probably not going to be at that point until we get into the early part of next year. And once we have some visibility around that and we can step back at that moment, look at where the stock price is, how things are standing in the market at that point in time, and we're starting to get down to that window where people would need to make a decision, then we'll be giving you some visibility around what we think the right path forward is around that. And obviously, we want to see what also transpires here in Washington over the next couple of months. There's chances that policy may change around how different types of distributions or different approaches get taxed. And all that has to be factored into our overall equation of how do we get value back into the shareholders' pocket in the right way. And the more information we have around that, the better informed that will be, and I think the better it will be for shareholders as they move through it. But of course, there'll be notice. before we close the transaction. I just wouldn't expect that it's going to be months and months and months before we close the transaction because we obviously want some degree of regulatory certainty. 
And where we are with the build, what the first thing I would probably share with everybody is, we're on this path to substantially increase our fiber footprint. And that stretches across both our consumer and our business base. And I think as you've known from past history, this is -- it's not uncommon for us to go through these ramps of infrastructure builds. We've done it many times before. We've recently been through one where we went through a multiyear ramp on fiber builds that we kind of started executing around the 2015 time frame. They always, as you move through the front end of them, have a few moments where they're a little bit lumpy and a little bit rocky because that's the nature of it. These are inherently large civil construction projects, and they're spread out across many municipalities. And there's many permitting agencies and all kinds of things that go on in getting everybody kind of ginned up and ready to go at scale, sometimes take some steps. But at the end of the day, we always get there. 
And I think what's important for the investors to understand is we're on this march to get ourselves into a position where we can deploy fiber at scale and move from where we are right now, which is we won an objective of about 3 million passings a year, and we'll ultimately probably ramp that into 5. But we're looking at other options to see if there's capital efficient ways for us to even take that up a little bit further and do more, but we will get there. And I would ask that we probably not rotate on any given 90-day period as to whether or not it was a good 90 days or a bad 90 days. It's a question around whether or not we scale this up and get to the point that we're starting to deliver new homes into the inventory in a regular fashion. And I'm absolutely convinced that the organization is doing that. 
Are we seeing some supply stress right now in certain places as part of the reason why we guided down to 2.5 million this year? The answer to that is yes. It's coming in interesting places. But the great news is when you're the scale player in the market, we work through those faster and with the preferred position than others. And we're seeing that occur, whether it's chipsets for gateways and homes that are necessary to put a WiFi infrastructure and a modem in place. Or it's fiber components that are necessary or access to civil engineering, I think we're working through all those in a respectable fashion. 
I can give you an example right now. One of the reasons that we had to kind of deal with a guide down was one of our fiber providers was struggling a little bit and getting us the prefabricated portions of the infrastructure that go out into the distribution plan, the last mile, if you will, the parts that go up and down alleys and streets that ultimately connect homes into the network. And there's preassembled components that come in that are pretty spliced, that are put out into the network as we receive them from the manufacturer. We have worked through a lot of those issues, and we, in fact, have an awful lot of that infrastructure, if not all of the 2.5 million that will be placed. 
But there is a connector piece of that infrastructure that moves from the optical node that ultimately ties that into the distribution neighborhood, which we're running a little bit short on right now. And it's literally a very small section of fiber that splices in the larger distribution. It's frankly the larger distribution that's harder to deploy. There's more labor hours in it. It's what requires more permits and more activity out in neighborhoods, but it's that little connector piece, and we're a little bit short on right now. We're working through with the manufacturer in a collaborative way. We have a lot of plans in place to get that done and get the work completed. But it's one of those things where it's going to be nip and tuck right up until the end of everything we put in. 
But if for some reason, we fall a little short on that, we're not talking about missing the substantial portion of the labor. We're talking about missing a connector that has to be put in that can bring up a lot of houses every time we put 1 more of those in on the network. So we feel good about the ramp. We're going to continue to ramp, and we're going to continue to give you insights to the new homes that are coming in. And we also believe, we're in a very unique position, given that we're the largest provider and builder of fiber out there right now that we're in strength in the industry and what we can command in that supply chain, and we've secured the right kind of relationships to get that done."

We're going to be launching in 6 countries next week in Europe, and we're very excited about that. And we've also publicly announced a number of other European country launches in 2022. So our approach is very much what it had been before. And we're excited, if you take a look at the Latin America results, what expansion across the globe can bring. 
In terms of your second question about our motion picture slate and what have we learned. I'll state the obvious, which is not unique to us, is that we're in the middle of a pandemic, and a pandemic obviously presents very unique circumstances. And as you know well, we have been very much leading in the first over the wall, so to speak, in terms of bringing our 2021 slate to customers in a way that can work for them, but also work for exhibition and work for our participants. And so what we've learned is that motion pictures continue to matter. We believe they're going to matter for decades to come, and we're proudly investing in them. 
In terms of the road forward, we've committed to 2022, and that's the visibility that we have. And that is a combination of 2 things. On one side will be a certain slate of motion pictures that will have an exclusive theatrical run, 45 days. That's quite a bit different from where things were, say, 5 years ago in terms of the theatrical run, then they will come to HBO Max. And then we're also going to have a slate of motion pictures from Warner Bros. that will come directly to HBO Max on Day 1. So that's -- those are the answers to your 2 questions, Brett. Thank you for asking."

So there's no pulling the foot off the accelerator in that regard. It is -- HBO Max is the foundation of that business moving forward and how the combined company will continue to go to market. And everything that we do right now to make that product better and add customers is a step in the right direction and the consistent direction of where the closed and combined business goes. And we all want the shareholders that own a substantial portion of that company moving forward to have a valuable asset, one that's growing and one that will be successful in the next generation of media.

These are very profitable lifetime value subscribers. 
As it relates to Business Wireline. We started about a year ago, starting to rationalize low-profit margin products and services. And that effort continues. The goal would be, over time, more and more of our services in the enterprise space are going to come from our core connectivity product, whether it be wireless or fiber. And that's where the growth is going to come. And it's a process we are partway through, but we think as you get through the latter part of this year to early next year, the comps get a little bit easier. I'll ask Jeff to chime in."

If you look at our Business Wireline business, as we reported segment-wise, we are moving customers, many of our enterprise customers through a product mix shift. We've been doing this for a while.

If you look at our Business Wireline business, as we reported segment-wise, we are moving customers, many of our enterprise customers through a product mix shift. We've been doing this for a while. I think it's important to note that, unlike others, we don't report a consolidated business P&L that includes wireless. And we are actually seeing shift to wireless for many services as many of our customers have moved off and over in the pandemic. That's just a general observation. 
More specifically, David, the 3 parts of our business that we're getting to subscriber growth, revenue growth and then EBITDA growth, we've got first two, our business -- our Consumer Wireline and our Mobility moving in that direction. And we are at the cusp of getting our Business Wireline business to move in that direction. It's going to take some time because it's going to require some product mix and product development work, specifically areas of the business markets that we, at AT&T, serve less were underrepresented or more of the medium-sized businesses in the mid-market. And these customers are more inclined to use shared broadband served up by fiber and our business service -- class services that we sell to our top-end enterprise accounts are a bit more bespoke and specific networking networks that are not necessarily attractive to the mid-markets. We have been making moves to shift the product mix in demand. 
And as John mentioned earlier, as our fiber expansion, that's not just for consumer but also for business, begins to take footing, you'll see us shift shares of our revenue in Business Wireline more transactional-based and down market with the execution that we know we can deliver. And so it's going to take a few quarters as we work through it. The cost transformation that we're undertaking inside the Communications company, as Pascal mentioned, we're about halfway through the $6 billion in aggregate for the firm. The back half of the transformation program really brings in more operating efficiencies in our Business Wireline segment that we'll see start to accrete to EBITDA growth in that part of our business."

And then just secondly, back in -- I think it was March at the Analyst Day, AT&T set a goal for net debt to end the year at $154 billion at 3x leverage, which infers if you just divide the 3 into the net debt. It's about $51.3 billion of EBITDA ex-DTV for the year. And since then, it seems like your cost-cutting program is moving faster. So just curious if you can give us an update on these goals?

Pascal touched on this a second ago. If you think about maintaining the industry-leading, the highest ARPU of any player in the market, even though we're the third player in wireless, being able to do that with some of these promotional offers that are part of our strategy, gives us confidence that we're working our base and our customers up the ARPU stack into higher-value unlimited rate plans. 
We still have large portions of our subscriber base that we have not migrated into those rate plans. And so we expect that to continue pretty much on the course and speed of what the customer wants. We're not driving or forcing any unnatural behavior there. We're letting the customers choose when it's time for them to take advantage of an offer or to move into a new rate plan, and we'll continue to execute that.

If you want to get to a sense for what the base business is post-DTV and WarnerMedia, which I think all of the information is out there, we've provided -- for WarnerMedia, we report the results separately. So those are very easily discernible. And then if you look at DTV, we've provided extensive pro forma. 
The thing to keep in mind is when we compute net debt-to-EBITDA, we use the trailing 12 months. In this instance, some of it included DTV for part of the year, and it doesn't include DTV for another part of the year. So that's how you're getting to your 3x. That's how we get to 3x in the guidance we provided. But other than that, we're not changing the guidance. We think that should get you in the zone.

We are absolutely including wireless as a bundled opportunity for us in this part of our footprint.

There was really not much new fiber build from about 2018. At the end of 2018, for -- there's a bit of a hiatus period there. So I would tell you that a lot of the results you're seeing right now, to Jeff's point, is really better execution of the team going back in and working in some of the asset base to actually improve performance overall. 
Yes, now the midpoint of this year, you're now seeing some new inventory come into play, and we're getting a lot better, as Jeff just described, moving through penetration rates faster. And if we, in fact, sustain that, it's going to make the business case even a stronger business case because one of the big sensitivities to payback is rate to penetration. And if we can keep that going, it can be dramatically better than what we think is already a pretty attractive business case. 
And the last point I would make is the nice part about this build in many instances is that we're filling in a little bit of areas that we maybe didn't complete previously. And so as that fill-in occurs, you get some effectiveness on marketing messages, the ability to go into a market and get your particular value proposition effectively communicated, how you deal with your distribution channels through that. So we'll probably be a little bit more effective and efficient given the base of customers that we have as we build out and fill in over the next several quarters."

Do I believe there's an opportunity for us as a company to operate at a 5 million a year range kind of at capacity and what we do. I think we can get there. How we get there and how we scale that and what time frame will be an artifact of what we come back to you and tell you in terms of our results and how much progress we're making around them. And we're going to continue to push forward.

And there's obviously questions that many of you are asking, ""Well, can they get to that level?"" And you better believe some of the cost savings stuff is dropping to the bottom line because that's how we get to that level. 
So the back end of this program, while we've used the front end of it to actually increase our market effectiveness and be in a better position in terms of our customer growth and volume, the back end of this program is about actually getting a better efficiency that drops to the bottom line that ultimately comes in play and helps us on the cash flow side. And I think that's how you should think about how we've kind of done that. And there's some structural approaches that we're using on the higher longer-term issues like changing out IT infrastructure and data structures, et cetera, that's harder and longer work, but tends to also have more operating leverage once it goes into service, and we get it done. And that's really what's underneath it. Jeff, why don't you go ahead and find any additional color you might want to add, I'm talking."

With that, first of all, thank you all for joining us this morning and appreciate your questions and your interest in the business. And as I said at the start of the call, I think in some respects, the quarter is more of the same. It's been consistent focus and consistent execution. 
And I would say, I'm really pleased with our progress overall on how the team is executing. There are a lot of moving parts, and there have been some distractions, but I really am pleased across the board, whether in the Communications company and Media company. Teams have done a remarkable job that stay in focus on what their task is at hand. And I only get more excited about that because as we work our way through this process, and some of those distractions drop away, I think the sky is the limit in terms of what these teams can do with even better execution as they hit their stride around things. 
The comment that Phil made, I guess, where I would come out on my point of view of these markets that we're involved in, as I'm actually much more bullish and optimistic about the markets in aggregate. I think there's a reason, there's a substantial amount of investment moving into these industries, and it's because there's a tremendous importance and an inherent value that customers get out of connectivity moving forward. And if I were to think about our businesses on the communications side of the company, we are moving into what I would call the golden age of connectivity and ubiquity and connectivity. I actually feel really optimistic about that, that there's some really smart operators in this industry. 
They're investing because they have a path to gain return on those things, and they're going to do it in a way that's intelligent and smart. And demand is strong in these industries, and I believe there may be some structural changes that come out of some of the programs that the government is looking at that could make that demand even stronger and more robust. And I believe that if policy is structured appropriately in this country right now, we can see a really strong forward progress in the communications industry that's good for all of us. 
On the media side, I think we are in a very, very unique position with what we've done. We set out, as we started HBO Max with a description of a product that we thought was going to be different, it was going to be a more focused product with a higher degree of quality and a more distinct brand characterization of what we did moving forward. I think if you go out and you look at any third party that's been evaluating that, as the team has gained its stride and continue to iterate on the quality of the product, the quality of the platform, as we move through the pandemic in terms of our ability to bring new content out, the market, ratings of engagement, viewership, awards that have come in, indications of time engaged on the platform from third parties have all been recognizing the team on that work. 
And I absolutely believe it is a unique breed of cat that, when combined with Discovery moving forward, will only strengthen its capabilities to become one of the must-have platforms of consumers moving forward, and a tremendous amount of value creation as that customer base is established globally. 
So with that, we'll talk to you as we wrap up the year. I expect to come back and tell you more of the same. And I hope you all have a great fourth quarter and great holidays if I don't talk to you before then."

I'll be brief because the quarter is largely more of the same. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of consistent progress since we articulated our simplified business strategy and how we plan to measure our progress going forward. 
The close of the DIRECTV transaction this quarter is another important step we've completed to reposition AT&T. I acknowledge, this makes for some extra cycles on comparative analysis. And as we continue to do so, there will be fewer moving parts to assess in better visibility and clarity. In the meantime, it's important not to lose sight of the success we're having, deploying capital into our areas of strategic focus. Bottom line, we're accelerating our historical rates of customer growth in Mobility, Fiber and HBO Max, and customer satisfaction is improving across the board with lower churn and higher NPS scores. 
Mobility is delivering more postpaid phone customers on a rolling 12-month run rate than it has in the prior decade. Our Fiber products are recognized as best-in-class. As we expand our Fiber footprint, we're delivering a superior service and we're growing our share. We're already nearing the low end of our 2021 guidance for global HBO Max and HBO subscribers, despite our long planned intent to no longer seed customer control through Amazon's channels offering. Additionally, customer growth can be attributed in part to our ability to mine out significant cost savings from our operations and reinvest them back into the business. The results are driving Mobility and Consumer Wireline EBITDA growth that we expect to be complemented by margin expansion as our transformation work matures. 
We have clear line of sight to achieving at least half of our $6 billion cost savings run rate target by the end of this year, driven by success with a number of initiatives that we believe also will support improving returns in the coming years. Whether they stem from nearly $1 billion of savings from streamlining our field operations, a similar level of savings from changes made to our procurement processes or $0.5 billion of savings from the rationalization of our retail store footprint, our focus on driving out inefficiencies is showing tangible results. These are just a few of the most significant programs underway. More initiatives that we expect will drive incremental savings and operating leverage are in the investment and implementation phase. 
Finally, as I mentioned, we've closed the DIRECTV transaction and continue to expect the WarnerMedia deal to close by midyear 2022. With these and other dispositions, we monetized or announced plans to monetize more than $55 billion of assets over the past year. The last 5 quarters have been a period of repositioning our business, while also delivering operational results, without repositioning nearing completion that will afford even more focus on continued execution and improved performance. 
We're on track to reach our full year free cash flow guidance in the $26 billion range, and we expect to hit the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance. We're in the early innings of transforming the company and believe that we have significant opportunity ahead of us to expand share in our focus areas and drive better returns, including sustained earnings growth. We continue to strive to earn your confidence one quarter at a time, delivering operating performance and shows our momentum is real and sustainable.

Before we get to our consolidated results, let's look at the progress in our market focus areas on Slide 5. As John mentioned, we continued our strong customer momentum in the third quarter with 928,000 postpaid phone net adds. That's our best net adds quarter in over 10 years. Customers like the strength of our network and our consistent, simple offers. Gross adds are up, churn is low, and we continue to take share and grow our customer base. 
Our Fiber base also continues to expand. Broadband revenues grew by more than 7%, and we now have 5.7 million AT&T Fiber customers, with 3.4 million of them on 1-gig connections. And we saw a sequential growth in our Fiber net adds with most of those new to AT&T. 
Let's now look at our HBO Max/HBO global subscribers. As we said last quarter, most of the subscriber additions for the remainder of the year are expected to come from our lower ARPU international base. We've reached nearly 70 million global subscribers, thanks to growth in our international markets. As previously announced, domestic subscribers were down due to our proactive decision to shut down the Amazon wholesale platform. This was partially offset by new wholesale relationships. 
Retail subscriber growth slowed down the timing of new content, but we expect retail subscriber growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter due to strong content slate. We have new seasons of success in the Curb Your Enthusiasm debuting, the return of Sex and the City as well as the much-anticipated premieres of Dune, King Richard and The Matrix: Resurrection. Given our upcoming content slate and expanding global footprint, we expect to end the year at the higher end of our year-end global subscriber target. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for our consolidated financial results. The third quarter results reflect the closing of the DIRECTV transaction after the first month of the quarter. We're a smaller company today than we were at the beginning of the quarter, and that is reflected in our results. Excluding DIRECTV revenues, revenues were up about $1.7 billion or 5%, thanks to growth in our market-focused areas. Gains in Mobility, Warner Media and Consumer Wireline more than offset the clients in Business Wireline and from the disposition of other businesses. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.87. That's up more than 14% year-over-year. In addition to merger-amortization adjustments for the quarter, adjustments were made to exclude our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization, a gain on the sale of Playdemic and the an actuarial gain on benefit plans. When you exclude DIRECTV from both periods, adjusted EBITDA was up 3% year-over-year, mostly due to growth in Mobility and strong growth at WarnerMedia, reflecting partial recovery from the pandemic and the timing of sports costs. 
Cash from operations came in at $9.9 billion for the quarter. Spending was up, both year-over-year and sequentially with CapEx of $4.7 billion and gross capital investments totaling $5.7 billion. Free cash flow was $5.2 billion, inclusive of year-over-year increases of $850 million in CapEx and $1.7 billion investment in WarnerMedia cash content. Year-to-date, our content investment has increased by more than $4 billion. Additionally, our leverage position also benefited from $10 billion in asset monetization in the quarter, including our DIRECTV-TPG transaction. 
Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communication business on Slide 7. Our Mobility business continues to gain steam. Revenues were up 7% with service revenues growing 4.6%. Postpaid phone churn remained at record low levels, and we had record postpaid phone growth. Prepaid also continued to be a solid performer for us, especially our Cricket brand. We added 249,000 prepaid phones in the quarter. Prepaid phone churn is less than 3%, with Cricket churn even lower. 
Mobility EBITDA is up nearly $300 million or 3.6% year-over-year, driven by growth in service revenues and transformation savings. We expect that growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter. This growth came even with increased volumes, 3G shutdown costs of nearly $200 million, higher costs associated with the return of the iPhone launch into the third quarter and without a material return in international roaming. We expect similar quarterly 3G shutdown costs through the first quarter of 2022. 
Business Wireline continues to deliver consistent margins in the high 30s and solid EBITDA. The business did see some difficult year-over-year comparison, given pandemic-related benefits experienced last year. We have been very aggressive in proactively rationalizing our portfolio of low-margin products. This creates incremental pressure on our near-term revenues. But at the same time, it allows us to focus on our core network and transport services products. It will take several quarters for us to work through this initiative. But as we lap the beginning of this process that began late last year, we should see improving revenue trends in Business Wireline. 
Our Fiber growth was solid. We had our highest Fiber gross adds ever, and we continue to win share wherever we have fiber. We added 289,000 Fiber customers in the quarter, and more than 70% of Fiber net adds are new AT&T broadband customers, and this gives us great confidence as we continue to build out our fiber footprint. 
Last quarter, we reached a major inflection point in our Consumer Wireline business, where broadband revenue growth now surpasses legacy declines. Total Consumer Wireline revenues are up again this quarter, growing 3.4%. This quarter also reached an inflection point on broadband profit as EBITDA grew 3.8%. We expect sequential EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter, but it will be a tougher year-over-year comparison due to a onetime pandemic-related benefit in last year's fourth quarter. 
Let's move to WarnerMedia results, which are on Slide 8. WarnerMedia revenues were up 14%, led by strong DTC growth and content licensing. Direct-to-Consumer subscription revenues grew about 25%, reflecting the continued success of HBO Max. Content and other revenues were up 32%, reflecting higher TV licensing and the recovery of TV production and theatrical releases. 
Advertising revenues were down nearly 12%, mostly due to the timing of sports. You may recall that the prior year third quarter included the restart of the NBA Season and the playoffs, which returned to a more traditional schedule this year. This lowered sports cost in the quarter, which helped WarnerMedia grow EBITDA by 13.5%. 
The third quarter also included the impact of more than $200 million in DIRECTV advertising revenue sharing costs. With the close of the DIRECTV transaction, WarnerMedia continues to represent and sell DIRECTV's advertising inventory and now compensates DIRECTV through a revenue-share arrangement. This revenue share is now recorded as an expense to WarnerMedia. 
We launched HBO Max in Latin America late June and have had incredible success. And next week, we are launching new international markets in Spain and the Nordic region, with more new markets to come in 2022. 
Now before we get to your questions, just a few words about guidance. 3 quarters into the year, we feel good about customer momentum and where we stand relative to our guidance provided last quarter. With our strong performance, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be at the high end of our previous guidance of low- to mid-single-digit growth range. And that's with significant costs expected to be incurred in launching HBO Max in Europe. Additionally, we expect more than $350 million of advertising sharing costs associated with WarnerMedia's new advertising sharing arrangement with DIRECTV as well as continued costs associated with shutting down our 3G network. 
Also keep in mind, last year's fourth quarter benefited from the advertising associated with the U.S. presidential election. And as mentioned earlier, we are on track with our free cash flow target of around $26 billion as well. 
In addition to the fourth quarter being a traditionally stronger free cash flow quarter, we expect the FirstNet reimbursement of approximately $1 billion, lower year-over-year cost from the iPhone launch moving up to the third quarter this year and DIRECTV cash distribution of approximately $800 million.

Any sort of color or granularity you can give there that get us to the point where the Communications business is growing EBITDA? 
And then maybe for Jason, can you give us any color on the AVOD launch this summer? And it looks like you guys added 6 million to 7 million HBO Max subs globally, if you net out the Amazon losses.

Business Wireline, we talked about some of the issues we're facing. So when you think about all those things, you should get a sense that, from here, the momentum of the business continues, and we feel really good about it. Our customers are growing. Our revenues are growing, and we continue to take costs out of the business. So over time, it's going to translate to improvement in not only top line, but we will see profit growth."

This is Jason on the AVOD question, which is we've been happy with the launch, which was in June of this year. So this is the first full quarter. And we're happy not just in terms of the absolute response, in terms of subscribers, but also because advertising helps lower the price and increase the value for an HBO Max subscription. So we see it as rather strategic, and we're very excited about where that goes. 
One thing that is interesting to note, John, is that until the end of the year, there is a slight difference in the product of ad-supported HBO Max in that the movie, specifically Matrix, King Richard and Dune, are not part of the ad-supported offering. So there will be full content parity starting in late January of 2022. So we're very happy with the results, and we're quite excited about the future as well. 
And then you also asked about our results. If you assume taking into account the Amazon Prime video channels exit, we haven't commented specifically on the size of the subscribers coming from Amazon Prime video channels. But I think it's safe to say that we're very happy with the quarter. When you think about how we've grown 1.9 million worldwide, and even when you think about the Amazon exit, which we think is a very strategic decision that 3 companies really have made so far, which includes Disney and Netflix being the other two, we feel very good about the quarter."

To address that question, I kind of back out for a second and look at the health of our Wireless business in the context of the overall industry and to tell you that our strategy is working here at AT&T.

To address that question, I kind of back out for a second and look at the health of our Wireless business in the context of the overall industry and to tell you that our strategy is working here at AT&T. As we demonstrated, it's the fifth consecutive quarter where we have driven some momentum and gaining share. Our net add strength here in the quarter at 928,000. And that compares to what we have produced back in 2019 in the third quarter of 101,000. And we're driving strong service revenue growth, and we just posted the largest total EBITDA that we've generated out of the Wireless business segment. 
The best part about it, Phil, is that our customers are telling us that we're doing a good job. This churn levels that are low are a signal to the service and the value that we're offering. And our NPS feedback that we've received is the highest that we've ever received. 
The sustainability of what we've done here in AT&T, I think, is really important to understand more broadly. It's a question that keeps coming up about our growth relative to competition in the general market. It's important to note that we've optimized our distribution channels. We've expanded the reach of it, and we're now addressing new segments that we were not addressing earlier, and that's helping us drive some of our customer momentum. 
But in combination to that, Phil, we've simplified our rate plans, and we remain consistent in our offers to the market over the last 13 months, if you will. And this really enables the AT&T frontline team members to master their craft, deliver a higher level of service. And that -- this can't be overlooked. This is a key component to what's driving momentum for us at AT&T in our business. 
I'd also point to things like our FirstNet program. We're starting to reach some scale here. Third quarter, we posted the highest net-add quarter since launching the program. And we've arrived at a position of leadership and strength in the law enforcement segment under that public safety sector. And so all in all, it's been the operational changes that we've made at AT&T that has driven really strong momentum in our customer counts. 
The promotions that you referred to, there's an aspect of promotions that's just one element of this broader strategy. And it's important to note that not all of our customers that are with us, that upgrade or that join us from competitors, take advantage of the promotional offers that you see in the market. We've been at this for a little over a year now. And I can tell you that I've studied the characteristics of the customers that have taken the promotion versus those that have not taken the promotion in our customer base. 
And here's what I can tell you, that those that have participated in our promotional offers have a higher LTV, a better churn and a higher satisfaction score than those that have not. And so we know this is driving accretive value. The industry is healthy. And better than that, the new accounts to AT&T, those that are joining us from our competitors, they exhibit the same kind of characteristics in their financials, higher LTVs, better churn and higher satisfaction than our base. 
So it's not just that we are adding more customers. We know, based on these metrics that we see, that we're adding high-value customers. And don't believe that this is driven uniquely by any kind of subsidy or extra cash flow that happens to be in the marketplace of the general market. It's also, I think, important, Phil, to note that the cost of these promotions as one element of our strategy, it runs through our service revenue. The cost of those promotions run through that in amortization. And so for us to be able suppose this kind of growth in the quarter in this competitive market and drive this kind of solid performance in subscriber revenue, accounting for any cost of the promotions, gives us confidence that we are accreting value. I would take this kind of quarter all day long in a competitive market, and I'm certain that our shareholders are going to be happy with it."

We're not participating or taking EBB dollars on our postpaid subscribers. And I would say in terms of telecommunications, in general, and the health, there's clearly a stronger consumer out there because of some of the things that the federal government has done with the pandemic, the prop-up household income, and that's not -- can't last forever. 
However, if you kind of examine where we are in the infrastructure bill, and you think about what is moving from a federal policy perspective on building better infrastructure, whether or not Congress gets that through, of course, is a question. But if you work under assumption that there seems to be some bipartisan view that we need to do the right things around infrastructure, and then broadband and connectivity to the Internet seems to come at the top of the list. I would expect that there's going to be some more federal money that moves into the industry next year. And some of it comes in the form of a direct subsidy to what's considered to be low-income households. That definition of low-income households is a fairly generous definition. It's 200% of the poverty line of the bill that was proposed or written. 
So when you start thinking about that, does that mean that a household, at least in terms of making decisions on telecommunications purchases, might be in a strong perspective next year? The economy continues to be reasonably strong. I don't worry about all of a sudden seeing a reversal or turn around the aggregate spending power on telecommunication services."

The general progress on the deal, I think, is consistent with what we would have expected as we walked into it. As we indicated in our opening remarks, we're moving through the steps with the various regulatory agencies, both domestically in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Those processes are moving along at the pace we would have expected and don't see any surprises around it. As you might guess, regulatory agencies are doing their typical overview around that. And we feel really comfortable around the back and forth and what's been produced, the time lines and the milestones we've hit around those things. 
I would not expect that we would be giving details around kind of our view of the construct of the deal until we're a little further along in that process, and we have some degree of visibility that we know that there's going to be a positive affirmation of the deal coming out. And we're getting into that, let's call it the window, where we know we're in the final back and forth to try to get either a consent decree or approval, whichever comes out of it, to get the transaction moving forward. 
You probably have been around the deal long enough to know that we're not at that point right now, and we're probably not going to be at that point until we get into the early part of next year. And once we have some visibility around that and we can step back at that moment, look at where the stock price is, how things are standing in the market at that point in time, and we're starting to get down to that window where people would need to make a decision, then we'll be giving you some visibility around what we think the right path forward is around that. And obviously, we want to see what also transpires here in Washington over the next couple of months. There's chances that policy may change around how different types of distributions or different approaches get taxed. And all that has to be factored into our overall equation of how do we get value back into the shareholders' pocket in the right way. And the more information we have around that, the better informed that will be, and I think the better it will be for shareholders as they move through it. But of course, there'll be notice. before we close the transaction. I just wouldn't expect that it's going to be months and months and months before we close the transaction because we obviously want some degree of regulatory certainty. 
And where we are with the build, what the first thing I would probably share with everybody is, we're on this path to substantially increase our fiber footprint. And that stretches across both our consumer and our business base. And I think as you've known from past history, this is -- it's not uncommon for us to go through these ramps of infrastructure builds. We've done it many times before. We've recently been through one where we went through a multiyear ramp on fiber builds that we kind of started executing around the 2015 time frame. They always, as you move through the front end of them, have a few moments where they're a little bit lumpy and a little bit rocky because that's the nature of it. These are inherently large civil construction projects, and they're spread out across many municipalities. And there's many permitting agencies and all kinds of things that go on in getting everybody kind of ginned up and ready to go at scale, sometimes take some steps. But at the end of the day, we always get there. 
And I think what's important for the investors to understand is we're on this march to get ourselves into a position where we can deploy fiber at scale and move from where we are right now, which is we won an objective of about 3 million passings a year, and we'll ultimately probably ramp that into 5. But we're looking at other options to see if there's capital efficient ways for us to even take that up a little bit further and do more, but we will get there. And I would ask that we probably not rotate on any given 90-day period as to whether or not it was a good 90 days or a bad 90 days. It's a question around whether or not we scale this up and get to the point that we're starting to deliver new homes into the inventory in a regular fashion. And I'm absolutely convinced that the organization is doing that. 
Are we seeing some supply stress right now in certain places as part of the reason why we guided down to 2.5 million this year? The answer to that is yes. It's coming in interesting places. But the great news is when you're the scale player in the market, we work through those faster and with the preferred position than others. And we're seeing that occur, whether it's chipsets for gateways and homes that are necessary to put a WiFi infrastructure and a modem in place. Or it's fiber components that are necessary or access to civil engineering, I think we're working through all those in a respectable fashion. 
I can give you an example right now. One of the reasons that we had to kind of deal with a guide down was one of our fiber providers was struggling a little bit and getting us the prefabricated portions of the infrastructure that go out into the distribution plan, the last mile, if you will, the parts that go up and down alleys and streets that ultimately connect homes into the network. And there's preassembled components that come in that are pretty spliced, that are put out into the network as we receive them from the manufacturer. We have worked through a lot of those issues, and we, in fact, have an awful lot of that infrastructure, if not all of the 2.5 million that will be placed. 
But there is a connector piece of that infrastructure that moves from the optical node that ultimately ties that into the distribution neighborhood, which we're running a little bit short on right now. And it's literally a very small section of fiber that splices in the larger distribution. It's frankly the larger distribution that's harder to deploy. There's more labor hours in it. It's what requires more permits and more activity out in neighborhoods, but it's that little connector piece, and we're a little bit short on right now. We're working through with the manufacturer in a collaborative way. We have a lot of plans in place to get that done and get the work completed. But it's one of those things where it's going to be nip and tuck right up until the end of everything we put in. 
But if for some reason, we fall a little short on that, we're not talking about missing the substantial portion of the labor. We're talking about missing a connector that has to be put in that can bring up a lot of houses every time we put 1 more of those in on the network. So we feel good about the ramp. We're going to continue to ramp, and we're going to continue to give you insights to the new homes that are coming in. And we also believe, we're in a very unique position, given that we're the largest provider and builder of fiber out there right now that we're in strength in the industry and what we can command in that supply chain, and we've secured the right kind of relationships to get that done."

In terms of your first question, our approach is consistent with what our approach was a quarter ago, 2 quarters ago, 3 quarters ago. And what I mean by that is that, for us, it's business as usual. We're going to be launching in 6 countries next week in Europe, and we're very excited about that. And we've also publicly announced a number of other European country launches in 2022. So our approach is very much what it had been before. And we're excited, if you take a look at the Latin America results, what expansion across the globe can bring. 
In terms of your second question about our motion picture slate and what have we learned. I'll state the obvious, which is not unique to us, is that we're in the middle of a pandemic, and a pandemic obviously presents very unique circumstances. And as you know well, we have been very much leading in the first over the wall, so to speak, in terms of bringing our 2021 slate to customers in a way that can work for them, but also work for exhibition and work for our participants. And so what we've learned is that motion pictures continue to matter. We believe they're going to matter for decades to come, and we're proudly investing in them. 
In terms of the road forward, we've committed to 2022, and that's the visibility that we have. And that is a combination of 2 things. On one side will be a certain slate of motion pictures that will have an exclusive theatrical run, 45 days. That's quite a bit different from where things were, say, 5 years ago in terms of the theatrical run, then they will come to HBO Max. And then we're also going to have a slate of motion pictures from Warner Bros. that will come directly to HBO Max on Day 1. So that's -- those are the answers to your 2 questions, Brett. Thank you for asking."

And it's required that you get to scale, and I've said multiple times that run a window here where that's a foot race, and it's an important foot race. So there's no pulling the foot off the accelerator in that regard. It is -- HBO Max is the foundation of that business moving forward and how the combined company will continue to go to market. And everything that we do right now to make that product better and add customers is a step in the right direction and the consistent direction of where the closed and combined business goes. And we all want the shareholders that own a substantial portion of that company moving forward to have a valuable asset, one that's growing and one that will be successful in the next generation of media. And we believe we've got to do the right things right now to make sure that the business is well-positioned to make that happen."

Can you kind of give us a feeling for how we should expect these 2 forces to work against one another as year 2 and year 3 see these promotional discounts compound as a headwind, assuming you continue down this path? And the runway you have to try to offset that with core growth, recognizing, of course, that it's just an accounting issue.

And yes, there will be some slight degradation in ARPU. But when you look at our overall ARPU, we're still at the high end of the industry. So that's a consideration to keep in mind. These are very profitable lifetime value subscribers. 
As it relates to Business Wireline. We started about a year ago, starting to rationalize low-profit margin products and services. And that effort continues. The goal would be, over time, more and more of our services in the enterprise space are going to come from our core connectivity product, whether it be wireless or fiber. And that's where the growth is going to come. And it's a process we are partway through, but we think as you get through the latter part of this year to early next year, the comps get a little bit easier. I'll ask Jeff to chime in."

If you look at our Business Wireline business, as we reported segment-wise, we are moving customers, many of our enterprise customers through a product mix shift. We've been doing this for a while. I think it's important to note that,",357,"Yes. Thanks, Pascal. If you look at our Business Wireline business, as we reported segment-wise, we are moving customers, many of our enterprise customers through a product mix shift. We've been doing this for a while. I think it's important to note that, unlike others, we don't report a consolidated business P&L that includes wireless. And we are actually seeing shift to wireless for many services as many of our customers have moved off and over in the pandemic. That's just a general observation. 
More specifically, David, the 3 parts of our business that we're getting to subscriber growth, revenue growth and then EBITDA growth, we've got first two, our business -- our Consumer Wireline and our Mobility moving in that direction. And we are at the cusp of getting our Business Wireline business to move in that direction. It's going to take some time because it's going to require some product mix and product development work, specifically areas of the business markets that we, at AT&T, serve less were underrepresented or more of the medium-sized businesses in the mid-market. And these customers are more inclined to use shared broadband served up by fiber and our business service -- class services that we sell to our top-end enterprise accounts are a bit more bespoke and specific networking networks that are not necessarily attractive to the mid-markets. We have been making moves to shift the product mix in demand. 
And as John mentioned earlier, as our fiber expansion, that's not just for consumer but also for business, begins to take footing, you'll see us shift shares of our revenue in Business Wireline more transactional-based and down market with the execution that we know we can deliver. And so it's going to take a few quarters as we work through it. The cost transformation that we're undertaking inside the Communications company, as Pascal mentioned, we're about halfway through the $6 billion in aggregate for the firm. The back half of the transformation program really brings in more operating efficiencies in our Business Wireline segment that we'll see start to accrete to EBITDA growth in that part of our business."

And how much opportunity is in front of the company to upsell customers on these higher value plans that you've been marketing? 
And then just secondly, back in -- I think it was March at the Analyst Day, AT&T set a goal for net debt to end the year at $154 billion at 3x leverage, which infers if you just divide the 3 into the net debt. It's about $51.3 billion of EBITDA ex-DTV for the year. And since then, it seems like your cost-cutting program is moving faster. So just curious if you can give us an update on these goals? And is that the right bouncing-off point to think about the AT&T EBITDA without DIRECTV for 2021?"

There still remains a large opportunity within our base of customers to work them through a more value, higher end of our rate plans. And you're kind of seeing that play out in postpaid phone ARPU. Pascal touched on this a second ago. If you think about maintaining the industry-leading, the highest ARPU of any player in the market, even though we're the third player in wireless, being able to do that with some of these promotional offers that are part of our strategy, gives us confidence that we're working our base and our customers up the ARPU stack into higher-value unlimited rate plans. 
We still have large portions of our subscriber base that we have not migrated into those rate plans. And so we expect that to continue pretty much on the course and speed of what the customer wants. We're not driving or forcing any unnatural behavior there. We're letting the customers choose when it's time for them to take advantage of an offer or to move into a new rate plan, and we'll continue to execute that. So that's got room to run for the next many several quarters. That's not something that's going to dry up in the short term."

So those are very easily discernible. And then if you look at DTV, we've provided extensive pro forma. 
The thing to keep in mind is when we compute net debt-to-EBITDA, we use the trailing 12 months. In this instance, some of it included DTV for part of the year, and it doesn't include DTV for another part of the year. So that's how you're getting to your 3x.

There was really not much new fiber build from about 2018. At the end of 2018, for -- there's a bit of a hiatus period there. So I would tell you that a lot of the results you're seeing right now, to Jeff's point, is really better execution of the team going back in and working in some of the asset base to actually improve performance overall. 
Yes, now the midpoint of this year, you're now seeing some new inventory come into play, and we're getting a lot better, as Jeff just described, moving through penetration rates faster. And if we, in fact, sustain that, it's going to make the business case even a stronger business case because one of the big sensitivities to payback is rate to penetration. And if we can keep that going, it can be dramatically better than what we think is already a pretty attractive business case. 
And the last point I would make is the nice part about this build in many instances is that we're filling in a little bit of areas that we maybe didn't complete previously. And so as that fill-in occurs, you get some effectiveness on marketing messages, the ability to go into a market and get your particular value proposition effectively communicated, how you deal with your distribution channels through that. So we'll probably be a little bit more effective and efficient given the base of customers that we have as we build out and fill in over the next several quarters."

Do I believe there's an opportunity for us as a company to operate at a 5 million a year range kind of at capacity and what we do. I think we can get there. How we get there and how we scale that and what time frame will be an artifact of what we come back to you and tell you in terms of our results and how much progress we're making around them.

And you better believe some of the cost savings stuff is dropping to the bottom line because that's how we get to that level. 
So the back end of this program, while we've used the front end of it to actually increase our market effectiveness and be in a better position in terms of our customer growth and volume, the back end of this program is about actually getting a better efficiency that drops to the bottom line that ultimately comes in play and helps us on the cash flow side.

And there's some structural approaches that we're using on the higher longer-term issues like changing out IT infrastructure and data structures, et cetera, that's harder and longer work, but tends to also have more operating leverage once it goes into service, and we get it done. And that's really what's underneath it. Jeff, why don't you go ahead and find any additional color you might want to add, I'm talking."

And it's not only impacting our Business Wireline part of the franchise, Colby. It's all 3 reported segments. I think we've been investing heavily in these transformation initiatives to go drive growth and improve our cost structure and our effectiveness as an organization. Simply put, we have been hard at work inside of the company preparing for a better execution and a better operating performance. And we're seeing signs of that in our Wireless business. We're seeing signs it is now in our Consumer Wireline business. And I'd tell you that the Business Wireline begins to feather in as we move into the back half of the program."

With that, first of all, thank you all for joining us this morning and appreciate your questions and your interest in the business. And as I said at the start of the call, I think in some respects, the quarter is more of the same. It's been consistent focus and consistent execution. 
And I would say, I'm really pleased with our progress overall on how the team is executing. There are a lot of moving parts, and there have been some distractions, but I really am pleased across the board, whether in the Communications company and Media company. Teams have done a remarkable job that stay in focus on what their task is at hand. And I only get more excited about that because as we work our way through this process, and some of those distractions drop away, I think the sky is the limit in terms of what these teams can do with even better execution as they hit their stride around things. 
The comment that Phil made, I guess, where I would come out on my point of view of these markets that we're involved in, as I'm actually much more bullish and optimistic about the markets in aggregate. I think there's a reason, there's a substantial amount of investment moving into these industries, and it's because there's a tremendous importance and an inherent value that customers get out of connectivity moving forward. And if I were to think about our businesses on the communications side of the company, we are moving into what I would call the golden age of connectivity and ubiquity and connectivity. I actually feel really optimistic about that, that there's some really smart operators in this industry. 
They're investing because they have a path to gain return on those things, and they're going to do it in a way that's intelligent and smart. And demand is strong in these industries, and I believe there may be some structural changes that come out of some of the programs that the government is looking at that could make that demand even stronger and more robust. And I believe that if policy is structured appropriately in this country right now, we can see a really strong forward progress in the communications industry that's good for all of us. 
On the media side, I think we are in a very, very unique position with what we've done. We set out, as we started HBO Max with a description of a product that we thought was going to be different, it was going to be a more focused product with a higher degree of quality and a more distinct brand characterization of what we did moving forward. I think if you go out and you look at any third party that's been evaluating that, as the team has gained its stride and continue to iterate on the quality of the product, the quality of the platform, as we move through the pandemic in terms of our ability to bring new content out, the market, ratings of engagement, viewership, awards that have come in, indications of time engaged on the platform from third parties have all been recognizing the team on that work. 
And I absolutely believe it is a unique breed of cat that, when combined with Discovery moving forward, will only strengthen its capabilities to become one of the must-have platforms of consumers moving forward, and a tremendous amount of value creation as that customer base is established globally. 
So with that, we'll talk to you as we wrap up the year. I expect to come back and tell you more of the same. And I hope you all have a great fourth quarter and great holidays if I don't talk to you before then."
