Happy New Year, and thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our strong second quarter results as well as our perspective on how Conagra is positioned to continue to succeed in both the current environment and beyond. 
So let's get started. I'm very pleased with our strong results for the second quarter. Our business continued to perform well, both in the absolute and relative to peers. Our success to date in fiscal 2021 is not only a testament to our team's ability to adapt to the current environment, but a reflection of the work we've done to transform our business over the past 5-plus years. 
Our ongoing execution of the Conagra Way playbook perpetually reshaping our portfolio and capabilities for better growth and better margins has enabled us to rise to the occasion during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that has positioned the business to excel in the future. 
During the second quarter, we continue to build on our momentum, and our Q2 results exceeded our expectations across the board. We had strong broad-based sales growth, our margin expansion is ahead of schedule, and I'm proud to announce that we've reached our deleveraging target earlier than originally planned. 
In keeping with our Conagra Way playbook, We continue to optimize the business for long-term value creation during the quarter. We made targeted investments in both production capacity and marketing support to drive the physical and mental availability of our products. We also remain committed to sculpting our portfolio through smart divestments with the agreement shortly after the second quarter closed to sell Peter Pan peanut butter. Peter Pan is a very good business, but it's not an investment priority for Conagra given our other portfolio priorities. 
Finally, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance for all metrics. And none of these would be possible without our exceptional team, particularly our frontline workers. So before we dive into the details of the quarter, I want to recognize everyone responsible for the continued extraordinary work of our supply chain. I'm extremely proud of the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members whose dedication has enabled our industry-leading performance. We remain focused on keeping employees safe while meeting the needs of our communities, customers and consumers. And I'd like to thank everyone at Conagra for making this possible. 
With that, let's get into the business update. As the table on Slide 7 shows, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations across the board. We delivered organic net sales growth of 8.1%, adjusted operating margin of 19.6% and  adjusted EPS of $0.81. These results enabled us to reach our fiscal '21 net leverage ratio target of 3.6x ahead of schedule. 
During the second quarter, we continued to drive significant growth across our retail business. Total Conagra retail sales grew 10.4% year-over-year with strong growth across each of our snacks, frozen and staples portfolios. Our results were driven by continued success in expanding our presence with consumers and gaining share. Total Conagra household penetration grew 14 basis points versus a year ago, and our category share increased 26 basis points. 
Critical to our ability to sustain our growing relevancy with consumers is the physical availability of our products, whether through brick-and-mortar or online. And Slide 9 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce have continued to yield results. 
In the chart on the left, you can see the step change in e-commerce growth for total edible that has occurred since the onset of the pandemic. But what's really impressive about this chart is the sustainability of our e-commerce performance. We've retained a massive portion of the e-commerce sales we gained at the onset of the pandemic, and our results have outpaced total edible e-commerce growth each quarter. As a result of our sustained success, e-commerce continued its recent trend of steadily increasing as a percentage of our total retail sales, as you can see on the right. 
While e-commerce growth both on an absolute basis and as a percent of overall sales, it's not a new dynamic for Conagra. This growth has accelerated during COVID-19. In addition to our continued progress in e-commerce, our new innovation generated strong performance during the second quarter. When we began this journey over 5 years ago, we recognized that we had a lot of latent potential in the portfolio, it just had to be modernized. So we set out to aggressively do just that. And you'll recall that we established a goal of having 15% of our annual retail sales coming from products launched within the preceding 3 years. 
As you can see on Slide 10, our innovation performance has continued to exceed our 15% goal. What's equally important is the consistency of our innovation performance. Investments we've made over the last 5 years in our innovation capabilities enables us to continue launching new products since the pandemic began. Customers trust our innovation track record and rely on our new products to drive consumer trial and overall category growth. 
Slide 11 drills down on the strength of our recent innovation performance. Compared to last year's first half launches, the products we introduced in the first half of this year have achieved 37% more sales per UPC and 28% more distribution points per UPC during the comparable time period. 
Product performance highlights include: Marie Callender's post the #1 branded new item in frozen indulgent single-serve meals. Duncan Hines has delivered the top 3 highest velocity new items in single-serve baking and our modernized Hungry Man brand is outpacing category growth by more than 2x. 
After a strong first half of fiscal '21, we will introduce even more new products that will build distribution in the second half. Expect to hear more about our upcoming product launches at CAGNY next month. 
Turning now to Slide 12. Total Conagra frozen retail sales grew an impressive 8.3% versus a year ago, thanks to strong growth in each of our 4 main frozen categories. Importantly, Our terrific frozen vegetables business returned to strong growth in the quarter as we brought on our additional capacity investment online. 
Slide 13 digs a bit deeper into our largest frozen brand, Birds Eye. Birds Eye is a cornerstone of the important frozen vegetables segment with a #1 position in the category and more than twice the category share of the closest branded competitor. Recall that Birds Eye previously faced some supply constraints as we worked to bring new capacity online. And last quarter, I noted that shipments for the brand were a bit ahead of consumption as retailers started rebuilding their inventories. 
As you can see in the charts on Slide 13, Birds Eye returned to form in Q2 as expected. In addition to strong retail sales growth of 7.2% in the quarter, Birds Eye gained an impressive 261 basis points of share from Q1 to Q2. 
Continuing to Slide 14, you can see how Birds Eye has attracted and retained more new buyers than our competition since the pandemic began. Frozen vegetables category remains highly relevant to consumers, and we believe the steps we've taken over the past several quarters to modernize the Birds Eye brand and expand capacity have positioned us well to build on our category leadership. 
Turning now to another area of strength, our leading portfolio of frozen single-serve meals had another terrific quarter. As you can see on Slide 15, Conagra has outperformed peers, driven category growth and attracted new buyers since the start of the pandemic. As the chart on this slide shows, we have 3 of the top brands in this category from both a trial and repeat perspective. 
Our snacks business also continued to see strong growth in the quarter. As you can see on Slide 16, we delivered double-digit retail sales growth on a year-over-year and 2-year basis in snacking, led by impressive results across popcorn, sweet treats and meat snacks. 
And we're not just growing, we're winning versus the competition. Slide 17 shows how we grew share year-over-year in popcorn, meat snacks, hot cocoa and ready-to-eat pudding and gelatin in the quarter. 
Our staples portfolio also delivered solid results in Q2. And Historically, this portfolio has served as a -- primarily as a source of cash for us, but it hasn't been looked at as a growth engine, but Slide 18 shows how staples remain highly relevant to consumers in the quarter as people continue to rediscover cooking and the utility, relevance and value of products in our portfolio. 
Our basket of the total staples category grew retail sales by 12.7% in the second quarter. People are returning to their kitchens during the pandemic and new younger consumers are discovering the joy of cooking. 
Many of the brands on this slide, including PAM, RO*TEL and Hunt's, are cooking utilities and ingredients. As we've discussed before, the current environment has resulted in consumers trying or reengaging with our products and coming back again and again. 
And that takes us to what we see going forward and how our business is uniquely set up to win. Our execution of the Conagra Way playbook over the last 5-plus years enabled us to deliver strong performance prior to the onset of COVID. And we firmly believe that our reshaped portfolio, modernized products and enhanced capabilities have been foundational to our ability to excel during these highly dynamic times. 
We all know that the COVID pandemic has driven an increase in at-home eating overall. But for Conagra, it has also meant an acceleration of the consumer trial adoption and repeat purchase rates of our products. Our results have been strong on both an absolute and relative basis. These dynamics have driven meaningful levels of incremental cash flow for our business, they've also enhanced the ROI of our previous disciplined investments in portfolio capabilities and the physical and mental availability of our products. 
Importantly, the Conagra Way is perpetual. While we've adapted to the current environment and delivered superior results, we also continue to look to the future and make smart investments to further strengthen our business. Our investments include continuing to modernize our products and packaging, increasing production capacity when category dynamics warrant, supporting on-shelf availability and increased e-commerce share and raising consumer awareness. To be clear, these investments were not a reaction to the near-term environment, but decisions rooted in our longer-term outlook for the business and our disciplined execution of the Conagra Way. 
We believe that Conagra is in a strong position to continue to win now and for years to come. We expect that our investments, coupled with consumer adoption and the proven stickiness of our product will result in Conagra continuing to deliver long-term profitable growth. 
In summary, We continue to see solid execution across our portfolio aligned with the Conagra Way playbook in Q2, which enabled us to deliver results that exceeded our expectations. Our business remains strong in the absolute and relative to competition and we expect Conagra to be in an even better position post-COVID as a result of our ongoing disciplined approach to investment and innovation. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

Today, I'll walk through the details of our second quarter fiscal '21 performance and our Q3 outlook before we move to the Q&A portion of the call. 
I'll start by calling out a few performance highlights from the quarter, which are captured on Slide 22. As Sean mentioned, outstanding execution by our teams across the company enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales, margin, profitability and deleveraging during the second quarter, while we continued to invest in the business. 
Reported and organic net sales for the quarter were up 6.2% and 8.1%, respectively, versus the same period a year ago. We continued our strong margin performance from Q1 as Q2 adjusted gross margin increased 139 basis points to 29.9%. Adjusted operating margin increased 250 basis points to 19.6%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.7% to $712 million in the quarter. And Our adjusted diluted EPS grew 28.6% to $0.81 for the second quarter. 
Slide 23 breaks out the drivers of our 6.2% second quarter net sales growth. As you can see, the 8.1% increase in organic net sales was primarily driven by a 6.6% increase in volume related to the growth of at-home food consumption. The favorable impact of price/mix, which was evenly driven by favorable sales mix and less trade merchandising also contributed to our growth. The strong organic net sales growth was partially offset by the impacts of foreign exchange and a 1.7% net decrease associated with divestitures. 
The Peter Pan peanut butter business is still part of Conagra Brands and thus included in our organic results. We expect the sale of Peter Pan to be completed in Q3, at which point it will be removed from organic net sales growth. I will discuss the estimated impact of this divestiture shortly. 
Slide 24 summarizes our net sales by segment for the second quarter. On both a reported and organic basis, we saw continued significant growth in each of our 3 retail segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen and International. The net sales increase was primarily driven by the increase of at-home food consumption as a result of COVID-19, which benefited our retail segments, but negatively impacted our Foodservice segment. 
The Grocery & Snacks segment experienced strong organic net sales growth of 15.3% in the quarter. The segment's organic net sales growth outpaced its growth in consumption as retailers continue to rebuild inventories. 
Our Refrigerated & Frozen segment delivered organic net sales growth of 7.8%. This growth is a testament to our continued modernization and innovation efforts and illustrates the increasingly important role Refrigerated & Frozen products play in meeting the evolving needs of today's consumers. 
Turning to the International segment, quarterly organic net sales increased 9.1%. This segment experienced particularly strong growth in both Canada and Mexico. This quarter, our Foodservice segment reported a 21.4% organic net sales decline, primarily driven by a volume decrease of 25.3% due to less restaurant traffic as a result of COVID-19. 
Slide 25 outlines the adjusted operating margin bridge for the quarter versus the prior year period. As you can see, in the second quarter, our adjusted operating margin increased 250 basis points to 19.6%. Strong supply chain realized productivity, favorable price mix, cost synergies associated with Pinnacle Foods acquisition and fixed cost leverage combined to drive 440 basis points in adjusted operating margin improvement, more than offsetting the impact of cost of goods sold inflation and COVID-related costs in the quarter. Collectively, these drivers resulted in a 139 basis point increase in our adjusted gross margin versus the same period a year ago. 
A&P increased 4.7% on a dollar basis primarily due to increases in e-commerce marketing. A&P was flat on a percentage of sales basis this quarter versus Q2 a year ago. 
Finally, our adjusted SG&A rate was favorable by 110 basis points, primarily as a result of fixed cost leverage on higher net sales, the Pinnacle cost synergies and temporarily reduced spending as employees work from home and significantly reduced their travel. 
I want to give you some additional perspective on our margin expansion. As I just mentioned, operating margin expanded 250 basis points for the quarter, well ahead of our expectations. Of this 250 basis point expansion in operating margin this quarter, approximately 60 basis points reflects our ongoing progress towards achieving our fiscal '22 margin target of 18% to 19%. We also saw an approximate 180 basis point margin benefit from price/mix in the quarter, primarily driven by mix and to a lesser extent, favorable pricing and lower trade merchandising. We expect to retain some of this benefit going forward, but exactly how much remains uncertain at this point. 
An additional 10 basis points of net margin expansion came from favorable fixed cost leverage across the entire P&L and COVID-related SG&A benefits, mostly offset by COVID-related cost of goods sold. We do not expect this net benefit to repeat next year. 
Slide 26 summarizes our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment for the second quarter. Our 3 retail segments saw operating profits increased by double-digit percentages versus the same period a year ago. Each retail segment benefited from higher organic net sales and strong supply chain realized productivity. 
In the Foodservice segment, however, operating profit decreased due to the COVID-related impacts of lower organic net sales and higher input costs that more than offset the impacts of favorable supply chain realized productivity and cost synergies. 
Overall, we're pleased with the continuation of the strong Q1 margin results into the second quarter, which are anchored by core productivity and benefits from the Pinnacle acquisition we expected to see. 
Turning to Slide 27. We've outlined the drivers of our second quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth versus the same period a year ago. 
EPS increased 28.6% to $0.81. The growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion and also benefited from a decrease in net interest expense as we've continued to reduce debt as prioritized. 
Slide 28 highlights our significant progress on the overall synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal '19. We captured an incremental $27 million in savings during the most recent quarter, bringing total cumulative synergies to $246 million. As a reminder, the majority of total synergies to date have been in SG&A. 
Cost of goods sold synergies have started to be a bigger portion of our synergy capture in the last 2 quarters, and we expect them to make up a majority of our synergies going forward. We remain pleased with the team's progress in capturing synergies and remain on track to achieve our fiscal '22 synergy targets. 
Slide 29 shows the strong progress we've made to date to achieve our deleveraging targets. Since the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal '19 through the end of the second quarter of fiscal '21, we have reduced total gross debt by $2.3 billion, resulting in net debt of $9.2 billion. 
We are pleased to report that at the end of the second quarter, we achieved our net leverage ratio target of 3.6x, down from 5x at the closing of the Pinnacle acquisition, and 3.7x at the end of the first quarter of fiscal '21. Strong consistent improvements in debt reduction, coupled with robust earnings enabled us to achieve this net leverage ratio target ahead of schedule. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to be focused on executing a balanced capital allocation policy. We remain committed to solid investment-grade credit ratings as we continue to be opportunistic using our balance sheet to drive shareholder value, such as our increased investment in CapEx and the recent 29% dividend increase. 
Slide 30 summarizes our outlook. As Sean and I have both said throughout this presentation, we believe in the strength of Conagra's future. While we're confident in the quarters ahead and that Conagra will continue to excel beyond the COVID-19 environment, the sustained impact of COVID-19 remains dynamic and continues to make near-term forecasting with specificity a challenge. 
We expect the continuation of elevated retail demand and reduced Foodservice demand compared to historic pre-COVID-19 demand levels. We are currently seeing both of these trends continue in the third quarter to date. 
For the third quarter, we expect organic net sales growth to be in the range of plus 6% to 8%. We expect Q3 operating margin to be in the range of 16% to 16.5%, implying a year-over-year increase of 30 to 80 basis points. This estimate includes an expected acceleration of our A&P investment in e-commerce marketing that we started in Q2, reducing the estimated year-over-year Q3 operating margin expansion. As a reminder, Q3 operating margins are historically lower than Q2 operating margins given the leverage impact on the seasonality of sales. Given these sales and margin factors, along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver third quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $0.56 to $0.60. 
Our third quarter guidance also continues to assume that the end-to-end supply chain operates effectively during this period of heightened demand. As outlined in our earnings release, our third quarter guidance does not yet include any impact from the pending sale of the Peter Pan business. We are selling the business for approximately $102 million, and the expected annualized impact of the divestiture is a reduction of approximately $110 million of net sales and $0.03 of adjusted EPS. 
Lastly, we are reaffirming all metrics of our fiscal '22 guidance, which also excludes the impact of the pending sale of Peter Pan. We look forward to presenting again next month at CAGNY, where we will provide another update on our progress in executing the Conagra Way. We hope you'll join us.

So good questions. Let me try to unpack each piece of that. Yes, of course, we can provide that assurance.

Let me try to unpack each piece of that. Yes, of course, we can provide that assurance. We believe that what we are experiencing right now with the acceleration of product trial that in normal times would take years and hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Now as for what's going to sustain it through 2022 and beyond, in a nutshell, it is our people and our playbook. Now I spoke about our people in my prepared remarks, but let me remind investors about our playbook, particularly with respect to brand building. 
We have spent years curating and optimizing our approach to brand building, and we believe it is one of the most progressive and effective approaches in our space. The goal, obviously, in brand building is to create a powerful connection between our consumers and our brands. And in the simplest sense, in our eyes, to do that, you have to meet people where they are with modernized products and packages. And then you communicate information that is relevant and meaningful to them. And this is really the heart of our approach. 
So first, we meet people where they are. And you can ask yourself, ""Well, where are they these days?"" Well, these days, it's often: a, on their devices, seeking entertainment or information; or b, shopping in bricks and mortar or online. But it's also important to understand where they're not. And increasingly, we are seeing that they are not tethered to a television that is broadcasting mass-market advertising. You know when I was 5 years old, that was the place you would find a consumer and you can communicate the information you had to share. But obviously, if that were our approach today and that we're so monolithic, we wouldn't be finding a lot of consumers, especially not a lot of young consumers who we are very, very focused on because there are significant sustainable demographic tailwinds there that I've spoken about before. So instead, we reach our consumers in a diversity of locales from online to in-store, to on TV, to on radio and more. 
And then with respect to communicating the information that's relevant and meaningful to them, it starts, as you all heard me talk many times with, a very modernized product and package design. And then it's a synced provocative message around the appealing product benefit. That's our playbook. It works, and it will continue to work, and it's why our growth rates, our innovation performance, our trial, our repeat, our depth of repeat metrics are often outpacing our competitors. 
So in the simplest sense, what we are asserting here is that modern high-quality products with great bottom line and in-store presence supported by provocative and targeted messaging will beat outdated lower-quality products with weak online or in-store presence, but lots of broadcast media every single time. 
And then lastly, the last part of your question, our total brand investment already is, it has been at a strong level, and it remains strong. But yes, it is variable. And in any given quarter, we can flex it based on the circumstance of the quarter. So recall when supply was constrained, we dialed back when supply is ample, and we see good ROI opportunities we can flex it up. And by the way, we can flex it above or below the line, as you've seen. But overall, I would say the level is in a good place, and I think the strong results that you're seeing, not just in the absolute, but relative to competition shows that."

Can you walk us through again how the operating margin goes from where it landed in fiscal Q2 to your forecast for Q3?

First, as I mentioned in my remarks, the normal cadence of operating margin from the second quarter to the third quarter always shows a step down as we exit the holiday season and lose some of the operating leverage from the lower overall sales dollars. 
Second, when you look at Q3 operating margin a year ago, there were some benefits from reduced incentive comp accrual and SG&A a year ago in Q3. 
Third, inflation for the third quarter is now estimated to be around 3.5%, whereas in Q2, it was around 2.8%, 2.9%. 
And then lastly, as we just discussed, we are accelerating our A&P investment in the third quarter to support increased e-commerce marketing that we started in Q2, so we expect double-digit increase in A&P in the third quarter versus a year ago. So they're really the factors. And with that though, we still, with our guidance, we're implying a 30 to 80 basis point improvement in operating margin in the third quarter."

If you go back 5 years, the company 5, 5.5 years ago, didn't look anything like it looks today, right? We were a global conglomerate. We were struggling in the world of private label. We were trying to be a lot of things",663,"Yes, sure, David, Happy New Year. If you go back 5 years, the company 5, 5.5 years ago, didn't look anything like it looks today, right? We were a global conglomerate. We were struggling in the world of private label. We were trying to be a lot of things to a lot of people. 
Today, we are a focused pure-play, largely a North American company. And we play in 3 spaces, frozen; we play in snacks, and it's a very unique snack business with a lot of neglected coats as we call it; and we play in staples, and that's pretty much the portfolio. And over the last 5 years, the heavy lift was in the early days where we had to tackle value over volume, and that was painful but necessary to go through to purge out low-quality volume establish a new foundation. But it put us in a position to then layer on outstanding innovation on a much stronger base. 
And we started, as you know, with frozen, and we have what we believe is the leading frozen portfolio in North America that growing incredibly robustly. It is a centerpiece of our investment and our innovation effort, and that will continue because we are in the early innings of frozen's success. 
And as I pointed out in CAGNY last year, when you look at the demographic tailwinds we have from millennials, as they form households, and they -- we know they're already big users of frozen, but then when they form households, have their first child and then additional children, the per capita consumption of those household goes up and up and up again, so that's frozen. 
Our snacks business, we really rebased that a couple of years ago, and we said we're going to stand as a snack company. We run it like a snack company. And its performance there has just been outstanding. It's been both organic and it's been through M&A. We think that playbook will continue. It's a high-growth high-margin business, and we've got extremely strong relative market shares in that space. So that will also continue, and that remains the other, probably our second priority in terms of investment. And again, these investments come below the line and above the line. It's all about the combination of physical and mental availability of meeting people where they are, as they just pointed out. 
But the third piece is one of the more interesting pieces during and post pandemic, which is our staples portfolio, about 1/3 of our retail business in staples, which historically was a cash managed for cash type of business. But these products here are not -- there are a lot of products that are not fundamentally different from what you might see at some of our peer companies like a McCormick, where spices are utilities in the cooking process no differently than a can of RO*TEL or HAM cooking spread as a utility in the cooking process. And to some degree, those products go as cooking goes. And what's happening right now is cooking is in a very, very good place, not just because of the older generations who've always been more established in terms of cooking behavior, but the fact that these younger households have learned to kind of be comfortable in their own home, have explored their culinary and built their culinary skills out and are absolutely enamored with recipes and cooking right now. 
So a lot of our staple products, be it products like Hunt's tomato, RO*TEL, our salsa business, our dressing businesses. These are businesses that are playing a meaningful role during the pandemic, and we believe because of some of the demographic tailwinds will continue at an elevated level post-pandemic. 
So very strong up forward-looking performance in frozen and snacks and more optimism in terms of the growth potential out of stapled than probably pre-pandemic is how I would -- Dave, do you want to add anything to that?"

One of the things I shared last quarter that I might point our investors' attention back to was a slide that showed that after the previous recession in 2008, we saw a permanently elevated level of at-home eating occasions. And what was more interesting about the first 6 months of this pandemic is the level of elevation we saw this year or this past year was twice what we saw in 2008. And that was just a -- this is in a very short period of time. So there is previous evidence of stickiness post the adversity.

The key part of this, and then I'll pass it to Sean is, and we've talked about this at Investor Day that we manage margins to offset inflation in a lot of different areas.

And then more recently, obviously, with Pinnacle and the synergies that we're getting out of that, That's helping drive margin plus the fixed overhead absorption we're getting from the higher volumes from COVID.

And so items that come in and brands that come in not only need to be strategic, but ideally will help us in terms of our forward-looking growth rates and margins. Similarly, items that we divest sometimes can be things that have been a chronic drag on growth rates or margins. So by effectively managing kind of both the inbounds and the outbounds, remainco, so to speak, the remaining company, going forward should look better. That's the ideal situation in terms of growth prospect and margin. 
And we've got -- obviously, we've been active doing that. We'll continue to be active. We just announced the divestiture of Peter Pan. We've got this capital loss carry forward that we're well aware of, we talk about every day. And our principle there is pretty simple, which is if something is not a fit for us and somebody else wants to make an offer for an asset that is above what we see as the intrinsic value, then we're all ears on that kind of thing. 
Similarly, on inbound stuff, we're just now getting to the point where we're feeling -- our focus has been about delevering. Let's not -- let's be very clear on that. Ever since the Pinnacle acquisition, we've been 100% focused on delevering. We're now ahead of that cadence. So we can start to see our way toward other uses of capital going forward. Well, they could be share buybacks, they could be bolt-on acquisitions. They just have to make sense. Or could be investing in our business, as Ken pointed out in our own CapEx. So that's -- all of that's fair game. 
Dave, do you want to add anything to that?"

Obviously, as you said, we can see, right, the margin targets coming in ahead of plan, leverage target is coming in ahead of plan. But then we're also all kind of talking about the inflationary effects potentially this year. 
And then it sounds like you think you can hold some of the pricing benefits you've already received. But then we have to combine that with some or, let's say, less fixed cost leverage as we think about next year. So it seems like kind of what's implied in all of it is our targets aren't changing, but the targets that we have are still slightly below where we've come in the first half of this year. So it sounds like just kind of where you sit now, your visibility, all things considered, you just pointed to this, Dave, in terms of your -- kind of your sensitivity analysis, right? As you look forward next year, all things netted out, you say, yes, we might have to give some a bit back, we might have to give some of that back. But kind of net-net, relative to where we were last year, we feel just as good or maybe stronger about hitting those margin targets, while at the same time as we continue to see kind of sales revised upwards. 
So kind of net-net, what I'm asking is like why wasn't not just the margin piece, why would kind of be operating profit dollars in fiscal '22 be higher than you even thought they would have been 1.5 years ago? A lot in there, but..."

So let me take a shot at that, Rob. So obviously, starting at the top of fiscal '22, how we come out post-COVID and what the stickiness is obviously impacts the top line and that drives that -- the sales dollars and then the gross profit, operating profit dollars, right? So -- but if you kind of step back and you look at this quarter, and let me just take this Q2 and dissect it a little bit differently, so you get an understanding of kind of what's happening in margin. If you look at -- we improved operating margin 250 basis points this quarter, and there's 3 buckets, okay? 
The first bucket is improvement that we got that's not going to stay with us. And that's 10 basis points of the 250. And what is that? That's all this COVID stuff. It's COVID costs that are a bad guy. It's the lower SG&A from COVID because we're not traveling, which is a good guy. It's favorable absorption across the P&L, which is a good guy. You net all that stuff together, that's 10 basis points of benefit we got this quarter that's not going to recur. 
The second bucket is what is going to recur, and that's our core productivity. That is our realized productivity from supply chain. That's our Pinnacle synergies and then that's inflation and business investments. For the quarter, the net benefit of that was 60 basis points. And those programs will continue to go. 
The third bucket is where we are still evaluating it in terms of the ongoing benefit is price/mix. We had 180 basis points of price/mix benefit in Q2. Now the majority of that was mix and a lot of that's from volume. So there is a part of that, that will not recur. But there's also a benefit from less merchandising and pricing in there. And some of that will recur, but we're not quantifying what amount of the 180 will recur. So I say it that way because it's hard to look at some of these numbers sometimes and really understand what's ongoing versus what's not. So hopefully, that's a little helpful kind of looking at this quarter and thinking how it could apply. But all that kind of goes into the mixture. Obviously, inflation, everything else we're looking at as we run scenarios to give us the confidence to reaffirm '22."

Happy New Year, and thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call.

Happy New Year, and thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our strong second quarter results as well as our perspective on how Conagra is positioned to continue to succeed in both the current environment and beyond.  
So let's get started. I'm very pleased with our strong results for the second quarter. Our business continued to perform well, both in the absolute and relative to peers. Our success to date in fiscal 2021 is not only a testament to our team's ability to adapt to the current environment, but a reflection of the work we've done to transform our business over the past 5-plus years.  
Our ongoing execution of the Conagra Way playbook perpetually reshaping our portfolio and capabilities for better growth and better margins has enabled us to rise to the occasion during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that has positioned the business to excel in the future.  
During the second quarter, we continue to build on our momentum, and our Q2 results exceeded our expectations across the board. We had strong broad-based sales growth, our margin expansion is ahead of schedule, and I'm proud to announce that we've reached our deleveraging target earlier than originally planned.  
In keeping with our Conagra Way playbook, We continue to optimize the business for long-term value creation during the quarter. We made targeted investments in both production capacity and marketing support to drive the physical and mental availability of our products. We also remain committed to sculpting our portfolio through smart divestments with the agreement shortly after the second quarter closed to sell Peter Pan peanut butter. Peter Pan is a very good business, but it's not an investment priority for Conagra given our other portfolio priorities.  
Finally, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance for all metrics. And none of these would be possible without our exceptional team, particularly our frontline workers. So before we dive into the details of the quarter, I want to recognize everyone responsible for the continued extraordinary work of our supply chain. I'm extremely proud of the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members whose dedication has enabled our industry-leading performance. We remain focused on keeping employees safe while meeting the needs of our communities, customers and consumers. And I'd like to thank everyone at Conagra for making this possible.  
With that, let's get into the business update. As the table on Slide 7 shows, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations across the board. We delivered organic net sales growth of 8.1%, adjusted operating margin of 19.6% and adjusted EPS of $0.81. These results enabled us to reach our fiscal '21 net leverage ratio target of 3.6x ahead of schedule.  
During the second quarter, we continued to drive significant growth across our retail business. Total Conagra retail sales grew 10.4% year-over-year with strong growth across each of our snacks, frozen and staples portfolios. Our results were driven by continued success in expanding our presence with consumers and gaining share. Total Conagra household penetration grew 14 basis points versus a year ago, and our category share increased 26 basis points.  
Critical to our ability to sustain our growing relevancy with consumers is the physical availability of our products, whether through brick-and-mortar or online. And Slide 9 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce have continued to yield results.  
In the chart on the left, you can see the step change in e-commerce growth for total edible that has occurred since the onset of the pandemic. But what's really impressive about this chart is the sustainability of our e-commerce performance. We've retained a massive portion of the e-commerce sales we gained at the onset of the pandemic, and our results have outpaced total edible e-commerce growth each quarter. As a result of our sustained success, e-commerce continued its recent trend of steadily increasing as a percentage of our total retail sales, as you can see on the right.  
While e-commerce growth both on an absolute basis and as a percent of overall sales, it's not a new dynamic for Conagra. This growth has accelerated during COVID-19. In addition to our continued progress in e-commerce, our new innovation generated strong performance during the second quarter. When we began this journey over 5 years ago, we recognized that we had a lot of latent potential in the portfolio, it just had to be modernized. So we set out to aggressively do just that. And you'll recall that we established a goal of having 15% of our annual retail sales coming from products launched within the preceding 3 years.  
As you can see on Slide 10, our innovation performance has continued to exceed our 15% goal. What's equally important is the consistency of our innovation performance. Investments we've made over the last 5 years in our innovation capabilities enabled us to continue launching new products since the pandemic began. Customers trust our innovation track record and rely on our new products to drive consumer trial and overall category growth.  
Slide 11 drills down on the strength of our recent innovation performance. Compared to last year's first half launches, the products we introduced in the first half of this year have achieved 37% more sales per UPC and 28% more distribution points per UPC during the comparable time period.  
Product performance highlights include: Marie Callender's post the #1 branded new item in frozen indulgent single-serve meals. Duncan Hines has delivered the top 3 highest velocity new items in single-serve baking and our modernized Hungry-Man brand is outpacing category growth by more than 2x.  
After a strong first half of fiscal '21, we will introduce even more new products that will build distribution in the second half. Expect to hear more about our upcoming product launches at CAGNY next month.  
Turning now to Slide 12. Total Conagra frozen retail sales grew an impressive 8.3% versus a year ago, thanks to strong growth in each of our 4 main frozen categories. Importantly, Our terrific frozen vegetables business returned to strong growth in the quarter as we brought on our additional capacity investment online.  
Slide 13 digs a bit deeper into our largest frozen brand, Birds Eye. Birds Eye is a cornerstone of the important frozen vegetables segment with a #1 position in the category and more than twice the category share of the closest branded competitor. Recall that Birds Eye previously faced some supply constraints as we worked to bring new capacity online. And last quarter, I noted that shipments for the brand were a bit ahead of consumption as retailers started rebuilding their inventories.  
As you can see in the charts on Slide 13, Birds Eye returned to form in Q2 as expected. In addition to strong retail sales growth of 7.2% in the quarter, Birds Eye gained an impressive 261 basis points of share from Q1 to Q2.  
Continuing to Slide 14, you can see how Birds Eye has attracted and retained more new buyers than our competition since the pandemic began. Frozen vegetables category remains highly relevant to consumers, and we believe the steps we've taken over the past several quarters to modernize the Birds Eye brand and expand capacity have positioned us well to build on our category leadership.  
Turning now to another area of strength, our leading portfolio of frozen single-serve meals had another terrific quarter. As you can see on Slide 15, Conagra has outperformed peers, driven category growth and attracted new buyers since the start of the pandemic. As the chart on this slide shows, we have 3 of the top brands in this category from both a trial and repeat perspective.  
Our snacks business also continued to see strong growth in the quarter. As you can see on Slide 16, we delivered double-digit retail sales growth on a year-over-year and 2-year basis in snacking, led by impressive results across popcorn, sweet treats and meat snacks.  
And we're not just growing, we're winning versus the competition. Slide 17 shows how we grew share year-over-year in popcorn, meat snacks, hot cocoa and ready-to-eat pudding and gelatin in the quarter.  
Our staples portfolio also delivered solid results in Q2. Historically, this portfolio has served as a -- primarily as a source of cash for us, but it hasn't been looked at as a growth engine, but Slide 18 shows how staples remain highly relevant to consumers in the quarter as people continue to rediscover cooking and the utility, relevance and value of products in our portfolio.  
Our basket of the total staples category grew retail sales by 12.7% in the second quarter. People are returning to their kitchens during the pandemic and new younger consumers are discovering the joy of cooking.  
Many of the brands on this slide, including PAM, RO*TEL and Hunt's, are cooking utilities and ingredients. As we've discussed before, the current environment has resulted in consumers trying or reengaging with our products and coming back again and again.  
And that takes us to what we see going forward and how our business is uniquely set up to win. Our execution of the Conagra Way playbook over the last 5-plus years enabled us to deliver strong performance prior to the onset of COVID. And we firmly believe that our reshaped portfolio, modernized products and enhanced capabilities have been foundational to our ability to excel during these highly dynamic times.  
We all know that the COVID pandemic has driven an increase in at-home eating overall. But for Conagra, it has also meant an acceleration of the consumer trial adoption and repeat purchase rates of our products. Our results have been strong on both an absolute and relative basis. These dynamics have driven meaningful levels of incremental cash flow for our business, they've also enhanced the ROI of our previous disciplined investments in portfolio capabilities and the physical and mental availability of our products.  
Importantly, the Conagra Way is perpetual. While we've adapted to the current environment and delivered superior results, we also continue to look to the future and make smart investments to further strengthen our business. Our investments include continuing to modernize our products and packaging, increasing production capacity when category dynamics warrant, supporting on-shelf availability and increased e-commerce share and raising consumer awareness. To be clear, these investments were not a reaction to the near-term environment, but decisions rooted in our longer-term outlook for the business and our disciplined execution of the Conagra Way.  
We believe that Conagra is in a strong position to continue to win now and for years to come. We expect that our investments, coupled with consumer adoption and the proven stickiness of our product will result in Conagra continuing to deliver long-term profitable growth.  
In summary, We continue to see solid execution across our portfolio aligned with the Conagra Way playbook in Q2, which enabled us to deliver results that exceeded our expectations. Our business remains strong in the absolute and relative to competition and we expect Conagra to be in an even better position post-COVID as a result of our ongoing disciplined approach to investment and innovation.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

Today, I'll walk through the details of our second quarter fiscal '21 performance and our Q3 outlook before we move to the Q&A portion of the call.  I'll start by calling out a few performance highlights from the",1658,"Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll walk through the details of our second quarter fiscal '21 performance and our Q3 outlook before we move to the Q&A portion of the call.  
I'll start by calling out a few performance highlights from the quarter, which are captured on Slide 22. As Sean mentioned, outstanding execution by our teams across the company enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales, margin, profitability and deleveraging during the second quarter, while we continued to invest in the business.  
Reported and organic net sales for the quarter were up 6.2% and 8.1%, respectively, versus the same period a year ago. We continued our strong margin performance from Q1 as Q2 adjusted gross margin increased 139 basis points to 29.9%. Adjusted operating margin increased 250 basis points to 19.6%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.7% to $712 million in the quarter. And our adjusted diluted EPS grew 28.6% to $0.81 for the second quarter.  
Slide 23 breaks out the drivers of our 6.2% second quarter net sales growth. As you can see, the 8.1% increase in organic net sales was primarily driven by a 6.6% increase in volume related to the growth of at-home food consumption. The favorable impact of price/mix, which was evenly driven by favorable sales mix and less trade merchandising also contributed to our growth. The strong organic net sales growth was partially offset by the impacts of foreign exchange and a 1.7% net decrease associated with divestitures.  
The Peter Pan peanut butter business is still part of Conagra Brands and thus included in our organic results. We expect the sale of Peter Pan to be completed in Q3, at which point it will be removed from organic net sales growth. I will discuss the estimated impact of this divestiture shortly.  
Slide 24 summarizes our net sales by segment for the second quarter. On both a reported and organic basis, we saw continued significant growth in each of our 3 retail segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen and International. The net sales increase was primarily driven by the increase of at-home food consumption as a result of COVID-19, which benefited our retail segments, but negatively impacted our Foodservice segment.  
The Grocery & Snacks segment experienced strong organic net sales growth of 15.3% in the quarter. The segment's organic net sales growth outpaced its growth in consumption as retailers continue to rebuild inventories.  
Our Refrigerated & Frozen segment delivered organic net sales growth of 7.8%. This growth is a testament to our continued modernization and innovation efforts and illustrates the increasingly important role Refrigerated & Frozen products play in meeting the evolving needs of today's consumers.  
Turning to the International segment, quarterly organic net sales increased 9.1%. This segment experienced particularly strong growth in both Canada and Mexico. This quarter, our Foodservice segment reported a 21.4% organic net sales decline, primarily driven by a volume decrease of 25.3% due to less restaurant traffic as a result of COVID-19.  
Slide 25 outlines the adjusted operating margin bridge for the quarter versus the prior year period. As you can see, in the second quarter, our adjusted operating margin increased 250 basis points to 19.6%. Strong supply chain realized productivity, favorable price mix, cost synergies associated with Pinnacle Foods acquisition and fixed cost leverage combined to drive 440 basis points in adjusted operating margin improvement, more than offsetting the impact of cost of goods sold inflation and COVID-related costs in the quarter. Collectively, these drivers resulted in a 139 basis point increase in our adjusted gross margin versus the same period a year ago.  
A&P increased 4.7% on a dollar basis primarily due to increases in e-commerce marketing. A&P was flat on a percentage of sales basis this quarter versus Q2 a year ago.  
Finally, our adjusted SG&A rate was favorable by 110 basis points, primarily as a result of fixed cost leverage on higher net sales, the Pinnacle cost synergies and temporarily reduced spending as employees work from home and significantly reduced their travel.  
I want to give you some additional perspective on our margin expansion. As I just mentioned, operating margin expanded 250 basis points for the quarter, well ahead of our expectations. Of this 250 basis point expansion in operating margin this quarter, approximately 60 basis points reflects our ongoing progress towards achieving our fiscal '22 margin target of 18% to 19%. We also saw an approximate 180 basis point margin benefit from price/mix in the quarter, primarily driven by mix and to a lesser extent, favorable pricing and lower trade merchandising. We expect to retain some of this benefit going forward, but exactly how much remains uncertain at this point.  
An additional 10 basis points of net margin expansion came from favorable fixed cost leverage across the entire P&L and COVID-related SG&A benefits, mostly offset by COVID-related cost of goods sold. We do not expect this net benefit to repeat next year.  
Slide 26 summarizes our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment for the second quarter. Our 3 retail segments saw operating profits increased by double-digit percentages versus the same period a year ago. Each retail segment benefited from higher organic net sales and strong supply chain realized productivity.  
In the Foodservice segment, however, operating profit decreased due to the COVID-related impacts of lower organic net sales and higher input costs that more than offset the impacts of favorable supply chain realized productivity and cost synergies.  
Overall, we're pleased with the continuation of the strong Q1 margin results into the second quarter, which are anchored by core productivity and benefits from the Pinnacle acquisition we expected to see. Turning to Slide 27. We've outlined the drivers of our second quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth versus the same period a year ago.  
EPS increased 28.6% to $0.81. The growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion and also benefited from a decrease in net interest expense as we've continued to reduce debt as prioritized.  
Slide 28 highlights our significant progress on the overall synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal '19. We captured an incremental $27 million in savings during the most recent quarter, bringing total cumulative synergies to $246 million. As a reminder, the majority of total synergies to date have been in SG&A.  
Cost of goods sold synergies have started to be a bigger portion of our synergy capture in the last 2 quarters, and we expect them to make up a majority of our synergies going forward. We remain pleased with the team's progress in capturing synergies and remain on track to achieve our fiscal '22 synergy targets.  
Slide 29 shows the strong progress we've made to date to achieve our deleveraging targets. Since the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal '19 through the end of the second quarter of fiscal '21, we have reduced total gross debt by $2.3 billion, resulting in net debt of $9.2 billion.  
We are pleased to report that at the end of the second quarter, we achieved our net leverage ratio target of 3.6x, down from 5x at the closing of the Pinnacle acquisition, and 3.7x at the end of the first quarter of fiscal '21. Strong consistent improvements in debt reduction, coupled with robust earnings enabled us to achieve this net leverage ratio target ahead of schedule.  
Looking ahead, we will continue to be focused on executing a balanced capital allocation policy. We remain committed to solid investment-grade credit ratings as we continue to be opportunistic using our balance sheet to drive shareholder value, such as our increased investment in CapEx and the recent 29% dividend increase.  
Slide 30 summarizes our outlook. As Sean and I have both said throughout this presentation, we believe in the strength of Conagra's future. While we're confident in the quarters ahead and that Conagra will continue to excel beyond the COVID-19 environment, the sustained impact of COVID-19 remains dynamic and continues to make near-term forecasting with specificity a challenge.  
We expect the continuation of elevated retail demand and reduced Foodservice demand compared to historic pre-COVID-19 demand levels. We are currently seeing both of these trends continue in the third quarter to date.  
Over the third quarter, we expect organic net sales growth to be in the range of plus 6% to 8%. We expect Q3 operating margin to be in the range of 16% to 16.5%, implying a year-over-year increase of 30 to 80 basis points. This estimate includes an expected acceleration of our A&P investment in e-commerce marketing that we started in Q2, reducing the estimated year-over-year Q3 operating margin expansion. As a reminder, Q3 operating margins are historically lower than Q2 operating margins given the leverage impact on the seasonality of sales. Given these sales and margin factors, along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver third quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $0.56 to $0.60.  
Our third quarter guidance also continues to assume that the end-to-end supply chain operates effectively during this period of heightened demand. As outlined in our earnings release, our third quarter guidance does not yet include any impacts from the pending sale of the Peter Pan business. We are selling the business for approximately $102 million, and the expected annualized impact of the divestiture is a reduction of approximately $110 million of net sales and $0.03 of adjusted EPS.  
Lastly, we are reaffirming all metrics of our fiscal '22 guidance, which also excludes the impact of the pending sale of Peter Pan. We look forward to presenting again next month at CAGNY, where we will provide another update on our progress in executing the Conagra Way. We hope you'll join us.  
Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks this morning. I'll now pass it to the operator to open it up for questions."

And with fiscal '22, really, at this point, rapidly approaching as well as all the uncertainty around operating in the current environment, I guess, Sean, can you -- I mean what can you offer to sort of assure investors that Conagra can not only reach its fiscal '22 targets, but I guess, more importantly, do it in a way that enables the company to deliver sustainable growth thereafter? As that's a question that I know I've been getting quite a bit these days.  
And as part of that, I saw A&P was up in the quarter, and you mentioned that we should expect that to continue into the fiscal third quarter, is that a pattern of -- is that pattern of summary investment, one that we should expect more of moving forward?

So good questions. Let me try to unpack each piece of that. Yes, of course, we can provide that assurance.

Let me try to unpack each piece of that. Yes, of course, we can provide that assurance. We believe that what we are experiencing right now is the acceleration of product trial that in normal times would take years and hundreds of millions of dollars.  
Now as for what's going to sustain it through 2022 and beyond, in a nutshell, it is our people and our playbook. Now I spoke about our people in my prepared remarks, but let me remind investors about our playbook, particularly with respect to brand building.  
We have spent years curating and optimizing our approach to brand building, and we believe it is one of the most progressive and effective approaches in our space. The goal, obviously, in brand building is to create a powerful connection between our consumers and our brands. And in the simplest sense, in our eyes, to do that, you have to meet people where they are with modernized products and packages. And then you communicate information that is relevant and meaningful to them. And this is really the heart of our approach.  
So first, we meet people where they are. And you can ask yourself, ""Well, where are they these days?"" Well, these days, it's often: a, on their devices, seeking entertainment or information; or b, shopping in bricks and mortar or online. But it's also important to understand where they're not. And increasingly, we are seeing that they are not tethered to a television that is broadcasting mass-market advertising. You know when I was 5 years old, that was the place you would find a consumer and you can communicate the information you had to share. But obviously, if that were our approach today and that we're so monolithic, we wouldn't be finding a lot of consumers, especially not a lot of young consumers who we are very, very focused on because there are significant sustainable demographic tailwinds there that I've spoken about before.  
So instead, we reach our consumers in a diversity of locales from online to in-store, to on TV, to on radio and more.  
And then with respect to communicating the information that's relevant and meaningful to them, it starts, as you all heard me talk many times with, a very modernized product and package design. And then it's a synced provocative message around the appealing product benefit. That's our playbook. It works, and it will continue to work, and it's why our growth rates, our innovation performance, our trial, our repeat, our depth of repeat metrics are often outpacing our competitors.  
So in the simplest sense, what we are asserting here is that modern high-quality products with great bottom line and in-store presence supported by provocative and targeted messaging will beat outdated lower-quality products with weak online or in-store presence, but lots of broadcast media every single time.  
And then lastly, the last part of your question, our total brand investment already is, it has been at a strong level, and it remains strong. But yes, it is variable. And in any given quarter, we can flex it based on the circumstance of the quarter. So recall when supply was constrained, we dialed back. When supply is ample and we see good ROI opportunities we can flex it up. And by the way, we can flex it above or below the line, as you've seen. But overall, I would say the level is in a good place, and I think the strong results that you're seeing, not just in the absolute, but relative to competition shows that."

Can you walk us through again how the operating margin goes from where it landed in fiscal Q2 to your forecast for Q3? As you mentioned, it represents a pretty substantial sequential step-down, and is that purely just the marketing aspect? Or are there other factors we need to take into account there? And maybe it's commodity or commodities, which have spiked a bit and things of that nature."

First, as I mentioned in my remarks, the normal cadence of operating margin from the second quarter to the third quarter always shows a step down as we exit the holiday season and lose some of the operating leverage from the lower overall sales dollars.  
Second, when you look at Q3 operating margin a year ago, there were some benefits from reduced incentive comp accrual and SG&A a year ago in Q3.  
Third, inflation for the third quarter is now estimated to be around 3.5%, whereas in Q2, it was around 2.8%, 2.9%.  
And then lastly, as we just discussed, we are accelerating our A&P investment in the third quarter to support increased e-commerce marketing that we started in Q2, so we expect double-digit increase in A&P in the third quarter versus a year ago. So they're really the factors. And with that though, we still, with our guidance, we're implying a 30 to 80 basis point improvement in operating margin in the third quarter."

If you go back 5 years, the company 5, 5.5 years ago, didn't look anything like it looks today, right? We were a global conglomerate. We were struggling in the world of private label.

We were a global conglomerate. We were struggling in the world of private label. We were trying to be a lot of things to a lot of people.  
Today, we are a focused pure-play, largely a North American company. And we play in 3 spaces, frozen; we play in snacks, and it's a very unique snack business with a lot of neglected coats as we call it; and we play in staples, and that's pretty much the portfolio. And over the last 5 years, the heavy lift was in the early days where we had to tackle value over volume, and that was painful but necessary to go through to purge out low-quality volume and establish a new foundation. But it put us in a position to then layer on outstanding innovation on a much stronger base.  
And we started, as you know, with frozen, and we have what we believe is the leading frozen portfolio in North America that it's been growing incredibly robustly. It is a centerpiece of our investment and our innovation effort, and that will continue because we are in the early innings of frozen's success.  
And as I pointed out in CAGNY last year, when you look at the demographic tailwinds we have from millennials, as they form households, and they -- we know they're already big users of frozen, but then when they form households, have their first child and then additional children, the per capita consumption of those household goes up and up and up again, so that's frozen.  
Our snacks business, we really rebased that a couple of years ago, and we said we're going to stand as a snack company. We run it like a snack company. And the performance there has just been outstanding. It's been both organic and it's been through M&A. And we think that playbook will continue. It's a high-growth high-margin business, and we've got extremely strong relative market shares in that space. So that will also continue, and that remains the other, probably our second priority in terms of investment. And again, these investments come below the line and above the line. It's all about the combination of physical and available -- mental availability of meeting people where they are, as I just pointed out. But the third piece is one of the more interesting pieces during and post pandemic, which is our staples portfolio, about 1/3 of our retail business in staples, which historically was a cash managed for cash type of business. 
But these products here are not -- there are a lot of products that are not fundamentally different from what you might see at some of our peer companies like a McCormick, where spices are utilities in the cooking process no differently than a can of RO*TEL or PAM cooking spray as a utility in the cooking process. And to some degree, those products go as cooking goes. And what's happening right now is cooking is in a very, very good place, not just because of the older generations who've always been more established in terms of cooking behavior, but the fact that these younger households have learned to kind of be comfortable in their own home, have explored their culinary and built their culinary skills out and are absolutely enamored with recipes and cooking right now. 
So a lot of our staple products, be it products like Hunt's tomato, RO*TEL, our salsa business, our dressing businesses. These are businesses that are playing a meaningful role during the pandemic, and we believe because of some of the demographic tailwinds will continue at an elevated level post-pandemic. 
So very strong up forward-looking performance in frozen and snacks and more optimism in terms of the growth potential out of stapled than probably pre-pandemic is how I would put it. Dave, do you want to add anything to that?"

One of the things I shared last quarter that I might point into our investors' attention back to was a slide that showed that after the previous recession in 2008, we saw a permanently elevated level of at-home eating occasions. And what was more interesting about the first 6 months of this pandemic is the level of elevation we saw this year or this past year was twice what we saw in 2008. And that was just a -- this is in a very short period of time. So there is previous evidence of stickiness post the adversity.

So our planning posture is we feel good about our consumption call. It will be very similar to what we saw in Q2. And we believe that shipments are going to roughly be in line with that, and there's going to be some puts and takes between the different segments.

We've seen some increases in the last month or 2 in some of the agricultural commodities and certainly freight energy, just the overall even economists' macro views seem to be pointing towards more inflation. So I guess 2 questions related to that. One, how are we hedged? Or how should we be thinking about inflation and managing it as we move into fiscal '22? And maybe what's contemplated in the '22 targets that you reaffirmed this morning? 
And then Sean, I guess, second to that is just given how the retail environment's changed a bit, is there anything different in terms of the way that you might approach inflation and pricing with retailers today than maybe would have been the case pre-COVID?"

From a procurement perspective, our procurement department is very experienced, and we're looking at every area, every commodity, and we're taking positions where we feel like there's opportunities to do that. So that's really part of our ongoing kind of process. So at this point, obviously, we're looking at fiscal '21, but we'll even have positions that go into fiscal '22. So that's all part of our internal process that we always have. 
The key part of this, and then I'll pass it to Sean is, and we've talked about this at Investor Day that we manage margins to offset inflation in a lot of different areas. And so we look at, obviously, we have our productivity programs and supply chain. We have our margin-accretive innovation, our pricing, trade optimization, our mix. And then the way we can sculpt margin through M&A. And so we're obviously looking at all those levers. And then more recently, obviously, with Pinnacle and the synergies that we're getting out of that, that's helping drive margin plus the fixed overhead absorption we're getting from the higher volumes from COVID. So that all comes into play as we think about margin from a macro level.

Post-COVID is brand mix, specifically the staples business, which is stronger today and these cooking utilities that we expected may remain a bit stronger because of these millennials cooking at home. Those tend to be extremely relatively strong margins for us. So that is -- that's good brand mix for us.

Obviously, we've been very active in the last 5 years with inbound stuff and outbound stuff. And when we do that, both ways, it is -- we do consider not -- we consider it as we're reshaping the portfolio for better growth and better margins. And so items that come in and brands that come in not only need to be strategic, but ideally will help us in terms of our forward-looking growth rates and margins. Similarly, items that we divest sometimes can be things that have been a chronic drag on growth rates or margins. So by effectively managing kind of both the inbounds and the outbounds, remainco, so to speak, the remaining company, going forward should look better. That's the ideal situation in terms of growth prospects and margin. 
And we've got -- obviously, we've been active doing that. We'll continue to be active. We just announced the divestiture of Peter Pan. We've got this capital loss carry forward that we're well aware of, we talk about every day. And our principle there is pretty simple, which is if something is not a fit for us and somebody else wants to make an offer for an asset that is above what we see as the intrinsic value, then we're all ears on that kind of thing. 
Similarly, on inbound stuff, we're just now getting to the point where we're feeling -- our focus has been about delevering. Let's not -- let's be very clear on that. Ever since the Pinnacle acquisition, we've been 100% focused on delevering. We're now ahead of that cadence. So we can start to see our way toward other uses of capital going forward where they could be share buybacks, they could be bolt-on acquisitions. They just have to make sense. Or could be investing in our business, as Ken pointed out in our own CapEx. So that's -- all of that's fair game.

And then it sounds like you think you can hold some of the pricing benefits you've already received. But then we have to combine that with some or, let's say, less fixed cost leverage as we think about next year. So it seems like kind of what's implied in all of it is our targets aren't changing, but the targets that we have are still slightly below where we've come in the first half of this year. So it sounds like just kind of where you sit now, your visibility, all things considered, you just pointed to this, Dave, in terms of your -- kind of your sensitivity analysis, right? As you look forward next year, all things netted out, you say, yes, we might have to give some of this back, we might have to give some of that back. But kind of net-net, relative to where we were last year, we feel just as good or maybe stronger about hitting those margin targets, while at the same time as we continue to see kind of sales revised upwards.

So let me take a shot at that, Rob. So obviously, starting at the top of fiscal '22, how we come out post-COVID and what the stickiness is obviously impacts the top line and that drives that -- the sales dollars and then the gross profit, operating profit dollars, right? So -- but if you kind of step back and you look at this quarter, and let me just take this Q2 and dissect it a little bit differently, so you get an understanding of kind of what's happening in margin. If you look at -- we improved operating margin 250 basis points this quarter, and there's 3 buckets, okay? 
The first bucket is improvement that we got that's not going to stay with us. And that's 10 basis points of the 250. And what is that? That's all this COVID stuff. It's the COVID costs that are a bad guy. It's the lower SG&A from COVID because we're not traveling, which is a good guy. It's favorable absorption across the P&L, which is a good guy. You net all that stuff together, that's 10 basis points of benefit we got this quarter that's not going to recur. 
The second bucket is what is going to recur, and that's our core productivity. That is our realized productivity from supply chain. That's our Pinnacle synergies and then that's inflation and business investments. For the quarter, the net benefit of that was 60 basis points. And those programs will continue to go. 
The third bucket is where we are still evaluating it in terms of the ongoing benefit is price/mix. We had 180 basis points of price/mix benefit in Q2. Now the majority of that was mix and a lot of that's from volume. So there is a part of that, that will not recur. But there's also a benefit from less merchandising and pricing in there. And some of that will recur, but we're not quantifying what amount of the 180 will recur. So I say it that way because it's hard to look at some of these numbers sometimes and really understand what's ongoing versus what's not. So hopefully, that's a little helpful kind of looking at this quarter and thinking how it could apply. But all that kind of goes into the mixture. Obviously, inflation, everything else we're looking at as we run scenarios to give us the confidence to reaffirm '22."

Happy New Year, and thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our strong second quarter results as well as our perspective on how Conagra is positioned to continue to succeed in both the current environment and beyond. 
So let's get started. I'm very pleased with our strong results for the second quarter. Our business continued to perform well, both in the absolute and relative to peers. Our success to date in fiscal 2021 is not only a testament to our team's ability to adapt to the current environment, but a reflection of the work we've done to transform our business over the past 5-plus years. 
Our ongoing execution of the Conagra Way playbook perpetually reshaping our portfolio and capabilities for better growth and better margins has enabled us to rise to the occasion during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that has positioned the business to excel in the future. 
During the second quarter, we continue to build on our momentum, and our Q2 results exceeded our expectations across the board. We had strong, broad-based sales growth, our margin expansion is ahead of schedule, and I'm proud to announce that we've reached our deleveraging target earlier than originally planned. 
In keeping with our Conagra Way playbook, we continue to optimize the business for long-term value creation during the quarter. We made targeted investments in both production capacity and marketing support to drive the physical and mental availability of our products. We also remain committed to sculpting our portfolio through smart divestments with the agreement shortly after the second quarter closed to sell Peter Pan peanut butter. Peter Pan is a very good business, but it's not an investment priority for Conagra given our other portfolio priorities. 
Finally, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance for all metrics. And none of this would be possible without our exceptional team, particularly our frontline workers. So before we dive into the details of the quarter, I want to recognize everyone responsible for the continued extraordinary work of our supply chain. I'm extremely proud of the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members whose dedication has enabled our industry-leading performance. We remain focused on keeping employees safe while meeting the needs of our communities, customers and consumers. And I'd like to thank everyone at Conagra for making this possible. 
With that, let's get into the business update. As the table on Slide 7 shows, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations across the board. We delivered organic net sales growth of 8.1%, adjusted operating margin of 19.6% and adjusted EPS of $0.81. These results enabled us to reach our fiscal '21 net leverage ratio target of 3.6x ahead of schedule. 
During the second quarter, we continued to drive significant growth across our retail business. Total Conagra retail sales grew 10.4% year-over-year with strong growth across each of our snacks, frozen and staples portfolios. Our results were driven by continued success in expanding our presence with consumers and gaining share. Total Conagra household penetration grew 14 basis points versus a year ago, and our category share increased 26 basis points. 
Critical to our ability to sustain our growing relevancy with consumers is the physical availability of our products, whether through brick-and-mortar or online. And Slide 9 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce have continued to yield results. In the chart on the left, you can see the step change in e-commerce growth for total edible that has occurred since the onset of the pandemic. But what's really impressive about this chart is the sustainability of our e-commerce performance. We've retained a massive portion of the e-commerce sales we gained at the onset of the pandemic, and our results have outpaced total edible e-commerce growth each quarter. As a result of our sustained success, e-commerce continued its recent trend of steadily increasing as a percentage of our total retail sales, as you can see on the right. 
While e-commerce growth, both on an absolute basis and as a percent of overall sales, is not a new dynamic for Conagra. This growth has accelerated during COVID-19. In addition to our continued progress in e-commerce, our new innovation generated strong performance during the second quarter. When we began this journey over 5 years ago, we recognized that we had a lot of latent potential in the portfolio, it just had to be modernized. So we set out to aggressively do just that. And you'll recall that we established a goal of having 15% of our annual retail sales coming from products launched within the preceding 3 years. 
Slide 11 drills down on the strength of our recent innovation performance. Compared to last year's first half launches, the products we introduced in the first half of this year have achieved 37% more sales per UPC and 28% more distribution points per UPC during the comparable time period. 
Product performance highlights include: Marie Callender's post the #1 branded new item in frozen indulgent single-serve meals. Duncan Hines has delivered the top 3 highest velocity new items in single-serve baking and our modernized Hungry-Man brand is outpacing category growth by more than 2x. After a strong first half of fiscal '21, we will introduce even more new products that will build distribution in the second half. Expect to hear more about our upcoming product launches at CAGNY next month. 
Turning now to Slide 12. Total Conagra frozen retail sales grew an impressive 8.3% versus a year ago, thanks to strong growth in each of our 4 main frozen categories. Importantly, our terrific frozen vegetables business returned to strong growth in the quarter as we brought on our additional capacity investment online. 
Slide 13 digs a bit deeper into our largest frozen brand, Birds Eye. Birds Eye is a cornerstone of the important frozen vegetables segment, with a #1 position in the category and more than twice the category share of the closest branded competitor. Recall that Birds Eye previously faced some supply constraints as we worked to bring new capacity online. And last quarter, I noted that shipments for the brand were a bit ahead of consumption as retailers started rebuilding their inventories. 
As you can see in the charts on Slide 13, Birds Eye returned to form in Q2 as expected. In addition to strong retail sales growth of 7.2% in the quarter, Birds Eye gained an impressive 261 basis points of share from Q1 to Q2. 
Continuing to Slide 14, you can see how Birds Eye has attracted and retained more new buyers than our competition since the pandemic began. Frozen vegetables category remains highly relevant to consumers, and we believe the steps we've taken over the past several quarters to modernize the Birds Eye brand and expand capacity have positioned us well to build on our category leadership. 
Turning now to another area of strength, our leading portfolio of frozen single-serve meals had another terrific quarter. As you can see on Slide 15, Conagra has outperformed peers, driven category growth and attracted new buyers since the start of the pandemic. As the chart on this slide shows, we have 3 of the top brands in this category from both a trial and repeat perspective. 
Our snacks business also continued to see strong growth in the quarter. As you can see on Slide 16, we delivered double-digit retail sales growth on a year-over-year and 2-year basis in snacking, led by impressive results across popcorn, sweet treats and meat snacks. 
We're not just growing, we're winning versus the competition. Slide 17 shows how we grew share year-over-year in popcorn, meat snacks, hot cocoa and ready-to-eat pudding and gelatin in the quarter. 
Our staples portfolio also delivered solid results in Q2. Historically, this portfolio has served as a -- primarily as a source of cash for us, but it hasn't been looked at as a growth engine, but Slide 18 shows how staples remain highly relevant to consumers in the quarter as people continue to rediscover cooking and the utility, relevance and value of products in our portfolio. 
Our basket of the total staples category grew retail sales by 12.7% in the second quarter. People are returning to their kitchens during the pandemic and new younger consumers are discovering the joy of cooking. Many of the brands on this slide, including PAM, RO*TEL and Hunt's, are cooking utilities and ingredients. As we've discussed before, the current environment has resulted in consumers trying or reengaging with our products and coming back again and again. 
And that takes us to what we see going forward and how our business is uniquely set up to win. Our execution of the Conagra Way playbook over the last 5-plus years enabled us to deliver strong performance prior to the onset of COVID. And we firmly believe that our reshaped portfolio, modernized products and enhanced capabilities have been foundational to our ability to excel during these highly dynamic times. 
We all know that the COVID pandemic has driven an increase in at-home eating overall. But for Conagra, it has also meant an acceleration of the consumer trial adoption and repeat purchase rates of our products. Our result have been strong on both an absolute and relative basis. These dynamics have driven meaningful levels of incremental cash flow for our business, they've also enhanced the ROI of our previous disciplined investments in portfolio capabilities and the physical and mental availability of our products. 
Importantly, the Conagra Way is perpetual. While we've adapted to the current environment and delivered superior results, we also continue to look to the future and make smart investments to further strengthen our business. Our investments include continuing to modernize our products and packaging, increasing production capacity when category dynamics warrant, supporting on-shelf availability and increased e-commerce share and raising consumer awareness. To be clear, these investments are not a reaction to the near-term environment, but decisions rooted in our longer-term outlook for the business and our disciplined execution of the Conagra Way. 
We believe that Conagra is in a strong position to continue to win now and for years to come. We expect that our investments, coupled with consumer adoption and the proven stickiness of our product will result in Conagra continuing to deliver long-term profitable growth. 
In summary, we continue to see solid execution across our portfolio aligned with the Conagra Way playbook in Q2, which enabled us to deliver results that exceeded our expectations. Our business remains strong in the absolute and relative to competition, and we expect Conagra to be in an even better position post-COVID as a result of our ongoing disciplined approach to investment and innovation. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

Today, I'll walk through the details of our second quarter fiscal '21 performance and our Q3 outlook before we move to the Q&A portion of the call. I'll start by calling out a few performance highlights from the",1657,"Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll walk through the details of our second quarter fiscal '21 performance and our Q3 outlook before we move to the Q&A portion of the call. 
I'll start by calling out a few performance highlights from the quarter, which are captured on Slide 22. As Sean mentioned, outstanding execution by our teams across the company enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales, margin, profitability and deleveraging during the second quarter, while we continued to invest in the business. 
Reported and organic net sales for the quarter were up 6.2% and 8.1%, respectively, versus the same period a year ago. We continued our strong margin performance from Q1 as Q2 adjusted gross margin increased 139 basis points to 29.9%. Adjusted operating margin increased 250 basis points to 19.6%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.7% to $712 million in the quarter. And our adjusted diluted EPS grew 28.6% to $0.81 for the second quarter. 
Slide 23 breaks out the drivers of our 6.2% second quarter net sales growth. As you can see, the 8.1% increase in organic net sales was primarily driven by a 6.6% increase in volume related to the growth of at-home food consumption. The favorable impact of price/mix, which was evenly driven by favorable sales mix and less trade merchandising also contributed to our growth. The strong organic net sales growth was partially offset by the impacts of foreign exchange and a 1.7% net decrease associated with divestitures. 
The Peter Pan peanut butter business is still part of Conagra Brands and thus included in our organic results. We expect the sale of Peter Pan to be completed in Q3, at which point it will be removed from organic net sales growth. I will discuss the estimated impact of this divestiture shortly. 
Slide 24 summarizes our net sales by segment for the second quarter. On both a reported and organic basis, we saw continued significant growth in each of our 3 retail segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen and International. The net sales increase was primarily driven by the increase of at-home food consumption as a result of COVID-19, which benefited our retail segments, but negatively impacted our Foodservice segment. 
The Grocery & Snacks segment experienced strong organic net sales growth of 15.3% in the quarter. The segment's organic net sales growth outpaced its growth in consumption as retailers continue to rebuild inventories. Our Refrigerated & Frozen segment delivered organic net sales growth of 7.8%. This growth is a testament to our continued modernization and innovation efforts and illustrates the increasingly important role Refrigerated & Frozen products play in meeting the evolving needs of today's consumers. 
Turning to the International segment. Quarterly organic net sales increased 9.1%. This segment experienced particularly strong growth in both Canada and Mexico. This quarter, our Foodservice segment reported a 21.4% organic net sales decline primarily driven by a volume decrease of 25.3% due to less restaurant traffic as a result of COVID-19. 
Slide 25 outlines the adjusted operating margin bridge for the quarter versus the prior year period. As you can see, in the second quarter, our adjusted operating margin increased 250 basis points to 19.6%. Strong supply chain realized productivity, favorable price mix, cost synergies associated with Pinnacle Foods acquisition and fixed cost leverage combined to drive 440 basis points in adjusted operating margin improvement, more than offsetting the impact of cost of goods sold inflation and COVID-related costs in the quarter. Collectively, these drivers resulted in a 139 basis point increase in our adjusted gross margin versus the same period a year ago. 
A&P increased 4.7% on a dollar basis primarily due to increases in e-commerce marketing. A&P was flat on a percentage of sales basis this quarter versus Q2 a year ago. Finally, our adjusted SG&A rate was favorable by 110 basis points primarily as a result of fixed cost leverage on higher net sales, the Pinnacle cost synergies and temporarily reduced spending as employees work from home and significantly reduced their travel. 
I want to give you some additional perspective on our margin expansion. As I just mentioned, operating margin expanded 250 basis points for the quarter, well ahead of our expectations. Of this 250 basis point expansion in operating margin this quarter, approximately 60 basis points reflects our ongoing progress towards achieving our fiscal '22 margin target of 18% to 19%. We also saw an approximate 180 basis point margin benefit from price/mix in the quarter primarily driven by mix and, to a lesser extent, favorable pricing and lower trade merchandising. We expect to retain some of this benefit going forward, but exactly how much remains uncertain at this point. An additional 10 basis points of net margin expansion came from favorable fixed cost leverage across the entire P&L and COVID-related SG&A benefits, mostly offset by COVID-related cost of goods sold. We do not expect this net benefit to repeat next year. 
Slide 26 summarizes our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment for the second quarter. Our 3 retail segments, all operating profits increased by double-digit percentages versus the same period a year ago. Each retail segment benefited from higher organic net sales and strong supply chain realized productivity. 
In the Foodservice segment, however, operating profit decreased due to the COVID-related impacts of lower organic net sales and higher input costs that more than offset the impacts of favorable supply chain realized productivity and cost synergies. Overall, we're pleased with the continuation of the strong Q1 margin results into the second quarter, which are anchored by core productivity and benefits from the Pinnacle acquisition we expected to see. 
Turning to Slide 27. We've outlined the drivers of our second quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth versus the same period a year ago. EPS increased 28.6% to $0.81. The growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion and also benefited from a decrease in net interest expense as we've continued to reduce debt as prioritized. 
Slide 28 highlights our significant progress on the overall synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal '19. We captured an incremental $27 million in savings during the most recent quarter, bringing total cumulative synergies to $246 million. As a reminder, the majority of total synergies to date have been in SG&A. 
Cost of goods sold synergies have started to be a bigger portion of our synergy captured the last 2 quarters, and we expect them to make up a majority of our synergies going forward. We remain pleased with the team's progress in capturing synergies and remain on track to achieve our fiscal '22 synergy targets. 
Slide 29 shows the strong progress we've made to date to achieve our deleveraging targets. Since the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal '19 through the end of the second quarter of fiscal '21, we have reduced total gross debt by $2.3 billion, resulting in net debt of $9.2 billion. 
We are pleased to report that at the end of the second quarter, we achieved our net leverage ratio target of 3.6x, down from 5x at the closing of the Pinnacle acquisition, and 3.7x at the end of the first quarter of fiscal '21. Strong consistent improvements in debt reduction, coupled with robust earnings enabled us to achieve this net leverage ratio target ahead of schedule. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to be focused on executing a balanced capital allocation policy. We remain committed to solid investment-grade credit ratings as we continue to be opportunistic using our balance sheet to drive shareholder value, such as our increased investment in CapEx and the recent 29% dividend increase. 
Slide 30 summarizes our outlook. As Sean and I have both said throughout this presentation, we believe in the strength of Conagra's future. While we're confident in the quarters ahead and that Conagra will continue to excel beyond the COVID-19 environment, the sustained impact of COVID-19 remains dynamic and continues to make near-term forecasting with specificity a challenge. We expect the continuation of elevated retail demand and reduced foodservice demand compared to historic pre-COVID-19 demand levels. We are currently seeing both of these trends continue in the third quarter to date. 
For the third quarter, we expect organic net sales growth to be in the range of plus 6% to 8%. We expect Q3 operating margin to be in the range of 16% to 16.5%, implying a year-over-year increase of 30 to 80 basis points. This estimate includes an expected acceleration of our A&P investment in e-commerce marketing that we started in Q2, reducing the estimated year-over-year Q3 operating margin expansion. As a reminder, Q3 operating margins are historically lower than Q2 operating margins given the leverage impact on the seasonality of sales. Given these sales and margin factors, along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver third quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $0.56 to $0.60. 
Our third quarter guidance also continues to assume that the end-to-end supply chain operates effectively during this period of heightened demand. As outlined in our earnings release, our third quarter guidance does not yet include any impacts from the pending sale of the Peter Pan business. We are selling the business for approximately $102 million, and the expected annualized impact of the divestiture is a reduction of approximately $110 million of net sales and $0.03 of adjusted EPS. 
Lastly, we are reaffirming all metrics of our fiscal '22 guidance, which also excludes the impact of the pending sale of Peter Pan. We look forward to presenting again next month at CAGNY, where we will provide another update on our progress in executing the Conagra Way. We hope you'll join us. Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks this morning. 
I'll now pass it to the operator to open it up for questions."

And with fiscal '22, really, at this point, rapidly approaching as well as all the uncertainty around operating in the current environment, I guess, Sean, can you -- I mean what can you offer to sort of assure investors that Conagra can, not only reach its fiscal '22 targets, but I guess, more importantly, do it in a way that enables the company to deliver sustainable growth thereafter? As that's a question that I know I've been getting quite a bit these days. 
And as part of that, I saw A&P was up in the quarter, and you mentioned that we should expect that to continue into the fiscal third quarter, is that a pattern of -- is that pattern of some reinvestment one that we should expect more of moving forward?

So good questions. Let me try to unpack each piece of that. Yes, of course, we can provide that assurance.

Let me try to unpack each piece of that. Yes, of course, we can provide that assurance. We believe that what we are experiencing right now is the acceleration of product trial that in normal times would take years and hundreds of millions of dollars. Now as for what's going to sustain it through 2022 and beyond, in a nutshell, it is our people and our playbook. Now I spoke about our people in my prepared remarks, but let me remind investors about our playbook, particularly with respect to brand building. 
We have spent years curating and optimizing our approach to brand building, and we believe it is one of the most progressive and effective approaches in our space. The goal, obviously, in brand building is to create a powerful connection between our consumers and our brands. And in the simplest sense, in our eyes, to do that, you have to meet people where they are with modernized products and packages. And then you communicate information that is relevant and meaningful to them. And this is really the heart of our approach. 
So first, we meet people where they are. And you can ask yourself, ""Well, where are they these days?"" Well, these days, it's often, a, on their devices, seeking entertainment or information; or b, shopping in bricks and mortar or online. But it's also important to understand where they're not. And increasingly, we are seeing that they are not tethered to a television that is broadcasting mass market advertising. You know when I was 5 years old, that was the place you would find a consumer and you could communicate the information you had to share. But obviously, if that were our approach today and we're so monolithic, we wouldn't be finding a lot of consumers, especially not a lot of young consumers who we are very, very focused on because there are significant sustainable demographic tailwinds there that I've spoken about before. So instead, we reach our consumers in a diversity of locales from online to in-store, to on TV, to on radio and more. 
And then with respect to communicating the information that's relevant and meaningful to them, it starts, as you’ve heard me talk many times with, a very modernized product and package design and then a succinct provocative message around the appealing product benefit. That's our playbook. It works, and it will continue to work, and it's why our growth rates, our innovation performance, our trial, our repeat, our depth of repeat metrics are often outpacing our competitors. So in the simplest sense, what we are asserting here is that modern high-quality products with great online and in-store presence supported by provocative and targeted messaging will beat outdated lower-quality products with weak online or in-store presence, but lots of broadcast media every single time. 
And then lastly, the last part of your question, our total brand investment already is, it has been at a strong level, and it remains strong. But yes, it is variable. And in any given quarter, we can flex it based on the circumstance of the quarter. So recall when supply was constrained, we dialed back. When supply is ample and we see good ROI opportunities, we can flex it up. And by the way, we can flex it above or below the line, as you've seen. But overall, I would say the level is in a good place, and I think the strong results that you're seeing, not just in the absolute, but relative to competition shows that."

Can you walk us through again how the operating margin goes from where it landed in fiscal Q2 to your forecast for Q3? As you mentioned, it represents a pretty substantial sequential step-down, and is that purely just the marketing aspect? Or are there other factors we need to take into account there? And maybe it's commodity or commodities, which have spiked a bit and things of that nature."

First, as I mentioned in my remarks, the normal cadence of operating margin from the second quarter to the third quarter always shows a step down as we exit the holiday season and lose some of the operating leverage from the lower overall sales dollars. 
Second, when you look at Q3 operating margin a year ago, there were some benefits from reduced incentive comp accrual and SG&A a year ago in Q3. Third, inflation for the third quarter is now estimated to be around 3.5%, whereas in Q2, it was around 2.8%, 2.9%. 
And then lastly, as we just discussed, we are accelerating our A&P investment in the third quarter to support increased e-commerce marketing that we started in Q2. So we expect double-digit increase in A&P in the third quarter versus a year ago. So they're really the factors. And with that though, we still, with our guidance, we're implying a 30 to 80 basis point improvement in operating margin in the third quarter."

We were a global conglomerate. We were struggling in the world of private label. We were trying to be a lot of things to a lot of people. 
Today, we are a focused pure-play, largely North American company. And we play in 3 spaces: frozen, we play in snacks, and it's a very unique snack business with a lot of neglected coves as we call it. And we play in staples, and that's pretty much the portfolio. And over the last 5 years, the heavy lift was in the early days where we had to tackle value over volume, and that was painful but necessary to go through to purge out low-quality volume and establish a new foundation. But it put us in a position to then layer on outstanding innovation on a much stronger base. 
And we started, as you know, with frozen, and we have what we believe is the leading frozen portfolio in North America that has been growing incredibly robustly. It is a centerpiece of our investment and our innovation effort, and that will continue because we are in the early innings of frozen's success. 
And as I pointed out in CAGNY last year, when you look at the demographic tailwinds we have from millennials as they form households, and they -- we know they're already big users of frozen, but then when they form households, have their first child and then additional children, the per capita consumption of those household goes up and up and up again, so that's frozen. 
Our snacks business, we really rebased that a couple of years ago, and we said we're going to stand as a snack company. We run it like a snack company. And the performance there has just been outstanding. It's been both organic and it's been through M&A. And we think that playbook will continue. It's a high-growth, high-margin business, and we've got extremely strong relative market shares in that space. So that will also continue, and that remains the other, probably our second priority in terms of investment. And again, these investments come below the line and above the line. It's all about the combination of physical and available -- mental availability, meeting people where they are, as I just pointed out. 
But the third piece is one of the more interesting pieces during and post pandemic, which is our staples portfolio, about 1/3 of our retail business in staples, which historically was a cash managed for cash type of business. But these products here are not -- there are a lot of products that are not fundamentally different from what you might see at some of our peer companies like a McCormick, where spices are utilities in the cooking process, no differently than a can of RO*TEL or PAM cooking spray is a utility in the cooking process. 
And to some degree, those products go as cooking goes. And what's happening right now is cooking is in a very, very good place, not just because of the older generations who've always been more established in terms of cooking behavior, but the fact that these younger households have learned to kind of be comfortable in their own home, have explored their culinary and built their culinary skills out and are absolutely enamored with recipes and cooking right now. 
So a lot of our staple products, be it products like Hunt's tomato, RO*TEL, our salsa business, our dressing businesses. These are businesses that are playing a meaningful role during the pandemic, and we believe because of some of these demographic tailwinds will continue at an elevated level post-pandemic. 
So very strong up forward-looking performance in frozen and snacks and more optimism in terms of the growth potential out of staples than probably pre-pandemic is how I would put it. Dave, do you want to add anything to that?"

One of the things I shared last quarter that I might point into our investors' attention back to was a slide that showed that after the previous recession in 2008, we saw a permanently elevated level of at-home eating occasions. And what was more interesting about the first 6 months of this pandemic is the level of elevation we saw this year or this past year was twice what we saw in 2008. And that was just a -- this is in a very short period of time. So there is previous evidence of stickiness post the adversity.

But if that sustainable growth is already here, can you talk about -- and I guess this is for Dave too, how should you think or how should we think about your desire to kind of grow CapEx over the next couple of years to support that heightened demand? You talked about free cash flow, that wasn't changed. I'm just wondering if there's a chance that as you see demand perhaps being sticky, that your plants will need a little more expansion to kind of support the -- what's out there in the consumer world?"

When we think about ROIC, when we deploy our capital against organic growth opportunities, we see oftentimes some of the very best returns, and we have done that. So on Slim Jim, as an example, we've dramatically increased the size of the plant a year or so ago, and that business has performed so well and utilizing that capacity, we're on the precipice of doing that again. And so those types of capital investments are clearly on our radar and are priorities for us. But we have other capital allocation options as well, and that is all part of our balanced approach to capital allocation. Dave, do you want to pick up on that a little bit?"

The key part of this, and then I'll pass it to Sean and we've talked about this at Investor Day that we manage margins to offset inflation in a lot of different areas. And so we look at, obviously, we have our productivity programs and supply chain. We have our margin-accretive innovation, our pricing, trade optimization, our mix. And then the way we can sculpt margin through M&A. And so we're obviously looking at all those levers. And then more recently, obviously, with Pinnacle and the synergies that we're getting out of that, that's helping drive margin plus the fixed overhead absorption we're getting from the higher volumes from COVID.

Obviously, we've been very active in the last 5 years with inbound stuff and outbound stuff. And when we do that, both ways, it is -- we do consider not -- we consider it as we're reshaping the portfolio for better growth and better margins. And so items that come in and brands that come in, not only need to be strategic, but ideally will help us in terms of our forward-looking growth rates and margins. Similarly, items that we divest sometimes can be things that have been a chronic drag on growth rates or margins. So by effectively managing kind of both the inbounds and the outbounds, remainco, so to speak, the remaining company going forward should look better. That's the ideal situation in terms of growth prospects and margin. 
And we've got -- obviously, we've been active doing that. We'll continue to be active. We just announced the divestiture of Peter Pan. We've got this capital loss carryforward that we're well aware of, we talk about every day. And our principle there is pretty simple, which is if something is not a fit for us and somebody else wants to make an offer for an asset that is above what we see as the intrinsic value, then we're all ears on that kind of thing. 
Similarly, on inbound stuff, we're just now getting to the point where we're feeling -- our focus has been about delevering. Let's not -- let's be very clear on that. Ever since the Pinnacle acquisition, we've been 100% focused on delevering. We're now ahead of that cadence. So we can start to see our way toward other uses of capital going forward, what they could be share buybacks, they could be bolt-on acquisitions. They just have to make sense. Or could be investing in our business, as Ken pointed out in our own CapEx. So that's -- all of that's fair game. Dave, do you want to add anything to that?"

And then it sounds like you think you can hold some of the pricing benefits you've already received. But then we have to combine that with some or, let's say, less fixed cost leverage as we think about next year. So it seems like kind of what's implied in all of it is our targets aren't changing, but the targets that we have are still slightly below where we've come in the first half of this year. So it sounds like just kind of where you sit now, your visibility, all things considered, you just pointed to this, Dave, in terms of your -- kind of your sensitivity analysis, right? As you look forward next year, all things netted out, you say, yes, we might have to give some of this back, we might have to give some of that back. But kind of net-net, relative to where we were last year, we feel just as good or maybe stronger about hitting those margin targets while at the same time as we continue to see kind of sales revised upwards. 
So kind of net-net, what I'm asking is like why wouldn’t -- not just the margin piece, why wouldn’t kind of the operating profit dollars in fiscal '22 be higher than you even thought they would have been 1.5 years ago? Lot in there, but..."

So let me take a shot at that, Rob. So obviously, starting at the top of fiscal '22, how we come out post-COVID and what the stickiness is obviously impacts the top line and that drives that -- the sales dollars and then the gross profit, operating profit dollars, right? So -- but if you kind of step back and you look at this quarter, and let me just take this Q2 and dissect it a little bit differently, so you get an understanding of kind of what's happening in margin. If you look at -- we improved operating margin 250 basis points this quarter, and there's 3 buckets, okay? 
The first bucket is improvement that we got that's not going to stay with us. And that's 10 basis points of the 250. And what is that? That's all this COVID stuff. It's the COVID costs that are a bad guy. It's the lower SG&A from COVID because we're not traveling, which is a good guy. It's favorable absorption across the P&L, which is a good guy. You net all that stuff together, that's 10 basis points of benefit we got this quarter that's not going to recur. 
The second bucket is what is going to recur, and that's our core productivity. That is our realized productivity from supply chain. That's our Pinnacle synergies and then that's inflation and business investments. For the quarter, the net benefit of that was 60 basis points and those programs will continue to go. 
The third bucket is where we are still evaluating it in terms of the ongoing benefit is price/mix. We had 180 basis points of price/mix benefit in Q2. Now the majority of that was mix and a lot of that's from volume. So there is a part of that, that will not recur. But there's also a benefit from less merchandising and pricing in there. And some of that will recur, but we're not quantifying what amount of the 180 will recur. So I say it that way because it's hard to look at some of these numbers sometimes and really understand what's ongoing versus what's not. So hopefully, that's a little helpful kind of looking at this quarter and thinking how it could apply. But all that kind of goes into the mixture. Obviously, inflation, everything else we're looking at as we run scenarios to give us the confidence to reaffirm '22."

Happy New Year, and thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our strong second quarter results as well as our perspective on how Conagra is positioned to continue to succeed in both the current environment and beyond. 
So let's get started. I'm very pleased with our strong results for the second quarter. Our business continued to perform well, both in the absolute and relative to peers. Our success to date in fiscal 2021 is not only a testament to our team's ability to adapt to the current environment, but a reflection of the work we've done to transform our business over the past 5-plus years. 
Our ongoing execution of the Conagra Way playbook perpetually reshaping our portfolio and capabilities for better growth and better margins has enabled us to rise to the occasion during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that has positioned the business to excel in the future. 
During the second quarter, we continue to build on our momentum, and our Q2 results exceeded our expectations across the board. We had strong, broad-based sales growth, our margin expansion is ahead of schedule, and I'm proud to announce that we've reached our deleveraging target earlier than originally planned. 
In keeping with our Conagra Way playbook, we continue to optimize the business for long-term value creation during the quarter. We made targeted investments in both production capacity and marketing support to drive the physical and mental availability of our products. We also remain committed to sculpting our portfolio through smart divestments with the agreement shortly after the second quarter closed to sell Peter Pan peanut butter. Peter Pan is a very good business, but it's not an investment priority for Conagra given our other portfolio priorities. 
Finally, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance for all metrics. And none of this would be possible without our exceptional team, particularly our frontline workers. So before we dive into the details of the quarter, I want to recognize everyone responsible for the continued extraordinary work of our supply chain. I'm extremely proud of the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members whose dedication has enabled our industry-leading performance. We remain focused on keeping employees safe while meeting the needs of our communities, customers and consumers. And I'd like to thank everyone at Conagra for making this possible. 
With that, let's get into the business update. As the table on Slide 7 shows, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations across the board. We delivered organic net sales growth of 8.1%, adjusted operating margin of 19.6% and adjusted EPS of $0.81. These results enabled us to reach our fiscal '21 net leverage ratio target of 3.6x ahead of schedule. 
During the second quarter, we continued to drive significant growth across our retail business. Total Conagra retail sales grew 10.4% year-over-year with strong growth across each of our snacks, frozen and staples portfolios. Our results were driven by continued success in expanding our presence with consumers and gaining share. Total Conagra household penetration grew 14 basis points versus a year ago, and our category share increased 26 basis points. 
Critical to our ability to sustain our growing relevancy with consumers is the physical availability of our products, whether through brick-and-mortar or online. And Slide 9 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce have continued to yield results. In the chart on the left, you can see the step change in e-commerce growth for total edible that has occurred since the onset of the pandemic. But what's really impressive about this chart is the sustainability of our e-commerce performance. We've retained a massive portion of the e-commerce sales we gained at the onset of the pandemic, and our results have outpaced total edible e-commerce growth each quarter. As a result of our sustained success, e-commerce continued its recent trend of steadily increasing as a percentage of our total retail sales, as you can see on the right. 
While e-commerce growth, both on an absolute basis and as a percent of overall sales, is not a new dynamic for Conagra. This growth has accelerated during COVID-19. In addition to our continued progress in e-commerce, our new innovation generated strong performance during the second quarter. When we began this journey over 5 years ago, we recognized that we had a lot of latent potential in the portfolio, it just had to be modernized. So we set out to aggressively do just that. And you'll recall that we established a goal of having 15% of our annual retail sales coming from products launched within the preceding 3 years. 
Slide 11 drills down on the strength of our recent innovation performance. Compared to last year's first half launches, the products we introduced in the first half of this year have achieved 37% more sales per UPC and 28% more distribution points per UPC during the comparable time period. 
Product performance highlights include: Marie Callender's post the #1 branded new item in frozen indulgent single-serve meals. Duncan Hines has delivered the top 3 highest velocity new items in single-serve baking and our modernized Hungry-Man brand is outpacing category growth by more than 2x. After a strong first half of fiscal '21, we will introduce even more new products that will build distribution in the second half. Expect to hear more about our upcoming product launches at CAGNY next month. 
Turning now to Slide 12. Total Conagra frozen retail sales grew an impressive 8.3% versus a year ago, thanks to strong growth in each of our 4 main frozen categories. Importantly, our terrific frozen vegetables business returned to strong growth in the quarter as we brought on our additional capacity investment online. 
Slide 13 digs a bit deeper into our largest frozen brand, Birds Eye. Birds Eye is a cornerstone of the important frozen vegetables segment, with a #1 position in the category and more than twice the category share of the closest branded competitor. Recall that Birds Eye previously faced some supply constraints as we worked to bring new capacity online. And last quarter, I noted that shipments for the brand were a bit ahead of consumption as retailers started rebuilding their inventories. 
As you can see in the charts on Slide 13, Birds Eye returned to form in Q2 as expected. In addition to strong retail sales growth of 7.2% in the quarter, Birds Eye gained an impressive 261 basis points of share from Q1 to Q2. 
Continuing to Slide 14, you can see how Birds Eye has attracted and retained more new buyers than our competition since the pandemic began. Frozen vegetables category remains highly relevant to consumers, and we believe the steps we've taken over the past several quarters to modernize the Birds Eye brand and expand capacity have positioned us well to build on our category leadership. 
Turning now to another area of strength, our leading portfolio of frozen single-serve meals had another terrific quarter. As you can see on Slide 15, Conagra has outperformed peers, driven category growth and attracted new buyers since the start of the pandemic. As the chart on this slide shows, we have 3 of the top brands in this category from both a trial and repeat perspective. 
Our snacks business also continued to see strong growth in the quarter. As you can see on Slide 16, we delivered double-digit retail sales growth on a year-over-year and 2-year basis in snacking, led by impressive results across popcorn, sweet treats and meat snacks. 
We're not just growing, we're winning versus the competition. Slide 17 shows how we grew share year-over-year in popcorn, meat snacks, hot cocoa and ready-to-eat pudding and gelatin in the quarter. 
Our staples portfolio also delivered solid results in Q2. Historically, this portfolio has served as a -- primarily as a source of cash for us, but it hasn't been looked at as a growth engine, but Slide 18 shows how staples remain highly relevant to consumers in the quarter as people continue to rediscover cooking and the utility, relevance and value of products in our portfolio. 
Our basket of the total staples category grew retail sales by 12.7% in the second quarter. People are returning to their kitchens during the pandemic and new younger consumers are discovering the joy of cooking. Many of the brands on this slide, including PAM, RO*TEL and Hunt's, are cooking utilities and ingredients. As we've discussed before, the current environment has resulted in consumers trying or reengaging with our products and coming back again and again. 
And that takes us to what we see going forward and how our business is uniquely set up to win. Our execution of the Conagra Way playbook over the last 5-plus years enabled us to deliver strong performance prior to the onset of COVID. And we firmly believe that our reshaped portfolio, modernized products and enhanced capabilities have been foundational to our ability to excel during these highly dynamic times. 
We all know that the COVID pandemic has driven an increase in at-home eating overall. But for Conagra, it has also meant an acceleration of the consumer trial adoption and repeat purchase rates of our products. Our result have been strong on both an absolute and relative basis. These dynamics have driven meaningful levels of incremental cash flow for our business, they've also enhanced the ROI of our previous disciplined investments in portfolio capabilities and the physical and mental availability of our products. 
Importantly, the Conagra Way is perpetual. While we've adapted to the current environment and delivered superior results, we also continue to look to the future and make smart investments to further strengthen our business. Our investments include continuing to modernize our products and packaging, increasing production capacity when category dynamics warrant, supporting on-shelf availability and increased e-commerce share and raising consumer awareness. To be clear, these investments are not a reaction to the near-term environment, but decisions rooted in our longer-term outlook for the business and our disciplined execution of the Conagra Way. 
We believe that Conagra is in a strong position to continue to win now and for years to come. We expect that our investments, coupled with consumer adoption and the proven stickiness of our product will result in Conagra continuing to deliver long-term profitable growth. 
In summary, we continue to see solid execution across our portfolio aligned with the Conagra Way playbook in Q2, which enabled us to deliver results that exceeded our expectations. Our business remains strong in the absolute and relative to competition, and we expect Conagra to be in an even better position post-COVID as a result of our ongoing disciplined approach to investment and innovation. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

Today, I'll walk through the details of our second quarter fiscal '21 performance and our Q3 outlook before we move to the Q&A portion of the call. I'll start by calling out a few performance highlights from the",1657,"Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll walk through the details of our second quarter fiscal '21 performance and our Q3 outlook before we move to the Q&A portion of the call. 
I'll start by calling out a few performance highlights from the quarter, which are captured on Slide 22. As Sean mentioned, outstanding execution by our teams across the company enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales, margin, profitability and deleveraging during the second quarter, while we continued to invest in the business. 
Reported and organic net sales for the quarter were up 6.2% and 8.1%, respectively, versus the same period a year ago. We continued our strong margin performance from Q1 as Q2 adjusted gross margin increased 139 basis points to 29.9%. Adjusted operating margin increased 250 basis points to 19.6%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.7% to $712 million in the quarter. And our adjusted diluted EPS grew 28.6% to $0.81 for the second quarter. 
Slide 23 breaks out the drivers of our 6.2% second quarter net sales growth. As you can see, the 8.1% increase in organic net sales was primarily driven by a 6.6% increase in volume related to the growth of at-home food consumption. The favorable impact of price/mix, which was evenly driven by favorable sales mix and less trade merchandising also contributed to our growth. The strong organic net sales growth was partially offset by the impacts of foreign exchange and a 1.7% net decrease associated with divestitures. 
The Peter Pan peanut butter business is still part of Conagra Brands and thus included in our organic results. We expect the sale of Peter Pan to be completed in Q3, at which point it will be removed from organic net sales growth. I will discuss the estimated impact of this divestiture shortly. 
Slide 24 summarizes our net sales by segment for the second quarter. On both a reported and organic basis, we saw continued significant growth in each of our 3 retail segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen and International. The net sales increase was primarily driven by the increase of at-home food consumption as a result of COVID-19, which benefited our retail segments, but negatively impacted our Foodservice segment. 
The Grocery & Snacks segment experienced strong organic net sales growth of 15.3% in the quarter. The segment's organic net sales growth outpaced its growth in consumption as retailers continue to rebuild inventories. Our Refrigerated & Frozen segment delivered organic net sales growth of 7.8%. This growth is a testament to our continued modernization and innovation efforts and illustrates the increasingly important role Refrigerated & Frozen products play in meeting the evolving needs of today's consumers. 
Turning to the International segment. Quarterly organic net sales increased 9.1%. This segment experienced particularly strong growth in both Canada and Mexico. This quarter, our Foodservice segment reported a 21.4% organic net sales decline primarily driven by a volume decrease of 25.3% due to less restaurant traffic as a result of COVID-19. 
Slide 25 outlines the adjusted operating margin bridge for the quarter versus the prior year period. As you can see, in the second quarter, our adjusted operating margin increased 250 basis points to 19.6%. Strong supply chain realized productivity, favorable price mix, cost synergies associated with Pinnacle Foods acquisition and fixed cost leverage combined to drive 440 basis points in adjusted operating margin improvement, more than offsetting the impact of cost of goods sold inflation and COVID-related costs in the quarter. Collectively, these drivers resulted in a 139 basis point increase in our adjusted gross margin versus the same period a year ago. 
A&P increased 4.7% on a dollar basis primarily due to increases in e-commerce marketing. A&P was flat on a percentage of sales basis this quarter versus Q2 a year ago. Finally, our adjusted SG&A rate was favorable by 110 basis points primarily as a result of fixed cost leverage on higher net sales, the Pinnacle cost synergies and temporarily reduced spending as employees work from home and significantly reduced their travel. 
I want to give you some additional perspective on our margin expansion. As I just mentioned, operating margin expanded 250 basis points for the quarter, well ahead of our expectations. Of this 250 basis point expansion in operating margin this quarter, approximately 60 basis points reflects our ongoing progress towards achieving our fiscal '22 margin target of 18% to 19%. We also saw an approximate 180 basis point margin benefit from price/mix in the quarter primarily driven by mix and, to a lesser extent, favorable pricing and lower trade merchandising. We expect to retain some of this benefit going forward, but exactly how much remains uncertain at this point. An additional 10 basis points of net margin expansion came from favorable fixed cost leverage across the entire P&L and COVID-related SG&A benefits, mostly offset by COVID-related cost of goods sold. We do not expect this net benefit to repeat next year. 
Slide 26 summarizes our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment for the second quarter. Our 3 retail segments, all operating profits increased by double-digit percentages versus the same period a year ago. Each retail segment benefited from higher organic net sales and strong supply chain realized productivity. 
In the Foodservice segment, however, operating profit decreased due to the COVID-related impacts of lower organic net sales and higher input costs that more than offset the impacts of favorable supply chain realized productivity and cost synergies. Overall, we're pleased with the continuation of the strong Q1 margin results into the second quarter, which are anchored by core productivity and benefits from the Pinnacle acquisition we expected to see. 
Turning to Slide 27. We've outlined the drivers of our second quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth versus the same period a year ago. EPS increased 28.6% to $0.81. The growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion and also benefited from a decrease in net interest expense as we've continued to reduce debt as prioritized. 
Slide 28 highlights our significant progress on the overall synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal '19. We captured an incremental $27 million in savings during the most recent quarter, bringing total cumulative synergies to $246 million. As a reminder, the majority of total synergies to date have been in SG&A. 
Cost of goods sold synergies have started to be a bigger portion of our synergy captured the last 2 quarters, and we expect them to make up a majority of our synergies going forward. We remain pleased with the team's progress in capturing synergies and remain on track to achieve our fiscal '22 synergy targets. 
Slide 29 shows the strong progress we've made to date to achieve our deleveraging targets. Since the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal '19 through the end of the second quarter of fiscal '21, we have reduced total gross debt by $2.3 billion, resulting in net debt of $9.2 billion. 
We are pleased to report that at the end of the second quarter, we achieved our net leverage ratio target of 3.6x, down from 5x at the closing of the Pinnacle acquisition, and 3.7x at the end of the first quarter of fiscal '21. Strong consistent improvements in debt reduction, coupled with robust earnings enabled us to achieve this net leverage ratio target ahead of schedule. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to be focused on executing a balanced capital allocation policy. We remain committed to solid investment-grade credit ratings as we continue to be opportunistic using our balance sheet to drive shareholder value, such as our increased investment in CapEx and the recent 29% dividend increase. 
Slide 30 summarizes our outlook. As Sean and I have both said throughout this presentation, we believe in the strength of Conagra's future. While we're confident in the quarters ahead and that Conagra will continue to excel beyond the COVID-19 environment, the sustained impact of COVID-19 remains dynamic and continues to make near-term forecasting with specificity a challenge. We expect the continuation of elevated retail demand and reduced foodservice demand compared to historic pre-COVID-19 demand levels. We are currently seeing both of these trends continue in the third quarter to date. 
For the third quarter, we expect organic net sales growth to be in the range of plus 6% to 8%. We expect Q3 operating margin to be in the range of 16% to 16.5%, implying a year-over-year increase of 30 to 80 basis points. This estimate includes an expected acceleration of our A&P investment in e-commerce marketing that we started in Q2, reducing the estimated year-over-year Q3 operating margin expansion. As a reminder, Q3 operating margins are historically lower than Q2 operating margins given the leverage impact on the seasonality of sales. Given these sales and margin factors, along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver third quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $0.56 to $0.60. 
Our third quarter guidance also continues to assume that the end-to-end supply chain operates effectively during this period of heightened demand. As outlined in our earnings release, our third quarter guidance does not yet include any impacts from the pending sale of the Peter Pan business. We are selling the business for approximately $102 million, and the expected annualized impact of the divestiture is a reduction of approximately $110 million of net sales and $0.03 of adjusted EPS. 
Lastly, we are reaffirming all metrics of our fiscal '22 guidance, which also excludes the impact of the pending sale of Peter Pan. We look forward to presenting again next month at CAGNY, where we will provide another update on our progress in executing the Conagra Way. We hope you'll join us. Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks this morning. 
I'll now pass it to the operator to open it up for questions."

So good questions. Let me try to unpack each piece of that. Yes, of course, we can provide that assurance.

Let me try to unpack each piece of that. Yes, of course, we can provide that assurance. We believe that what we are experiencing right now is the acceleration of product trial that in normal times would take years and hundreds of millions of dollars. Now as for what's going to sustain it through 2022 and beyond, in a nutshell, it is our people and our playbook. Now I spoke about our people in my prepared remarks, but let me remind investors about our playbook, particularly with respect to brand building. 
We have spent years curating and optimizing our approach to brand building, and we believe it is one of the most progressive and effective approaches in our space. The goal, obviously, in brand building is to create a powerful connection between our consumers and our brands. And in the simplest sense, in our eyes, to do that, you have to meet people where they are with modernized products and packages. And then you communicate information that is relevant and meaningful to them. And this is really the heart of our approach. 
So first, we meet people where they are. And you can ask yourself, ""Well, where are they these days?"" Well, these days, it's often, a, on their devices, seeking entertainment or information; or b, shopping in bricks and mortar or online. But it's also important to understand where they're not. And increasingly, we are seeing that they are not tethered to a television that is broadcasting mass market advertising. You know when I was 5 years old, that was the place you would find a consumer and you could communicate the information you had to share. But obviously, if that were our approach today and we're so monolithic, we wouldn't be finding a lot of consumers, especially not a lot of young consumers who we are very, very focused on because there are significant sustainable demographic tailwinds there that I've spoken about before. So instead, we reach our consumers in a diversity of locales from online to in-store, to on TV, to on radio and more. 
And then with respect to communicating the information that's relevant and meaningful to them, it starts, as you’ve heard me talk many times with, a very modernized product and package design and then a succinct provocative message around the appealing product benefit. That's our playbook. It works, and it will continue to work, and it's why our growth rates, our innovation performance, our trial, our repeat, our depth of repeat metrics are often outpacing our competitors. So in the simplest sense, what we are asserting here is that modern high-quality products with great online and in-store presence supported by provocative and targeted messaging will beat outdated lower-quality products with weak online or in-store presence, but lots of broadcast media every single time. 
And then lastly, the last part of your question, our total brand investment already is, it has been at a strong level, and it remains strong. But yes, it is variable. And in any given quarter, we can flex it based on the circumstance of the quarter. So recall when supply was constrained, we dialed back. When supply is ample and we see good ROI opportunities, we can flex it up. And by the way, we can flex it above or below the line, as you've seen. But overall, I would say the level is in a good place, and I think the strong results that you're seeing, not just in the absolute, but relative to competition shows that."

First, as I mentioned in my remarks, the normal cadence of operating margin from the second quarter to the third quarter always shows a step down as we exit the holiday season and lose some of the operating leverage from the lower overall sales dollars. 
Second, when you look at Q3 operating margin a year ago, there were some benefits from reduced incentive comp accrual and SG&A a year ago in Q3. Third, inflation for the third quarter is now estimated to be around 3.5%, whereas in Q2, it was around 2.8%, 2.9%. 
And then lastly, as we just discussed, we are accelerating our A&P investment in the third quarter to support increased e-commerce marketing that we started in Q2. So we expect double-digit increase in A&P in the third quarter versus a year ago. So they're really the factors. And with that though, we still, with our guidance, we're implying a 30 to 80 basis point improvement in operating margin in the third quarter."

Well, if you go back 5 years, the company 5 to 5.5 years ago, it didn't look anything like it looks today, right? We were a global conglomerate. We were struggling in the world of private label. We were trying to be a lot of things to a",668,"Yes, sure, David. Well, if you go back 5 years, the company 5 to 5.5 years ago, it didn't look anything like it looks today, right? We were a global conglomerate. We were struggling in the world of private label. We were trying to be a lot of things to a lot of people. 
Today, we are a focused pure-play, largely North American company. And we play in 3 spaces: frozen, we play in snacks, and it's a very unique snack business with a lot of neglected coves as we call it. And we play in staples, and that's pretty much the portfolio. And over the last 5 years, the heavy lift was in the early days where we had to tackle value over volume, and that was painful but necessary to go through to purge out low-quality volume and establish a new foundation. But it put us in a position to then layer on outstanding innovation on a much stronger base. 
And we started, as you know, with frozen, and we have what we believe is the leading frozen portfolio in North America that has been growing incredibly robustly. It is a centerpiece of our investment and our innovation effort, and that will continue because we are in the early innings of frozen's success. 
And as I pointed out in CAGNY last year, when you look at the demographic tailwinds we have from millennials as they form households, and they -- we know they're already big users of frozen, but then when they form households, have their first child and then additional children, the per capita consumption of those household goes up and up and up again, so that's frozen. 
Our snacks business, we really rebased that a couple of years ago, and we said we're going to stand as a snack company. We run it like a snack company. And the performance there has just been outstanding. It's been both organic and it's been through M&A. And we think that playbook will continue. It's a high-growth, high-margin business, and we've got extremely strong relative market shares in that space. So that will also continue, and that remains the other, probably our second priority in terms of investment. And again, these investments come below the line and above the line. It's all about the combination of physical and available -- mental availability, meeting people where they are, as I just pointed out. 
But the third piece is one of the more interesting pieces during and post pandemic, which is our staples portfolio, about 1/3 of our retail business in staples, which historically was a cash managed for cash type of business. But these products here are not -- there are a lot of products that are not fundamentally different from what you might see at some of our peer companies like a McCormick, where spices are utilities in the cooking process, no differently than a can of RO*TEL or PAM cooking spray is a utility in the cooking process. 
And to some degree, those products go as cooking goes. And what's happening right now is cooking is in a very, very good place, not just because of the older generations who've always been more established in terms of cooking behavior, but the fact that these younger households have learned to kind of be comfortable in their own home, have explored their culinary and built their culinary skills out and are absolutely enamored with recipes and cooking right now. 
So a lot of our staple products, be it products like Hunt's tomato, RO*TEL, our salsa business, our dressing businesses. These are businesses that are playing a meaningful role during the pandemic, and we believe because of some of these demographic tailwinds will continue at an elevated level post-pandemic. 
So very strong up forward-looking performance in frozen and snacks and more optimism in terms of the growth potential out of staples than probably pre-pandemic is how I would put it. Dave, do you want to add anything to that?"

One of the things I shared last quarter that I might point into our investors' attention back to was a slide that showed that after the previous recession in 2008, we saw a permanently elevated level of at-home eating occasions. And what was more interesting about the first 6 months of this pandemic is the level of elevation we saw this year or this past year was twice what we saw in 2008. And that was just a -- this is in a very short period of time. So there is previous evidence of stickiness post the adversity.

And we've got -- obviously, we've been active doing that. We'll continue to be active. We just announced the divestiture of Peter Pan. We've got this capital loss carryforward that we're well aware of, we talk about every day. And our principle there is pretty simple, which is if something is not a fit for us and somebody else wants to make an offer for an asset that is above what we see as the intrinsic value, then we're all ears on that kind of thing. 
Similarly, on inbound stuff, we're just now getting to the point where we're feeling -- our focus has been about delevering. Let's not -- let's be very clear on that. Ever since the Pinnacle acquisition, we've been 100% focused on delevering. We're now ahead of that cadence. So we can start to see our way toward other uses of capital going forward, what they could be share buybacks, they could be bolt-on acquisitions. They just have to make sense. Or could be investing in our business, as Ken pointed out in our own CapEx. So that's -- all of that's fair game. Dave, do you want to add anything to that?"

Obviously, as you said, we could see, right, the margin targets coming in ahead of plan, leverage target is coming in ahead of plan. But then we're also all kind of talking about the inflationary effects potentially this year. 
And then it sounds like you think you can hold some of the pricing benefits you've already received. But then we have to combine that with some or, let's say, less fixed cost leverage as we think about next year. So it seems like kind of what's implied in all of it is our targets aren't changing, but the targets that we have are still slightly below where we've come in the first half of this year. So it sounds like just kind of where you sit now, your visibility, all things considered, you just pointed to this, Dave, in terms of your -- kind of your sensitivity analysis, right? As you look forward next year, all things netted out, you say, yes, we might have to give some of this back, we might have to give some of that back. But kind of net-net, relative to where we were last year, we feel just as good or maybe stronger about hitting those margin targets while at the same time as we continue to see kind of sales revised upwards. 
So kind of net-net, what I'm asking is like why wouldn’t -- not just the margin piece, why wouldn’t kind of the operating profit dollars in fiscal '22 be higher than you even thought they would have been 1.5 years ago? Lot in there, but..."

So let me take a shot at that, Rob. So obviously, starting at the top of fiscal '22, how we come out post-COVID and what the stickiness is obviously impacts the top line and that drives that -- the sales dollars and then the gross profit, operating profit dollars, right? So -- but if you kind of step back and you look at this quarter, and let me just take this Q2 and dissect it a little bit differently, so you get an understanding of kind of what's happening in margin. If you look at -- we improved operating margin 250 basis points this quarter, and there's 3 buckets, okay? 
The first bucket is improvement that we got that's not going to stay with us. And that's 10 basis points of the 250. And what is that? That's all this COVID stuff. It's the COVID costs that are a bad guy. It's the lower SG&A from COVID because we're not traveling, which is a good guy. It's favorable absorption across the P&L, which is a good guy. You net all that stuff together, that's 10 basis points of benefit we got this quarter that's not going to recur. 
The second bucket is what is going to recur, and that's our core productivity. That is our realized productivity from supply chain. That's our Pinnacle synergies and then that's inflation and business investments. For the quarter, the net benefit of that was 60 basis points and those programs will continue to go. 
The third bucket is where we are still evaluating it in terms of the ongoing benefit is price/mix. We had 180 basis points of price/mix benefit in Q2. Now the majority of that was mix and a lot of that's from volume. So there is a part of that, that will not recur. But there's also a benefit from less merchandising and pricing in there. And some of that will recur, but we're not quantifying what amount of the 180 will recur. So I say it that way because it's hard to look at some of these numbers sometimes and really understand what's ongoing versus what's not. So hopefully, that's a little helpful kind of looking at this quarter and thinking how it could apply. But all that kind of goes into the mixture. Obviously, inflation, everything else we're looking at as we run scenarios to give us the confidence to reaffirm '22."

Happy New Year, and thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call.

Happy New Year, and thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our strong second quarter results as well as our perspective on how Conagra is positioned to continue to succeed in both the current environment and beyond. 
So let's get started. I'm very pleased with our strong results for the second quarter. Our business continued to perform well, both in the absolute and relative to peers. Our success to date in fiscal 2021 is not only a testament to our team's ability to adapt to the current environment, but a reflection of the work we've done to transform our business over the past 5-plus years. 
Our ongoing execution of the Conagra Way playbook perpetually reshaping our portfolio and capabilities for better growth and better margins has enabled us to rise to the occasion during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that has positioned the business to excel in the future. 
During the second quarter, we continue to build on our momentum, and our Q2 results exceeded our expectations across the board. We had strong, broad-based sales growth, our margin expansion is ahead of schedule, and I'm proud to announce that we've reached our deleveraging target earlier than originally planned. 
In keeping with our Conagra Way playbook, we continue to optimize the business for long-term value creation during the quarter. We made targeted investments in both production capacity and marketing support to drive the physical and mental availability of our products. We also remain committed to sculpting our portfolio through smart divestments with the agreement shortly after the second quarter closed to sell Peter Pan peanut butter. Peter Pan is a very good business, but it's not an investment priority for Conagra given our other portfolio priorities. 
Finally, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance for all metrics. And none of this would be possible without our exceptional team, particularly our frontline workers. So before we dive into the details of the quarter, I want to recognize everyone responsible for the continued extraordinary work of our supply chain. I'm extremely proud of the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members whose dedication has enabled our industry-leading performance. We remain focused on keeping employees safe while meeting the needs of our communities, customers and consumers. And I'd like to thank everyone at Conagra for making this possible. 
With that, let's get into the business update. As the table on Slide 7 shows, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations across the board. We delivered organic net sales growth of 8.1%, adjusted operating margin of 19.6% and adjusted EPS of $0.81. These results enabled us to reach our fiscal '21 net leverage ratio target of 3.6x ahead of schedule. 
During the second quarter, we continued to drive significant growth across our retail business. Total Conagra retail sales grew 10.4% year-over-year with strong growth across each of our snacks, frozen and staples portfolios. Our results were driven by continued success in expanding our presence with consumers and gaining share. Total Conagra household penetration grew 14 basis points versus a year ago, and our category share increased 26 basis points. 
Critical to our ability to sustain our growing relevancy with consumers is the physical availability of our products, whether through brick-and-mortar or online. And Slide 9 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce have continued to yield results. In the chart on the left, you can see the step change in e-commerce growth for total edible that has occurred since the onset of the pandemic. But what's really impressive about this chart is the sustainability of our e-commerce performance. We've retained a massive portion of the e-commerce sales we gained at the onset of the pandemic, and our results have outpaced total edible e-commerce growth each quarter. As a result of our sustained success, e-commerce continued its recent trend of steadily increasing as a percentage of our total retail sales, as you can see on the right. 
While e-commerce growth, both on an absolute basis and as a percent of overall sales, is not a new dynamic for Conagra. This growth has accelerated during COVID-19. In addition to our continued progress in e-commerce, our new innovation generated strong performance during the second quarter. When we began this journey over 5 years ago, we recognized that we had a lot of latent potential in the portfolio, it just had to be modernized. So we set out to aggressively do just that. And you'll recall that we established a goal of having 15% of our annual retail sales coming from products launched within the preceding 3 years. 
As you can see on Slide 10, our innovation performance has continued to exceed our 15% goal. What's equally important is the consistency of our innovation performance. Investments we've made over the last 5 years in our innovation capabilities enabled us to continue launching new products since the pandemic began. Customers trust our innovation track record and rely on our new products to drive consumer trial and overall category growth.  
Slide 11 drills down on the strength of our recent innovation performance. Compared to last year's first half launches, the products we introduced in the first half of this year have achieved 37% more sales per UPC and 28% more distribution points per UPC during the comparable time period. 
Product performance highlights include: Marie Callender's post the #1 branded new item in frozen indulgent single-serve meals. Duncan Hines has delivered the top 3 highest velocity new items in single-serve baking and our modernized Hungry-Man brand is outpacing category growth by more than 2x. After a strong first half of fiscal '21, we will introduce even more new products that will build distribution in the second half. Expect to hear more about our upcoming product launches at CAGNY next month. 
Turning now to Slide 12. Total Conagra frozen retail sales grew an impressive 8.3% versus a year ago, thanks to strong growth in each of our 4 main frozen categories. Importantly, our terrific frozen vegetables business returned to strong growth in the quarter as we brought on our additional capacity investment online. 
Slide 13 digs a bit deeper into our largest frozen brand, Birds Eye. Birds Eye is a cornerstone of the important frozen vegetables segment, with a #1 position in the category and more than twice the category share of the closest branded competitor. Recall that Birds Eye previously faced some supply constraints as we worked to bring new capacity online. And last quarter, I noted that shipments for the brand were a bit ahead of consumption as retailers started rebuilding their inventories. 
As you can see in the charts on Slide 13, Birds Eye returned to form in Q2 as expected. In addition to strong retail sales growth of 7.2% in the quarter, Birds Eye gained an impressive 261 basis points of share from Q1 to Q2. 
Continuing to Slide 14, you can see how Birds Eye has attracted and retained more new buyers than our competition since the pandemic began. Frozen vegetables category remains highly relevant to consumers, and we believe the steps we've taken over the past several quarters to modernize the Birds Eye brand and expand capacity have positioned us well to build on our category leadership. 
Turning now to another area of strength, our leading portfolio of frozen single-serve meals had another terrific quarter. As you can see on Slide 15, Conagra has outperformed peers, driven category growth and attracted new buyers since the start of the pandemic. As the chart on this slide shows, we have 3 of the top brands in this category from both a trial and repeat perspective. 
Our snacks business also continued to see strong growth in the quarter. As you can see on Slide 16, we delivered double-digit retail sales growth on a year-over-year and 2-year basis in snacking, led by impressive results across popcorn, sweet treats and meat snacks. 
We're not just growing, we're winning versus the competition. Slide 17 shows how we grew share year-over-year in popcorn, meat snacks, hot cocoa and ready-to-eat pudding and gelatin in the quarter. 
Our staples portfolio also delivered solid results in Q2. Historically, this portfolio has served as a -- primarily as a source of cash for us, but it hasn't been looked at as a growth engine, but Slide 18 shows how staples remain highly relevant to consumers in the quarter as people continue to rediscover cooking and the utility, relevance and value of products in our portfolio. 
Our basket of the total staples category grew retail sales by 12.7% in the second quarter. People are returning to their kitchens during the pandemic and new younger consumers are discovering the joy of cooking. Many of the brands on this slide, including PAM, RO*TEL and Hunt's, are cooking utilities and ingredients. As we've discussed before, the current environment has resulted in consumers trying or reengaging with our products and coming back again and again. 
And that takes us to what we see going forward and how our business is uniquely set up to win. Our execution of the Conagra Way playbook over the last 5-plus years enabled us to deliver strong performance prior to the onset of COVID. And we firmly believe that our reshaped portfolio, modernized products and enhanced capabilities have been foundational to our ability to excel during these highly dynamic times. 
We all know that the COVID pandemic has driven an increase in at-home eating overall. But for Conagra, it has also meant an acceleration of the consumer trial adoption and repeat purchase rates of our products. Our result have been strong on both an absolute and relative basis. These dynamics have driven meaningful levels of incremental cash flow for our business, they've also enhanced the ROI of our previous disciplined investments in portfolio capabilities and the physical and mental availability of our products. 
Importantly, the Conagra Way is perpetual. While we've adapted to the current environment and delivered superior results, we also continue to look to the future and make smart investments to further strengthen our business. Our investments include continuing to modernize our products and packaging, increasing production capacity when category dynamics warrant, supporting on-shelf availability and increased e-commerce share and raising consumer awareness. To be clear, these investments are not a reaction to the near-term environment, but decisions rooted in our longer-term outlook for the business and our disciplined execution of the Conagra Way. 
We believe that Conagra is in a strong position to continue to win now and for years to come. We expect that our investments, coupled with consumer adoption and the proven stickiness of our product will result in Conagra continuing to deliver long-term profitable growth. 
In summary, we continue to see solid execution across our portfolio aligned with the Conagra Way playbook in Q2, which enabled us to deliver results that exceeded our expectations. Our business remains strong in the absolute and relative to competition, and we expect Conagra to be in an even better position post-COVID as a result of our ongoing disciplined approach to investment and innovation. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

Today, I'll walk through the details of our second quarter fiscal '21 performance and our Q3 outlook before we move to the Q&A portion of the call. I'll start by calling out a few performance highlights from the",1657,"Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll walk through the details of our second quarter fiscal '21 performance and our Q3 outlook before we move to the Q&A portion of the call. 
I'll start by calling out a few performance highlights from the quarter, which are captured on Slide 22. As Sean mentioned, outstanding execution by our teams across the company enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales, margin, profitability and deleveraging during the second quarter, while we continued to invest in the business. 
Reported and organic net sales for the quarter were up 6.2% and 8.1%, respectively, versus the same period a year ago. We continued our strong margin performance from Q1 as Q2 adjusted gross margin increased 139 basis points to 29.9%. Adjusted operating margin increased 250 basis points to 19.6%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.7% to $712 million in the quarter. And our adjusted diluted EPS grew 28.6% to $0.81 for the second quarter. 
Slide 23 breaks out the drivers of our 6.2% second quarter net sales growth. As you can see, the 8.1% increase in organic net sales was primarily driven by a 6.6% increase in volume related to the growth of at-home food consumption. The favorable impact of price/mix, which was evenly driven by favorable sales mix and less trade merchandising also contributed to our growth. The strong organic net sales growth was partially offset by the impacts of foreign exchange and a 1.7% net decrease associated with divestitures. 
The Peter Pan peanut butter business is still part of Conagra Brands and thus included in our organic results. We expect the sale of Peter Pan to be completed in Q3, at which point it will be removed from organic net sales growth. I will discuss the estimated impact of this divestiture shortly. 
Slide 24 summarizes our net sales by segment for the second quarter. On both a reported and organic basis, we saw continued significant growth in each of our 3 retail segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen and International. The net sales increase was primarily driven by the increase of at-home food consumption as a result of COVID-19, which benefited our retail segments, but negatively impacted our Foodservice segment. 
The Grocery & Snacks segment experienced strong organic net sales growth of 15.3% in the quarter. The segment's organic net sales growth outpaced its growth in consumption as retailers continue to rebuild inventories. Our Refrigerated & Frozen segment delivered organic net sales growth of 7.8%. This growth is a testament to our continued modernization and innovation efforts and illustrates the increasingly important role Refrigerated & Frozen products play in meeting the evolving needs of today's consumers. 
Turning to the International segment. Quarterly organic net sales increased 9.1%. This segment experienced particularly strong growth in both Canada and Mexico. This quarter, our Foodservice segment reported a 21.4% organic net sales decline primarily driven by a volume decrease of 25.3% due to less restaurant traffic as a result of COVID-19. 
Slide 25 outlines the adjusted operating margin bridge for the quarter versus the prior year period. As you can see, in the second quarter, our adjusted operating margin increased 250 basis points to 19.6%. Strong supply chain realized productivity, favorable price mix, cost synergies associated with Pinnacle Foods acquisition and fixed cost leverage combined to drive 440 basis points in adjusted operating margin improvement, more than offsetting the impact of cost of goods sold inflation and COVID-related costs in the quarter. Collectively, these drivers resulted in a 139 basis point increase in our adjusted gross margin versus the same period a year ago. 
A&P increased 4.7% on a dollar basis primarily due to increases in e-commerce marketing. A&P was flat on a percentage of sales basis this quarter versus Q2 a year ago. Finally, our adjusted SG&A rate was favorable by 110 basis points primarily as a result of fixed cost leverage on higher net sales, the Pinnacle cost synergies and temporarily reduced spending as employees work from home and significantly reduced their travel. 
I want to give you some additional perspective on our margin expansion. As I just mentioned, operating margin expanded 250 basis points for the quarter, well ahead of our expectations. Of this 250 basis point expansion in operating margin this quarter, approximately 60 basis points reflects our ongoing progress towards achieving our fiscal '22 margin target of 18% to 19%. We also saw an approximate 180 basis point margin benefit from price/mix in the quarter primarily driven by mix and, to a lesser extent, favorable pricing and lower trade merchandising. We expect to retain some of this benefit going forward, but exactly how much remains uncertain at this point. An additional 10 basis points of net margin expansion came from favorable fixed cost leverage across the entire P&L and COVID-related SG&A benefits, mostly offset by COVID-related cost of goods sold. We do not expect this net benefit to repeat next year. 
Slide 26 summarizes our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment for the second quarter. Our 3 retail segments, all operating profits increased by double-digit percentages versus the same period a year ago. Each retail segment benefited from higher organic net sales and strong supply chain realized productivity. 
In the Foodservice segment, however, operating profit decreased due to the COVID-related impacts of lower organic net sales and higher input costs that more than offset the impacts of favorable supply chain realized productivity and cost synergies. Overall, we're pleased with the continuation of the strong Q1 margin results into the second quarter, which are anchored by core productivity and benefits from the Pinnacle acquisition we expected to see. 
Turning to Slide 27. We've outlined the drivers of our second quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth versus the same period a year ago. EPS increased 28.6% to $0.81. The growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion and also benefited from a decrease in net interest expense as we've continued to reduce debt as prioritized. 
Slide 28 highlights our significant progress on the overall synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal '19. We captured an incremental $27 million in savings during the most recent quarter, bringing total cumulative synergies to $246 million. As a reminder, the majority of total synergies to date have been in SG&A. 
Cost of goods sold synergies have started to be a bigger portion of our synergy captured the last 2 quarters, and we expect them to make up a majority of our synergies going forward. We remain pleased with the team's progress in capturing synergies and remain on track to achieve our fiscal '22 synergy targets. 
Slide 29 shows the strong progress we've made to date to achieve our deleveraging targets. Since the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal '19 through the end of the second quarter of fiscal '21, we have reduced total gross debt by $2.3 billion, resulting in net debt of $9.2 billion. 
We are pleased to report that at the end of the second quarter, we achieved our net leverage ratio target of 3.6x, down from 5x at the closing of the Pinnacle acquisition, and 3.7x at the end of the first quarter of fiscal '21. Strong consistent improvements in debt reduction, coupled with robust earnings enabled us to achieve this net leverage ratio target ahead of schedule. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to be focused on executing a balanced capital allocation policy. We remain committed to solid investment-grade credit ratings as we continue to be opportunistic using our balance sheet to drive shareholder value, such as our increased investment in CapEx and the recent 29% dividend increase. 
Slide 30 summarizes our outlook. As Sean and I have both said throughout this presentation, we believe in the strength of Conagra's future. While we're confident in the quarters ahead and that Conagra will continue to excel beyond the COVID-19 environment, the sustained impact of COVID-19 remains dynamic and continues to make near-term forecasting with specificity a challenge. We expect the continuation of elevated retail demand and reduced foodservice demand compared to historic pre-COVID-19 demand levels. We are currently seeing both of these trends continue in the third quarter to date. 
For the third quarter, we expect organic net sales growth to be in the range of plus 6% to 8%. We expect Q3 operating margin to be in the range of 16% to 16.5%, implying a year-over-year increase of 30 to 80 basis points. This estimate includes an expected acceleration of our A&P investment in e-commerce marketing that we started in Q2, reducing the estimated year-over-year Q3 operating margin expansion. As a reminder, Q3 operating margins are historically lower than Q2 operating margins given the leverage impact on the seasonality of sales. Given these sales and margin factors, along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver third quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $0.56 to $0.60. 
Our third quarter guidance also continues to assume that the end-to-end supply chain operates effectively during this period of heightened demand. As outlined in our earnings release, our third quarter guidance does not yet include any impacts from the pending sale of the Peter Pan business. We are selling the business for approximately $102 million, and the expected annualized impact of the divestiture is a reduction of approximately $110 million of net sales and $0.03 of adjusted EPS. 
Lastly, we are reaffirming all metrics of our fiscal '22 guidance, which also excludes the impact of the pending sale of Peter Pan. We look forward to presenting again next month at CAGNY, where we will provide another update on our progress in executing the Conagra Way. We hope you'll join us. Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks this morning. 
I'll now pass it to the operator to open it up for questions."

And with fiscal '22, really, at this point, rapidly approaching as well as all the uncertainty around operating in the current environment, I guess, Sean, can you -- I mean what can you offer to sort of assure investors that Conagra can, not only reach its fiscal '22 targets, but I guess, more importantly, do it in a way that enables the company to deliver sustainable growth thereafter? As that's a question that I know I've been getting quite a bit these days. 
And as part of that, I saw A&P was up in the quarter, and you mentioned that we should expect that to continue into the fiscal third quarter, is that a pattern of -- is that pattern of some reinvestment one that we should expect more of moving forward?

So good questions. Let me try to unpack each piece of that. Yes, of course, we can provide that assurance.

Let me try to unpack each piece of that. Yes, of course, we can provide that assurance. We believe that what we are experiencing right now is the acceleration of product trial that in normal times would take years and hundreds of millions of dollars. Now as for what's going to sustain it through 2022 and beyond, in a nutshell, it is our people and our playbook. Now I spoke about our people in my prepared remarks, but let me remind investors about our playbook, particularly with respect to brand building. 
We have spent years curating and optimizing our approach to brand building, and we believe it is one of the most progressive and effective approaches in our space. The goal, obviously, in brand building is to create a powerful connection between our consumers and our brands. And in the simplest sense, in our eyes, to do that, you have to meet people where they are with modernized products and packages. And then you communicate information that is relevant and meaningful to them. And this is really the heart of our approach. 
So first, we meet people where they are. And you can ask yourself, ""Well, where are they these days?"" Well, these days, it's often, a, on their devices, seeking entertainment or information; or b, shopping in bricks and mortar or online. But it's also important to understand where they're not. And increasingly, we are seeing that they are not tethered to a television that is broadcasting mass market advertising. You know when I was 5 years old, that was the place you would find a consumer and you could communicate the information you had to share. But obviously, if that were our approach today and we're so monolithic, we wouldn't be finding a lot of consumers, especially not a lot of young consumers who we are very, very focused on because there are significant sustainable demographic tailwinds there that I've spoken about before. So instead, we reach our consumers in a diversity of locales from online to in-store, to on TV, to on radio and more. 
And then with respect to communicating the information that's relevant and meaningful to them, it starts, as you’ve heard me talk many times with, a very modernized product and package design and then a succinct provocative message around the appealing product benefit. That's our playbook. It works, and it will continue to work, and it's why our growth rates, our innovation performance, our trial, our repeat, our depth of repeat metrics are often outpacing our competitors. So in the simplest sense, what we are asserting here is that modern high-quality products with great online and in-store presence supported by provocative and targeted messaging will beat outdated lower-quality products with weak online or in-store presence, but lots of broadcast media every single time. 
And then lastly, the last part of your question, our total brand investment already is, it has been at a strong level, and it remains strong. But yes, it is variable. And in any given quarter, we can flex it based on the circumstance of the quarter. So recall when supply was constrained, we dialed back. When supply is ample and we see good ROI opportunities, we can flex it up. And by the way, we can flex it above or below the line, as you've seen. But overall, I would say the level is in a good place, and I think the strong results that you're seeing, not just in the absolute, but relative to competition shows that."

Can you walk us through again how the operating margin goes from where it landed in fiscal Q2 to your forecast for Q3? As you mentioned, it represents a pretty substantial sequential step-down, and is that purely just the marketing aspect? Or are there other factors we need to take into account there? And maybe it's commodity or commodities, which have spiked a bit and things of that nature."

First, as I mentioned in my remarks, the normal cadence of operating margin from the second quarter to the third quarter always shows a step down as we exit the holiday season and lose some of the operating leverage from the lower overall sales dollars. 
Second, when you look at Q3 operating margin a year ago, there were some benefits from reduced incentive comp accrual and SG&A a year ago in Q3. Third, inflation for the third quarter is now estimated to be around 3.5%, whereas in Q2, it was around 2.8%, 2.9%. 
And then lastly, as we just discussed, we are accelerating our A&P investment in the third quarter to support increased e-commerce marketing that we started in Q2. So we expect double-digit increase in A&P in the third quarter versus a year ago. So they're really the factors. And with that though, we still, with our guidance, we're implying a 30 to 80 basis point improvement in operating margin in the third quarter."

We were a global conglomerate. We were struggling in the world of private label. We were trying to be a lot of things to a lot of people. 
Today, we are a focused pure-play, largely North American company. And we play in 3 spaces: frozen, we play in snacks, and it's a very unique snack business with a lot of neglected coves as we call it. And we play in staples, and that's pretty much the portfolio. And over the last 5 years, the heavy lift was in the early days where we had to tackle value over volume, and that was painful but necessary to go through to purge out low-quality volume and establish a new foundation. But it put us in a position to then layer on outstanding innovation on a much stronger base. 
And we started, as you know, with frozen, and we have what we believe is the leading frozen portfolio in North America that has been growing incredibly robustly. It is a centerpiece of our investment and our innovation effort, and that will continue because we are in the early innings of frozen's success. 
And as I pointed out in CAGNY last year, when you look at the demographic tailwinds we have from millennials as they form households, and they -- we know they're already big users of frozen, but then when they form households, have their first child and then additional children, the per capita consumption of those household goes up and up and up again, so that's frozen. 
Our snacks business, we really rebased that a couple of years ago, and we said we're going to stand as a snack company. We run it like a snack company. And the performance there has just been outstanding. It's been both organic and it's been through M&A. And we think that playbook will continue. It's a high-growth, high-margin business, and we've got extremely strong relative market shares in that space. So that will also continue, and that remains the other, probably our second priority in terms of investment. And again, these investments come below the line and above the line. It's all about the combination of physical and available -- mental availability, meeting people where they are, as I just pointed out. 
But the third piece is one of the more interesting pieces during and post pandemic, which is our staples portfolio, about 1/3 of our retail business in staples, which historically was a cash managed for cash type of business. But these products here are not -- there are a lot of products that are not fundamentally different from what you might see at some of our peer companies like a McCormick, where spices are utilities in the cooking process, no differently than a can of RO*TEL or PAM cooking spray is a utility in the cooking process. 
And to some degree, those products go as cooking goes. And what's happening right now is cooking is in a very, very good place, not just because of the older generations who've always been more established in terms of cooking behavior, but the fact that these younger households have learned to kind of be comfortable in their own home, have explored their culinary and built their culinary skills out and are absolutely enamored with recipes and cooking right now. 
So a lot of our staple products, be it products like Hunt's tomato, RO*TEL, our salsa business, our dressing businesses. These are businesses that are playing a meaningful role during the pandemic, and we believe because of some of these demographic tailwinds will continue at an elevated level post-pandemic. 
So very strong up forward-looking performance in frozen and snacks and more optimism in terms of the growth potential out of staples than probably pre-pandemic is how I would put it. Dave, do you want to add anything to that?"

One of the things I shared last quarter that I might point into our investors' attention back to was a slide that showed that after the previous recession in 2008, we saw a permanently elevated level of at-home eating occasions. And what was more interesting about the first 6 months of this pandemic is the level of elevation we saw this year or this past year was twice what we saw in 2008. And that was just a -- this is in a very short period of time. So there is previous evidence of stickiness post the adversity.

We've seen some increases in the last month or 2 in some of the agricultural commodities and certainly freight energy, just the overall even economists' macro views seem to be pointing towards more inflation. So I guess 2 questions related to that. One, how are we hedged? Or how should we be thinking about inflation and managing it as we move into fiscal '22? And maybe what's contemplated in the '22 targets that you reaffirmed this morning? 
And then Sean, I guess, second to that is just given how the retail environment's changed a bit, is there anything different in terms of the way that you might approach inflation and pricing with retailers today than maybe would have been the case pre-COVID?"

So that's really part of our ongoing kind of process. So at this point, obviously, we're looking at fiscal '21, but we'll even have positions that go into fiscal '22. So that's all part of our internal process that we always have. 
The key part of this, and then I'll pass it to Sean and we've talked about this at Investor Day that we manage margins to offset inflation in a lot of different areas. And so we look at, obviously, we have our productivity programs and supply chain. We have our margin-accretive innovation, our pricing, trade optimization, our mix. And then the way we can sculpt margin through M&A. And so we're obviously looking at all those levers. And then more recently, obviously, with Pinnacle and the synergies that we're getting out of that, that's helping drive margin plus the fixed overhead absorption we're getting from the higher volumes from COVID. So that all comes into play as we think about margin from a macro level. Sean, anything to..."

Post-COVID is brand mix, specifically the staples business, which is stronger today and these cooking utilities that we expected may remain a bit stronger because of these millennials cooking at home. Those tend to be extremely relatively strong margins for us. So that is -- that's good brand mix for us. And that's just -- that's fortunate that, that piece of the portfolio and these younger consumers engaging in cooking habits and really liking our #1 brands in that space, that's a positive overall in terms of integrated margin management."

Obviously, we've been very active in the last 5 years with inbound stuff and outbound stuff. And when we do that, both ways, it is -- we do consider not -- we consider it as we're reshaping the portfolio for better growth and better margins. And so items that come in and brands that come in, not only need to be strategic, but ideally will help us in terms of our forward-looking growth rates and margins. Similarly, items that we divest sometimes can be things that have been a chronic drag on growth rates or margins. So by effectively managing kind of both the inbounds and the outbounds, remainco, so to speak, the remaining company going forward should look better. That's the ideal situation in terms of growth prospects and margin. 
And we've got -- obviously, we've been active doing that. We'll continue to be active. We just announced the divestiture of Peter Pan. We've got this capital loss carryforward that we're well aware of, we talk about every day. And our principle there is pretty simple, which is if something is not a fit for us and somebody else wants to make an offer for an asset that is above what we see as the intrinsic value, then we're all ears on that kind of thing. 
Similarly, on inbound stuff, we're just now getting to the point where we're feeling -- our focus has been about delevering. Let's not -- let's be very clear on that. Ever since the Pinnacle acquisition, we've been 100% focused on delevering. We're now ahead of that cadence. So we can start to see our way toward other uses of capital going forward, what they could be share buybacks, they could be bolt-on acquisitions. They just have to make sense. Or could be investing in our business, as Ken pointed out in our own CapEx. So that's -- all of that's fair game. Dave, do you want to add anything to that?"

Obviously, as you said, we could see, right, the margin targets coming in ahead of plan, leverage target is coming in ahead of plan. But then we're also all kind of talking about the inflationary effects potentially this year. 
And then it sounds like you think you can hold some of the pricing benefits you've already received. But then we have to combine that with some or, let's say, less fixed cost leverage as we think about next year. So it seems like kind of what's implied in all of it is our targets aren't changing, but the targets that we have are still slightly below where we've come in the first half of this year. So it sounds like just kind of where you sit now, your visibility, all things considered, you just pointed to this, Dave, in terms of your -- kind of your sensitivity analysis, right? As you look forward next year, all things netted out, you say, yes, we might have to give some of this back, we might have to give some of that back. But kind of net-net, relative to where we were last year, we feel just as good or maybe stronger about hitting those margin targets while at the same time as we continue to see kind of sales revised upwards. 
So kind of net-net, what I'm asking is like why wouldn’t -- not just the margin piece, why wouldn’t kind of the operating profit dollars in fiscal '22 be higher than you even thought they would have been 1.5 years ago? Lot in there, but..."

So let me take a shot at that, Rob. So obviously, starting at the top of fiscal '22, how we come out post-COVID and what the stickiness is obviously impacts the top line and that drives that -- the sales dollars and then the gross profit, operating profit dollars, right? So -- but if you kind of step back and you look at this quarter, and let me just take this Q2 and dissect it a little bit differently, so you get an understanding of kind of what's happening in margin. If you look at -- we improved operating margin 250 basis points this quarter, and there's 3 buckets, okay? 
The first bucket is improvement that we got that's not going to stay with us. And that's 10 basis points of the 250. And what is that? That's all this COVID stuff. It's the COVID costs that are a bad guy. It's the lower SG&A from COVID because we're not traveling, which is a good guy. It's favorable absorption across the P&L, which is a good guy. You net all that stuff together, that's 10 basis points of benefit we got this quarter that's not going to recur. 
The second bucket is what is going to recur, and that's our core productivity. That is our realized productivity from supply chain. That's our Pinnacle synergies and then that's inflation and business investments. For the quarter, the net benefit of that was 60 basis points and those programs will continue to go. 
The third bucket is where we are still evaluating it in terms of the ongoing benefit is price/mix. We had 180 basis points of price/mix benefit in Q2. Now the majority of that was mix and a lot of that's from volume. So there is a part of that, that will not recur. But there's also a benefit from less merchandising and pricing in there. And some of that will recur, but we're not quantifying what amount of the 180 will recur. So I say it that way because it's hard to look at some of these numbers sometimes and really understand what's ongoing versus what's not. So hopefully, that's a little helpful kind of looking at this quarter and thinking how it could apply. But all that kind of goes into the mixture. Obviously, inflation, everything else we're looking at as we run scenarios to give us the confidence to reaffirm '22."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our strong third quarter results, our perspective on how Conagra is succeeding in the current environment and how we are well positioned to drive future growth from behavioral tailwinds. So let's get started. 
Our business continued to perform well, both in the absolute and relative to competition during the third quarter. Our ability to deliver for stakeholders during this pandemic is not only a testament to our team's ability to adapt to the current environment, but a reflection of the work we've done to transform our business over the past 5-plus years. Our ongoing execution of the Conagra Way playbook, perpetually reshaping our portfolio and capabilities for better growth and better margins, has enabled us to rise to the occasion during the COVID-19 pandemic and has positioned the business to excel in the future. During the third quarter, we continued to build on our momentum and invested across the company to further strengthen the business. This included ongoing investments in physical availability to ensure our products are accessible, online and in stores, and mental availability to ensure we're making the right connections with our consumers. 
As I've said previously, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented an incredible consumer trialing opportunity. Our innovation and marketing approach has enabled us to secure not only strong trial but also strong repeat rates and market share gains. Based on the evidence we are seeing, which I will summarize today, we expect to emerge from the pandemic with structurally higher volumes and share driven by the stickiness of the COVID-driven demand. But to be clear, we are not relying on these benefits to achieve our fiscal 2022 organic net sales guidance. 
Given our confidence in the longer-term value creation opportunities of our business, we opportunistically repurchased approximately $300 million of shares in the quarter. We remain committed to a balanced approach to capital allocation, which includes investing in our business, maintaining solid investment-grade credit ratings, executing smart M&A, and returning capital to shareholders via share repurchases and paying an attractive dividend. Our decision to repurchase shares demonstrates our willingness to capitalize on occasions when we believe we're undervalued. 
As we navigate the current environment, we're seeing input cost inflation accelerate in many of our categories and across the industry. Dave will detail multiple levers we have to manage this inflation.  And finally, we are again reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance. 
I'll unpack these items a bit further in a moment, but I want to start by acknowledging our frontline team. Our supply chain is a vital component of our success, and I want to commend our team once again for their extraordinary execution amid the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm extremely proud of the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members whose dedication has enabled our industry-leading performance. We remain focused on keeping employees safe while meeting the needs of our communities, customers and consumers; and I'd like to thank everyone at Conagra for making this possible.
Let's get into the business update. As the table on Slide 8 shows our organic net sales growth of 9.7% exceeded our expectations in the quarter, despite the winter storm in February causing a small temporary disruption in the supply chain. We also delivered adjusted operating margin of 16% and adjusted EPS of $0.59, both in line with our quarterly guidance. This strong performance was driven by our continued execution of the Conagra Way playbook. The foundation of everything we do is building superior products with modern attributes, great taste and contemporary packaging. Our third quarter results demonstrate the continued strong performance of our new innovation, which is being accepted by customers and sought after by consumers. 
Once we have the product right, we need to make sure that consumers and customers have access to it across all channels. As we will detail today, this is exemplified by our investments in transportation to ensure physical availability amid elevated demand. 
And finally, we support the mental availability of our products to ensure we connect with consumers in the right place, at the right time and with the right messages. In the third quarter, we supported our brands with continued investments in e-commerce and digital marketing. 
Our playbook is not just a slogan. It's the framework we use to run the business, and it continues to deliver great results. 
During the third quarter, we grew retail sales 13.8%, with each of our domains, frozen, staples and snacks, outpacing the industry. As a result, we grew share in each of our domains. Our strong broad-based growth and share gains were fueled by both our superior penetration and repeat purchase rates in the quarter. Slide 11 shows that our household penetration rate during the third quarter was on average double that of our top 15 peers, and we outpaced those same peers in terms of repeat purchase rate. 
As I mentioned a minute ago, the Conagra Way playbook starts with building superior products. When we began this journey over 5 years ago, we recognized that we had a lot of latent potential in the portfolio but it had to be modernized, so we set out to aggressively do just that. And you'll recall that we established a goal of having 15% of our annual retail sales come from products launched within the preceding 3 years. 
As you can see on Slide 12, we our innovation performance has consistently exceeded our 15% goal over the last 2 fiscal years and through the last 52 weeks, and our fiscal '21 innovation is performing even better than prior year innovation. Compared to last year's launches, the products we introduced through the third quarter this fiscal '21 have achieved 66% more sales per UPC and 53% more distribution points per UPC than during the comparable time period last year. And as you can see on Slide 13, many of our new innovations are leading their categories.
Looking ahead, we're starting to see strong customer acceptance our fiscal '22 innovation. Customers trust our innovation track record and rely on our new products to drive consumer trial and overall category growth. Slide 14 shows just a few of our exciting innovations that will begin shipping in fiscal 2022. 
Critical to our ability to sustain our growing relevancy with consumers is the physical availability of our products, whether through brick-and-mortar or online, and Slide 15 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce have continued to yield results. Conagra has outpaced total edible retail sales and e-commerce growth each quarter throughout the pandemic, and we have grown share in e-commerce across 76% of our brands over the past year. As we've discussed before, we believe that e-commerce investment is a high-ROI opportunity to deliver our message to consumers. 
Slide 16 details some of the specific benefits to expanding our e-commerce platform. E-commerce shoppers over-index to younger millennial consumers. When consumers start to shop online, they're likely to continue the behavior and become heavy users of a brand, and online shoppers in general have higher brand loyalty than those shopping in store. All of this demonstrates the opportunity for superior lifetime value that's being generated by our e-commerce investment and growth.
Now let's turn briefly to each of our retail domains and start with frozen on Slide 17. Total Conagra frozen retail sales grew an impressive 12% on both a 1- and 2-year basis in the quarter, which is an acceleration from the second quarter. And Slide 18 demonstrates our growth in frozen accelerated on a sequential basis across many of our leading brands and categories. 
Our snacks business also continued to deliver strong growth throughout the quarter -- third quarter. As you can see on Slide 19, we generated double-digit retail sales growth on a year-over-year and 2-year basis in snacking, led by impressive increases in cross popcorn, sweet treats and meat snacks. And as consumers continued snacking at elevated rates, we capitalized with strong Q3 velocity growth across our leading brands. 
Our staples portfolio also delivered solid results in Q3, including 15% retail sales growth, led by double-digit quarterly growth across key staples categories. And as Slide 22 shows the broad-based growth we delivered in the third quarter exceeded the already strong growth we delivered in the second quarter. People are returning to their kitchens during the pandemic, and new younger consumers are discovering the joy of cooking. As we've discussed before, the current environment has resulted in consumers trying or reengaging with our staples products and coming back again and again. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our end market performance across the portfolio this quarter. And it's even more impressive, given the fact that we delivered these results despite continued supply constraints resulting from sustained elevated demand outpacing our ability to supply. 
And that takes us to what we see looking ahead. As we try to understand where consumer trends are going, it's always helpful to look back at lessons from recent history. During the '08/'09 recession, we saw consumers shift from primarily consuming meals sourced away from home to meal sourced in home. While this shift is not surprising during the heart of a recession, it's important to recognize that the change in behavior, although event-driven, lasted well past the recovery. And we believe that a good portion of that change in behavior was driven by the formation of new habits. 
Psychology experts assert that it takes on average 66 days for a new behavior to become habitual. As you all know, we are nearly 400 days into the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumers have adapted to at-home eating and formed new habits that we expect to sustain well beyond the current conditions. 
And early data supports our hypothesis. If you take a sampling of data from states that have been the most open based on the mobility of their residents throughout the pandemic, what you'll find is the 2-year growth rates in retail sales are materially higher than pre-pandemic and fairly consistent as states reopen and stay open. So while people are starting to leave their homes more frequently, they are still choosing to eat at home. Consumers are largely maintaining the habits they've acquired over the past 400 days, just like psychology predicts. 
And while we're poised to benefit from sustained elevated at home eating, we are not resting on our laurels or taking our consumers for granted. We're continuing to invest behind our brands to create connections with consumers. Slide 27 shows just one fun example of our innovative approach to brand building. We listen to our communities and identify the trends that resonate with them. 
As an example, the Slim Jim community online was built on memes. Given that fact doge and Dogecoin were a natural fit for our brand. Since joining the online conversation about the Do Good Everyday sentiment of Dogecoin, we've tapped into another channel for Slim Jim to engage with its community. We've seen a market uptick in audience interaction, including direct engagement and advocacy from the person that created Dogecoin, as you can see on this slide. Not only is this community hungry for our product and new innovation, but they've also been quick to rally behind the brand, playing a large part in Slim Jim being crowned the champion of Adweek's March Adness bracket of the top 64 brands. On its way to the title, Slim Jim defeated Doritos, Pepsi, Amazon, Wendy's, M&M and OREO in head-to-head matchups. We're excited about this, and you should be on the lookout for additional crypto-themed activations in the future. 
And Slim Jim is just one example of how we're connecting with the consumer. Since the onset of COVID-19 last March, we've gained the equivalent of more than 4 years' worth of incremental new buyers. COVID has effectively supercharged new trial at a level rarely seen in our industry. 
Importantly, we're winning with younger consumers. Nearly half of our new buyers are millennials and Gen Z. The steady trends shown on Slide 29 demonstrate that these new buyers are even more likely to repeat purchases across many of our key brands. They are discovering our modernized portfolio and developing new habits that include our products. And as you can see on Slide 30, we're outpacing our peers in terms of repeat rate as consumers are flocking to our brand more than to those of our top competitors across all of our domains. 
And we continue to believe that we are very well positioned to capture the benefits of consumer behavior post-pandemic. Let's start with frozen. The adoption of remote work provides a structural increase in the demand for frozen food compared to pre-COVID levels. Importantly, some aspects of the remote workforce adoption are expected to be permanent. And this shift to remote work has the biggest impact on lunch and dinner occasions, the meals with the largest exposure to frozen foods. 
Our portfolio of brands and products uniquely meet these consumers' needs. Our frozen portfolio over-indexes in these occasions by offering hyper-convenient meals and sides perfect for a quick lunch or family dinner. 
In addition to enjoying more food cooked together at home and including frozen as a key part of those meals, consumers are making what we believe is a significant and lasting shift to at home entertainment. People increased their time spent watching digital video by over 40% in 2020. Recent studies and our understanding of habit formation tell us that this shift towards at-home entertainment is likely to continue post pandemic. When consumers, particularly the younger generations, move their entertainment to the home, they increase the number of at-home snacking occasions. And during those occasions, consumers are choosing our brands time and time again. 
And as I've already touched on, younger groups are engaging more and more with our staples segment as they learn how to cook at home. As the chart on the left demonstrates, young adults are increasingly moving from urban areas to smaller cities and suburbs, where there are fewer options for eating away from home. And as the chart on the right demonstrates, these young consumers, Gen Z and millennials, are increasingly engaging with Conagra's staples portfolio as they discover their kitchens. 
Today, we are reaffirming our fiscal '22 guidance. As I said earlier, we're not incorporating expectations about the stickiness of COVID-driven demand in our reaffirmation of the organic net sales guidance. However, as we have detailed today, we are increasingly confident that we will benefit from the stickiness of the pandemic driven demand. And as Dave will discuss, while the current inflationary environment provides us more of a challenge on margin than we were originally expecting, we will be pulling on all of our margin levers to manage through the current environment and remain focused on delivering our profitability targets. 
So to summarize, we continued to deliver solid execution during the third quarter, and our business remains strong in the absolute and relative to peers. While inflation is accelerating, we have multiple levers to manage inflation and drive margin improvement. And we're continuing our execution of the Conagra Way playbook, which includes investments to capitalize on significant behavioral tailwinds. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

I'll start my remarks by calling out a few third quarter performance highlights, which are captured on Slide 37. As we have detailed this morning, the business continued to perform very well throughout the third",1666,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my remarks by calling out a few third quarter performance highlights, which are captured on Slide 37. 
As we have detailed this morning, the business continued to perform very well throughout the third quarter. Strong execution from the supply chain and outstanding performance by our teams across the company enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales during the third quarter, while meeting margin and earnings targets as we continued to strategically invest in the business while managing inflation. 
Overall, reported and organic net sales for the quarter increased 8.5% and 9.7% respectively compared to the same period a year ago. Adjusted gross margin increased 12 basis points to 27.5%, and adjusted operating margin increased 31 basis points to 16% in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.9% to $566 million in the quarter, while adjusted diluted EPS grew to $0.59, up 25.5%. 
Slide 38 illustrates the drivers of our 8.5% net sales growth versus the same period a year ago. The 9.7% increase in organic net sales was driven by a 6.1% increase in volume connected to the continued increase in at-home food consumption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A favorable price/mix impact contributed a 3.6% increase to organic sales growth. As Sean mentioned, our organic sales growth was impacted a bit from the February winter storms that impacted our ability to deliver product for a short time during the quarter. Our strong organic net sales growth was partially offset by the impact of a 1.2% decrease associated with the divestitures of the Lender's, H.K. Anderson and Peter Pan businesses as well as the exit of the private label peanut butter business. As a reminder, we completed the divestiture of our Peter Pan business on January 25, which was approximately 2 months into our fiscal third quarter.
Turning to Slide 39, you will find a summary of our net sales by segment. In the third quarter, we saw continued growth in each of our 3 retail segments on both a reported and organic basis as the continuation of elevated demand for at-home food consumption benefited these segments. Our foodservice segment was negatively impacted by reduced demand away from home. Importantly, innovation momentum in our retail segments continued throughout the quarter. 
Slide 40 outlines the adjusted operating margin bridge for the third quarter versus the prior year. As you can see, our adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points to 16%, in line with our guidance range for the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin increased by 12 basis points in the quarter versus the same period a year ago as our margin levers of mix, cost management, fixed cost leverage and pricing more than offset the combination of inflation and COVID-related costs. 
Included in the 180 basis points of COVID-related costs is 60 basis points of additional transportation investments that we made during the quarter. I'll discuss those in more detail in a moment. 
A&P increased 11.8% in the quarter, primarily driven by higher e-commerce marketing investments, particularly for the refrigerated and frozen segment. And finally, our adjusted SG&A rate was favorable to our operating margin by 30 basis points versus a year ago as net sales grew at a faster pace than SG&A. 
I'd now like to touch on certain transportation investments we made in the quarter. These are incremental transportation costs incurred on top of the core transportation inflation we experienced, so we've included these in our COVID-19-related costs in the margin bridge. These investments had a negative impact on our margins, but they helped us deliver more profit dollars. 
As you can see by Q3 organic net sales exceeding guidance, demand was higher than we expected during the quarter. To adequately service this demand, we made the decision to invest approximately $15 million in the quarter. This meant aggressively seeking out every available truck and adjusting how we ship to customers. To best service demand for certain brands, we had to bypass our normal distribution network and ship directly to customers. 
While we incurred additional costs to implement these actions, which impacted our operating margin, this enabled us to minimize out of stocks, maximize on-shelf availability and maximize profit dollars. COVID has provided a period of significant elevated consumer trial of our brands, and our innovation has outperformed expectations, allowing us to gain share with existing and new consumers. Investing to keep product on shelves to support this momentum and to support our retail customers while they manage tighter inventory levels was an easy business decision for us. While we expect demand to remain elevated for the foreseeable future, we believe we will be in a position to start rebuilding inventory over the next 2 quarters, which we believe will start removing the need for these incremental investments. 
I want to take a moment to comment on the input cost inflation we're seeing in the market and provide an overview of what we're doing to navigate it. As you can see on Slide 42, inflation increased 3.9% in the third quarter. This was higher than our 3.5% estimate and reflects the broad-based impact on the cost of materials, manufacturing and transportation and logistics. We expect the rate of inflation to continue to accelerate over the next few quarters. Fortunately, we have a variety of levers that can be used to offset this pressure, including pricing. We have already mobilized our inflation-justified pricing plans with some actions already in market, others communicated to customers, and some yet to come. History shows us that price adjustments are more likely to be accepted in the market when industry-wide and broad-based input cost inflation occurs, and that's the environment we see today. 
We will also leverage our capabilities beyond just pricing to offset margin pressure, including overall mix management, cost savings measures such as our ongoing supply chain realized productivity programs, and the optimization of our fixed cost leverage. In short, we will continue to closely evaluate the impact of inflation on our business and are confident in our ability to utilize our entire tool kit to manage through this environment.
Turning to Slide 43. You can see an outline of our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment for the quarter. We are very happy with the continued profit growth in our retail business in the quarter, which more than offsets the decline in foodservice. 
Slide 44 summarizes the drivers of our third quarter adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. In the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS of $0.59 increased by 25.5% compared to the same period a year ago. The growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion as well as reduced interest expense driven by lower debt. 
Slide 45 summarizes Conagra's net debt and cash flow information. We ended the third quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at our longer-term target of 3.5x, which is down from 4.8x a year ago. With our balance sheet in a stronger position and given our strong operating cash flow, we have increased our investments in the business. Our year-to-date CapEx increased over $130 million compared to last year to fund important capacity and productivity projects. 
The combination of the improved balance sheet and strong free cash flow generation has enabled us to return additional capital to shareholders via our recently increased dividend as well as by executing our first share repurchases since the close of the Pinnacle acquisition. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased 8.8 million shares for $298 million, demonstrating our willingness to capitalize on occasions when we believe we are undervalued. 
Looking forward, we will continue to be focused on executing a balanced capital allocation policy focused on driving sustainable value creation. We remain committed to maintaining solid investment-grade credit ratings as we use the strength of our cash flow and balance sheet to opportunistically play offense as compelling investment opportunities arise in the future. 
Slide 46 summarizes our current outlook. As we've said throughout our comments today, Conagra's business is performing well. And we remain optimistic regarding our ability to generate continued strong performance in the quarters ahead. For the fourth quarter, we expect organic net sales to decline approximately 10% to 12% as we lap the 21.5% growth in Q4 a year ago. Our Q4 guidance represents a strong 2-year growth rate of approximately 7% to 9.5%. As a reminder, reported net sales will also be impacted by last year's 53rd week. 
We expect fourth quarter operating margin to be in the range of 14% to 15%. And this estimate includes the combination of continued transportation investments to support product availability at similar levels to Q3, the lag in timing between our pricing actions, and the expected acceleration of inflation as well as a continuation of the A&P investment increase that started in Q2. As a reminder, our fiscal fourth quarter is historically our lowest operating margin quarter given seasonality and as just mentioned, does not include a 53rd week. 
Given these sales and margin factors, we expect to deliver fourth quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $0.49 to $0.55. Our fourth quarter guidance also continues to assume that the end-to-end supply chain operates effectively during this period of heightened demand. 
And finally, we are reaffirming all of our fiscal '22 guidance metrics. As Sean mentioned, the benefits of the stickiness of COVID-related demand are not required to reach our fiscal '22 organic net sales guidance. While the current inflationary environment provides us more of a challenge on margin than we were originally expecting, we remain focused on utilizing our entire tool kit to deliver our profitability targets, which we are reaffirming today. When we report Q4 results in early July, we plan to provide more detail on our fiscal '22 expectations. 
That concludes my remarks this morning. Thanks for listening. I'll now pass it to the operator to open it up for questions."

So in other words, Conagra can hit its fiscal '22 goals, but do so in a way that is somehow deemed less sustainable or lower quality. 
And I guess in light of rising inflation seen in today's results on margins and sort of the margin commentary for next quarter, I'd expect these concerns to only grow from here. So I guess I'd love your take on this and maybe to address this sort of very specific investor concern, if you could."

Well, the short answer is that, that concern is totally unwarranted, but let's catch you up for a second, just look at the big picture here. 
Over the past 6 years, we have totally transformed our company and our culture, and the magnitude of the portfolio modernization we've delivered is arguably best in class. And that incredible work by our Conagra team put us in a position to capitalize on the unique and unprecedented trialing opportunity that COVID presented. We knew that our modernized products would perform and that our repeat purchases would be excellent. 
So what did we do? We invested during the pandemic to maximize trial and try to capture the lifetime value of these new, mostly younger consumers. Look no further than our aggressive stance on transportation solutions and e-commerce in Q3. 
So if you flash forward to fiscal '22, our conviction around getting our products, our modernized products into consumers' mouths won't change. We play the long game, and we do not burn the furniture to create better margin percent optics short term. This is my -- I think it's my ninth year as a public company CEO, and I've never taken that route, so I don't think that concern is warranted."

You obviously maintained that range today, but the 3Q margin came in lighter than you expected. 4Q's will as well. And then you have acceleration of inflation into next year. 
So despite your reiteration and even though pricing and savings are going to accelerate, there's an argument to me that your current numbers are saying these tailwinds won't be quite enough to offset costs. So I guess my question is this: just how confident are you in that 18% to 19% range?

Here's how I think about this whole inflation/levers/pricing kind of concept. 
Principally, when we're experiencing inflation as we are currently, we will be very aggressive to offset it using multiple levers like our cost programs, which you cited; our pricing, trade and mix. Now with regard to inflation-justified pricing, it's really there not a question of if we will move, it's a question of how closely the pricing action's impact on the P&L lines up with inflation's impact on the P&L. And here not all businesses are equal. The lag is typically shorter, as you know, in foodservice and in those retail categories with [ simpler ]. But our expectation is to fully offset inflation over time and through all of these levers, and we're working very aggressively to do that. 
And as I pointed out before, something else to keep in mind too is that the priority for both Conagra and our customers is to sustain growth. Now doing that means we got to keep our proven innovation machine running, and doing that means we have to offset inflation. So in other words, our customers understand this more often than not, because they've seen and they now count on the tremendous vitality that our innovation programs have driven into important categories like frozen and snacks. 
And last thing before I turn it over to Dave is by the way, I am very happy that we've been so aggressive in modernizing our portfolio for the past 6 years. Because you can see it in the numbers, the dedication that these consumers now have to our products will be another factor that helps us navigate this inflationary period. Dave, do you want to talk any more about the cost savings levers or anything?"

As it relates to realized productivity, first of all, we have a very experienced supply chain organization with really strong processes across the entire network. So if you look historically, we've approximated 3% of cost of goods sold realized productivity savings if you go back historically. Efficiency in the plants, network opportunity sourcing, there's just a series of different areas, and we continue to execute projects to drive the cost savings opportunity. So obviously, this isn't changing as we look forward. 
There's other levers though. As Andrew had asked previously, we're on track with our Pinnacle synergies to go from our $270 million where we are year-to-date this year to $305 million by the end of next fiscal year. 
Less COVID-related costs in fiscal '22. As people become vaccinated, the entire end-to-end supply chain is going to benefit from less supply disruption, and that will enable us to reduce excess costs being incurred in fiscal '21 to support demand. The Q3 incremental transportation investment that I discussed in my remarks, that's one example. That was $15 million of investment just in this quarter.  Another area is supplementing volume with co-mans, both the incremental cost of the co-man and the incremental distribution cost to get it from the co-man to the customer. 
And so that's another important lever. We're over $100 million year-to-date in those COVID-related costs that, as we look at '22, should really be an opportunity for us to get that out of the base. 
We will have some headwinds with fixed overhead absorption and overall segment mix, but we think product mix is an opportunity for us. And then as we always talk about, margin-accretive innovation, our innovation continues to be strong, and we're really bullish on making sure that it's margin accretive. 
So there's a lot of things, a lot of dynamics that's driving this right now. But based on the analysis we've done in the different scenarios, we think we have various ways that we can reach our '22 profitability numbers."

The overall objective is to optimize getting product to customers as quickly and efficiently as possible. So for certain categories in staples and snacking where inventory has been tight, we made the decision to bypass our normal DC distribution system network and shift directly from plant or directly from one selected DC. So that gives us better inventory, and it allows us to meet customer demand more efficiently, and it improves product availability. But it comes at an incremental cost: inefficient shipping lanes and sporadic frequency of distribution routes. So there's a lot of dynamics there that's going to continue into Q4, and we'll manage that number the best we can."

We've talked about how these acute inflationary periods work with respect to pricing many times over the years. And this lag concept is an important one, right? When you see broad-based inflation across an industry across the basket the way we're seeing now, you tend to see the whole industry kind of acknowledge that there -- they've got to contend with these things. They've got to deal with it. 
And not, as I said a few minutes ago, not all businesses are created equal in terms of when the positive impact of pricing shows up in the P&L versus the negative impact of the inflation. There can be a lag. 
So over the course of a full year, that's kind of how you tend to see it go as you see more of a headwind in the short term, and then you see recovery as pricing goes into the marketplace. And then oftentimes, there's a benefit the following year as you begin to wrap. 
So we'll see how it plays out this year. What we can say at this point is we're flat out on all of these integrated margin management levers that we go after in times like this."

You can look at our top line in Q3 and say, wow, we beat our guidance on the top line. Was that because of the A&P increase? The answer to that is no. We planned for a double-digit increase in A&P, and we still over-delivered on our top line. 
So what was it exactly that drove the incremental lift on the top line? It was a deliberate and spontaneous choice by our management team to invest in transportation solutions that are atypical for us. They come at a higher cost, and we chose to do that and make that investment. 
Why did we do that? Because we've got phenomenal repeat and depth of repeat data. And so we're very confident in the ROI of that investment because we're very serious about investing in the business in the short term during this trial period in order to capture this lifetime value. So we've been doing it. 
Also, the decision to continue to lean hard on e-commerce where we tend to get the best ROIs, we tend to over-index most with the younger consumers who are going to be the ones that deliver that lifetime value. This is very purposeful in our regard. 
And we are absolutely -- we don't have any comments today on beyond '22. But what we can say is we're playing the game hard to optimize what beyond '22 looks like in terms of our consumer base because we're having such good fortune generating loyalty."

And frankly, we have been open to other things as well, but we're just -- it's not strategic for us.
Let me put it this way. To pursue utilizing the capital loss carryforward for the sake of utilizing the capital loss carryforward. It would be strategic for us to divest an asset that didn't fit or was something that wasn't a priority for us, as long as the valuation that was inbound cleared the intrinsic value of that.

But what's really interesting post pandemic is the staples business. And that's a very strong margin business for us, and it's been performing phenomenally well. And this whole dynamic with younger consumers learning how to cook, realizing the tremendous value proposition of cooking simple meals at home, beginning to form families and this kind of at-home nesting, it's a real phenomenon.

And we spread it out based on how we need it. But we've already been making those investments and added capacity, both internally and with co-packers. Interestingly, the way, as you all know, it works with some of these co-packer investments is those can be a headwind to margins in the short term. But if you believe that the demand on the other end of the consumer there is sustainable, typically when you repatriate that capacity back in house, that's expansive to margin at that point in time.

And I think probably on average, we probably reduced our reliance on promotion more than most food companies. And frankly, COVID again illuminated some of the inefficiency that has emerged over the years in some of the traditional promotions. It's just the lift that the industry used to see on a lot of categories are a lot smaller today. 
So it's -- we're big believers in redeploying any inefficiency we can find in our total marketing spend and higher ROI ways. That could be in trade. As you've seen before, we've found tremendous inefficiency in some of the A&P lines. And we've actually managed and reinvest some of that in-store with retailers, but not against traditional kind of ""stack them high and watch them fly"" types of investments. 
So that type of -- that priority is always intact for us, and we will continue to try to push our -- over time, our reliance on price-based promotion downward.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our strong third quarter results, our perspective on how Conagra is succeeding in the current environment and how we are well positioned to drive future growth from behavioral tailwinds. So let's get started.  
Our business continued to perform well, both in the absolute and relative to competition during the third quarter. Our ability to deliver for stakeholders during this pandemic is not only a testament to our team's ability to adapt to the current environment, but a reflection of the work we've done to transform our business over the past 5-plus years. Our ongoing execution of the Conagra Way playbook, perpetually reshaping our portfolio and capabilities for better growth and better margins, has enabled us to rise to the occasion during the COVID-19 pandemic and has positioned the business to excel in the future.  
During the third quarter, we continued to build on our momentum and invested across the company to further strengthen the business. This included ongoing investments in physical availability to ensure our products are accessible, online and in stores, and mental availability to ensure we're making the right connections with our consumers.  
As I've said previously, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented an incredible consumer trialing opportunity. Our innovation and marketing approach has enabled us to secure not only strong trial but also strong repeat rates and market share gains. Based on the evidence we are seeing, which I will summarize today, we expect to emerge from the pandemic with structurally higher volumes and share driven by the stickiness of the COVID-driven demand. But to be clear, we are not relying on these benefits to achieve our fiscal 2022 organic net sales guidance.  
Given our confidence in the longer-term value creation opportunities of our business, we opportunistically repurchased approximately $300 million of shares in the quarter. We remain committed to a balanced approach to capital allocation, which includes investing in our business, maintaining solid investment-grade credit ratings, executing smart M&A, and returning capital to shareholders via share repurchases and paying an attractive dividend. Our decision to repurchase shares demonstrates our willingness to capitalize on occasions when we believe we're undervalued.  
As we navigate the current environment, we're seeing input cost inflation accelerate in many of our categories and across the industry. Dave will detail multiple levers we have to manage this inflation.  And finally, we are again reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance.  
I'll unpack these items a bit further in a moment, but I want to start by acknowledging our frontline team. Our supply chain is a vital component of our success, and I want to commend our team once again for their extraordinary execution amid the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm extremely proud of the thousands of hard-working Conagra team members whose dedication has enabled our industry-leading performance. We remain focused on keeping employees safe while meeting the needs of our communities, customers and consumers; and I'd like to thank everyone at Conagra for making this possible. 
Let's get into the business update. As the table on Slide 8 shows our organic net sales growth of 9.7% exceeded our expectations in the quarter, despite the winter storm in February causing a small temporary disruption in the supply chain. We also delivered adjusted operating margin of 16% and adjusted EPS of $0.59, both in line with our quarterly guidance. This strong performance was driven by our continued execution of the Conagra Way playbook. The foundation of everything we do is building superior products with modern attributes, great taste and contemporary packaging. Our third quarter results demonstrate the continued strong performance of our new innovation, which is being accepted by customers and sought after by consumers.  
Once we have the product right, we need to make sure that consumers and customers have access to it across all channels. As we will detail today, this is exemplified by our investments in transportation to ensure physical availability amid elevated demand.  
And finally, we support the mental availability of our products to ensure we connect with consumers in the right place, at the right time and with the right messages. In the third quarter, we supported our brands with continued investments in e-commerce and digital marketing.  
Our playbook is not just a slogan. It's the framework we use to run the business, and it continues to deliver great results.  
During the third quarter, we grew retail sales 13.8%, with each of our domains, frozen, staples and snacks, outpacing the industry. As a result, we grew share in each of our domains. Our strong broad-based growth and share gains were fueled by both our superior penetration and repeat purchase rates in the quarter. Slide 11 shows that our household penetration rate during the third quarter was on average double that of our top 15 peers, and we outpaced those same peers in terms of repeat purchase rate.  
As I mentioned a minute ago, the Conagra Way playbook starts with building superior products. When we began this journey over 5 years ago, we recognized that we had a lot of latent potential in the portfolio but it had to be modernized, so we set out to aggressively do just that. And you'll recall that we established a goal of having 15% of our annual retail sales come from products launched within the preceding 3 years.  
As you can see on Slide 12, our innovation performance has consistently exceeded our 15% goal over the last 2 fiscal years and through the last 52 weeks, and our fiscal '21 innovation is performing even better than prior year innovation. Compared to last year's launches, the products we introduced through the third quarter this fiscal '21 have achieved 66% more sales per UPC and 53% more distribution points per UC than during the comparable time period last year. And as you can see on Slide 13, many of our new innovations are leading their categories. 
Looking ahead, we're starting to see strong customer acceptance our fiscal '22 innovation. Customers trust our innovation track record and rely on our new products to drive consumer trial and overall category growth. Slide 14 shows just a few of our exciting innovations that will begin shipping in fiscal 2022. Critical to our ability to sustain our growing relevancy with consumers is the physical availability of our products, whether through brick-and-mortar or online, and Slide 15 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce have continued to yield results. Conagra has outpaced total edible retail sales in e-commerce growth each quarter throughout the pandemic, and we have grown share in e-commerce across 76% of our brands over the past year. As we've discussed before, we believe that e-commerce investment is a high-ROI opportunity to deliver our message to consumers.  
Slide 16 details some of the specific benefits to expanding our e-commerce platform. E-commerce shoppers over-index to younger millennial consumers. When consumers start to shop online, they're likely to continue the behavior and become heavy users of a brand, and online shoppers in general have higher brand loyalty than those shopping in store. All of this demonstrates the opportunity for superior lifetime value that's being generated by our e-commerce investment and growth. 
Now let's turn briefly to each of our retail domains and start with frozen on Slide 17. Total Conagra frozen retail sales grew an impressive 12% on both a 1- and 2-year basis in the quarter, which is an acceleration from the second quarter. And Slide 18 demonstrates our growth in frozen accelerated on a sequential basis across many of our leading brands and categories.  
Our snacks business also continued to deliver strong growth throughout the quarter -- third quarter. As you can see on Slide 19, we generated double-digit retail sales growth on a year-over-year and 2-year basis in snacking, led by impressive increases in -- across popcorn, sweet treats and meat snacks. And as consumers continued snacking at elevated rates, we capitalized with strong Q3 velocity growth across our leading brands.  
Our staples portfolio also delivered solid results in Q3, including 15% retail sales growth, led by double-digit quarterly growth across key staples categories. And as Slide 22 shows the broad-based growth we delivered in the third quarter exceeded the already strong growth we delivered in the second quarter. People are returning to their kitchens during the pandemic, and new younger consumers are discovering the joy of cooking. As we've discussed before, the current environment has resulted in consumers trying or reengaging with our staples products and coming back again and again.  
Overall, I'm very pleased with our end market performance across the portfolio this quarter. And it's even more impressive, given the fact that we delivered these results despite continued supply constraints resulting from sustained elevated demand outpacing our ability to supply. And that takes us to what we see looking ahead. As we try to understand where consumer trends are going, it's always helpful to look back at lessons from recent history. During the '08/'09 recession, we saw consumers shift from primarily consuming meals sourced away from home to meal sourced in home. 
While this shift is not surprising during the heart of a recession, it's important to recognize that the change in behavior, although event-driven, lasted well past the recovery. And we believe that a good portion of that change in behavior was driven by the formation of new habits. Psychology experts assert that it takes on average 66 days for a new behavior to become habitual. As you all know, we are nearly 400 days into the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumers have adapted to at-home eating and formed new habits that we expect to sustain well beyond the current conditions.  
And early data supports our hypothesis. If you take a sampling of data from states that have been the most open based on the mobility of their residents throughout the pandemic, what you'll find is the 2-year growth rates in retail sales are materially higher than pre-pandemic and fairly consistent as states reopen and stay open. So while people are starting to leave their homes more frequently, they are still choosing to eat at home. Consumers are largely maintaining the habits they've acquired over the past 400 days, just like psychology predicts.  
And while we're poised to benefit from sustained elevated at home eating, we are not resting on our laurels or taking our consumers for granted. We're continuing to invest behind our brands to create connections with consumers. Slide 27 shows just one fun example of our innovative approach to brand building. We listen to our communities and identify the trends that resonate with them.  
As an example, the Slim Jim community online was built on memes. Given that fact, DOGE and Dogecoin were a natural fit for our brand. Since joining the online conversation about the Do Good Everyday (sic) [ Do Only Good Everyday ] sentiment of Dogecoin, we've tapped into another channel for Slim Jim to engage with its community. We've seen a market uptick in audience interaction, including direct engagement and advocacy from the person that created Dogecoin, as you can see on this slide. Not only is this community hungry for our product and new innovation, but they've also been quick to rally behind the brand playing a large part in Slim Jim being crowned the champion of Adweek's March Adness Bracket of the top 64 brands. On its way to the title, Slim Jim defeated Doritos, Pepsi, Amazon, Wendy's, M&M and OREO in head-to-head matchups.  
We're excited about this, and you should be on the lookout for additional crypto-themed activations in the future.  
And Slim Jim is just one example of how we're connecting with the consumer. Since the onset of COVID-19 last March, we've gained the equivalent of more than 4 years' worth of incremental new buyers. COVID has effectively supercharged new trial at a level rarely seen in our industry.  
Importantly, we're winning with younger consumers. Nearly half of our new buyers are millennials and Gen Z. The steady trends shown on Slide 29 demonstrate that these new buyers are even more likely to repeat purchases across many of our key brands. They are discovering our modernized portfolio and developing new habits that include our products. And as you can see on Slide 30, we're outpacing our peers in terms of repeat rate as consumers are flocking to our brand more than to those of our top competitors across all of our domains. And we continue to believe that we are very well positioned to capture the benefits of consumer behavior post-pandemic. Let's start with frozen. The adoption of remote work provides a structural increase in the demand for frozen food compared to pre-COVID levels. Importantly, some aspects of the remote workforce adoption are expected to be permanent. And this shift to remote work has the biggest impact on lunch and dinner occasions, the meals with the largest exposure to frozen foods.  
Our portfolio of brands and products uniquely meet these consumers' needs. Our frozen portfolio over-indexes in these occasions by offering hyper-convenient meals and sides perfect for a quick lunch or family dinner. In addition to enjoying more food cooked together at home and including frozen as a key part of those meals, consumers are making what we believe is a significant and lasting shift to at home entertainment. People increased their time spent watching digital video by over 40% in 2020. Recent studies and our understanding of habit formation tell us that this shift towards at-home entertainment is likely to continue post pandemic. When consumers, particularly the younger generations, move their entertainment to the home, they increase the number of at-home snacking occasions. And during those occasions, consumers are choosing our brands time and time again.  
And as I've already touched on, younger groups are engaging more and more with our staples segment as they learn how to cook at home. As the chart on the left demonstrates, young adults are increasingly moving from urban areas to smaller cities and suburbs, where there are fewer options for eating away from home. And as the chart on the right demonstrates, these young consumers, Gen Z and millennials, are increasingly engaging with Conagra's staples portfolio as they discover their kitchens.  
Today, we are reaffirming our fiscal '22 guidance. As I said earlier, we're not incorporating expectations about the stickiness of COVID-driven demand in our reaffirmation of the organic net sales guidance. However, as we have detailed today, we are increasingly confident that we will benefit from the stickiness of the pandemic-driven demand. And as Dave will discuss, while the current inflationary environment provides us more of a challenge on margin than we were originally expecting, we will be pulling on all of our margin levers to manage through the current environment and remain focused on delivering our profitability targets.  
So to summarize, we continued to deliver solid execution during the third quarter, and our business remains strong in the absolute and relative to peers. While inflation is accelerating, we have multiple levers to manage inflation and drive margin improvement. And we're continuing our execution of the Conagra Way playbook, which includes investments to capitalize on significant behavioral tailwinds. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

I'll start my remarks by calling out a few third quarter performance highlights, which are captured on Slide 37.  
As we have detailed this morning, the business continued to perform very well throughout the third quarter. Strong execution from the supply chain and outstanding performance by our teams across the company enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales during the third quarter, while meeting margin and earnings targets as we continued to strategically invest in the business while managing inflation.  
Overall, reported and organic net sales for the quarter increased 8.5% and 9.7% respectively compared to the same period a year ago. Adjusted gross margin increased 12 basis points to 27.5%, and adjusted operating margin increased 31 basis points to 16% in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.9% to $566 million in the quarter, while adjusted diluted EPS grew to $0.59, up 25.5%.  
Slide 38 illustrates the drivers of our 8.5% net sales growth versus the same period a year ago. The 9.7% increase in organic net sales was driven by a 6.1% increase in volume connected to the continued increase in at-home food consumption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A favorable price/mix impact contributed a 3.6% increase to organic sales growth.  
As Sean mentioned, our organic sales growth was impacted a bit from the February winter storms that impacted our ability to deliver product for a short time during the quarter. Our strong organic net sales growth was partially offset by the impact of a 1.2% decrease associated with the divestitures of the Lender's, H.K. Anderson and Peter Pan businesses as well as the exit of the private label peanut butter business. As a reminder, we completed the divestiture of our Peter Pan business on January 25, which was approximately 2 months into our fiscal third quarter. 
Turning to Slide 39. You will find a summary of our net sales by segment. In the third quarter, we saw continued growth in each of our 3 retail segments on both a reported and organic basis as the continuation of elevated demand for at-home food consumption benefited these segments. Our foodservice segment was negatively impacted by reduced demand away from home. Importantly, innovation momentum in our retail segments continued throughout the quarter.  
Slide 40 outlines the adjusted operating margin bridge for the third quarter versus the prior year. As you can see, our adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points to 16%, in line with our guidance range for the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin increased by 12 basis points in the quarter versus the same period a year ago as our margin levers of mix, cost management, fixed cost leverage and pricing more than offset the combination of inflation and COVID-related costs.  
Included in the 180 basis points of COVID-related costs is 60 basis points of additional transportation investments that we made during the quarter. I'll discuss those in more detail in a moment.  
A&P increased 11.8% in the quarter, primarily driven by higher e-commerce marketing investments, particularly for the refrigerated and frozen segment. And finally, our adjusted SG&A rate was favorable to our operating margin by 30 basis points versus a year ago as net sales grew at a faster pace than SG&A.  
I'd now like to touch on certain transportation investments we made in the quarter. These are incremental transportation costs incurred on top of the core transportation inflation we experienced, so we've included these in our COVID-19-related costs in the margin bridge. These investments had a negative impact on our margins, but they helped us deliver more profit dollars.  
As you can see by Q3 organic net sales exceeding guidance, demand was higher than we expected during the quarter. To adequately service this demand, we made the decision to invest approximately $15 million in the quarter. This meant aggressively seeking out every available truck and adjusting how we ship to customers. To best service demand for certain brands, we had to bypass our normal distribution network and ship directly to customers. While we incurred additional costs to implement these actions, which impacted our operating margin, this enabled us to minimize out of stocks, maximize on-shelf availability and maximize profit dollars. 
COVID has provided a period of significant elevated consumer trial of our brands, and our innovation has outperformed expectations, allowing us to gain share with existing and new consumers. Investing to keep product on shelves to support this momentum and to support our retail customers while they manage tighter inventory levels was an easy business decision for us. While we expect demand to remain elevated for the foreseeable future, we believe we will be in a position to start rebuilding inventory over the next 2 quarters, which we believe will start removing the need for these incremental investments.  
I want to take a moment to comment on the input cost inflation we're seeing in the market and provide an overview of what we're doing to navigate it. As you can see on Slide 42, inflation increased 3.9% in the third quarter. This was higher than our 3.5% estimate and reflects the broad-based impact on the cost of materials, manufacturing and transportation and logistics. We expect the rate of inflation to continue to accelerate over the next few quarters. Fortunately, we have a variety of levers that can be used to offset this pressure, including pricing. We have already mobilized our inflation-justified pricing plans with some actions already in market, others communicated to customers, and some yet to come. History shows us that price adjustments are more likely to be accepted in the market when industry-wide and broad-based input cost inflation occurs, and that's the environment we see today.  
We will also leverage our capabilities beyond just pricing to offset margin pressure, including overall mix management, cost savings measures such as our ongoing supply chain realized productivity programs, and the optimization of our fixed cost leverage. In short, we will continue to closely evaluate the impact of inflation on our business and are confident in our ability to utilize our entire tool kit to manage through this environment. 
Turning to Slide 43. You can see an outline of our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment for the quarter. We are very happy with the continued profit growth in our retail business in the quarter, which more than offsets the decline in foodservice.  
Slide 44 summarizes the drivers of our third quarter adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. In the quarter, our adjusted diluted EPS of $0.59 increased by 25.5% compared to the same period a year ago. The growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion as well as reduced interest expense driven by lower debt.  
Slide 45 summarizes Conagra's net debt and cash flow information. We ended the third quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at our longer-term target of 3.5x, which is down from 4.8x a year ago. With our balance sheet in a stronger position and given our strong operating cash flow, we have increased our investments in the business. Our year-to-date CapEx increased over $130 million compared to last year to fund important capacity and productivity projects.  
The combination of the improved balance sheet and strong free cash flow generation has enabled us to return additional capital to shareholders via our recently increased dividend as well as by executing our first share repurchases since the close of the Pinnacle acquisition. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased 8.8 million shares for $298 million, demonstrating our willingness to capitalize on occasions when we believe we are undervalued. Looking forward, we will continue to be focused on executing a balanced capital allocation policy focused on driving sustainable value creation. We remain committed to maintaining solid investment-grade credit ratings as we use the strength of our cash flow and balance sheet to opportunistically play offense as compelling investment opportunities arise in the future.  
Slide 46 summarizes our current outlook. As we've said throughout our comments today, Conagra's business is performing well, and we remain optimistic regarding our ability to generate continued strong performance in the quarters ahead. For the fourth quarter, we expect organic net sales to decline approximately 10% to 12% as we lap the 21.5% growth in Q4 a year ago. Our Q4 guidance represents a strong 2-year growth rate of approximately 7% to 9.5%. As a reminder, reported net sales will also be impacted by last year's 53rd week.  
We expect fourth quarter operating margin to be in the range of 14% to 15%. This estimate includes the combination of continued transportation investments to support product availability at similar levels to Q3, the lag in timing between our pricing actions, and the expected acceleration of inflation as well as a continuation of the A&P investment increase that started in Q2. As a reminder, our fiscal fourth quarter is historically our lowest operating margin quarter given seasonality and as just mentioned, does not include a 53rd week. 
Given these sales and margin factors, we expect to deliver fourth quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $0.49 to $0.55. Our fourth quarter guidance also continues to assume that the end-to-end supply chain operates effectively during this period of heightened demand. 
And finally, we are reaffirming all of our fiscal '22 guidance metrics. As Sean mentioned, the benefits of the stickiness of COVID-related demand are not required to reach our fiscal '22 organic net sales guidance. While the current inflationary environment provides us more of a challenge on margin than we were originally expecting, we remain focused on utilizing our entire tool kit to deliver our profitability targets, which we are reaffirming today. When we report Q4 results in early July, we plan to provide more detail on our fiscal '22 expectations. 
That concludes my remarks this morning. Thanks for listening. I'll now pass it to the operator to open it up for questions."

So in other words, Conagra can hit its fiscal '22 goals, but do so in a way that is somehow deemed less sustainable or lower quality. 
And I guess in light of rising inflation seen in today's results on margins and sort of the margin commentary for next quarter, I'd expect these concerns to only grow from here. So I guess I'd love your take on this and maybe to address this sort of very specific investor concern, if you could."

Over the past 6 years, we have totally transformed our company and our culture, and the magnitude of the portfolio modernization we've delivered is arguably best in class. And that incredible work by our Conagra team put us in a position to capitalize on the unique and unprecedented trialing opportunity that COVID presented. We knew that our modernized products would perform and that our repeat purchases would be excellent. 
So what did we do? We invested during the pandemic to maximize trial and try to capture the lifetime value of these new, mostly younger consumers. Look no further than our aggressive stance on transportation solutions and e-commerce in Q3. 
So if you flash forward to fiscal '22, our conviction around getting our products, our modernized products into consumers' mouths won't change. We play the long game, and we do not burn the furniture to create better margin percent optics short term. This is my -- I think it's my ninth year as a public company CEO, and I've never taken that route, so I don't think that concern is warranted."

We'll try anyway and just cut me off if you can't hear me. But Sean, as you know, just to kind of piggyback a little bit on what Andrew was saying, one of the bigger investor questions is whether you can hit that 18% minimum margin number next year, right? I'm sure you hear that more than we do. 
You obviously maintained that range today, but the 3Q margin came in lighter than you expected. 4Q's will as well. And then you have an acceleration of inflation into next year. 
So despite your reiteration and even though pricing and savings are going to accelerate, there's an argument to be made that your current numbers are saying these tailwinds won't be quite enough to offset costs. So I guess my question is this: just how confident are you in that 18% to 19% range? And why isn't it somewhat at risk at least more than it was 3 months ago, given net cost inflation that we're seeing?"

And the precise permutation of how things unfold is not yet clear because things are moving around still quite a bit. But here's how I think about '22 in general. 
Versus what we were originally envisioning, the top line clearly looks stronger. Margins look more challenged short term due to inflation and the lags that usually follow price increases. 
And so given we're still in the midst of finalizing our annual operating plan and our pricing plans, it is premature to communicate the precise permutation of how things will unfold. But in our eyes, we expect things to unfold in such a way that we deliver the guidance overall."

Principally, when we're experiencing inflation as we are c",320,"Yes, all right. So let me start, Chris, with a big picture here, and then go over to Dave with more granular detail. Here's how I think about this whole inflation/levers/pricing kind of concept. 
Principally, when we're experiencing inflation as we are currently, we will be very aggressive to offset it using multiple levers like our cost programs, which you cited; our pricing, trade and mix. Now with regard to inflation-justified pricing, it's really there not a question of if we will move, it's a question of how closely the pricing action's impact on the P&L lines up with inflation's impact on the P&L. And here not all businesses are equal. The lag is typically shorter, as you know, in foodservice and in those retail categories with [ simpler ] [indiscernible]. Our expectation is to fully offset inflation over time and through all of these levers, and we're working very aggressively to do that. 
And as I pointed out before, something else to keep in mind too is that the priority for both Conagra and our customers is to sustain growth. Now doing that means we got to keep our proven innovation machine running, and doing that means we have to offset inflation. So in other words, our customers understand this more often than not, because they've seen and they count -- now count on the tremendous vitality that our innovation programs have driven into important categories like frozen and snacks. 
And last thing before I turn it over to Dave is by the way, I am very happy that we've been so aggressive in modernizing our portfolio for the past 6 years. Because you can see it in the numbers, the dedication that these consumers now have to our products will be another factor that helps us navigate this inflationary period. Dave, do you want to talk any more about the other -- the cost savings levers or anything?"

As it relates to realized productivity, first of all, we have a very experienced supply chain organization with really strong processes across the entire network. So if you look historically, we've approximated 3% of cost of goods sold realized productivity savings if you go back historically. Efficiency in the plants, network opportunity sourcing, there's just a series of different areas, and we continue to execute projects to drive the cost savings opportunity. So obviously, this isn't changing as we look forward. 
There's other levers though. As Andrew had asked previously, we're on track with our Pinnacle synergies to go from our $270 million where we are year-to-date this year to $305 million by the end of next fiscal year. 
Less COVID-related costs in fiscal '22. As people become vaccinated, the entire end-to-end supply chain is going to benefit from less supply disruption, and that will enable us to reduce excess costs being incurred in fiscal '21 to support demand. The Q3 incremental transportation investment that I discussed in my remarks, that's one example. That was $15 million of investment just in this quarter.  Another area is supplementing volume with [ co-mans ], both the incremental cost of the [ co-man ] and the incremental distribution cost to get it from the [ co-man ] to the customer. 
And so that's another important lever. We're over $100 million year-to-date in those COVID-related costs that, as we look at '22, should really be an opportunity for us to get that out of the base. 
We will have some headwinds with fixed overhead absorption and overall segment mix, but we think product mix is an opportunity for us. And then as we always talk about, margin-accretive innovation, our innovation continues to be strong, and we're really bullish on making sure that it's margin accretive. 
So there's a lot of things, a lot of dynamics that's driving this right now. But based on the analysis we've done in the different scenarios, we think we have various ways that we can reach our '22 profitability numbers."

I'm not going to say that it's exactly $15 million. It's a little fluid. 
The overall objective is to optimize getting product to customers as quickly and efficiently as possible. So for certain categories in staples and snacking where inventory has been tight, we made the decision to bypass our normal DC distribution system network and shift directly from plant or directly from 1 selected DC. So that gives us better inventory, and it allows us to meet customer demand more efficiently, and it improves product availability. But it comes at an incremental cost, inefficient shipping lanes and sporadic frequency of distribution routes. So there's a lot of dynamics there that's going to continue into Q4, and we'll manage that number the best we can."

We've talked about how these acute inflationary periods work with respect to pricing many times over the years. And this lag concept is an important one, right? When you see broad-based inflation across an industry across the basket the way we're seeing now, you tend to see the whole industry kind of acknowledge that there -- they've got to contend with these things. They've got to deal with it. 
And not, as I said a few minutes ago, not all businesses are created equal in terms of when the positive impact of pricing shows up in the P&L versus the negative impact of the inflation. There can be a lag. 
So over the course of a full year, that's kind of how you tend to see it go as you see more of a headwind in the short term, and then you see recovery as pricing goes into the marketplace. And then oftentimes, there's a benefit the following year as you begin to wrap. 
So we'll see how it plays out this year. What we can say at this point is we're flat out on all of these integrated margin management levers that we go after in times like this."

You can look at our top line in Q3 and say, wow, we beat our guidance on the top line. Was that because of the A&P increase? The answer to that is no. We planned for a double-digit increase in A&P, and we still over-delivered on our top line. 
So what was it exactly that drove the incremental lift on the top line? It was a deliberate and spontaneous choice by our management team to invest in transportation solutions that are atypical for us. They come at a higher cost, and we chose to do that and make that investment. 
Why did we do that? Because we've got phenomenal repeat and depth of repeat data. And so we're very confident in the ROI of that investment because we're very serious about investing in the business in the short term during this trial period in order to capture this lifetime value. So we've been doing it. 
Also, the decision to continue to lean hard on e-commerce where we tend to get the best ROIs, we tend to over-index most with the younger consumers who are going to be the ones that deliver that lifetime value. This is very purposeful in our regard.

And we've actually managed and reinvest some of that in-store with retailers, but not against traditional kind of ""stack them high and watch them fly"" types of investments. 
So that type of -- that priority is always intact for us, and we will continue to try to push our -- over time, our reliance on price-based promotion downward. Obviously, last year was kind of an extreme base. And so we'll see how that evolves over time, but principally that's how we think about it. Dave, do you want to add to that?"

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results, our expectations for fiscal 2022 and our perspective on how the Conagra Way playbook positions us for continued success in this dynamic environment. 
Slide 5 lays out the key points we're going to cover today. As you saw in our release, we reported very strong results for fiscal 2021, and we could not have done so without our people executing the Conagra Way with excellence. Their dedication enabled us to capitalize on an unprecedented time of consumer demand. Over the last year, we acquired and retained multiple years' worth of new consumers, and we grew share across categories, all while continuing to invest in the future. This translated into strong growth across the portfolio. We saw continued strength in frozen and snacks as well as increased relevancy for our large staples business. 
The work we've done modernizing and premiumizing our portfolio continues to pay off. We believe our brands are healthier than ever and well positioned to manage through the current inflationary challenges. Dave and I will both share more about our approach to managing rising input costs later in the presentation. But I can tell you now that we're taking aggressive actions on a number of fronts. 
It's also important to note that our plans provide for continued brand-building investments to drive consumer demand and further enhance brand health. 
Our business remains very strong, but we are revising our fiscal '22 guidance to reflect the lag effect associated with the aggressive mitigating actions we are taking. Essentially, we see fiscal '22 as a tale of 2 halves, with the lag effect concentrated in the first half and particularly in Q1. We expect many of our actions will start to flow through the P&L in Q2, setting up a second half adjusted EPS in line with what was assumed for H2 within our prior guidance. Given our resiliency over the last year and the compelling consumer trends we're continuing to track, we remain confident in the underlying strength of the business and the opportunities ahead for long-term value creation. As a result, this morning, we announced a 14% increase to our annual dividend, reflecting our board's continued confidence in our outlook. Finally, we plan on hosting an investor meeting next spring to provide an update on our progress and discuss fiscal '23 and beyond. Be on the lookout for more information regarding the event. We hope you can join us. 
So with that as the backdrop, let's jump into the agenda for today's call. We'll start with our business update and then cover our priorities and value creation opportunities in fiscal 2022. 
As you can see on Slide 7, we ended fiscal 2021 with a strong fourth quarter that was in line with our guidance. As you know, our Q4 growth rates were impacted by the unprecedented demand we experienced in 2020 when at-home food consumption surged due to the onset of the pandemic and organic net sales increased 21.5%. Given this dynamic, we'll reference some 2-year figures throughout today's presentation to provide more helpful context on the underlying strength and trajectory of the business. 
And as you can see, on a 2-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the fourth quarter increased by more than 4%, and our 2-year adjusted EPS grew by more than 22%. On a full year basis, our organic net sales, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS were all up materially versus fiscal 2020. Continued execution of the Conagra Way playbook served as the foundation for our strong fiscal 2021 performance. 
Within our industry, success is defined by creating meaningful and lasting connections between consumers and brands. We believe that our playbook is the most effective framework for delivering on that objective. 
Our modern approach to brand building is based on 3 tenets. First, it all starts with developing superior products through perpetual modernization. Second, we ensure physical availability of our items, both in-store and online. And third, we drive mental availability of our products to ensure we remain salient and relevant with consumers. 
The foundation of the Conagra Way to brand building is our people. Our exceptional results this past fiscal year reflect our team's dedication to executing the Conagra Way each and every day. 
I would like to pause and say a heartfelt thank you to Conagra's amazing team for rising to the occasion to support each other, our business, our communities, our customers and our consumers. I'm extremely proud of the team's resilience in responding to the volatile environment throughout the year. We know our long-term performance is a function of the caliber and engagement of our team. That's why we're continuing to invest in our current employees and keeping the door open to talented new additions. 
In fiscal '21, our team's engagement was clearly evident in their intense focus on capturing opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, the pandemic created a unique environment for new consumer acquisition, and we were able to capitalize by having modern products available when and where consumers wanted them. We estimate that over the course of the last fiscal year, we gained the equivalent of more than 4 years' worth of incremental new buyers. COVID effectively amplified new product trial at a level rarely seen in our industry. 
In the chart on the left, on Slide 10, you can see the increase in household penetration across our portfolio during fiscal 2021, clear evidence of the magnitude of our new consumer acquisition. But what's even more encouraging is the chart on the right. We didn't just acquire new consumers. We kept them. The data shows that our new consumers discovered the tremendous value proposition our portfolio provides, and we're proud that our products are repeatedly appearing in pantries and freezers across America. Importantly, our performance over the last year was not only strong in the absolute, it was strong relative to the competition. 
We performed better than our peers in terms of household penetration and repeat rates and we continue to gain share. Keep in mind that we delivered these results despite hitting an upper control limit on the amount of product we could produce in certain categories. If we had additional capacity, these numbers would likely be even more impressive. 
Our disciplined approach to modernization and innovation across our product portfolio is key to our success. As you can see on Slide 11, we delivered an impressive innovation slate in fiscal '21. Our performance on innovation launched and sold in fiscal '21 surpassed the record performance we set in fiscal '20. And importantly, our innovation outperformed the competition. This strong outperformance is why even during the height of the pandemic, customers continue to ask for our new products. This is a clear testament to the innovation engine at Conagra and the solid reputation we built with customers and consumers. 
Slide 12 highlights a handful of our important launches in fiscal '21. We continued our successful Gardein co-branding strategy with the launch of Marie Callender's pot pie with Gardein protein. We continued to modernize and premiumize Birds Eye with the launch of vegetable bakes that are as good as any side dish you can order from a Chicago steakhouse. We began modernizing the Hungry-Man brand with the launch of the Double Meat platform that satisfies the hungriest of appetites. We also continued to work on Duncan Hines with the Instagramable epic line of baking kits along with our keto-friendly mixes. And we found even more ways to keep evolving our Healthy Choice Power Bowls with the launch of these vegetarian and vegan options. 
I'm particularly excited about the Birds Eye breaded vegetables platform we launched in fiscal '21. It's already started to take off with 3 of the cauliflower wings products being among the best-selling SKUs in the frozen vegetable category this year. If you haven't tried them, you're missing out. 
We supported the launch with a robust advertising campaign to drive awareness and mental availability. This campaign included digital, social and TV advertising. 
In addition to mental availability, we remain focused on the physical availability of our products in Q4, whether it's through brick-and-mortar or online. Slide 14 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce have continued to yield results. Growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business continued in fiscal 2021, both against our peers and as a percentage of our overall retail sales. We consistently outpaced the entire total edible category in terms of e-commerce retail sales growth during the year. e-commerce sales now represent nearly 8% of our total retail sales. And importantly, our success in fiscal 2021 was broad-based. Just take a look at Slide 15. 
Total Conagra retail sales grew an impressive 11.7% on a 2-year basis in the fourth quarter with contributions from each of our retail domains. On a 2-year basis, we delivered double-digit growth rates in retail sales across our frozen and snacking domains and a solid 5.2% growth rate in staples. 
Let's dig into each domain a bit more, and let's start with frozen on Slide 16. Over the last 2 years, our frozen retail sales have surged across desserts, single-serve meals and multi-serve meals. We've also seen consistent growth in retail sales of frozen vegetables. All in, our strategic frozen business grew 13.5% over the 2-year period ending in fiscal 2021. And importantly, our buyers repeatedly returned to our frozen products. As you can see on Slide 17, consumer repeat rates for our leading frozen brands have been stronger than for the competition. 
Turning to Slide 18. Our snacks business has seen similar success, delivering strong 2-year retail sales growth of 21% in fiscal '21, led by increases of more than 25% across hot cocoa, microwave popcorn, ready-to-eat pudding and meat snacks. As with frozen, consumer repeat rates for a number of our leading snack brands beat those of competition during the fiscal year. 
Staples was also a meaningful contributor to our success. On Slide 20, you can see the strength of our staples portfolio. Staples retail sales increased 5.2% over the past 2 years, spurred by steady growth across key staples categories. Having increasingly rediscovered the joys of cooking last year, consumers reengaged with our staples products in a meaningful way. 
As you can see on Slide 21, the solid performance from staples was not isolated. We saw strong 2-year growth rates across many of our largest staples brands. Overall, we're pleased by the performance across our retail business, both within the quarter and over the fiscal year. And as fiscal '22 begins, we believe our branded portfolio is stronger than ever. 
So let's talk about what we see looking ahead. We have a unique opportunity in fiscal '22 to leverage our current momentum and maximize long-term value-creation potential. New behaviors and habits created during the pandemic resulted in an elevated and sustained level of at-home eating. Shoppers are engaging or reengaging with our products now more than ever, creating a larger, high-quality consumer base. To sustain this engagement, we plan to continue making investments in the physical and mental availability for our products. This includes building additional capacity to fulfill consumer demand making further strategic e-commerce investments, pursuing efficient and thoughtful marketing campaigns and introducing a robust fiscal '22 innovation slate. 
As we invest in our brands to create new and stronger connections with our consumers, we will also strategically navigate the inflationary environment that accelerated quickly during Q4 and continues today. We're aggressively pulling on all our margin levers to minimize the inflation-related profit lag during the first half. Regardless of near-term cost challenges, we plan to stay focused on the long-term priorities of our business, including continued investments to further support our brands. Our objectives are ultimately focused on driving long-term value creation achieved by pursuing growth in frozen and snacks and maintaining our staples portfolio as a reliable contributor. 
Let's spend a few minutes on our fiscal '22 innovation plans for each of the domains. I'm excited to provide you a preview of what we have in store. 
Starting with frozen, once again, we have high expectations for our innovation slate. Slide 24 highlights some of the frozen products that will be rolled out during the year. Hungary-Man has responded very well to recent innovation. We're extending its new double-meat platform with this double chicken ball, which is sure to satisfy any big, bold appetite. 
Our broad snacks portfolio also provides us with plenty of opportunities to innovate. And here is just a sample of our fiscal '22 slate. Among the products on deck, household favorite Duncan Hines will soon be offering additional EPIC kits with versions of classic cookie mixes that combine many of the brand's delicious ingredients. 
Our highly relevant staples portfolio is also receiving a new slate of innovation as shown on Slide 26. Notably, our great P.F. Chang's brand is launching a variety of new restaurant-inspired products. Also, as more consumers seek plant-based foods, Gardein continues to expand its portfolio with new offerings, including a new line of plant-based chili. 
Overall, we're confident that the investments we're making in product innovations across our portfolio will produce strong ROIs. Ultimately, long-term brand health is dependent on the type of perpetual modernization that we're committed to here at Conagra. 
Before I turn things over to Dave to walk you through the financials, I want to quickly touch on our thoughts around inflation and our updated guidance for fiscal 2022. Dave will discuss the cost environment in more detail, but I want to reinforce that we are aggressively pulling on all of our levers to navigate the current inflationary environment. We began executing our aggressive response plan in fiscal 2021, given the inflation we were already seeing and talking to you about in Q3. The incremental inflation that arose as Q4 unfolded called for additional actions, and you can be assured that we've begun to respond accordingly. 
As I've shared in my remarks, we're also not pulling back from investing in the business. We remain squarely focused on long-term value creation. But I also know that a more short-term focused question on all of your minds is, will Conagra take list pricing increases. And the short answer is yes. In fact, we began implementing pricing actions on some of our products in the fourth quarter related to the initial inflation we experienced. The very early read on the data from those actions is that our elasticities look good so far. And we have more pricing coming. Because our pricing is being implemented strategically and thoughtfully, we're cautiously optimistic that our elasticities will remain strong as our full array of pricing enters the market in fiscal '22. 
As I mentioned last quarter and earlier in my presentation, we expect the negative impact of the cost inflation to hit our financials before the beneficial impact of our responsive actions, including our pricing. This timing mismatch is expected to be particularly impactful in H1 and more specifically in Q1. The resulting pressure on our first half margins impact our full year profit. 
And as you saw in the release, we're updating our fiscal '22 guidance as a result. Organic net sales growth is expected to be roughly flat to fiscal '21. This results in a CAGR over the 3 years ending fiscal '22 of approximately 3.5% compared to our original target of 1% to 2%. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 16%, and adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $2.50. Although the substantial increase in inflation over the last few months has negatively impacted our profit guidance for the year, we remain confident in the underlying strength of the business. Even with the lag effect I've discussed, our full year guidance delivers significant improvements compared to our fiscal '19 starting point. Importantly, we expect that the impact of our aggressive mitigating actions will cause second half adjusted EPS to rebound to be in line with what was assumed for H2 within our prior guidance. We're excited about the path the business is on, and we're ready for another dynamic year ahead. 
Thanks for your time, everyone. Dave, over to you."
26893,717840758,2343944,"Conagra Brands, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 13, 2021",2021-07-13,"Earnings Calls","Conagra Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some highlights from the quarter and full year fiscal '21, which are shown on Slide 30. Before we get into the details, a reminder that our year-over-year results for the fourth quarter reflect the",2550,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some highlights from the quarter and full year fiscal '21, which are shown on Slide 30. Before we get into the details, a reminder that our year-over-year results for the fourth quarter reflect the lapping of the onset of the pandemic in March, April and May of fiscal '20 and the unprecedented surge in consumer demand during that time. Additionally, our Q4 fiscal '20 included a 53rd week, which also impacts comparisons to the year ago period. 
Overall, we are pleased with our performance as our results for the quarter were in line with our expectations. We delivered strong growth for the full fiscal year, including a 5.1% increase in organic net sales; adjusted operating profit of nearly $2 billion, up 7.4% versus fiscal '20; and operating margin of 17.5% for the year, an increase of more than 100 basis points versus fiscal '20; an adjusted EBITDA increase of 6.5%; and adjusted EPS growth of 15.8% for the year. 
Turning to Slide 31. You can see the net sales bridge for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our 10.1% decrease in organic net sales during the quarter was driven by a 12.8% decline in volume due to the comparison to last year's demand surge. The impact of the volume decline was partially offset by a 2.7% benefit from favorable mix and the initial pricing actions we took in response to the elevated inflationary environment, which I will describe in further detail shortly. Divestitures drove a 150 basis point decline to net sales for the quarter, and we faced an additional headwind of 560 basis points from the lapping of last year's 53rd week. Finally, we experienced a 50 basis point benefit from foreign exchange during the quarter. Combined, these factors drove a 16.7% decline in net sales for the quarter compared to a year ago. 
The bottom half of the slide highlights the drivers of our net sales growth for full year fiscal '21 versus the prior year, with an increase in organic net sales of over 5%, driven by volume growth and favorable price mix actions. 
Slide 32 outlines our net sales summary by segment. In the fourth quarter, net sales in our 3 retail segments declined on both a reported and organic basis due to lapping last year's surge in demand. Conversely, our Foodservice segment grew considerably this quarter as restaurant traffic began to recover. For the full fiscal year, the strong performance in our 3 retail segments during the first 3 quarters of the year more than offset the decline in Q4, while our Foodservice segment was negatively impacted by reduced demand for away-from-home eating for most of the year. 
Slide 33 shows the puts and takes of our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin. As you can see, our team did a great job pulling on our margin levers in the quarter, including taking price increases in several retail categories driving favorable mix throughout the portfolio, capturing $20 million of synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition, managing our COVID-19-related costs, which were $36 million in the quarter and continuing to drive strong supply chain productivity. Despite these efforts, however, we were unable to fully offset cost of goods sold inflation in the quarter. Cost inflation continued to accelerate as the quarter progressed, ultimately landing at 8.6%, which was above the Q4 expectations we shared at the end of Q3. 
We also increased our A&P by 27% in the quarter as we continue to identify opportunities for strong ROIs on these investments, particularly within e-commerce. 
Finally, SG&A was a slight margin headwind in the quarter as SG&A dollars decreased at a lower rate than our reported net sales. Cost control and a disciplined approach to SG&A remain a hallmark of our culture here at Conagra. 
On Slide 34, we detail the operating profit and margin for our segments for the quarter and the full year. Each of our 3 retail segments declined versus last year's fourth quarter, driven by the lapping of last year's surge in demand and 53rd week as well as increased cost of goods sold inflation. However, each retail segment reported higher adjusted operating profit than the fourth quarter of fiscal '19, demonstrating the sustained progress we have made. 
As I noted earlier, our adjusted EPS of $0.54 was in line with our expectations despite higher-than-expected inflation. The decline in adjusted operating profit and the impact of last year's 53rd week affected our results by $0.23 and $0.05, respectively, shown here on Slide 35. These headwinds were partially offset by strong performance from our Ardent Mills joint venture, lower net interest expense and a slightly lower average diluted share count resulting from our Q3 share repurchase. 
Slide 36 summarizes our net debt at fiscal year-end and EBITDA and cash flow performance for the fiscal year. We ended the year with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.6x, which is in line with our fiscal '21 target. We took advantage of our strong balance sheet throughout the year to increase our investment in the business and return capital to shareholders. 
During fiscal '21, we increased CapEx by more than $130 million compared to the prior year and funded important capacity and productivity projects. We also repurchased nearly $300 million worth of shares and paid $475 million in dividends in fiscal '21. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we closed the sale of our Egg Beaters liquid egg business at the end of the fourth quarter. Given the timing of the closure, this sale had a minimal impact on our Q4 results, but we expect there to be an annualized net sales impact of roughly $40 million going forward. This will primarily be reflected in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment with small effects on our International and Foodservice segments. We estimate that the sale will have a total annualized impact on our EPS of approximately $0.01. 
As Sean mentioned, we are pleased with our current position in the market and are confident in our ability to continue executing the Conagra Way to drive profitable growth as we look ahead. However, we have experienced an acceleration of inflation since Q3. And due to the timing lag between when this inflation hits our P&L and when the benefits of our pricing and productivity actions take effect, we do not expect to fully offset the impact of these cost increases in time to meet our prior fiscal '22 EPS projections. We do expect, however, second half fiscal '22 EPS to be in line with what we assumed for the second half in our prior guidance. We are, therefore, updating our guidance as shown on Slide 37. 
For fiscal '22, we now expect organic net sales growth approximately flat to fiscal '21, adjusted operating margin of approximately 16% and adjusted EPS of approximately $2.50. While this guidance is our best estimate of how we will perform in fiscal '22, our ultimate performance will be highly dependent on 4 critical factors: first, how consumers purchase food as restaurants, offices and schools continue to reopen; second, the level of inflation we ultimately experience; third, the elasticity impact as consumers respond to higher prices; and finally, the ability of our end-to-end supply chain to continue to operate effectively. 
Slide 38 shows the progression of our fiscal '22 inflation expectations, the continued acceleration being the biggest driver of the change in our guidance. When we initially gave our fiscal '22 targets at our Investor Day in April of 2019, our models assumed an annual inflation rate of around 3%. At the time of our third quarter call, in April of 2021, we expected fiscal '22 inflation to come in at twice that level around 6%. Importantly, as of the Q3 call, we still saw a path to deliver our fiscal '22 targets. Not only is our brand health strong as evidenced by the strong consumer demand, we know how to pull on all margin levers. That said, there is a limit to how much cost increase we can absorb in the short term given the timing lag that Sean and I have discussed. 
And as all of you know, inflation has continued to rise sharply since April. We now currently expect fiscal '22 inflation to come in around 9%. The difference between the 6% we expected a few months ago and the 9% we expect today equates to approximately $255 million in additional costs during fiscal '22. 
The bulk of this inflation can be attributed to continued increases in the cost of edible fats and oils, proteins, packaging and transportation since the timing of our Q3 call. While we are able to hedge some of our inputs, others, particularly certain proteins are not easily hedged. 
As Sean mentioned, we have various levers at our disposal that we are actively and strategically pulling to manage this inflation, but the profit lag effect is real. For example, certain pricing actions can take 90 days to enact or a cost savings initiative may not be actionable until later in the year when a contract is up for review. So while we anticipate being able to successfully manage inflation over time, the continued sharp increases to input costs we are currently experiencing will take some time to overcome. And given our disciplined approach to managing the business for the long term, we will not reduce investments to meet the guidance target at the expense of the long-term health of our business. 
Slide 40 lays out the change in our adjusted EPS expectations in a bit more detail. We are updating our fiscal '22 adjusted EPS guidance for 3 items. First, consistent with our prior divestitures, we are removing $0.01 for the Egg Beaters divestiture that we announced today. Second, the largest driver of the change is the significant $0.41 per share increase in inflation since Q3 that I just discussed. And finally, we have identified many ways to manage and offset this increased inflation, including additional productivity and cost savings initiatives as well as substantial pricing actions that Sean and I have discussed. Again, the bulk of these margin offsets will start to hit our P&L in the second quarter and continue to increase in the second half, which is why we expect second half EPS to be in line with what we assumed for second half EPS in our prior fiscal '22 guidance. 
Slide 41 lays out some of the key assumptions that underlie our fiscal '22 expectations. On the top line, we expect organic net sales growth to be stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first. We expect children to return to in-person schooling and more employees to start returning to in-office work in the fall. So while we expect continued strong demand for our products, we also expect COVID-19-related volume benefits to start to slow at the end of our first quarter. 
Additionally, we have good acceptance from customers on our pricing actions so far, but we expect the majority of our pricing to start hitting the market at the end of Q1. 
We expect the timing of the scale-up to benefit the second half. We also expect our second half operating margins to be better than the first half. This is driven by our expectation that Q1 will be the most pressured quarter of the year. Q1 is expected to have the highest inflation rate of the year and benefit the least from pricing. 
At the same time, we have planned strong investments behind A&P and innovation for the first quarter. As the year progresses, we expect margins to improve as the inflation rate decelerates and the impacts of our margin lever actions take hold. As you heard Sean discussed, we also plan to continue maintaining strong brand-building support throughout the year to sustain the long-term health of the business. 
Turning to Slide 42. I think it's important to highlight that we expect the actions we are taking in fiscal '22 to create some tailwinds heading into fiscal '23. As we mentioned, we expect our second half EPS to be in line with what we assume for second half EPS in our prior guidance. So as we head into fiscal '23, we expect our profitability trend to be in line with our prior expectations. We expect our brand building and innovation actions to help maintain retail demand above pre-COVID-19 levels. At the same time, we expect to retain the consumers we have attracted during the pandemic while continuing to attract more. 
Next, the pricing and productivity actions we are taking will have year-on-year -- year-over-year benefits in fiscal '23 until we lap them. We also plan to continue executing our realized productivity programs to benefit our longer-term margins. 
Finally, while we expect to have reductions in COVID-19-related costs in fiscal '22, we believe there will be additional opportunities to reduce these costs even further in fiscal '23. 
Turning to capital allocation. As noted in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has approved a 14% increase to our annual dividend, which is summarized on Slide 43. I'm pleased that our strong balance sheet and our confidence in the long-term health and profitability of the business has put us in a position to raise our quarterly dividend to $0.3125 or $1.25 on an annualized basis beginning in September. This new dividend level represents a 50% payout ratio based on our fiscal '22 EPS guidance, which is in line with our longer-term targets. 
Before I close, I also want to provide some brief color on our tax asset in the disclosure you will see in our upcoming 10-K filing. As some of you remember, when we sold our private label business in 2016, we incurred a tax capital loss of approximately $4 billion that we could apply as a carryforward to offset capital gains generated through fiscal year-end '21. We always held true to the principle that we would not divest assets solely because of the existence of the asset, but our team has repeatedly looked for opportunities to maximize the asset's use. 
Since 2016, we utilized approximately half of the asset as we divested businesses that either weren't a strategic fit with our portfolio or were valued in excess of our internal expectations by another party. We also utilized a portion of the asset in connection with the Q4 fiscal '21 restructuring of our ownership in Ardent Mills. And before year-end, when the carryforward expired, we took additional actions that we believe should allow us to utilize a portion of the remaining capital loss carryforward in future periods. 
We are currently engaged with the IRS regarding these actions and plan to continue to update our disclosure on this matter as the process unfolds. It's important to note that there is no guarantee that we will be successful in achieving this favorable treatment of the tax asset. However, if we are successful, we could have some additional opportunity for future tax efficiency as we continue to strategically manage our portfolio of brands and investments. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thanks to everyone for listening. I'll now pass it back to the operator who can open the line for questions."

We did plan for some stickiness, but as Dave said in his prepared remarks, we also plan for some erosion to creep back in as we get closer to fall. 
On elasticities, our early elasticities do look good versus our estimates. And in my mind, they're likely to be aided by the ubiquity of the price increases in the grocery store. I think you call it strength in numbers. But in addition to that, even more so by higher prices in away-from-home food, which could further help stickiness. 
On top of those factors, we expect improved supply, which is going to help our service. We have an excellent '22 innovation slate. Our '21 innovation slate still has a lot more trial yet to happen, and we will be adding back some very select and prudent promotion dollars because we have confidence that the sales they'll generate will be incremental versus not adding them back.

First of all, we have ample tools to navigate inflation and the lag to pricing is no longer than normal. On pricing, the way it works is pretty straightforward.

First of all, we have ample tools to navigate inflation and the lag to pricing is no longer than normal. On pricing, the way it works is pretty straightforward. 
First, you don't generally get a customer to accept inflation-justified pricing until they're confident it's not transitory inflation. So it's not the day it shows up. It's after it's clearly established. Once that happens, it's around 90 days before you see the impact in the P&L. And then if inflation keeps moving, and this is what we've been dealing with, you take additional waves of action and the clock starts over. 
So if you look at where we were after our Q3 call, when inflation had run up to 6%, we were still finalizing our '22 AOP and we still saw a path to our previous EPS range. But since that time, inflation accelerated further by over $250 million, and that prompted us to develop additional plans to offset the additional inflation, and we've been hustling to implement those plans. But mechanically, there is a real lag effect. And when you have multiple waves of actions, at some point, you can't offset the increasing inflation in short-term windows, at least not without doing things that would ultimately destroy shareholder value like cutting investments in the business or investments in our people. 
So overall, we feel really good about our company. Our business has been very strong across the board. We continue to lead in innovation. We've delevered as planned. We continue to raise our dividend, and our people remain highly engaged. 
Now we've got inflation. It happens. You deal with it, and we are. The team is taking, my judgment, all the right actions. And the portfolio, importantly, is better positioned to navigate this dynamic than it was previously in the years gone by. 
So the net of all of this is a temporary window of profit pressure followed by a strong rebound. And that's how these cycles work when they're managed well, and that's how it will unfold from here. And specifically, as Dave just said, as we exit the year, the run rate earnings power of the business is expected to be exactly where we thought it would be before."

So our guidance of approximately 16% is 150 basis points reduction. So if you kind of look at the key drivers, it obviously starts with inflation, which is approximately 9%. This is the estimated market inflation before coverage. So that creates about a 650 basis point headwind to operating margin. 
Our total realized productivity, which is our core productivity, our sourcing coverage, Pinnacle synergies and then the reduction of the COVID costs are over 5% of last year's COGS. So this is a tailwind to operating margin of about 400 basis points. The net impact of all of our pricing actions, mix actions is a tailwind of about 150 basis points. And this includes our pricing for the year, which is somewhere between 3% to 4%, and that's not an annualized number because of the lag, partially offset by a bit of certain increased merchandising programs and then the mix with Foodservice. 
So there's a lot in there. There's a lot of puts and takes. But in terms of our core productivity, when you include the reduction of COVID and the sourcing benefits, we're over 5% of cost of goods sold against that 9% inflation. So those are the key drivers."

So it would feel like based on the rough math that you're implying something like EBIT margins in the 14 in the first half, 17 in the second half. Does that seem about right? Is that the sort of cadence you're thinking about?"

One of the things that we've been doing for the better part of 5 years now is premiumizing the portfolio. And that is -- we historically, as many of you know, have been around for a while, had a lot of our products that were very low priced $1 or below. We've worked hard to get those price points up. It's one of the interesting things about our company in this window we're in right now is we still think our products' price points have room to move north based on the quality that we offer and the modernization that we've put into our innovation. And sometimes you need a catalyst to continue to get those price points really in sync with the value proposition that we're offering. And so the optimist in us here is actually looking at some of what we're navigating here as a positive thing because it continues to fuel our premiumization and modernization strategy, which ultimately leads to better dollar realization per unit and better margins over time."

Are you implying that there's opportunity to pull back even further on trade? Because I think a lot of us and a lot of investors, in particular, are expecting just the opposite to happen. We'll lap the period where trade was subdued and promotions were subdued and they'll come back into the system and be a net price offset. You seem to be implying the opposite is true.

I think the thing you got to do here, Jason, is we've got to double-click down on what is trade, what's within trade. Trade is kind of a catch-all term. And within that catchall basket, there, historically in our experience, had been a lot of inefficiency. And as you've seen us do over the years, we've tried to purge a lot of that inefficiency out. And then there's some stuff that is under the heading of trade that works. 
So we see both opportunities to continue to get more efficient in some of the areas that have historically been inefficient in trade, and that could be fixed cost trade. It could be unhelpful promotions. So those are things where we can continue to get more efficient. 
By the same token, there are -- as I mentioned earlier, there are some opportunities to feather back in some trade to drive incremental volume. And the operative word there being incremental. And so we're -- this is the promotional investment part of trade spend. 
So the way I think about it is this, there's good promotional investments, meaning strong IRR. And those are the ones that drive incremental sales, sales that simply would not happen, but for the promotion. Then there's bad promotion investments. And those are the ones that do not drive incremental sales but merely cannibalize higher margin base sales. 
If you think about the height of the pandemic, we sold everything we could make as base sales. So promoted sales were inherently not incremental, which is why across the industry, you saw promotions fall. 
On the other side of the pandemic, base sales start to normalize, and that does leave room for good promotional investments to drive incremental sales, and those are sales that help overall sales and profitability. So the key to being good trade managers, trade spend managers are being able to identify those buckets where there's inefficiency continue to purge that out but not be blind to opportunities to drive incremental sales and profit, the good IRR investments. And that's why you got to get into the details on this giant catch-all bucket that we all call trade."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results, our expectations for fiscal 2022 and our perspective on how the Conagra Way playbook positions us for continued success in this dynamic environment.
Slide 5 lays out the key points we're going to cover today. As you saw in our release, we reported very strong results for fiscal 2021 and we could not have done so without our people executing the Conagra Way with excellence. Their dedication enabled us to capitalize on an unprecedented time of consumer demand.
Over the last year, we acquired and retained multiple years' worth of new consumers, and we grew share across categories, all while continuing to invest in the future. This translated into strong growth across the portfolio. We saw continued strength in frozen and snacks as well as increased relevancy for our large staples business.
The work we've done modernizing and premiumizing our portfolio continues to pay off. We believe our brands are healthier than ever and well positioned to manage through the current inflationary challenges. Dave and I will both share more about our approach to managing rising input costs later in the presentation. But I can tell you now that we're taking aggressive actions on a number of fronts. It's also important to note that our plans provide for continued brand-building investments to drive consumer demand and further enhance brand health.
Our business remains very strong, but we are revising our fiscal '22 guidance to reflect the lag effect associated with the aggressive mitigating actions we are taking. Essentially, we see fiscal '22 as a tale of 2 halves with the lag effect concentrated in the first half and particularly in Q1. We expect many of our actions will start to flow through the P&L in Q2, setting up a second half adjusted EPS in line with what was assumed for H2 within our prior guidance.
Given our resiliency over the last year and the compelling consumer trends we're continuing to track, we remain confident in the underlying strength of the business and the opportunities ahead for long-term value creation. As a result, this morning, we announced a 14% increase to our annual dividend, reflecting our board's continued confidence in our outlook. Finally, we plan on hosting an investor meeting next spring to provide an update on our progress and discuss fiscal '23 and beyond. Be on the lookout for more information regarding the event. We hope you can join us.
So with that as the backdrop, let's jump into the agenda for today's call. We'll start with our business update and then cover our priorities and value creation opportunities in fiscal 2022.
As you can see on Slide 7, we ended fiscal 2021 with a strong fourth quarter that was in line with our guidance. As you know, our Q4 growth rates were impacted by the unprecedented demand we experienced in 2020 when at-home food consumption surged due to the onset of the pandemic and organic net sales increased 21.5%. Given this dynamic, we'll reference some 2-year figures throughout today's presentation to provide more helpful context on the underlying strength and trajectory of the business.
And as you can see, on a 2-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the fourth quarter increased by more than 4% and our 2-year adjusted EPS grew by more than 22%. On a full year basis, our organic net sales, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS were all up materially versus fiscal 2020. Continued execution of the Conagra Way playbook served as the foundation for our strong fiscal 2021 performance.
Within our industry, success is defined by creating meaningful and lasting connections between consumers and brands. We believe that our playbook is the most effective framework for delivering on that objective.
Our modern approach to brand building is based on 3 tenets. First, it all starts with developing superior products through perpetual modernization. Second, we ensure physical availability of our items, both in-store and online. And third, we drive mental availability of our products to ensure we remain salient and relevant with consumers.
The foundation of the Conagra Way to brand building is our people. Our exceptional results this past fiscal year reflect our team's dedication to executing the Conagra Way each and every day.
I would like to pause and say a heartfelt thank you to Conagra's amazing team for rising to the occasion to support each other, our business, our communities, our customers and our consumers. I'm extremely proud of the team's resilience in responding to the volatile environment throughout the year. We know our long-term performance is a function of the caliber and engagement of our team. That's why we're continuing to invest in our current employees and keeping the door open to talented new additions.
In fiscal '21, our team's engagement was clearly evident in their intense focus on capturing opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, the pandemic created a unique environment for new consumer acquisition, and we were able to capitalize by having modern products available when and where consumers wanted them. We estimate that over the course of the last fiscal year, we gained the equivalent of more than 4 years' worth of incremental new buyers. COVID effectively amplified new product trial at a level rarely seen in our industry.
In the chart on the left, on Slide 10, you can see the increase in household penetration across our portfolio during fiscal 2021, clear evidence of the magnitude of our new consumer acquisition. But what's even more encouraging is the chart on the right. We didn't just acquire new consumers. We kept them. The data shows that our new consumers discovered the tremendous value proposition our portfolio provides, and we're proud that our products are repeatedly appearing in pantries and freezers across America.
Importantly, our performance over the last year was not only strong in the absolute, it was strong relative to the competition. We performed better than our peers in terms of household penetration and repeat rates and we continued to gain share. Keep in mind that we delivered these results despite hitting an upper control limit on the amount of product we could produce in certain categories. If we had additional capacity, these numbers would likely be even more impressive.
Our disciplined approach to modernization and innovation across our product portfolio is key to our success. As you can see on Slide 11, we delivered an impressive innovation slate in fiscal '21. Our performance on innovation launched and sold in fiscal '21 surpassed the record performance we set in fiscal '20. And importantly, our innovation outperformed the competition. This strong outperformance is why even during the height of the pandemic, customers continued to ask for our new products. This is a clear testament to the innovation engine at Conagra and the solid reputation we built with customers and consumers.
Slide 12 highlights a handful of our important launches in fiscal '21. We continued our successful Gardein co-branding strategy with the launch of Marie Callender's pot pie with Gardein protein. We continued to modernize and premiumize Birds Eye with the launch of vegetable bakes that are as good as any side dish you can order from a Chicago steakhouse.
We began modernizing the Hungry-Man brand with the launch of the Double Meat platform that satisfies the hungriest of appetites. We also continued to work on Duncan Hines with the Instagrammable EPIC line of baking kits along with our keto-friendly mixes. And we found even more ways to keep evolving our Healthy Choice Power Bowls with the launch of these vegetarian and vegan options.
I'm particularly excited about the Birds Eye breaded vegetables platform we launched in fiscal '21. It's already started to take off with 3 of the cauliflower wings products being among the best-selling SKUs in the frozen vegetable category this year. If you haven't tried them, you're missing out. We supported the launch with a robust advertising campaign to drive awareness and mental availability. This campaign included digital, social and TV advertising.
In addition to mental availability, we remain focused on the physical availability of our products in Q4, whether through brick-and-mortar or online. Slide 14 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce have continued to yield results. Growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business continued in fiscal 2021, both against our peers and as a percentage of our overall retail sales. We consistently outpaced the entire total edible category in terms of e-commerce retail sales growth during the year. E-commerce sales now represent nearly 8% of our total retail sales.
And importantly, our success in fiscal 2021 was broad-based. Just take a look at Slide 15. Total Conagra retail sales grew an impressive 11.7% on a 2-year basis in the fourth quarter with contributions from each of our retail domains. On a 2-year basis, we delivered double-digit growth rates in retail sales across our frozen and snacking domains and a solid 5.2% growth rate in staples.
Let's dig into each domain a bit more, and let's start with frozen on Slide 16. Over the last 2 years, our frozen retail sales have surged across desserts, single-serve meals and multi-serve meals. We've also seen consistent growth in retail sales of frozen vegetables. All in, our strategic frozen business grew 13.5% over the 2-year period ending in fiscal 2021. And importantly, our buyers repeatedly returned to our frozen products. As you can see on Slide 17, consumer repeat rates for our leading frozen brands have been stronger than for the competition.
Turning to Slide 18. Our snacks business has seen similar success, delivering strong 2-year retail sales growth of 21% in fiscal '21, led by increases of more than 25% across hot cocoa, microwave popcorn, ready-to-eat pudding and meat snacks. As with frozen, consumer repeat rates for a number of our leading snack brands beat those of competition during the fiscal year.
Staples was also a meaningful contributor to our success. On Slide 20, you can see the strength of our staples portfolio. Staples retail sales increased 5.2% over the past 2 years, spurred by steady growth across key staples categories. Having increasingly rediscovered the joys of cooking last year, consumers reengaged with our staples products in a meaningful way.
As you can see on Slide 21, the solid performance from staples was not isolated. We saw strong 2-year growth rates across many of our largest staples brands. Overall, we're pleased by the performance across our retail business, both within the quarter and over the fiscal year. And as fiscal '22 begins, we believe our branded portfolio is stronger than ever.
So let's talk about what we see looking ahead. We have a unique opportunity in fiscal '22 to leverage our current momentum and maximize long-term value-creation potential. New behaviors and habits created during the pandemic resulted in an elevated and sustained level of at-home eating. Shoppers are engaging or reengaging with our products now more than ever, creating a larger, high-quality consumer base.
To sustain this engagement, we plan to continue making investments in the physical and mental availability for our products. This includes building additional capacity to fulfill consumer demand, making further strategic e-commerce investments, pursuing efficient and thoughtful marketing campaigns and introducing a robust fiscal '22 innovation slate.
As we invest in our brands to create new and stronger connections with our consumers, we will also strategically navigate the inflationary environment that accelerated quickly during Q4 and continues today. We're aggressively pulling on all our margin levers to minimize the inflation-related profit lag during the first half.
Regardless of near-term cost challenges, we plan to stay focused on the long-term priorities of our business, including continued investments to further support our brands. Our objectives are ultimately focused on driving long-term value creation achieved by pursuing growth in frozen and snacks and maintaining our staples portfolio as a reliable contributor.
Let's spend a few minutes on our fiscal '22 innovation plans for each of the domains. I'm excited to provide you a preview of what we have in store. Starting with frozen, once again, we have high expectations for our innovation slate. Slide 24 highlights some of the frozen products that will be rolled out during the year. Hungry-Man has responded very well to recent innovation. We're extending its new Double Meat platform with this Double Chicken Bowl, which is sure to satisfy any big, bold appetite.
Our broad snacks portfolio also provides us with plenty of opportunities to innovate. And here is just a sample of our fiscal '22 slate. Among the products on deck, household favorite Duncan Hines will soon be offering additional EPIC kits with versions of classic cookie mixes that combine many of the brand's delicious ingredients.
Our highly relevant staples portfolio is also receiving a new slate of innovation as shown on Slide 26. Notably, our great P.F. Chang's brand is launching a variety of new restaurant-inspired products. Also, as more consumers seek plant-based foods, Gardein continues to expand its portfolio with new offerings, including a new line of plant-based chili.
Overall, we're confident that the investments we're making in product innovations across our portfolio will produce strong ROIs. Ultimately, long-term brand health is dependent on the type of perpetual modernization that we're committed to here at Conagra.
Before I turn things over to Dave to walk you through the financials, I want to quickly touch on our thoughts around inflation and our updated guidance for fiscal 2022. Dave will discuss the cost environment in more detail, but I want to reinforce that we are aggressively pulling on all of our levers to navigate the current inflationary environment.
We began executing our aggressive response plan in fiscal 2021, given the inflation we were already seeing and talking to you about in Q3. The incremental inflation that arose as Q4 unfolded called for additional actions, and you can be assured that we've begun to respond accordingly.
As I've shared in my remarks, we're also not pulling back from investing in the business. We remain squarely focused on long-term value creation. But I also know that a more short-term focused question on all of your minds is, will Conagra take list pricing increases? And the short answer is yes.
In fact, we began implementing pricing actions on some of our products in the fourth quarter related to the initial inflation we experienced. The very early read on the data from those actions is that our elasticities look good so far, and we have more pricing coming. Because our pricing is being implemented strategically and thoughtfully, we're cautiously optimistic that our elasticities will remain strong as our full array of pricing enters the market in fiscal '22.
As I mentioned last quarter and earlier in my presentation, we expect the negative impact of the cost inflation to hit our financials before the beneficial impact of our responsive actions, including our pricing. This timing mismatch is expected to be particularly impactful in H1 and more specifically in Q1. The resulting pressure on our first half margins impact our full year profit.
And as you saw in the release, we're updating our fiscal '22 guidance as a result. Organic net sales growth is expected to be roughly flat to fiscal '21. This results in a CAGR over the 3 years ending fiscal '22 of approximately 3.5% compared to our original target of 1% to 2%. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 16%, and adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $2.50.
Although the substantial increase in inflation over the last few months has negatively impacted our profit guidance for the year, we remain confident in the underlying strength of the business. Even with the lag effect I've discussed, our full year guidance delivers significant improvements compared to our fiscal '19 starting point.
Importantly, we expect that the impacts of our aggressive mitigating actions will cause second half adjusted EPS to rebound to be in line with what was assumed for H2 within our prior guidance. We're excited about the path the business is on, and we're ready for another dynamic year ahead.
Thanks for your time, everyone. Dave, over to you."
26893,717840758,2344038,"Conagra Brands, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 13, 2021",2021-07-13,"Earnings Calls","Conagra Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some highlights from the quarter and full year fiscal '21, which are shown on Slide 30. Before we get into the details, a reminder that our year-over-year results for the fourth quarter reflect the",2552,"Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some highlights from the quarter and full year fiscal '21, which are shown on Slide 30. Before we get into the details, a reminder that our year-over-year results for the fourth quarter reflect the lapping of the onset of the pandemic in March, April and May of fiscal '20 and the unprecedented surge in consumer demand during that time. Additionally, our Q4 fiscal '20 included a 53rd week, which also impacts comparisons to the year ago period.
Overall, we are pleased with our performance as our results for the quarter were in line with our expectations. We delivered strong growth for the full fiscal year, including a 5.1% increase in organic net sales; adjusted operating profit of nearly $2 billion, up 7.4% versus fiscal '20; and operating margin of 17.5% for the year, an increase of more than 100 basis points versus fiscal '20; an adjusted EBITDA increase of 6.5%; and adjusted EPS growth of 15.8% for the year.
Turning to Slide 31. You can see the net sales bridge for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our 10.1% decrease in organic net sales during the quarter was driven by a 12.8% decline in volume due to the comparison to last year's demand surge. The impact of the volume decline was partially offset by a 2.7% benefit from favorable mix and the initial pricing actions we took in response to the elevated inflationary environment, which I will describe in further detail shortly.
Divestitures drove a 150 basis point decline to net sales for the quarter, and we faced an additional headwind of 560 basis points from the lapping of last year's 53rd week. Finally, we experienced a 50 basis point benefit from foreign exchange during the quarter. Combined, these factors drove a 16.7% decline in net sales for the quarter compared to a year ago.
The bottom half of the slide highlights the drivers of our net sales growth for full year fiscal '21 versus the prior year with an increase in organic net sales of over 5% driven by volume growth and favorable price mix actions.
Slide 32 outlines our net sales summary by segment. In the fourth quarter, net sales in our 3 retail segments declined on both a reported and organic basis due to lapping last year's surge in demand. Conversely, our Foodservice segment grew considerably this quarter as restaurant traffic began to recover. For the full fiscal year, the strong performance in our 3 retail segments during the first 3 quarters of the year more than offset the decline in Q4, while our Foodservice segment was negatively impacted by reduced demand for away-from-home eating for most of the year.
Slide 33 shows the puts and takes of our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin. As you can see, our team did a great job pulling on our margin levers in the quarter, including taking price increases in several retail categories driving favorable mix throughout the portfolio, capturing $20 million of synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition, managing our COVID-19-related costs, which were $36 million in the quarter and continuing to drive strong supply chain productivity.
Despite these efforts, however, we were unable to fully offset cost of goods sold inflation in the quarter. COGS inflation continued to accelerate as the quarter progressed, ultimately landing at 8.6%, which was above the Q4 expectations we shared at the end of Q3. We also increased our A&P by 27% in the quarter as we continue to identify opportunities for strong ROIs on these investments, particularly within e-commerce.
Finally, SG&A was a slight margin headwind in the quarter as SG&A dollars decreased at a lower rate than our reported net sales. Cost control and a disciplined approach to SG&A remain a hallmark of our culture here at Conagra.
On Slide 34, we detail the operating profit and margin for our segments for the quarter and the full year. Each of our 3 retail segments declined versus last year's fourth quarter, driven by the lapping of last year's surge in demand and 53rd week as well as increased cost of goods sold inflation. However, each retail segment reported higher adjusted operating profit than the fourth quarter of fiscal '19, demonstrating the sustained progress we have made.
As I noted earlier, our adjusted EPS of $0.54 was in line with our expectations despite higher-than-expected inflation. The decline in adjusted operating profit and the impact of last year's 53rd week affected our results by $0.23 and $0.05, respectively, shown here on Slide 35. These headwinds were partially offset by strong performance from our Ardent Mills joint venture, lower net interest expense and a slightly lower average diluted share count resulting from our Q3 share repurchase.
Slide 36 summarizes our net debt at fiscal year-end and EBITDA and cash flow performance for the fiscal year. We ended the year with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.6x, which is in line with our fiscal '21 target. We took advantage of our strong balance sheet throughout the year to increase our investment in the business and return capital to shareholders.
During fiscal '21, we increased CapEx by more than $130 million compared to the prior year and funded important capacity and productivity projects. We also repurchased nearly $300 million worth of shares and paid $475 million in dividends in fiscal '21.
As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we closed the sale of our Egg Beaters liquid egg business at the end of the fourth quarter. Given the timing of the closure, this sale had a minimal impact on our Q4 results, but we expect there to be an annualized net sales impact of roughly $40 million going forward. This will primarily be reflected in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment with small effects on our International and Foodservice segments. We estimate that the sale will have a total annualized impact on our EPS of approximately $0.01.
As Sean mentioned, we are pleased with our current position in the market and are confident in our ability to continue executing the Conagra Way to drive profitable growth as we look ahead. However, we have experienced an acceleration of inflation since Q3. And due to the timing lag between when this inflation hits our P&L and when the benefits of our pricing and productivity actions take effect, we do not expect to fully offset the impact of these cost increases in time to meet our prior fiscal '22 EPS projections. We do expect, however, second half fiscal '22 EPS to be in line with what we assumed for the second half in our prior guidance. We are therefore updating our guidance as shown on Slide 37.
For fiscal '22, we now expect organic net sales growth approximately flat to fiscal '21, adjusted operating margin of approximately 16% and adjusted EPS of approximately $2.50. While this guidance is our best estimate of how we will perform in fiscal '22, our ultimate performance will be highly dependent on 4 critical factors: first, how consumers purchase food as restaurants, offices and schools continue to reopen; second, the level of inflation we ultimately experience; third, the elasticity impact as consumers respond to higher prices; and finally, the ability of our end-to-end supply chain to continue to operate effectively.
Slide 38 shows the progression of our fiscal '22 inflation expectations, the continued acceleration being the biggest driver of the change in our guidance. When we initially gave our fiscal '22 targets at our Investor Day in April of 2019, our models assumed an annual inflation rate of around 3%. At the time of our third quarter call in April of 2021, we expected fiscal '22 inflation to come in at twice that level around 6%.
Importantly, as of the Q3 call, we still saw a path to deliver our fiscal '22 targets. Not only is our brand health strong as evidenced by the strong consumer demand, we know how to pull on all margin levers. That said, there is a limit to how much cost increase we can absorb in the short term given the timing lag that Sean and I have discussed.
And as all of you know, inflation has continued to rise sharply since April. We now currently expect fiscal '22 inflation to come in around 9%. The difference between the 6% we expected a few months ago and the 9% we expect today equates to approximately $255 million in additional costs during fiscal '22.
The bulk of this inflation can be attributed to continued increases in the cost of edible fats and oils, proteins, packaging and transportation since the timing of our Q3 call. While we are able to hedge some of our inputs, others, particularly certain proteins, are not easily hedged.
As Sean mentioned, we have various levers at our disposal that we are actively and strategically pulling to manage this inflation, but the profit lag effect is real. For example, certain pricing actions can take 90 days to enact or a cost savings initiative may not be actionable until later in the year when a contract is up for review.
So while we anticipate being able to successfully manage inflation over time, the continued sharp increases to input costs we are currently experiencing will take some time to overcome. And given our disciplined approach to managing the business for the long term, we will not reduce investments to meet the guidance target at the expense of the long-term health of our business.
Slide 40 lays out the change in our adjusted EPS expectations in a bit more detail. We are updating our fiscal '22 adjusted EPS guidance for 3 items. First, consistent with our prior divestitures, we are removing $0.01 for the Egg Beaters divestiture that we announced today. Second, the largest driver of the change is the significant $0.41 per share increase in inflation since Q3 that I just discussed.
And finally, we have identified many ways to manage and offset this increased inflation, including additional productivity and cost savings initiatives as well as substantial pricing actions that Sean and I have discussed. Again, the bulk of these margin offsets will start to hit our P&L in the second quarter and continue to increase in the second half, which is why we expect second half EPS to be in line with what we assumed for second half EPS in our prior fiscal '22 guidance.
Slide 41 lays out some of the key assumptions that underlie our fiscal '22 expectations. On the top line, we expect organic net sales growth to be stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first. We expect children to return to in-person schooling and more employees to start returning to in-office work in the fall. So while we expect continued strong demand for our products, we also expect COVID-19-related volume benefits to start to slow at the end of our first quarter.
Additionally, we have good acceptance from customers on our pricing actions so far, but we expect the majority of our pricing to start hitting the market at the end of Q1. We expect the timing of the scale-up to benefit the second half.
We also expect our second half operating margins to be better than the first half. This is driven by our expectation that Q1 will be the most pressured quarter of the year. Q1 is expected to have the highest inflation rate of the year and benefit the least from pricing.
At the same time, we have planned strong investments behind A&P and innovation for the first quarter. As the year progresses, we expect margins to improve as the inflation rate decelerates and the impacts of our margin lever actions take hold. As you heard Sean discussed, we also plan to continue maintaining strong brand-building support throughout the year to sustain the long-term health of the business.
Turning to Slide 42. I think it's important to highlight that we expect the actions we are taking in fiscal '22 to create some tailwinds heading into fiscal '23. As we mentioned, we expect our second half EPS to be in line with what we assume for second half EPS in our prior guidance.
So as we head into fiscal '23, we expect our profitability trend to be in line with our prior expectations. We expect our brand building and innovation actions to help maintain retail demand above pre-COVID-19 levels. At the same time, we expect to retain the consumers we have attracted during the pandemic while continuing to attract more.
Next, the pricing and productivity actions we are taking will have year-on-year -- year-over-year benefits in fiscal '23 until we lap them. We also plan to continue executing our realized productivity programs to benefit our longer-term margins.
Finally, while we expect to have reductions in COVID-19-related costs in fiscal '22, we believe there will be additional opportunities to reduce these costs even further in fiscal '23.
Turning to capital allocation. As noted in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has approved a 14% increase to our annual dividend, which is summarized on Slide 43. I'm pleased that our strong balance sheet and our confidence in the long-term health and profitability of the business has put us in a position to raise our quarterly dividend to $0.3125 or $1.25 on an annualized basis beginning in September. This new dividend level represents a 50% payout ratio based on our fiscal '22 EPS guidance, which is in line with our longer-term targets.
Before I close, I also want to provide some brief color on our tax asset in the disclosure you will see in our upcoming 10-K filing. As some of you remember, when we sold our private label business in 2016, we incurred a tax capital loss of approximately $4 billion that we could apply as a carryforward to offset capital gains generated through fiscal year-end '21. We always held true to the principle that we would not divest assets solely because of the existence of the asset, but our team has repeatedly looked for opportunities to maximize the asset's use.
Since 2016, we utilized approximately half of the asset as we divested businesses that either weren't a strategic fit with our portfolio or were valued in excess of our internal expectations by another party. We also utilized a portion of the asset in connection with the Q4 fiscal '21 restructuring of our ownership in Ardent Mills. And before year-end, when the carryforward expired, we took additional actions that we believe should allow us to utilize a portion of the remaining capital loss carryforward in future periods.
We are currently engaged with the IRS regarding these actions and plan to continue to update our disclosure on this matter as the process unfolds. It's important to note that there is no guarantee that we will be successful in achieving this favorable treatment of the tax asset. However, if we are successful, we could have some additional opportunity for future tax efficiency as we continue to strategically manage our portfolio of brands and investments.
That concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thanks to everyone for listening. I'll now pass it back to the operator who can open the line for questions."

And what I can tell you is, overall, we think our sales outlook is a prudent guide based on prudent assumptions, particularly around stickiness and elasticities. We did plan for some stickiness, but as Dave said in his prepared remarks, we also plan for some erosion to creep back in as we get closer to fall.
On elasticities, our early elasticities do look good versus our estimates. And in my mind, they're likely to be aided by the ubiquity of the price increases in the grocery store. I think you call it strength in numbers, but in addition to that, even more so by higher prices in away-from-home food, which could further help stickiness.
On top of those factors, we expect improved supply, which is going to help our service. We have an excellent '22 innovation slate. Our '21 innovation slate still has a lot more trial yet to happen, and we will be adding back some very select and prudent promotion dollars because we have confidence that the sales they'll generate will be incremental versus not adding them back. So overall, we like where we sit at the top line."

First of all, we have ample tools to navigate inflation and the lag to pricing is no longer than normal. On pricing, the way it works is pretty straightforward.
First, you don't generally get a customer to accept inflation-justified pricing until they're confident it's not transitory inflation. So it's not the day it shows up. It's after it's clearly established. Once that happens, it's around 90 days before you see the impact in the P&L. And then if inflation keeps moving, and this is what we've been dealing with, you take additional waves of action and the clock starts over.
So if you look at where we were after our Q3 call, when inflation had run up to 6%, we were still finalizing our '22 AOP and we still saw a path to our previous EPS range. But since that time, inflation accelerated further by over $250 million, and that prompted us to develop additional plans to offset the additional inflation, and we've been hustling to implement those plans.
But mechanically, there is a real lag effect. And when you have multiple waves of actions, at some point, you can't offset the increasing inflation in short-term windows, at least not without doing things that would ultimately destroy shareholder value like cutting investments in the business or investments in our people.
So overall, we feel really good about our company. Our business has been very strong across the board. We continue to lead in innovation. We've delevered as planned. We continue to raise our dividend and our people remain highly engaged.
Now we've got inflation. It happens. You deal with it, and we are. The team is taking, my judgment, all the right actions. And the portfolio, importantly, is better positioned to navigate this dynamic than it was previously in the years gone by.
So the net of all of this is a temporary window of profit pressure followed by a strong rebound. And that's how these cycles work when they're managed well, and that's how it will unfold from here. And specifically, as Dave just said, as we exit the year, the run rate earnings power of the business is expected to be exactly where we thought it would be before."

So our guidance of approximately 16% is 150 basis points reduction. So if you kind of look at the key drivers, it obviously starts with inflation, which is approximately 9%. This is the estimated market inflation before coverage. So that creates about a 650 basis point headwind to operating margin.
Our total realized productivity, which is our core productivity, our sourcing coverage, Pinnacle synergies and then the reduction of the COVID costs are over 5% of last year's COGS. So this is a tailwind to operating margin of about 400 basis points. The net impact of all of our pricing actions, mix actions is a tailwind of about 150 basis points. And this includes our pricing for the year, which is somewhere between 3% to 4%, and that's not an annualized number because of the lag, partially offset by a bit of certain increased merchandising programs and then the mix with Foodservice.
So there's a lot in there. There's a lot of puts and takes. But in terms of our core productivity, when you include the reduction of COVID and the sourcing benefits, we're over 5% of cost of goods sold against that 9% inflation. So those are the key drivers."

One of the things that we've been doing for the better part of 5 years now is premiumizing the portfolio.

It's one of the interesting things about our company in this window we're in right now is we still think our products' price points have room to move north based on the quality that we offer and the modernization that we've put into our innovation. And sometimes you need a catalyst to continue to get those price points really in sync with the value proposition that we're offering.
And so the optimist in us here is actually looking at some of what we're navigating here as a positive thing because it continues to fuel our premiumization and modernization strategy, which ultimately leads to better dollar realization per unit and better margins over time."

Are you implying that there's opportunity to pull back even further on trade? Because I think a lot of us and a lot of investors, in particular, are expecting just the opposite to happen.

I think the thing you got to do here, Jason, is we've got to double-click down on what is trade, what's within trade. Trade is kind of a catchall term. And within that catchall basket, there, historically in our experience, had been a lot of inefficiency. And as you've seen us do over the years, we've tried to purge a lot of that inefficiency out. And then there's some stuff that is under the heading of trade that works.
So we see both opportunities to continue to get more efficient in some of the areas that have historically been inefficient in trade, and that could be fixed cost trade. It could be unhelpful promotions. So those are things where we can continue to get more efficient.
By the same token, there are -- as I mentioned earlier, there are some opportunities to feather back in some trade to drive incremental volume, and the operative word there being incremental. And so we're -- this is the promotional investment part of trade spend.
So the way I think about it is this, there's good promotional investments, meaning strong IRR. And those are the ones that drive incremental sales, sales that simply would not happen but for the promotion. Then there's bad promotion investments. And those are the ones that do not drive incremental sales but merely cannibalize higher margin base sales.
If you think about the height of the pandemic, we sold everything we could make as base sales. So promoted sales were inherently not incremental, which is why across the industry, you saw promotions fall.
On the other side of the pandemic, base sales start to normalize, and that does leave room for good promotional investments to drive incremental sales and those are sales that help overall sales and profitability. So the key to being good trade managers, trade spend managers are being able to identify those buckets where there's inefficiency, continue to purge that out but not be blind to opportunities to drive incremental sales and profit, the good IRR investments. And that's why you got to get into the details on this giant catchall bucket that we all call trade."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our results for the quarter, our updated outlook for the remainder of the year and why we believe that Conagra continues to be well positioned for the future. 
Slide 5 lays out our key messages for today. First, as everyone is aware, the external environment is incredibly dynamic right now, and we see many of these challenges persisting. But despite the complex operating situation, the ongoing dedication, resilience and agility of our team enabled us to deliver solid Q1 results on the back of strong sales. We continue to benefit from our proven approach to brand building and the breadth of investments we're making to increase consumer demand. These efforts drive brand health, which is evidenced by the continued strength of our sales, share and repeat rates across the portfolio. As a result, we believe our brands are well positioned to continue managing through the current inflationary challenges and support ongoing inflation-justified pricing actions.
Looking ahead, we're reaffirming our EPS outlook for the year. However, we now see a slightly different path to achieving that EPS. We expect inflation to be higher than originally forecasted but we also see continued strength in consumer demand even above our original expectations. We believe that consumer demand, coupled with additional pricing and cost-saving actions will enable us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of about $2.50.
So with that as the backdrop, let's jump right in. We know that our long-term performance is a function of the caliber and engagement of our team, and that has never been more true than today. I'm extremely proud of the team's resilience and agility in adapting to the dynamic environment we're currently experiencing. As a result of our team's continued hard work and dedication, we've been able to successfully execute through sustained elevated demand and challenging supply conditions.
First, as we've already mentioned, consumer demand has remained at higher levels than we expected due to macro forces as well as the unique position of our portfolio. This is a great problem to have, but it increases the demands on our supply chain at a time when the industry is navigating labor shortages, material supply issues and transportation cost and congestion challenges. Taken together, these factors created an upper control limit on the amount of product we could produce and ship in Q1. If we had the capacity to meet all of the demand, our numbers would likely have been even more impressive. However, our ability to deliver solid results amid this dynamic environment is a testament to our team's ongoing commitment to executing the Conagra Way playbook each and every day.
The Conagra Way playbook to portfolio modernization remains our North Star in any operating environment. Regardless of the external factors that may influence short-term demand and supply dynamics in any given quarter, we define long-term success as creating meaningful and lasting connections between consumers and our brands. We believe that our playbook is the most effective framework for delivering on that objective. Those of you who have followed us for a while will recall that our modern approach to brand building is more comprehensive than legacy industry practices. Instead of anchoring our brand building predominantly in broadcast advertising that pushes new messages on old products, we anchor our investments and our efforts first in developing new modern and superior items.
Then once we've created these more modern and provocative products, we invest to drive the physical availability of those items in-store and online. And finally, our investments to drive meaningful one-to-one communication to the right consumers at the right time, at the right place, enable us to remain salient and relevant. This comprehensive approach and unwavering commitment to modernizing and premiumizing our portfolio continues to pay off and enables us to better manage our brands within any environment.
And as you can see on Slide 8, our team delivered solid results during the first quarter. As you know, our year-over-year growth rates were impacted by the elevated demand we experienced during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 when we were still in the early months of the pandemic. Given this dynamic, we'll reference some 2-year figures throughout today's presentation to provide more helpful context of what we believe is the underlying strength and trajectory of the business.
As you can see, on a 2-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the first quarter increased 7% and adjusted EPS grew by nearly 8%. Importantly, our solid performance in the first quarter was broad based. Just take a look at Slide 9. Total Conagra weighted dollar share grew 0.8 points on a 2-year basis in the quarter with share gains in each of our domestic retail domains, frozen, snacks and staples. Innovation remained a key to our success across the portfolio in Q1.
Slide 10 highlights the impact of our disciplined approach to delivering new products and modernizing our portfolio. During the first quarter, our innovation outperformed the strong results we delivered in the year ago period. This reflects not only the quality of the products launched, but also our efforts to support those launches with investments and capabilities that deliver deeper, more meaningful consumer connections. And as you can see, our innovation rose to the top of the pack in several key categories, including snacks, sweet treats, frozen vegetables and frozen meals.
Our performance is a clear testament to the innovation and marketing engine at Conagra, and we believe the solid reputation we've built with customers and consumers. In addition to developing superior products, we also remain focused on physical availability during the first quarter through both brick and mortar and online.
Slide 11 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce continued to yield strong results. Once again, we delivered quarterly growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business, both against our peers and as a percentage of our overall retail sales. We outpaced the entire total edible category in terms of e-commerce retail sales growth during the first quarter, just as we did throughout fiscal 2021. E-commerce sales now represent more than 9% of our total retail sales more than double what they were just 2 years ago.
As we mentioned earlier, our solid top line performance during the first quarter was driven by strong demand, robust brand-building investments and inflation-justified pricing actions. Slide 12 details the extent of our pricing actions to date. A few key points to keep in mind. First, we began implementing actions on some of our domestic retail products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 in response to the inflation we began to experience last fiscal year. The majority of our domestic retail pricing actions, however, just started to hit the market at the end of Q1 in response to the inflation we spoke to you about on our Q4 earnings call in July. As a result, the benefit in the quarter is less than what we expect to see going forward.
You can see this playing out in the consumption data from the last 4 weeks, all of which are part of our fiscal second quarter. During this period, our on-shelf prices rose across all 3 domestic retail domains. Looking ahead, our original plans for the year included additional inflation-justified pricing in future periods. Given the heightened inflationary environment, however, we now expect to take incremental actions beyond those original plans.
Many of these actions have already been communicated to our customers and the benefits will be weighted toward the second half of the fiscal year. We'll keep you apprised, but it's important that we stress that our pricing actions are not a blunt instrument. We take a fact-based approach to pricing within the portfolio. We use a data-driven approach to elasticities and thoughtfully execute actions to align with customer windows.
As we look ahead, we remain confident in the fiscal 2022 EPS guidance we outlined on the fourth quarter call, but we now expect to take a different path to achieving that guidance. As mentioned, we now expect inflation to be higher than originally forecasted. However, we believe that the combination of continued strength in consumer demand, incremental inflation-justified pricing and additional cost savings actions will enable us to offset the impact of that inflation.
I'd like to briefly unpack these factors, starting with the update to our inflation expectations. As you can see on Slide 14, we currently expect gross inflation to be approximately 11% for fiscal 2022 compared to the approximately 9% we anticipated at the time of our fourth quarter call. The bulk of the incremental inflation can be attributed to continued increases in the cost of proteins, edible fats and oils, grains and steel cans since our Q4 call. I want to emphasize that this is our best current estimate of gross inflation for the full year and does not account for the impact of supply chain productivity improvements or hedging. Dave will provide more color on inflation and the various levers we're able to pull to help offset its impact.
Even in the face of this acutely inflationary environment, we remain squarely focused on continuing to invest in our brands and capturing the strong consumer demand. And we're pleased to share that the consumer demand we experienced during the first quarter exceeded our prior expectations. As you can see on Slide 15, our total company retail sales on a 2-year CAGR basis were up nearly 7% in the first quarter with strong growth across our frozen, snacks and staples domains. And when you peel back the onion further you find even more evidence to underscore the durable strength of our top line performance.
The chart on the left side of Slide 16 demonstrates that we continue to grow our household penetration during the first quarter building upon the significant new consumer acquisition we've achieved over the past 1.5 years. But what I believe is even more encouraging is the chart on the right. We didn't just acquire new consumers, we kept them. The data shows growth in repeat rates that demonstrates our new consumers discovered the incredible products and tremendous value proposition of our portfolio. We're proud that our products are resonating with consumers and that those shoppers keep coming back for more. Importantly, our performance on these metrics, household penetration and repeat rates has not only been strong in the absolute but relative to the competition as well.
We're also encouraged by the elasticity of demand for our portfolio, which has been better than previously expected. Slide 17 demonstrates that our pricing actions to date have had limited impact on demand. As I mentioned, most of our pricing actions taken to date began to appear on shelf at the end of Q1. And you can see how that dynamic is being reflected in the data for September, which is part of our second quarter. We continue to be cautiously optimistic that our elasticities will remain favorable as the full array of pricing enters the market. As evidenced by our strong penetration and repeat rates, a growing number of consumers have clearly discovered the convenience and value that our retail portfolio provides.
Taken together, the net result of these factors I just detailed is the reaffirmation of our EPS guidance and margin and a few updates on how we expect to get there. We're increasing our organic net sales guidance to be approximately plus 1% up from approximately flat at the time of our Q4 call. We are reaffirming our adjusted operating margin guidance to remain at approximately 16%. We're updating our gross inflation guidance to about 11%, and we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $2.50.
Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to briefly reinforce some of the longer-term tailwinds we believe will benefit us for years to come. This includes enduring trends that predate the COVID-19 pandemic and new consumer behaviors adopted over the past 18 months. As a reminder, we have a proven track record of successfully attracting Millennial and Gen Z consumers at a higher rate than our categories as a whole. By attracting younger consumers now we create the groundwork for future growth. Not only do these younger generations offer the opportunity to drive lifetime value, they're larger than the Gen X generation that immediately preceded them.
Historically, younger adults have eaten at home less than older generations. The meaningful shift toward at-home eating tends to happen during the family formation years. In particular, we know that annual frozen category spend per buyer increases in households with young kids, and it increases further as the kids grow up. Importantly, almost half of Millennials have yet to begin having kids, and we fully expect their consumption of Conagra products will grow along with the growth of their families.
Another enduring trend is the growth of snacking, which has long been the fastest-growing occasion in food and shows no signs of slowing down. We have a very strong $2 billion ready-to-eat snacks business that spans multiple subcategories where we either have the fastest-growing brand, the largest brand or both. The COVID-19 pandemic has only served to accelerate these existing trends and create additional long-term growth drivers. One of the primary drivers for more at-home eating is the shifting workplace dynamics that are meaningfully changing weekday eating behavior. This includes both the contracting workforce and the rise of remote work.
As more people work from home or exit the workforce, the more likely these people are to eat at home, particularly on weekdays. Importantly, some aspects of remote workforce adoption are expected to be permanent. The way we work is changing and that's driving changes in consumer eating habits as well. More time at home also means more time devoted to preparing meals. Younger consumers are acquiring new skills and developing new food habits at a formative age. The behavioral science tells us that when people learn to cook at an early age, they continue to cook at elevated levels as they get older, and consumers of all ages are rediscovering their kitchens and cooking more at home.
Across all these long-term tailwinds, we believe our portfolio is uniquely positioned to meet the needs of today's consumers. Our frozen portfolio offers hyper convenient meals and sides perfect for the quick work lunch or family dinner. Our Snacks and Sweet Treats portfolio caters to those looking to experience bold, anytime flavors at home while enjoying time with friends and family. And our Staples portfolio offers the simple cooking aids and meal enhancers that both experienced and first-time cooks are seeking.
In summary, Conagra's portfolio has delivered against the recent behavioral shift better than the competition. And as we move beyond the pandemic and Millennials and Gen Z's continue to age, we believe that our brands are well positioned to become an even more regular part of their routines.
Now that I've highlighted our performance for the quarter and strong positioning for the future, I'll turn it over to Dave to provide more detail."
26893,1680703574,2404825,"Conagra Brands, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 07, 2021",2021-10-07,"Earnings Calls","Conagra Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everybody.

I'll start by going over some highlights from the quarter shown on Slide 21. As a reminder, our year-over-year comparisons reflect the lapping of extremely strong demand for at-home food consumption during the early months of the pandemic. For that reason, we are also including 2-year comparisons for a number of important metrics, to provide helpful context regarding the underlying health of our business.
We are pleased with the overall results of the first quarter, which, as Sean discussed, reflected our ability to successfully navigate the current dynamic environment. Organic net sales declined by 0.4% compared to a year ago and increased 7% on a 2-year CAGR. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating profit both decreased year-over-year but were flat on a 2-year basis, demonstrating our ability to offset the double-digit inflation experienced in the business during the quarter.
I also want to highlight the increase in our advertising and promotional spend on both a 1- and 2-year basis. These investments reflect our continued commitment to building and maintaining strong brands.
Turning to Slide 22. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our net sales for the quarter. On an organic net sales basis, the 0.4% decrease during the quarter was driven by a 2% decline in volume from lapping last year's elevated demand. This decline was almost entirely offset by favorable brand mix and the pricing actions we've taken to date in response to the inflationary environment.
There are 2 items I want to call out on price mix. First, as a reminder, the majority of our domestic retail pricing actions just started to hit shelves at the end of Q1. So the benefit in the quarter was limited compared to the benefits we expect to receive over the course of fiscal '22.
Second, our 1.6% benefit from price mix laps a 70 basis point benefit in the prior year period that was associated with the true-up of fiscal '20 fourth quarter trade expense accrual. Without that item, the current quarter's price mix benefit would have been plus 2.3%. Divestitures resulted in a 110 basis point decline in net sales during the quarter, and foreign exchange provided a 50 basis point benefit. Together, these factors drove a 1% decline in total Conagra net sales for the quarter compared to a year ago.
Slide 23 shows our net sales summary by segment, both on a year-over-year and a 2-year compounded basis. As you can see, we've had strong 2-year compounded net sales growth in each of our 3 retail segments with a slight decline in our Foodservice segment. Net sales for the entire company have increased 7% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Our 2-year annual sales growth rate for the domestic retail segments is tracking closely with the retail consumption growth achieved over the same period.
Turning to adjusted operating margin. Slide 24 details the puts and takes of our first quarter results. First quarter inflation was 16.6%, driving our adjusted gross margin decline of 530 basis points compared to a year ago. We delivered 550 points of benefit from our margin lever actions in the quarter, inflation-justified pricing, supply chain realized productivity, cost synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition and lower pandemic-related expenses. However, these benefits were more than offset by the very significant inflation.
Note that the 16.6% inflation shown on the slide represents gross market inflation for Q1 and does not include hedging or sourcing benefits. We capture hedging as part of our realized productivity. For the first quarter, our net inflation inclusive of hedging was high single digits.
Our Q1 adjusted operating margin was also impacted by year-over-year changes to A&P and adjusted SG&A. As I previously mentioned, we continue to increase our investments in A&P in the quarter.
The adjusted operating profit and margin by segment for the quarter are shown on Slide 25. As a reminder, we expect our first quarter this fiscal year to benefit the least from our inflation-justified pricing actions. It's also worth highlighting again that our adjusted operating profit is flat on a 2-year basis. Over a 2-year period, we have completely offset double-digit inflation while also increasing investment in the business.
As you can see on Slide 26, our Q1 adjusted EPS of $0.50 was heavily impacted by inflation as well as by a slightly higher tax rate. These headwinds were partially offset by strong performance from our Ardent Mills joint venture, lower net interest expense and a slightly lower average diluted share count due to our share repurchases during the quarter.
Turning to Slide 27. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4x, which was in line with our expectations and reflects the seasonality of the business. Our cash flow from operations and free cash flow were also both in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our CapEx increased year-over-year as we remain focused on continued capacity investments to maximize physical availability of our products. We also continued to return capital to shareholders during the first quarter. We repurchased approximately $50 million of common stock and paid approximately $132 million in cash dividends.
As a reminder, the Board of Directors approved a 14% increase to our annual dividend in July. We paid our first dividend at the increased quarterly rate of $0.3125 per share or $1.25 per share on an annualized basis shortly after the conclusion of Q1.
As we have already detailed today, we continue to experience cost of goods sold inflation at a level that is both significant and in excess of the level projected at the time of our Q4 fiscal '21 earnings call. We now expect gross cost of goods sold inflation to be approximately 11% for fiscal '22. We previously expected gross inflation of approximately 9%. This heightened inflationary pressure is coming from increases across many inputs, particularly proteins, edible fats and oils, grains and metal-based packaging. We are also seeing increasing costs in transportation given marketplace dynamics.
We have strong plans in place to mitigate the impact of this inflation. First, we will leverage sourcing and hedging. Given our sourcing and hedging positions, we only expect 2/3 of the 200 basis point increase in gross inflation to impact the fiscal '22 P&L. Regarding quarterly flow, we expect about half of the net impact from this heightened inflation to hit in the fourth quarter. We expect the other half to impact Q2 and Q3 about equally. As a reminder, the benefit of hedging actions is classified as realized productivity in our schedules.
In addition to hedging and sourcing, we expect to have a number of drivers to help offset inflation in fiscal '22. As Sean already detailed, these drivers include higher-than-expected consumer demand, lower-than-expected elasticities of demand and incremental inflation-justified pricing beyond our original plan. As Sean noted, the benefits of our incremental pricing actions will be weighted towards the second half of the fiscal year.
We are also taking additional actions to enhance supply chain productivity through the balance of fiscal '22. And as always, we will maintain a disciplined approach to cost control, which continues to be a hallmark of our culture. We now have additional cost savings actions planned beyond what was included as part of our initial guidance for the year.
In summary, we intend to leverage our full range of margin drivers to offset the impact of inflation. We expect to realize the benefits from these drivers as the year progresses with the benefits weighted towards the second half of the year. We continue to expect margins to improve sequentially over the remainder of fiscal '22.
The updated inflation expectations, the higher-than-expected consumer demand and the comprehensive actions we are taking to combat rising costs are all reflected in the updated fiscal '22 guidance we issued this morning. We remain confident in our original adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $2.50 for the year, but the path to achieve that guidance has changed. We now expect organic net sales growth of approximately 1% compared to our prior expectations of approximately flat growth. Also, we expect our adjusted operating margin to continue to be approximately 16%, but sees some modest compression versus our original forecast. We expect the increase in dollar profit from higher net sales together with incremental cost savings to offset the incremental net inflation dollars.
As I explained on last quarter's call, this guidance is our best estimate of how we will perform in fiscal '22. But our ultimate performance will be highly dependent on multiple factors, including: first, how consumers purchase food as food service establishments continue to reopen and people return to in-office work and in-person school; second, the level of inflation we ultimately experienced; third, the elasticity of demand impact as consumers respond to higher prices; and finally, the ability of our end-to-end supply chain to continue to operate effectively as the pandemic continues to evolve.
Before turning it over to the operator for Q&A. I want to reiterate Sean's comments regarding our confidence in the resiliency of our business. Our ability to deliver solid results amid such a dynamic environment reflects the continued dedication of our team as well as the strength of our brands and the Conagra Way playbook.
Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks. I'll now pass it to the operator for questions."

Well, as you're implying, with respect to supply chain, it is a daily grind. So I am incredibly appreciative and proud of our team. Clearly, when demand from consumers is this strong at the same time that the supply chain is strained, service can suffer. And to manage that to the best of our abilities and maximize our sales, we attack each of the root causes as aggressively as we can. So with respect to the labor environment, it is about recruiting as aggressively as we can and then keeping people healthy when they get in the door.
With respect to materials and ingredients, it's about keeping the pressure on suppliers and having contingencies. And with respect to logistics, it's about being as creative and aggressive as we can. And so in times like these, it does come down to agility and resilience, and that's really how our culture is wired. We talked about having a refuse to lose attitude every day. And in the end, the supply chain challenges will ultimately abate. And when they do, the fact that our consumers have such affinity for our product sets us up very well for the future. So that's really our goal is to do everything within our power to get as many boxes of our products as we can out the door to help offset some of the cost pressures.

Let me address your operating profit and margin question, Andrew. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, given the dynamic of increasing profit from our higher sales dollars offsetting the dollar impact of inflation, the math on that compresses margins a bit. So we expect higher sales at same operating profit. So our guidance on operating margin was approximately 16%. We were expecting to tip a bit above that in previous guidance. Now we're expecting to tip a bit below it, but we're still sort of guiding to approximately 16%. So that's the dynamic on your operating profit question.
As you look at the kind of the bridge to roughly how we get there, last quarter, I gave a bridge, just updating it now we expect 800 basis points of operating margin headwind from the 11% gross inflation with our inflation going up. We expect about 490 points of operating margin tailwind from the cost coming out, including our realized productivity and that includes our hedging and sourcing as well as our lower COVID costs and the Pinnacle synergies. And we expect about 190 basis points of operating margin tailwind from all of our price mix actions, including our pricing, merchandising, product and segment mix and then a little bit of a headwind on SG&A to operating margin. So that's sort of the rough bridge to get you to the little bit below 16%."

Really, the second quarter, we're going to see more of a benefit from price mix versus what we saw in the first quarter.

It will still be up, but it will be at a lower rate. But the second quarter inflation, gross inflation is going to be roughly the same. So it's going to be the increased benefit from price mix."

And on our end, when you're in a strained supply situation, we do look at promotional reductions to keep demand in check and not exacerbate supply challenges. So as we work with our retailers on some of the stuff that they like to get out on the floor during the holidays, you've got 2 aspects of those holiday promotions. You've got the location, getting it out on the floor and then you've got the amount of discount, the magnitude of the discount. Certainly, we want to help our consumers to find our product during the holidays, but the magnitude of the discount does not -- we don't need to fan the flames of supply challenges.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our results for the quarter, our updated outlook for the remainder of the year and why we believe that Conagra continues to be well positioned for the future.  
Slide 5 lays out our key messages for today. First, as everyone is aware, the external environment is incredibly dynamic right now, and we see many of these challenges persisting. But despite the complex operating situation, the ongoing dedication, resilience and agility of our team enabled us to deliver solid Q1 results on the back of strong sales. We continue to benefit from our proven approach to brand building and the breadth of investments we're making to increase consumer demand. These efforts drive brand health, which is evidenced by the continued strength of our sales, share and repeat rates across the portfolio. As a result, we believe our brands are well positioned to continue managing through the current inflationary challenges and support ongoing inflation-justified pricing actions. 
Looking ahead, we're reaffirming our EPS outlook for the year. However, we now see a slightly different path to achieving that EPS. We expect inflation to be higher than originally forecasted but we also see continued strength in consumer demand even above our original expectations. We believe that consumer demand, coupled with additional pricing and cost-saving actions, will enable us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of about $2.50. 
So with that as the backdrop, let's jump right in. We know that our long-term performance is a function of the caliber and engagement of our team, and that has never been more true than today. I'm extremely proud of the team's resilience and agility in adapting to the dynamic environment we're currently experiencing. As a result of our team's continued hard work and dedication, we've been able to successfully execute through sustained elevated demand and challenging supply conditions. 
First, as we've already mentioned, consumer demand has remained at higher levels than we expected due to macro forces as well as the unique position of our portfolio. This is a great problem to have, but it increases the demands on our supply chain at a time when the industry is navigating labor shortages, material supply issues and transportation cost and congestion challenges. Taken together, these factors created an upper control limit on the amount of product we could produce and ship in Q1. If we had the capacity to meet all of the demand, our numbers would likely have been even more impressive. However, our ability to deliver solid results amid this dynamic environment is a testament to our team's ongoing commitment to executing the Conagra Way playbook each and every day. 
The Conagra Way playbook to portfolio modernization remains our North Star in any operating environment. Regardless of the external factors that may influence short-term demand and supply dynamics in any given quarter, we define long-term success as creating meaningful and lasting connections between consumers and our brands. We believe that our playbook is the most effective framework for delivering on that objective. Those of you who have followed us for a while will recall that our modern approach to brand building is more comprehensive than legacy industry practices. Instead of anchoring our brand building predominantly in broadcast advertising that pushes new messages on old products, we anchor our investments and our efforts first in developing new modern and superior items. 
Then once we've created these more modern and provocative products, we invest to drive the physical availability of those items in-store and online. And finally, our investments to drive meaningful one-to-one communication to the right consumers at the right time, at the right place, enable us to remain salient and relevant. This comprehensive approach and unwavering commitment to modernizing and premiumizing our portfolio continues to pay off and enables us to better manage our brands within any environment. 
And as you can see on Slide 8, our team delivered solid results during the first quarter. As you know, our year-over-year growth rates were impacted by the elevated demand we experienced during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 when we were still in the early months of the pandemic. Given this dynamic, we'll reference some 2-year figures throughout today's presentation to provide more helpful context of what we believe is the underlying strength and trajectory of the business. 
As you can see, on a 2-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the first quarter increased 7% and adjusted EPS grew by nearly 8%. Importantly, our solid performance in the first quarter was broad based. Just take a look at Slide 9. Total Conagra weighted dollar share grew 0.8 points on a 2-year basis in the quarter with share gains in each of our domestic retail domains: frozen, snacks and staples. Innovation remained a key to our success across the portfolio in Q1. 
Slide 10 highlights the impact of our disciplined approach to delivering new products and modernizing our portfolio. During the first quarter, our innovation outperformed the strong results we delivered in the year-ago period. This reflects not only the quality of the products launched, but also our efforts to support those launches with investments and capabilities that deliver deeper, more meaningful consumer connections. And as you can see, our innovation rose to the top of the pack in several key categories, including snacks, sweet treats, frozen vegetables and frozen meals. 
Our performance is a clear testament to the innovation and marketing engine at Conagra, and we believe the solid reputation we've built with customers and consumers. In addition to developing superior products, we also remain focused on physical availability during the first quarter through both brick-and-mortar and online. 
Slide 11 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce continued to yield strong results. Once again, we delivered quarterly growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business, both against our peers and as a percentage of our overall retail sales. We outpaced the entire total edible category in terms of e-commerce retail sales growth during the first quarter, just as we did throughout fiscal 2021. E-commerce sales now represent more than 9% of our total retail sales, more than double what they were just 2 years ago. 
As we mentioned earlier, our solid top line performance during the first quarter was driven by strong demand, robust brand-building investments and inflation-justified pricing actions. Slide 12 details the extent of our pricing actions to date. A few key points to keep in mind. First, we began implementing actions on some of our domestic retail products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 in response to the inflation we began to experience last fiscal year. The majority of our domestic retail pricing actions, however, just started to hit the market at the end of Q1 in response to the inflation we spoke to you about on our Q4 earnings call in July. As a result, the benefit in the quarter is less than what we expect to see going forward. 
You can see this playing out in the consumption data from the last 4 weeks, all of which are part of our fiscal second quarter. During this period, our on-shelf prices rose across all 3 domestic retail domains. Looking ahead, our original plans for the year included additional inflation-justified pricing in future periods. Given the heightened inflationary environment, however, we now expect to take incremental actions beyond those original plans. 
Many of these actions have already been communicated to our customers and the benefits will be weighted toward the second half of the fiscal year. We'll keep you apprised, but it's important that we stress that our pricing actions are not a blunt instrument. We take a fact-based approach to pricing within the portfolio. We use a data-driven approach to elasticities and thoughtfully execute actions to align with customer windows. 
As we look ahead, we remain confident in the fiscal 2022 EPS guidance we outlined on the fourth quarter call, but we now expect to take a different path to achieving that guidance. As mentioned, we now expect inflation to be higher than originally forecasted. However, we believe that the combination of continued strength in consumer demand, incremental inflation-justified pricing and additional cost savings actions will enable us to offset the impact of that inflation. 
I'd like to briefly unpack these factors, starting with the update to our inflation expectations. As you can see on Slide 14, we currently expect gross inflation to be approximately 11% for fiscal 2022 compared to the approximately 9% we anticipated at the time of our fourth quarter call. The bulk of the incremental inflation can be attributed to continued increases in the cost of proteins, edible fats and oils, grains and steel cans since our Q4 call. I want to emphasize that this is our best current estimate of gross inflation for the full year and does not account for the impact of supply chain productivity improvements or hedging. Dave will provide more color on inflation and the various levers we're able to pull to help offset its impact. 
Even in the face of this acutely inflationary environment, we remain squarely focused on continuing to invest in our brands and capturing the strong consumer demand. And we're pleased to share that the consumer demand we experienced during the first quarter exceeded our prior expectations. As you can see on Slide 15, our total company retail sales on a 2-year CAGR basis were up nearly 7% in the first quarter with strong growth across our frozen, snacks and staples domains. And when you peel back the onion further you find even more evidence to underscore the durable strength of our top line performance. 
The chart on the left side of Slide 16 demonstrates that we continue to grow our household penetration during the first quarter building upon the significant new consumer acquisition we've achieved over the past 1.5 years. But what I believe is even more encouraging is the chart on the right. We didn't just acquire new consumers, we kept them. The data shows growth in repeat rates that demonstrates our new consumers discovered the incredible products and tremendous value proposition of our portfolio. We're proud that our products are resonating with consumers and that those shoppers keep coming back for more. Importantly, our performance on these metrics, household penetration and repeat rates has not only been strong in the absolute but relative to the competition as well. 
We're also encouraged by the elasticity of demand for our portfolio, which has been better than previously expected. Slide 17 demonstrates that our pricing actions to date have had limited impact on demand. As I mentioned, most of our pricing actions taken to date began to appear on shelf at the end of Q1. And you can see how that dynamic is being reflected in the data for September, which is part of our second quarter. We continue to be cautiously optimistic that our elasticities will remain favorable as the full array of pricing enters the market. As evidenced by our strong penetration and repeat rates, a growing number of consumers have clearly discovered the convenience and value that our retail portfolio provides. 
Taken together, the net result of these factors I just detailed is the reaffirmation of our EPS guidance and margin and a few updates on how we expect to get there. We're increasing our organic net sales guidance to be approximately plus 1%, up from approximately flat at the time of our Q4 call. We are reaffirming our adjusted operating margin guidance to remain at approximately 16%. We're updating our gross inflation guidance to about 11%, and we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $2.50. 
Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to briefly reinforce some of the longer-term tailwinds we believe will benefit us for years to come. This includes enduring trends that predate the COVID-19 pandemic and new consumer behaviors adopted over the past 18 months. As a reminder, we have a proven track record of successfully attracting millennial and Gen Z consumers at a higher rate than our categories as a whole. By attracting younger consumers now we create the groundwork for future growth. Not only do these younger generations offer the opportunity to drive lifetime value, they're larger than the Gen X generation that immediately preceded them. Historically, younger adults have eaten at home less than older generations. 
The meaningful shift toward at-home eating tends to happen during the family formation years. In particular, we know that annual frozen category spend per buyer increases in households with young kids, and it increases further as the kids grow up. Importantly, almost half of millennials have yet to begin having kids, and we fully expect their consumption of Conagra products will grow along with the growth of their families. 
Another enduring trend is the growth of snacking, which has long been the fastest-growing occasion in food and shows no signs of slowing down. We have a very strong $2 billion ready-to-eat snacks business that spans multiple subcategories where we either have the fastest-growing brand, the largest brand or both. The COVID-19 pandemic has only served to accelerate these existing trends and create additional long-term growth drivers. One of the primary drivers for more at-home eating is the shifting workplace dynamics that are meaningfully changing weekday eating behavior. This includes both the contracting workforce and the rise of remote work. 
As more people work from home or exit the workforce, the more likely these people are to eat at home, particularly on weekdays. Importantly, some aspects of remote workforce adoption are expected to be permanent. The way we work is changing and that's driving changes in consumer eating habits as well. More time at home also means more time devoted to preparing meals. Younger consumers are acquiring new skills and developing new food habits at a formative age. The behavioral science tells us that when people learn to cook at an early age, they continue to cook at elevated levels as they get older, and consumers of all ages are rediscovering their kitchens and cooking more at home. 
Across all these long-term tailwinds, we believe our portfolio is uniquely positioned to meet the needs of today's consumers. Our frozen portfolio offers hyper convenient meals and sides perfect for the quick work lunch or family dinner. Our snacks and sweet treats portfolio caters to those looking to experience bold, anytime flavors at home while enjoying time with friends and family. And our staples portfolio offers the simple cooking aids and meal enhancers that both experienced and first-time cooks are seeking. 
In summary, Conagra's portfolio has delivered against the recent behavioral shift better than the competition. And as we move beyond the pandemic and Millennials and Gen Z-ers continue to age, we believe that our brands are well positioned to become an even more regular part of their routines. 
Now that I've highlighted our performance for the quarter and strong positioning for the future, I'll turn it over to Dave to provide more detail."
26893,1680703574,2404859,"Conagra Brands, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Oct 07, 2021",2021-10-07,"Earnings Calls","Conagra Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everybody. I'll start by going over some highlights from the quarter shown on Slide 21.

I'll start by going over some highlights from the quarter shown on Slide 21. As a reminder, our year-over-year comparisons reflect the lapping of extremely strong demand for at-home food consumption during the early months of the pandemic. For that reason, we are also including 2-year comparisons for a number of important metrics to provide helpful context regarding the underlying health of our business. 
We are pleased with the overall results of the first quarter, which, as Sean discussed, reflected our ability to successfully navigate the current dynamic environment. Organic net sales declined by 0.4% compared to a year ago and increased 7% on a 2-year CAGR. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating profit both decreased year-over-year but were flat on a 2-year basis, demonstrating our ability to offset the double-digit inflation experienced in the business during the quarter. 
I also want to highlight the increase in our advertising and promotional spend on both a 1- and 2-year basis. These investments reflect our continued commitment to building and maintaining strong brands. 
Turning to Slide 22. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our net sales for the quarter. On an organic net sales basis, the 0.4% decrease during the quarter was driven by a 2% decline in volume from lapping last year's elevated demand. This decline was almost entirely offset by favorable brand mix and the pricing actions we've taken to date in response to the inflationary environment. 
There are 2 items I want to call out on price/mix. First, as a reminder, the majority of our domestic retail pricing actions just started to hit shelves at the end of Q1. So the benefit in the quarter was limited compared to the benefits we expect to receive over the course of fiscal '22. 
Second, our 1.6% benefit from price/mix laps a 70 basis point benefit in the prior year period that was associated with the true-up of fiscal '20 fourth quarter trade expense accrual. Without that item, the current quarter's price mix benefit would have been plus 2.3%. Divestitures resulted in a 110 basis point decline in net sales during the quarter, and foreign exchange provided a 50 basis point benefit. Together, these factors drove a 1% decline in total Conagra net sales for the quarter compared to a year ago. 
Slide 23 shows our net sales summary by segment, both on a year-over-year and a 2-year compounded basis. As you can see, we've had strong 2-year compounded net sales growth in each of our 3 retail segments with a slight decline in our Foodservice segment. Net sales for the entire company have increased 7% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Our 2-year annual sales growth rate for the domestic retail segments is tracking closely with the retail consumption growth achieved over the same period. 
Turning to adjusted operating margin. Slide 24 details the puts and takes of our first quarter results. First quarter inflation was 16.6%, driving our adjusted gross margin decline of 530 basis points compared to a year ago. We delivered 550 points of benefit from our margin lever actions in the quarter, inflation-justified pricing, supply chain realized productivity, cost synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition and lower pandemic-related expenses. However, these benefits were more than offset by the very significant inflation. 
Note that the 16.6% inflation shown on the slide represents gross market inflation for Q1 and does not include hedging or sourcing benefits. We capture hedging as part of our realized productivity. For the first quarter, our net inflation inclusive of hedging was high single digits. 
Our Q1 adjusted operating margin was also impacted by year-over-year changes to A&P and adjusted SG&A. As I previously mentioned, we continue to increase our investments in A&P in the quarter. 
The adjusted operating profit and margin by segment for the quarter are shown on Slide 25. As a reminder, we expect our first quarter this fiscal year to benefit the least from our inflation-justified pricing actions. It's also worth highlighting again that our adjusted operating profit is flat on a 2-year basis. Over a 2-year period, we have completely offset double-digit inflation while also increasing investment in the business. 
As you can see on Slide 26, our Q1 adjusted EPS of $0.50 was heavily impacted by inflation as well as by a slightly higher tax rate. These headwinds were partially offset by strong performance from our Ardent Mills joint venture, lower net interest expense and a slightly lower average diluted share count due to our share repurchases during the quarter.
Turning to Slide 27. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4x, which was in line with our expectations and reflects the seasonality of the business. Our cash flow from operations and free cash flow were also both in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our CapEx increased year-over-year as we remain focused on continued capacity investments to maximize physical availability of our products. We also continued to return capital to shareholders during the first quarter. We repurchased approximately $50 million of common stock and paid approximately $132 million in cash dividends.
As a reminder, the Board of Directors approved a 14% increase to our annual dividend in July. We paid our first dividend at the increased quarterly rate of $0.3125 per share or $1.25 per share on an annualized basis shortly after the conclusion of Q1.
As we have already detailed today, we continue to experience cost of goods sold inflation at a level that is both significant and in excess of the level projected at the time of our Q4 fiscal '21 earnings call. We now expect gross cost of goods sold inflation to be approximately 11% for fiscal '22. We previously expected gross inflation of approximately 9%. This heightened inflationary pressure is coming from increases across many inputs, particularly proteins, edible fats and oils, grains and metal-based packaging. We are also seeing increasing costs in transportation given marketplace dynamics.
We have strong plans in place to mitigate the impact of this inflation. First, we will leverage sourcing and hedging. Given our sourcing and hedging positions, we only expect 2/3 of the 200 basis point increase in gross inflation to impact the fiscal '22 P&L. Regarding quarterly flow, we expect about half of the net impact from this heightened inflation to hit in the fourth quarter. We expect the other half to impact Q2 and Q3 about equally. As a reminder, the benefit of hedging actions is classified as realized productivity in our schedules.
In addition to hedging and sourcing, we expect to have a number of drivers to help offset inflation in fiscal '22. As Sean already detailed, these drivers include higher-than-expected consumer demand, lower-than-expected elasticities of demand and incremental inflation-justified pricing beyond our original plan. As Sean noted, the benefits of our incremental pricing actions will be weighted towards the second half of the fiscal year.
We are also taking additional actions to enhance supply chain productivity through the balance of fiscal '22. And as always, we will maintain a disciplined approach to cost control, which continues to be a hallmark of our culture. We now have additional cost savings actions planned beyond what was included as part of our initial guidance for the year.
In summary, we intend to leverage our full range of margin drivers to offset the impact of inflation. We expect to realize the benefits from these drivers as the year progresses with the benefits weighted towards the second half of the year. We continue to expect margins to improve sequentially over the remainder of fiscal '22.
The updated inflation expectations, the higher-than-expected consumer demand and the comprehensive actions we are taking to combat rising costs are all reflected in the updated fiscal '22 guidance we issued this morning. We remain confident in our original adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $2.50 for the year, but the path to achieve that guidance has changed. We now expect organic net sales growth of approximately 1% compared to our prior expectations of approximately flat growth. Also, we expect our adjusted operating margin to continue to be approximately 16%, [ but sees ] some modest compression versus our original forecast. We expect the increase in dollar profit from higher net sales together with incremental cost savings to offset the incremental net inflation dollars.
As I explained on last quarter's call, this guidance is our best estimate of how we will perform in fiscal '22. But our ultimate performance will be highly dependent on multiple factors, including: first, how consumers purchase food as food service establishments continue to reopen and people return to in-office work and in-person school; second, the level of inflation we ultimately experience; third, the elasticity of demand impact as consumers respond to higher prices; and finally, the ability of our end-to-end supply chain to continue to operate effectively as the pandemic continues to evolve.
Before turning it over to the operator for Q&A, I want to reiterate Sean's comments regarding our confidence in the resiliency of our business. Our ability to deliver solid results amid such a dynamic environment reflects the continued dedication of our team as well as the strength of our brands and the Conagra Way playbook.
Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks. I'll now pass it to the operator for questions."

I guess Conagra is looking for higher sales than initially expected and sort of a similar margin for the full year. So really improved operating profit dollars. I was hoping you could provide maybe a bit more color on the sort of the key buckets and maybe quantify some of those key puts and takes for us because I guess that's where I'm getting a bit of pushback this morning in terms of the higher operating profit that you would now see in light of all these challenges.
And then secondly, just what would be the offset to the better operating profit for the full year that keeps EPS roughly in a similar place for the full year?"

Well, as you're implying, with respect to supply chain, it is a daily grind. So I am incredibly appreciative and proud of our team. Clearly, when demand from consumers is this strong at the same time that the supply chain is strained, service can suffer. And to manage that to the best of our abilities and maximize our sales, we attack each of the root causes as aggressively as we can. So with respect to the labor environment, it is about recruiting as aggressively as we can and then keeping people healthy when they get in the door.
With respect to materials and ingredients, it's about keeping the pressure on suppliers and having contingencies. And with respect to logistics, it's about being as creative and aggressive as we can. And so in times like these, it does come down to agility and resilience, and that's really how our culture is wired. We talked about having a refuse to lose attitude every day. And in the end, the supply chain challenges will ultimately abate. And when they do, the fact that our consumers have such affinity for our products sets us up very well for the future. So that's really our goal is to do everything within our power to get as many boxes of our products as we can out the door to help offset some of the cost pressures.

Let me address your operating profit and margin question, Andrew. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, given the dynamic of increasing profit from our higher sales dollars offsetting the dollar impact of inflation, the math on that compresses margins a bit. So we expect higher sales at same operating profit. So our guidance on operating margin was approximately 16%. We were expecting to tip a bit above that in previous guidance. Now we're expecting to tip a bit below it, but we're still sort of guiding to approximately 16%. So that's the dynamic on your operating profit question.
As you look at the kind of the bridge to roughly how we get there, last quarter, I gave a bridge, just updating it now. We expect 800 basis points of operating margin headwind from the 11% gross inflation with our inflation going up. We expect about 490 points of operating margin tailwind from the cost coming out, including our realized productivity and that includes our hedging and sourcing as well as our lower COVID costs and the Pinnacle synergies. And we expect about 190 basis points of operating margin tailwind from all of our price/mix actions, including our pricing, merchandising, product and segment mix and then a little bit of a headwind on SG&A to operating margin. So that's sort of the rough bridge to get you to the little bit below 16%."

It's a little difficult to get really precise with how much is hedging sourcing versus how much is just core realized productivity, there's a lot moving around. There's a little bit of overlap there as we're driving savings because of scale we have in buying a particular commodity, but then that commodity is inflating and then we're hedging it.

So that's one of the reasons we think the setup looks good as we kind of get through this. Because these cycles usually prove to be transitory in terms of rate of change. And so the fact that the pricing in a broad-based way will be in place and then the rate of change, it will abate. That is where the good setup lies."

And more specifically, like the tomato crop in California was stressed by the heat over the summer. We're hearing that there's some tightness in availability of steel cans and maybe some other produce items. So just can you just give us any color on like availability of raw materials?

The -- my earlier comments within the kind of strain, as I'll call it, within supply chain, the 3 buckets that I mentioned are labor, obviously, materials and ingredients and logistics. So we are working all 3 of those buckets aggressively every day. And there are -- periodically, you'll see a particular input that will get strained. And so we've got to go the extra mile to get our fair share of what's available, but also have contingency plans so that we can shift our mix as necessary if we have to go through a period where we get shorted on a particular ingredient, we will try to make it up with other products that we've got capacity to kind of push out the door. 
So this is why I described this as kind of a daily grind is this is a year of perseverance where we've got to make sure we are on top of what is available, get the maximum quantity we can, keep our people healthy, get the trucks to get the products to our customers and get as many boxes of our stuff out the door as we can because on the other side of that challenge is tremendously strong consumer demand, and we want to take full advantage of that because our depth of repeat helps us to capture the lifetime value of these consumers. So it's volatile. We're dealing with it. Every company in our space is dealing with it. And I think our team is doing a really good job in the face of it."

I guess as we're thinking about pricing as a function of list price increases and promotional frequency and depth. Is there more of an opportunity to take advantage of those -- not needing to promote as aggressively, I guess, in the holiday windows, just simply because demand is strong and those are periods where people are going to show up and shop anyway?

It's interesting, Bryan, somebody asked me recently, why don't customers just try to shape demand downward by taking more price than the inflation is? And my answer was, that's not the way customers tend to behave. I can't say I've ever seen a price above inflation to steer demand downward. But they have been willing to accept price increments. And on our end, when you're in a strained supply situation, we do look at promotional reductions to keep demand in check and not exacerbate supply challenges. So as we work with our retailers on some of the stuff that they like to get out on the floor during the holidays, you've got 2 aspects of those holiday promotions. You've got the location, getting it out on the floor and then you've got the amount of discount, the magnitude of the discount. Certainly, we want to help our consumers to find our product during the holidays, but the magnitude of the discount does not -- we don't need to fan the flames of supply challenges. So you make a very fair reasonable point, much how we behave during the height of the pandemic with respect to promotion."
