Even with vaccine proliferation on the horizon, COVID-19 infections really continue to rise, causing restrictions to be implemented in many parts of the world. Amidst the pandemic, Visa delivered strong financial results in our fiscal first quarter. And our strategy to enable money movement globally remains clear: pursuing growth through consumer payments new flows and value-added services. 
On our call today, let me discuss our Q1 results and then provide detail on our momentum this quarter with clients and the valuable solutions they utilize to drive money movement globally. As I review our Q1 results, recall we are growing over a quarter where no one had ever heard of COVID-19. 
Payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border volume all improved from Q4. Payments volume improved 0.5 point, processing transaction growth improved 1 point, and cross-border volume improved 8 points. 
Net revenues in the fiscal first quarter were $5.7 billion, a year-over-year decrease of 6%. And non-GAAP EPS was $1.42, a decrease of 3%. Through our dividends and buybacks, we returned $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in Q1. 
Vasant will cover spending in great detail, so I want to make a few high-level comments on holiday spending. U.S. holiday spending was quite different this year, but had a similar overall growth to the last 3 years of holiday season: led by strong retail growth somewhat offset by travel, entertainment and fuel. This year in the U.S., we generally saw a continuation of the trends that have been occurring during COVID: strong debit and e-commerce and weaker credit and card present. Outside the United States, holiday retail spending growth broadly accelerated, with growth in Canada, the U.K., Brazil and Australia all rising by 5 or more points over last year. 
Now let me transition to our progress with clients. We continue to win and renew business as we transfer money movement globally through consumer payments, new flows and belated services. In consumer payments, we continue to focus on digitizing the $18 trillion spent in cash and check globally by [more]  partners to grow endpoints and deepen customer engagement with innovation. We are growing credentials with traditional issuers, fintechs and wallets. 
Let me start with North America. We are very pleased to have renewed our long-standing partnership with Wells Fargo across consumer debit, credit, small business and commercial for the next 6 years. 
The Bank of Montreal Canada is [indiscernible] bank and the only top 5 Canadian bank not previously issuing with Visa, announced a new partnership with us to issue 2 affluent lifestyle credit card products in the Canadian market. These products are digital-first targeting the affluent millennial segment and offer strong rewards and value to cardholders in a differentiated and innovative way. 
In our Asia Pacific region, we won the debit business of Malaysia's Mbank after winning the credit business just a quarter ago. Our relationship with LINE Pay also deepened this quarter on 2 fronts. First in Japan, LINE Pay is now issuing Visa virtual prepaid cards. And second, Visa secured an exclusive partnership with LINE BK, Thailand's first social banking platform for issuance of Visa Debit cards. Within the first month, LINE BK issued 180,000 Visa debit credentials. 
In Russia, You Money, one of the country's largest electronic payment services with more than 120,000 merchants worldwide and 40 million end points, signed on to issue Visa credentials in their wallet and enable Visa Direct. 
In Europe, we had several notable wins as we continue to increase our business on the continent. Visa secured a business agreement with Santander Group, becoming the preferred partner in credit and commercial for another banks across 7 countries in Continental Europe. We also won the prepaid issuance of [Muni], the first proximity banking and payments company in Italy, which offers its services through both digital and retail channels with over 45,000 points of sale in rural and urban areas that can reach 20 million customers. 
Fish Bank, the largest private bank in Turkey with 20 million cards, has selected Visa for its consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios. Last, we renewed 2 portfolios with a leading U.K. issuer, one for consumer credit and one for commercial charge card. 
We also continue to deepen engagement with our partners to find new ways to remove friction and enhance the client experience through innovation. Just yesterday, we announced a global partnership with TransferWise and the first use case of Visa Cloud Connect, a new way to securely connect to VisaNet through the cloud. The new platform will enable the expansion of TransferWise's multicurrency debit cards in Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, the U.K. and the U.S. and deliver a range of financial services via a mobile app to their customers, including currency exchange and P2P payments, all linked to a Visa card. 
Cash to pay continues to expand, representing almost 2/3 of all face-to-face transactions excluding the United States. In the United States, we have approximately 300 million contactless cards in place now and have high single-digit penetration of face-to-face transactions. 
Even at this level, the U.S. is now the fourth largest country in the number of tap to pay transactions. Enablement continues to grow as all 500 of Costco fuel locations and Chipotle and Nordstrom stores now except tap to pay. I'm also pleased to report that the New York City MTA has completed their rollout to all subways and buses. 
Processing is also a way to bring Visa's innovations to market, and we have made significant progress in Latin America this past quarter in Ecuador, Colombia and Peru and now have reached 100% processing penetration in Chile. 
As I close out the consumer payments section, I wanted to note some progress in India. We continue to grow credentials. The Amazon Pay, ICICI Bank co-branded credit card in India has set a country record by issuing over 1 million cards in just 20 months. On the acceptance front, India now has 6.5 million acceptance points, including over 1 million QR points, up almost 20 percentage points from a year ago. And 65% of all terminals are tap to pay enabled. 
The Reserve Bank of India recently raised the contactless limit, which will soon cover 90%-plus of all transactions in India. Visa has entered into new partnerships with leading acquirers, such as SBI Payments, to launch acceptance solutions such as tap to phone and contactless. And Visa is partnering with the largest acquirer in India, HDFC Bank, in the launch and scale-up of smart hub and apps solution bundling payments, banking and value-added services to help small merchants grow their businesses. 
We're also contributing to India's Payment Infrastructure Development Fund to encourage growth of physical and digital acceptance in underpenetrated geographies, by adding 1 million points of sale and 2 million QR points per year over the next 3 years. All of these efforts build on our leading credit and debit market share in India. 
Now on to the second lever of growth, new flows, which represents $185 trillion in opportunity. We are pursuing this opportunity with our traditional commercial card solutions as well as newer capabilities like Visa Direct and B2B Connect. While we're making progress across all new flows, I'll highlight a few advancements from this quarter. 
In B2C, big economy payouts and earned wage [assets] continue to grow meaningfully in the wake of COVID. This quarter with DoorDash, we launched the Dasher Direct business prepaid card in the U.S., offering the over 1 million Dashers on the DoorDash platform access to daily deposits of earned wages and rich card benefits. In Canada, Skip the Dishes, the country's largest food delivery network, rolled out their Visa Direct-enabled courier payouts called Fast Cash. 
P2P, which represents $20 trillion of the flows was Visa Direct's first use case and continues to grow substantially. A key area of future growth is cross-border P2P or remittance. 4 of the top 5 global money transfer operators were onboarded in FY '20: TransferWise, Western Union, Remitly and Moneygram, which noted a 500% increase year-over-year in real-time transfers in December alone. 
Our efforts to expand remittance also extends to fintechs and banks who can enable this capability. Zpay, a fast-growing African fintech, will use Visa Direct to allow Africans to send money across European and North American corridors and soon will expand to all major corridors globally. Transfer Go, a global money transfer company that supports migrant workers to send money back to a relative without paying unnecessary bank fees, has enabled Visa Direct in 55 markets and has the potential to expand to a total of 178 countries in the future, with the upcoming additions such as the U.K., Italy and Nigeria. Across the globe in the first quarter, Visa Direct transactions grew almost 60%. 
Now on to B2B. In cross-border, Goldman Sachs Transaction Banking recently signed on to employ Visa B2B Connect for cross-border B2B money movement, offering its corporate clients the ability to transact in over 80 markets globally. We are very pleased that our partnership with Goldman continues to deepen on multiple fronts. 
In the virtual card-based business, we've expanded our relationship with U.K.-based Conformer Pay to launch Visa Commercial Pay, which has 3 offerings: a mobile app enabling virtual card issuance and management for business incidentals; two, a solution to manage business travel spend with enhanced data; and three, an integrated payables platform that could seamlessly send payments to suppliers. Barclays has already launched this functionality for their commercial clients. 
Currently, essentially all of these new flows are transacted into traditional fee and currencies. But there's a growing interest in digital currencies, and I wanted to take a minute to talk about how Visa thinks about crypto in general and our approach. 
In this space, we see ways that we can add differentiated value to the ecosystem. And we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help make cryptocurrencies more safe, useful and applicable for payments through our global presence, our partnership approach and our trusted brand. We think of the crypto market in 2 segments. First, there are cryptocurrencies that represent new assets such as Bitcoin. Second, there are secondary digital currencies or [stable] coins that are equity-backed by existing fiat currencies. 
We see all currencies in that first segment as digital gold. They are predominantly held as assets that are not used as a form of payment in a significant way at this point. Our strategy here is to work with wallets and exchanges to enable users to purchase these currencies using their Visa credentials or to cash out onto our Visa credential to make a fiat purchase at any of the 70 million merchants where Visa is accepted globally. This is similar to our approach to connect closed-loop wallets such as LINE Pay and Paytm. 
For the second segment, fiat-backed digital currencies including stable coins and central bank digital currencies, these are an emerging payments innovation that could have the potential to be used for global commerce, much like any other fiat currency. We think of digital currencies running on public blockchains as additional networks just like RTP or ACH networks, so we see them as part of our network of network strategy. 
Across both of these segments, we are the clear leader in this space. Today, 35 of the leading digital currency platforms and wallets have already chosen to issue Visa, including coin-based crypto.com, Black FY, Fold and DidPanda. These wallet relationships represent the potential for more than 50 million Visa credentials. The next leading network has a fraction of that. And it goes without saying, to the extent a specific digital currency becomes a recognized means of exchange, there's no reason why we cannot add it to our network, which already supports over 160 currencies today. 
Let me now turn to our third growth driver, value-added services. Here, we saw revenue grow at 19% in Q1, and let me name a few services with notable progress this quarter. 
As e-commerce explodes, interest in CyberSource remains strong for merchants as well as from fintechs and acquirers looking to leverage our capabilities to offer to their clients. This quarter, 2 additional leading acquirers signed on to use CyberSource, K Bank in Thailand and NAB in Australia. 
As one of the largest debit and prepaid issuer processes, we've been looking to expand Visa DPS globally. In that vein, we are pleased to share that we're bringing our Visa Debit processing system to Europe. DKB, our largest issuing bank in Germany, has chosen DPS as its debit processor and recently processed Visa's inaugural European DPS transaction via their platform. DKB will also be able to take advantage of nearly 20 value-added services through this connection. 
We have believed for years that installments represent an important opportunity in payments. To enable this capability, we offer our own network solution for issuers, merchants and fintech installment providers to use directly or also work with many -- and we also work with many installment providers to develop new solutions. This quarter, we have an update on both fronts. 
We signed a global deal with Afterpay, extending our U.S. relationship to an additional 7 countries, where Afterpay will use Visa technology to accelerate its global expansion. In addition, Visa and Afterpay will test and collaborate on the application of new technologies like tokenization and Visa Direct. 
We announced in July that Commerce Bank in the United States was piloting the network solution. And now -- it has now launched with over -- with about 300,000 customers live. Visa also signed Scotiabank as the first Canadian bank to launch a post-purchase installment pilot with employees in December, with a full market rollout slated for mid-2021. 
All of these growth levers, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, are driven by our network of network strategy, which is enabling all forms of payments, utilizing all networks and providing the value-added services you would expect from Visa as we enable money movement.
In closing, a few points. Domestic volumes driven by debit and e-commerce are really holding up well. Holiday spending will differ in terms of categories, and timing was quite good. Q1 overall was a very solid quarter and positive momentum continued, albeit we are still impacted by COVID-19. 
We are continuing to work very hard to balance expense management and recognition of the short-term realities and investing in an exciting set of growth opportunities as we always manage the business for the long term. We continue to be focused on our 3 growth levers, all of which are supported by our network of network. And lastly, we are hopeful that as vaccines roll out and become more readily available, lockdowns, travel restrictions and capacity constraints will be lessened or eliminated, enabling travel, entertainment and other commerce to grow. 
With that, over to Vasant for more color on our volumes and our financials."

During our fiscal first quarter last year, COVID-19 was not yet a word in the English language. This will be the last quarter where our performance is compared to a quarter with no COVID impact whatsoever. As suc",2550,"Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. 
During our fiscal first quarter last year, COVID-19 was not yet a word in the English language. This will be the last quarter where our performance is compared to a quarter with no COVID impact whatsoever. As such, our results this quarter provide a clear picture of the state of the recovery. 
Overall the quarter was stronger than we expected, with net revenue down 6% largely due to the cross-border business. EPS declined only 3%, helped by lower expenses and a lower tax rate. Exchange rates shifts versus last year increased reported net revenue growth by less than 0.5 point and EPS growth by less than 1 point. 
As we approach the first anniversary of the pandemic, where do we stand across our key business drivers relative to where we might have been had the pandemic never happened? Global payments volume is 4 to 5 points short of where we might have been. Debit has outperformed, helped by accelerated cash displacement. And credit is still a drag. 
In the U.S., we are actually back to our pre-pandemic growth trajectory, with debit significantly ahead offsetting credit underperformance. As you know, where we are well behind is in our cross-border business. In the first quarter of fiscal '21, our cross-border volumes were almost 40% lower excluding intra-Europe volumes, than they might have been had the pandemic never happened, largely due to travel. Cross-border travel volume, both card-present and card not present, is still down almost 70% relative to where it might have been at this point.
Let's start with a review of the key business drivers in the fiscal first quarter. Global payments volume and transaction growth rates were modestly better than the prior quarter. The cross-border volume recovery continued even as most borders remain completely or partially closed. The trajectory of the domestic spending recovery varies across the globe. Some regions and countries are recovering fast. Others are holding steady, while some have slowed in recent weeks as a result of new restrictions. What remains consistent globally is very strong debit and e-commerce spending, which is partially offset by weaker credit and in-store spending. Although constant dollar cross-border volume excluding transactions within Europe is still down 33%, there was an 8-point improvement from last quarter. 
Payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew 4.5%. Debit was up 17%, 3 percentage points lower than last quarter; while credit declined 6%, up 3 percentage points from Q4. Growth excluding China was 7%, up almost 1 point as Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded card conversion, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. volume growth -- U.S. payments volume growth was 8%, up 0.5 point from last quarter. 
Debit growth remained strong at 21%. Debit growth was 3 points lower than the fourth quarter, largely driven by a step down in unemployment benefits distributed via Visa prepaid cards. 
Credit spending declined 3% year-over-year, a 4-point improvement versus last quarter, driven by an acceleration in retail spending and some recovery in travel and restaurant spending. Card-not-present volume excluding travel continued to grow over 30% in the quarter, primarily driven by retail spending. The decline in card-present spending was consistent with last quarter. However, performance did deteriorate through the quarter as rising COVID cases led to further government-imposed restrictions in several states and cities. card-present spending slowdowns were more significant in the restaurant segment as well as during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend across most segments. 
Across 10 categories, growth was relatively consistent with the prior quarter. Categories which have been growing above their peak COVID levels have remained elevated including food and drug stores, home improvement and retail goods. For categories that are the hardest hit by this pandemic including travel, entertainment, fuel and restaurants, spending remained depressed with year-over-year declines consistent with last quarter. 
International payments volume grew 2% in Q1, or 6% excluding China, both of which are up 1 point versus last quarter. A few regional highlights: 
CEMEA remains our best performing region, growing 19% in constant dollars in the quarter, a more than 4-point improvement over Q4. The easing of COVID-related restrictions, particularly in the Middle East, and client wins drove the robust growth. 
Latin America grew 16% in constant dollars, a nearly 10-point acceleration from last quarter. This growth acceleration is fueled by limited COVID-related restrictions in most countries, elevated e-commerce spending compared to other regions, and growing our market share with client wins in a few of the larger countries. 
Europe grew 5% in constant dollars, a 4-point slowdown versus last quarter. This deceleration was driven partially by renewed restrictions in the second half of the quarter due to rapidly rising COVID infection rates particularly in the U.K., France, Italy and Germany. And also as you may remember, growth in Europe last quarter benefited from a nonrecurring event in the U.K. related to purchases of higher interest-bearing savings funds. 
Asia Pacific declined 8% in constant dollars. Excluding China, Q1 spending was flat, a 4-point improvement since last quarter. There continue to be more COVID-related restrictions in effect across Asia than other parts of the world. However, several larger markets such as New Zealand, Australia, Korea and Japan have returned to growth. 
Processed transactions growth was 4%, up 1 point from last quarter. Growth accelerated faster than payments volume as transaction sizes continue to normalize x Europe. Increased corporate-related restrictions in Europe are driving higher average ticket sizes causing transactions growth to slow.  Latin America is benefiting from processing wins in several countries, including Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Chile. 
Visa Direct continues to perform very well, with transactions growing almost 60% globally this quarter. Growth remains strong in every region as we continue to launch new use cases, further penetrate existing use cases such as Earned Wage Access and cross-border remittance, and expand existing use cases to new geographies. 
Constant dollar cross-border volume excluding transactions within Europe declined 33% in Q1, an 8-point improvement from the last quarter. Travel-related spend declined 64%, but improved 6 points versus the fourth quarter. Card-not-present nontravel growth was 20%, up 3 points, fueled by strong retail spending in November and December. 
Constant dollar cross-border volume including transactions within Europe declined 21% in the quarter. Although cross-border travel performance improved steadily through the quarter, the travel improvement was concentrated in only a few markets where borders are open. 
Travel from the U.S. to several countries in Latin America remained strong, including Mexico and the Caribbean. The UAE has been open to travelers, attracting people from Europe, Russia and other Gulf countries. Also travel across countries within the former Soviet Union has been growing. 
Unfortunately, the majority of borders remain closed or imposed significant requirements on international travelers. The World Tourism Organization reported in December that out of 217 countries, 118 countries or 54% still had completely or partially closed their borders to foreign visitors. Of the remaining 99 countries, the majority are mandating COVID tests with quarantines. Very few countries have no COVID restrictions. Significant obstacles in crossing borders remain the single most important factor guiding the slow recovery of cross-border travel. 
A quick review of first quarter financial results. Net revenue declined 6%, better than our expectations, primarily due to stronger-than-expected cross-border volumes and lower client incentives. Value-added services continue to perform well, growing 19%. 
It's important to note that had we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, it would have had minimal impact on our Q1 net revenue growth, because payment volume growth was very similar across both quarters. Service revenues grew 5%, roughly in line with nominal payments volume growth last quarter. Data processing grew 6%, with high teens value-added services growth, continuing to be partially offset by the mix shift away from higher-yielding cross-border transactions. International transaction revenues were down 28%, 4 points better than cross-border volumes excluding intra-Europe due to favorable country mix and currency volatility benefits. Other revenues grew 5% and led by value-added services, but continue to be negatively impacted by declines in the usage of travel-related card benefits. 
Client incentives were 24.6% of gross revenues, approximately 1 point lower than expected. This was driven by 3 factors: First, a few large deals expected to be signed in the first quarter were delayed to the second quarter. 
Second, cross-border volume was better than we expected, particularly in the month of December. As we said in the past, client incentives are mostly tied to payments volume. So outperformance in high-yielding cross-border volumes lowers our incentives as a percent of gross revenues. 
And third, payments volume growth only improved 0.5 point versus last quarter. As such, there was minimal impact on current quarter client incentives from current quarter volume. 
On the operating expense front, we continue to benefit from actions we implemented last spring. Our head count is lower. Our spending on external services has been scaled back. Travel continues to be very restricted, and some marketing spend has been curtailed. 
Both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses declined 10%, which was better than expected, partly due to timing shifts in client co-marketing as well as certain product and technology investments to later in the year. Non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $112 million for the fiscal quarter. This was over $30 million lower than expected due to 2 nonrecurring items. 
First, investment income [compared] to deferred compensation was higher. This is offset in personnel costs, and therefore income neutral. And second, an interest expense reserve was released due to the conclusion of certain tax audits. 
The non-GAAP tax rate was lower than expected at 16.6%. And during the quarter, the conclusion of tax audits in certain jurisdictions resulted in an $81 million benefit. In addition to this specific benefit, our tax rate is typically lower in the first quarter due to the impact of employee equity vesting. 
GAAP and non-GAAP EPS was $1.42, a decrease of 3%. 
We bought 8.7 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $202.30 for $1.8 billion this quarter. Our Board has authorized a new $8 billion share repurchase program, bringing total funds available for repurchases to over $11 billion. 
Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned approximately $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. In December, we repaid $3 billion of debt upon maturity of senior notes issued 5 years ago.
Moving on to some perspectives on the second fiscal quarter, starting with business driver trends through January 21. Through January 21, U.S. payments volume growth was 12%, with U.S. debit growing 30% and credit declining 6%. Debit growth is 10 points higher than the November, December run rate fueled by government stimulus payments distributed right around January 1. Weekly growth trends show a sharp step-up in growth in the first week of January and a step down in week 3. January credit growth has slowed 3 points since December, which is more in line with the November trend. 
While U.S. payments volume growth has accelerated, there are many countries where constant-dollar growth is slowing due to increased restrictions as COVID infections rise. In Asia Pacific, Japan, Australia, India and Singapore, payments volume growth has slowed 4 to 5 points versus December. In Europe, countries such as the U.K., Italy, Denmark and Germany all have at least 10 points slower growth in January. So far, growth rates are relatively steady in both CEMEA and Latin America. 
Through January 21, processed transactions growth remained at 4%, with acceleration in the U.S. offset by slowing growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. Cross-border volume excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis declined 33%, in line with the first quarter but below the trends we saw in December. 
In a fast-changing environment, accurate forecasting remains difficult. How long will elevated spending driven by stimulus payments last? How long will stepped up restrictions and lockdowns persist? How will these 2 countervailing trends balance out country by country? Will cross-border travel sustain a slow recovery, even if some new restrictions go into place? These are just some of the uncertainties as we look ahead to the next 3 months. 
Based on the trends to this point, our best sense is that the second quarter gross revenue growth rate will recover to be flattish with last year, with most of the improvement driven by international revenues. Growth in other -- in the other revenue lines is expected to have a small uptick due to easier year-over-year comparisons in the second half of March. 
First quarter client incentives were 1 point below our expectations. Second quarter client incentives could be 1 point above the high end of the 25.5% to 26.5% range we expect for the year. This would put first half incentives right in the middle of the range. 
There are several reasons for the step-up of client incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the second quarter, even with continued improvement in cross-border. First, as I mentioned earlier, a few large deals moved from the first to the second quarter, one of which was Wells Fargo, was signed in January as I now noted. 
Second, as we told you in October, many clients did not meet certain volume thresholds in calendar year 2020, and as such, did not earn corresponding incentives. As volume recovers in 2021, we expect clients will hit growth thresholds and earn these incentives. We accrue incentives accordingly, starting with the first quarter of the new calendar year. This quarter is a larger increase unique to the year of the recovery. 
And third, the impact of renewals we had already expected in the second quarter. Due to the step-up in client incentives as a percent of gross revenue, the net revenue decline in the second quarter is expected to be comparable to the decline we reported in the first quarter even as the gross revenue growth rate continues to recover. Exchange rate shifts could benefit second quarter net revenue growth by less than 1 point. 
We expect operating expenses to grow in the low to mid-single digits in the second quarter as we begin to lap the expense reductions implemented last year. We still plan to grow expenses in the double digits in the second half as we step up investments on key growth initiatives in anticipation. Nonoperating expense should be $145 million approximately, which is similar to the first quarter if you exclude the 2 nonrecurring items I mentioned earlier. 
There is no change to our tax rate expectations. It is still too early to predict what impact the U.S. election would have on our taxes. As always, we will provide updates as the year progresses. 
In summary, as you can see, our business remains resilient. Both debit and e-commerce growth are sustaining well above pre-COVID levels as the accelerated shift to digital payments becomes a habit. Cross-border growth is poised to recover sharply once vaccines facilitate reopening of borders and we lap last year's steep declines. Our new flows and value-added services businesses have continued to grow robustly through the worst of the pandemic. As Al indicated, we have stayed focused on our long-term growth initiatives, and we'll be stepping up the level of investment in the second half in anticipation of a post-COVID world with accelerating growth. 
With that, I'll turn this back to Mike."

Well, first of all, let me answer the last part of the question. This was a single lawsuit brought by a single regulator about one specific M&A transaction, so I don't believe that this portends anything about the future and our ability to continue to try to acquire companies. 
As we said a couple of weeks ago, we ended up making the decision that this was just going to go on for too long. And we all know that the payments marketplace is moving with great speed on so many fronts. And the idea that we would tie ourselves up on this transaction, and frankly the plan would tie themselves up through long-term litigation that could go all the way through an appeal, in and of itself is not appealing to us in terms of all the other things that we thought we could be investing in and spending management time on and spending our dollars on. 
We're continuing to forge down a path of making sure that we are a real player in this space of open banking and believe that we have a lot of the assets already. What Plaid was going to do was going to get us into the specifically into the data extraction type of business, which would have added to our network of networks. But it doesn't in and of itself prevent us from doing more going forward. 
We also still have the ability in that space to partner with Plaid. We have the ability to partner with other players around the world. And in many cases, that might give us the ability to partner with players that understand the nuances of specific markets in which they do work. We'll continue to look to make sure that we, to the degree that any use cases are going to form here, the most -- The use case that probably would have the most chance of have of stepping out and being something that takes -- has some legs behind it would be account to account. And I think we're very well positioned there. We're positioned well to make sure that we can provide payment capabilities for the various fintechs that we are doing business with today. And we have the ability to continue to sell value-added services to all of those players. 
So I think that ultimately as we have in the past, we will invest to grow internally. We will look to partner, and we will look to buy. And it will be a combination of capabilities and approaches that will allow us to continue to be a player in this space."

And we do have -- well, we think we have the Tokyo Olympics coming up in the summer months. I mean there's some people think that might be in some peril. At the moment, it's going forward.  
We held marketing to really relatively modest levels in this past quarter, but I would certainly expect us to be driving marketing up. Basically, when we go to market in our business, it's a combination of putting people resources, our technology resources and our marketing muscle behind whatever we're doing. And so those are the areas that I would expect to see us grow going forward. 
And then of course, I mean we really have dramatically curtailed T&D and professional services. And I think that to the degree that later in the year, we begin to get some people back to offices, and we begin to see some people get back on airplanes. We'll see some modest increases in those -- those expense areas, but we've been really careful about both our people level spending and our technology level spending and our marketing level spending. And I think as conditions warrant, we'll be dialing those up. Vasant gave you some insight into where we think expenses are going to be in the second half. And we think there's some really good opportunities that I want to make sure that if in fact as we believe that we'll be in some form of normalcy by the end of this fiscal year, we want to make sure that we have good momentum going into fiscal '22."

I guess a little bit of color for everybody: About 2/3 of our value-added services are in data processing, and they basically are  our transaction-based revenue streams. And that's CyberSource. That's our risk and identity products. That's DPS. And all of those will tend to continue to produce very good volumes, and they'll move with transactions as transaction tools. 
About 1/3 of our value-added services are split between our services revenue, which tends to be card benefits that are offered as a package. And then in other revenue, we have volumes that are not -- I'm sorry, we have services not tied to volumes, things like consultants, consulting our practice, and travel-related card benefits that obviously have been down. So I think as travel would be to come back at some point, that obviously would help that volume. 
So with that color, we saw our, obviously in a world where e-commerce and omni commerce is becoming a big deal. Cyber volume was very, very good and grow revenue. We continue to have more and more customers engage with us on risk and identity services. And as I said earlier now, we're excited about the fact that we're going to take our debit processing system beyond the United States. And we've now got it starting to use it in Europe.

Beyond that, Dubai opened a bit. Now Dubai is having a little bit of resurgence and just went back into some restrictions earlier this week. But Dubai has been open, and there's been a decent amount of travel into Middle East. 
There's been a very -- a little bit of an opening amongst the countries in the former Soviet union. And then there's been some improvement or some movement in intertrade within South America. 
So those are kind of the spots where we've seen the improvements in cross-border.

I think it's going to take more time to see business travel come back, and frankly it might take years for business travel to return to what it is. I mean we've all gotten accustomed to talking on video conferences, et cetera.

The 2 that I think are the most obvious is in terms of -- or 3 I'd say: continued penetration of current use cases; new use cases that get developed; and then thirdly, geographic expansion. And this is a business that we're still building out. There's still lots to do in all 3 of those categories. 
And to an earlier question I think Don asked, we're going to continue to invest in that area. And look, there's markets where we haven't even really laid any track for Visa Direct use cases where we haven't laid any track. And our plan is to continue to do that. 
If we look at the very first Visa Direct use case which continues to grow substantially, P2P payments, there's still lots to do, both in domestic P2P payments. But we think are key future growth areas in cross-border, P2P and remittance, and we're beginning to take steps there to enable that. And I mentioned in my remarks the fact that we've got relationships with 4 of the 5 top global money transfer operators, and that's helping us quite a bit. 
I think Earned Wage Access really continues to be a real opportunity. I touched a little bit on a few of those cases. But there's still lots of geographies and lots of organizations that we have the ability to penetrate, to grow that.  
And then you got on the B2C use cases, things like food and grocery delivery and online, gaming and insurance claim payouts. So all of those are I would say in the early innings of a baseball game in terms of our ability to continue to make progress and drive those.

Where we see our job is enablement no matter what the model is. But in some cases, the player is the actual lender. In some cases, they're sourcing a lender. 
In some cases, the installments are very short term, weeks at a time. In some cases, they're long term. Some providers only do installments. Some allow multiple payment options: pay now, pay on delivery, pay off on various numbers of installments. 
And then obviously, there were -- it's exciting for us, multiple ways to pay off installments, virtual cards, debit cards, ACH. And it's also a payment model today that's heavily funded by the merchant. 
Our strategy, Chris, is to be broad to play with multiple third-party providers and offer a Visa platform to enable issuers to offer pay now -- buy now, pay now, pay later capability. And we seek to work with all these options. And obviously what we want to do is get virtual cards from Visa in place as one option for repayment. We also want to put Visa cards on file as another option. 
And I would remind you that these installments do break -- at its core, these installments break a transaction or a purchase into 3 or 4 or 5 payment transactions, which is good for us, because it gives us more transactions on which to earn fees."

There are many variables here that go into it in a time like this when things are moving around quite a bit. Certainly, cross-border doing better helps. Renewals will have an impact. Sometimes they happen when we expect, sometimes they don't. 
There's also the year-over-year improvement that our clients have. As you know, last year many clients because of the pandemic, didn't hit certain thresholds.

Not -- you've got the stimulus payments that are on prepaid cards, which count in -- we count prepaid in our debit business. As e-commerce has moved into more everyday categories, people are using debit. People are more comfortable in tough situations, tough times to use money they have versus borrow money that they don't have. 
But I think when I look ahead structurally, to answer your question, look, I think e-commerce adoption has probably accelerated 3 to 5 years in the last year. And I don't think that's going backward. I think that people who have gotten used to shopping on their phone or their tablet or their computer are going to continue to do that. 
I think the other thing that I look at structurally that's really exciting is there's great opportunity to continue to grow both sides of this 2-sided market of buyers and sellers. Wallet proliferation is continuing. And we're working really hard to get credentials in wallets, which just adds to the -- these wallets in essence of becoming issuers, and that helps generate more buyers. And the cost of acceptance is going down around the world as more and more players are getting into it, and that's going to grow the number of sellers on our network. And as that network grows, I think that's going to be a really positive thing for us. 
Obviously, e-commerce comes with the issue of no cash, but I think that people are getting increasingly concerned about cash. And the combination of tap to pay in the physical world where the card doesn't need to leave your hands to go to anybody else in order to transact, and the fact that e-commerce doesn't -- cash is not an option, those are all of those things I think structurally are very positive for us. 
The thing on the flip side also, I mentioned that while business travel is a small piece of our overall travel, that will be one of those things that will be a little bit slower to come back and maybe never back at the level it was pre-COVID-19."

You saw that already in the first quarter, our cross-border was better than we expected. And as a result, our revenues were also quite a bit better than we expected. 
We're saying that we will step up our investment in the second half and expect our expenses to grow double digits. But if the cross-border business comes back in a meaningful way, I mean that's clearly going to be much better growth on the top line than that double-digit increase in expenses that we're planning. 
Also, you should remember that we start lapping the declines in our expenses from last year. Our expenses last year declined by 5% or so in the second half. So when we grow them double digits this year, this fiscal year in the second half, over a 2-year period, we're only growing them about 5%. 
So net-net, I mean cross-border coming back is going to have a very positive impact on our business, especially if it comes back faster than we might be expecting. In any case, the comparisons get better, so you will begin to see growth in the cross-border business just because of what happened last year."

I mean clearly the mix of the business between debit and credit has an impact. You all know that debit has clearly outperformed as the primary driver of cash conversion globally. And then in those parts of the world like the U.S. where debit has been a mechanism for distribution of stimulus payments, it's also benefited from that. So mix of business makes a big difference. 
We are not seeing any reason why that it will not continue to outperform. And credit is recovering, and that's a positive trend. If you look at places around the world, I mean in Europe, the bulk of the slowdown from Q1 to Q2 was the going -- the fact that we had that benefit in the first quarter. We've had some small impact from restrictions. But unless restrictions are becoming more significant, this trend seems to be improving almost everywhere. You saw that in Latin America and CEMEA, where we saw meaningful acceleration and we're not seeing much impact on those trends from additional cases. 
So overall the U.S. as I said in my comments, it's almost as if the pandemic didn't happen, right? We grew around 8% first quarter last year. We grew 8% again first quarter this year. Where if you believe our growth rate is 8% or 9%, we're almost back on the growth rate. 
Internationally, we're getting there, and we think that, that trend is meaningfully improving, as you saw. Where we're lagging certainly where the trend is still soft is Asia, where restrictions remain still significant. And in Europe there's some increasing restrictions now, and we'll see how they play out."

Even with vaccine proliferation on the horizon, COVID-19 infections really continue to rise, causing restrictions to be implemented in many parts of the world. Amidst the pandemic, Visa delivered strong financial results in our fiscal first quarter. And our strategy to enable money movement globally remains clear: pursuing growth through consumer payments, new flows and value-added services.
On our call today, let me discuss our Q1 results and then provide detail on our momentum this quarter with clients and the valuable solutions they utilize to drive money movement globally. As I review our Q1 results, recall we are going over a quarter where no one had ever heard of COVID-19.
Payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border volume all improved from Q4. Payments volume improved 0.5 point, processing transaction growth improved 1 point and cross-border volume improved 8 points. Net revenues in the fiscal first quarter were $5.7 billion, a year-over-year decrease of 6%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.42, a decrease of 3%. Through our dividends and buybacks, we returned $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in Q1.
Vasant will cover the spending in great detail, so I want to make a few high-level comments on holiday spending. U.S. holiday spending was quite different this year, but had a similar overall growth to the last 3 years of holiday season led by strong retail growth, somewhat offset by travel, entertainment and fuel. This year, in the U.S., we generally saw a continuation of the trends that have been occurring during COVID: strong debit and e-commerce and weaker credit and card presence. Outside the United States, holiday retail spending growth broadly accelerated, with growth in Canada, the U.K., Brazil and Australia all rising by 5 or more points over last year.
Now let me transition to our progress with clients. We continued to win and renew business as we transfer money movement globally through consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. In consumer payments, we continue to focus on digitizing the $18 trillion spent in cash and check globally by working with partners to grow end points and deepen customer engagement with innovation. We are growing credentials with traditional issuers, fintechs and wallets.
Let me start with North America. We are very pleased to have renewed our long-standing partnership with Wells Fargo across consumer debit, credit, small business and commercial for the next 6 years. The Bank of Montreal, Canada's fourth largest bank and the only top 5 Canadian bank not previously issuing with Visa, announced a new partnership with us to issue 2 affluent-lifestyle credit card products in the Canadian market. These products are digital-first, targeting the affluent millennial segment and offer strong rewards and value to cardholders in a differentiated and innovative way.
In our Asia Pacific region, we won the debit business of Malaysia's AmBank after winning the credit business just a quarter ago. Our relationship with LINE Pay also deepened this quarter on 2 fronts. First in Japan, LINE Pay is now issuing a Visa virtual prepaid card. And second, Visa secured an exclusive partnership with LINE BK, Thailand's first social banking platform, for issuance of Visa Debit cards. Within the first month, LINE BK issued 180,000 Visa Debit credentials.
In Russia, YooMoney, one of the country's largest electronic payment services with more than 120,000 merchants worldwide and 40 million end points, signed on to issue Visa credentials in their wallet and enable Visa Direct.
In Europe, we had several notable wins as we continue to increase our business on the continent. Visa secured a business agreement with Santander Group, becoming the preferred partner in credit and commercial for Santander banks across 7 countries in Continental Europe. We also won the prepaid issuance of Mooney, the first proximity banking and payments company in Italy, which offers its services through both digital and retail channels with over 45,000 points of sale in rural and urban areas that can reach 20 million customers. Isbank, the largest private bank in Turkey with 20 million cards, has selected Visa for its consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios. Last, we renewed 2 portfolios with a leading U.K. issuer, one for consumer credit and one for commercial charge card.
We also continue to deepen engagement with our partners to find new ways to remove friction and enhance the client experience through innovation. Just yesterday, we announced the global partnership with TransferWise and the first use case of Visa Cloud Connect, a new way to securely connect to VisaNet through the cloud. The new platform will enable the expansion of TransferWise's multicurrency debit cards in Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, the U.K. and the U.S. and deliver a range of financial services via a mobile app to their customers, including currency exchange and P2P payments, all linked to a Visa card.
Tap to pay continues to expand, representing almost 2/3 of all face-to-face transactions, excluding the United States. In the United States, we have approximately 300 million contactless cards in place now and have high single-digit penetration of face-to-face transactions. Even at this level, the U.S. is now the fourth largest country in the number of tap to pay transactions. Enablement continues to grow as all 500 of Costco's fuel locations and Chipotle and Nordstrom stores now except tap to pay. I'm also pleased to report that the New York City MTA has completed their rollout to all subways and buses. Processing is also a way to bring Visa's innovations to market, and we have made significant progress in Latin America this past quarter in Ecuador, Colombia and Peru and now have reached 100% processing penetration in Chile.
As I close out the consumer payments section, I wanted to note the progress in India. We continue to grow credentials. The Amazon Pay ICICI Bank co-branded credit card in India has set a country record by issuing over 1 million cards in just 20 months. On the acceptance front, India now has 6.5 million acceptance points, including over 1 million QR points, up almost 20 percentage points from a year ago, and 65% of all terminals are tap to pay enabled. The Reserve Bank of India recently raised the contactless limit, which will soon cover 90%-plus of all transactions in India.
Visa has entered into new partnerships with leading acquirers, such as SBI Payments, to launch acceptance solutions such as Tap to Phone and contactless. And Visa is partnering with the largest acquirer in India, HDFC Bank, in the launch and scale-up of SmartHub, an app solution bundling payments, banking and value-added services to help small merchants grow their businesses. We're also contributing to India's Payment Infrastructure Development Fund to encourage growth of physical and digital acceptance in underpenetrated geographies by adding 1 million points of sale and 2 million QR points per year over the next 3 years. All of these efforts build on our leading credit and debit market share in India.
Now on to the second lever of growth, new flows, which represents $185 trillion in opportunity. We are pursuing this opportunity with our traditional commercial card solutions as well as newer capabilities like Visa Direct and B2B Connect. While we're making progress across all new flows, I'll highlight a few advancements from this quarter.
In B2C, big economy payouts and Earned Wage Access continue to grow meaningfully in the wake of COVID. This quarter with DoorDash, we launched the DasherDirect business prepaid card in the U.S., offering the over 1 million Dashers on the DoorDash platform access to daily deposits of earned wages and rich card benefits. In Canada, SkipTheDishes, the country's largest food delivery network, rolled out their Visa Direct-enabled courier payouts called Fast Cash.
P2P, which represents $20 trillion of the flows was Visa Direct's first use case and continued to grow substantially. A key area of future growth is cross-border P2P or remittance. Four of the top 5 global money transfer operators were onboarded in fiscal year '20: TransferWise, Western Union, Remitly and MoneyGram, which noted a 500% increase year-over-year in real-time transfers in December alone.
Our efforts to expand remittance also extends to fintechs and banks who can enable this capability. Zeepay, a fast-growing African fintech, will use Visa Direct to allow Africans to send money across European and North American corridors and soon will expand to all major corridors globally. TransferGo, a global money transfer company that supports migrant workers to send money back to their relatives without paying unnecessary bank fees, has enabled Visa Direct in 55 markets and has the potential to expand to a total of 178 countries in the future, with the upcoming additions such as the U.K., Italy and Nigeria. Across the globe, in the first quarter, Visa Direct transactions grew almost 60%.
Now on to B2B. In cross-border, Goldman Sachs' Transaction Banking recently signed on to employ Visa B2B Connect for cross-border B2B money movement, offering its corporate clients the ability to transact in over 80 markets globally. We are very pleased that our partnership with Goldman continues to deepen on multiple fronts.
In the virtual card-based business, we've expanded our relationship with U.K.-based Conferma Pay to launch Visa Commercial Pay, which has 3 offerings: a mobile app enabling virtual card issuance and management for business incidentals; two, a solution to manage business travel spend with enhanced data; and three, an integrated payables platform that can seamlessly send payments to suppliers. Barclays has already launched this functionality for their commercial clients.
Currently, essentially all of these new flows are transacted in traditional fiat currencies. But there's a growing interest in digital currencies, and I wanted to take a minute to talk about how Visa thinks about crypto in general and our approach.
In this space, we see ways that we can add differentiated value to the ecosystem. And we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help make cryptocurrencies more safe, useful and applicable for payments through our global presence, our partnership approach and our trusted brand. We think of the crypto market in 2 segments. First, there are cryptocurrencies that represent new assets such as Bitcoin. Second, there are digital currencies or stable coins that are directly backed by existing fiat currencies.
We see all currencies in that first segment as digital gold. They are predominantly held as assets that are not used as a form of payment in a significant way at this point. Our strategy here is to work with wallets and exchanges to enable users to purchase these currencies using their Visa credentials or to cash out onto our Visa credential to make a fiat purchase at any of the 70 million merchants where Visa is accepted globally. This is similar to our approach to connect closed-loop wallets such as LINE Pay and Paytm.
For the second segment, fiat-backed digital currencies, including stable coins and central bank digital currencies, these are an emerging payments innovation that could have the potential to be used for global commerce, much like any other fiat currency. We think of digital currencies running on public blockchains as additional networks just like RTP or ACH networks, so we see them as part of our network of networks strategy.
Across both of these segments, we are the clear leader in this space. Today, 35 of the leading digital currency platforms and wallets have already chosen to issue Visa, including coin-based Crypto.com, BlackFi, Fold and BitPanda. These wallet relationships represent the potential for more than 50 million Visa credentials. The next leading network has a fraction of that. And it goes without saying, to the extent a specific digital currency becomes a recognized means of exchange, there's no reason why we cannot add it to our network, which already supports over 160 currencies today.
Let me now turn to our third growth lever, value-added services. Here, we saw our revenue grow at 19% in Q1, and let me name a few services with notable progress this quarter.
As e-commerce explodes, interest in CyberSource remained strong for merchants as well as from fintechs and acquirers looking to leverage our capabilities to offer to their clients. This quarter, 2 additional leading acquirers signed on to use CyberSource: KBank in Thailand and NAB in Australia. As one of the largest debit and prepaid issuer processors, we've been looking to expand Visa DPS globally. In that vein, we are pleased to share that we're bringing our Visa Debit processing system to Europe. DKB, our largest issuing bank in Germany, has chosen DPS as its debit processor and recently processed Visa's inaugural European DPS transaction via their platform. DKB will also be able to take advantage of nearly 20 value-added services through this connection.
We have believed for years that installments represent an important opportunity in payments. To enable this capability, we offer our own network solution for issuers, merchants and fintech installment providers to use directly or also work with many -- and we also work with many installment providers to develop new solutions. This quarter, we have updates on both fronts.
We signed a global deal with Afterpay, extending our U.S. relationship to an additional 7 countries where Afterpay will use Visa technology to accelerate its global expansion. In addition, Visa and Afterpay will test and collaborate on the application of new technologies like tokenization and Visa Direct. We announced in July that Commerce Bank in the United States was piloting a network solution and has now -- it has now launched with over -- with about 300,000 customers live. Visa also signed Scotiabank as the first Canadian bank to launch a post-purchase installment pilot with employees in December with a full market rollout slated for mid-2021.
All of these growth levers, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, are driven by our network of networks strategy, which is enabling all forms of payments, utilizing all networks and providing the value-added services you would expect from Visa as we enable money movement.
In closing, a few points. Domestic volumes driven by debit and e-commerce are really holding up well. Holiday spending, while differing in terms of categories and timing, was quite good. Q1 overall was a very solid quarter and positive momentum continued, albeit we are still impacted by COVID-19. We are continuing to work very hard to balance expense management in recognition of the short-term realities and investing in an exciting set of growth opportunities as we always manage the business for the long term. We continue to be focused on our 3 growth levers, all of which are supported by our network of networks. And lastly, we are hopeful that as vaccines roll out and become more readily available, lockdowns, travel restrictions and capacity constraints will be lessened or eliminated, enabling travel, entertainment and other commerce to grow.
With that, over to Vasant for more color on our volumes and our financials."
38043467,701220863,2184902,"Visa Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. During our fiscal first quarter last year, COVID-19 was not yet a word in the English language. This will be the last quarter where our performance is compared to a quarter with no COVID impact whatsoever. As such,",2553,"Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. During our fiscal first quarter last year, COVID-19 was not yet a word in the English language. This will be the last quarter where our performance is compared to a quarter with no COVID impact whatsoever. As such, our results this quarter provide a clear picture of the state of the recovery.
Overall the quarter was stronger than we expected with net revenue down 6%, largely due to the cross-border business. EPS declined only 3% helped by lower expenses and a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shifts versus last year increased reported net revenue growth by less than 0.5 point and EPS growth by less than 1 point.
As we approach the first anniversary of the pandemic, where do we stand across our key business drivers relative to where we might have been had the pandemic never happened? Global payments volume is 4 to 5 points short of where we might have been, debit has outperformed helped by accelerated cash displacement and credit is still a drag. In the U.S., we are actually back to our pre-pandemic growth trajectory with debit significantly ahead, offsetting credit underperformance.
As you know, where we are well behind is in our cross-border business. In the first quarter of fiscal '21, our cross-border volumes were almost 40% lower, excluding intra-Europe volumes, than they might have been had the pandemic never happened, largely due to travel. Cross-border travel volume, both card-present and card-not-present, is still down almost 70% relative to where it might have been at this point.
Let's start with a review of the key business drivers in the fiscal first quarter. Global payments volume and transaction growth rates were modestly better than the prior quarter. The cross-border volume recovery continued even as most borders remain completely or partially closed. The trajectory of the domestic spending recovery varies across the globe. Some regions and countries are recovering fast, others are holding steady, while some have slowed in recent weeks as a result of new restrictions. What remains consistent globally is very strong debit and e-commerce spending, which is partially offset by weaker credit and in-store spending. Although constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, is still down 33%, there was an 8-point improvement from last quarter.
Payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew 4.5%. Debit was up 17%, 3 percentage points lower than last quarter. While credit declined 6%, up 3 percentage points from Q4. Growth excluding China was 7%, up almost 1 point as Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded card conversions, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. volume growth -- U.S. payments volume growth was 8%, up 0.5 point from last quarter. Debit growth remained strong at 21%. Debit growth was 3 points lower than the fourth quarter, largely driven by a step-down in unemployment benefits distributed via Visa prepaid cards.
Credit spending declined 3% year-over-year, a 4-point improvement versus last quarter, driven by an acceleration in retail spending and some recovery in travel and restaurant spending. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, continued to grow over 30% in the quarter, primarily driven by retail spending. The decline in card-present spending was consistent with last quarter. However, performance did deteriorate through the quarter as rising COVID cases led to further government-imposed restrictions in several states and cities. Card-present spending slowdowns were more significant in the restaurant segment as well as during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend across most segments.
Across 10 categories, growth was relatively consistent with the prior quarter. Categories which have been growing above their pre-COVID levels have remained elevated, including food and drugstores, home improvement and retail goods. For categories that are the hardest hit by this pandemic, including travel, entertainment, fuel and restaurants, spending remained depressed with year-over-year declines consistent with last quarter. International payments volume grew 2% in Q1, or 6% excluding China, both of which are up 1 point versus last quarter.
A few regional highlights. CEMEA remains our best-performing region, growing 19% in constant dollars in the quarter, a more than 4-point improvement over Q4. The easing of COVID-related restrictions, particularly in the Middle East, and client wins drove the robust growth.
Latin America grew 16% in constant dollars, a nearly 10-point acceleration from last quarter. This growth acceleration is fueled by limited COVID-related restrictions in most countries, elevated e-commerce spending compared to other regions and growing our market share with client wins in a few of the larger countries.
Europe grew 5% in constant dollars, a 4-point slowdown versus last quarter. This deceleration was driven partially by renewed restrictions in the second half of the quarter due to rapidly rising COVID infection rates, particularly in the U.K., France, Italy and Germany. And also, as you may remember, growth in Europe last quarter benefited from a nonrecurring event in the U.K. related to purchases of higher interest-bearing savings funds.
Asia Pacific declined 8% in constant dollars. Excluding China, Q1 spending was flat, a 4-point improvement since last quarter. There continued to be more COVID-related restrictions in effect across Asia than other parts of the world. However, several larger markets, such as New Zealand, Australia, Korea and Japan, have returned to growth.
Processed transactions growth was 4%, up 1 point from last quarter. Growth accelerated faster than payments volume as transaction sizes continue to normalize ex Europe. Increased COVID-related restrictions in Europe are driving higher average ticket sizes, causing transactions growth to slow. Latin America is benefiting from processing wins in several countries, including Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Chile.
Visa Direct continues to perform very well, with transactions growing almost 60% globally this quarter. Growth remained strong in every region as we continue to launch new use cases; further penetrate existing use cases, such as Earned Wage Access and cross-border remittance; and expand existing use cases to new geographies.
Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, declined 33% in Q1, an 8-point improvement from the last quarter. Travel-related spend declined 64% but improved 6 points versus the fourth quarter. Card-not-present nontravel growth was 20%, up 3 points, fueled by strong retail spending in November and December. Constant dollar cross-border volume, including transactions within Europe, declined 21% in the quarter.
Although cross-border travel performance improved steadily through the quarter, the travel improvement was concentrated in only a few markets where borders are open. Travel from the U.S. to several countries in Latin America remained strong, including Mexico and the Caribbean. The U.A.E. has been open to travelers, attracting people from Europe, Russia and other Gulf countries. Also, travel across countries within the former Soviet Union has been growing.
Unfortunately, the majority of borders remain closed or imposed significant requirements on international travelers. The World Tourism Organization reported in December that out of 217 countries, 118 countries, or 54%, still had completely or partially closed their borders to foreign visitors. Of the remaining 99 countries, the majority are mandating COVID tests with quarantines. Very few countries have no COVID restrictions. Significant obstacles in crossing borders remain the single most important factor driving the slow recovery of cross-border travel.
A quick review of first quarter financial results. Net revenue declined 6%, better than our expectations, primarily due to stronger-than-expected cross-border volumes and lower client incentives. Value-added services continue to perform well, growing 19%. It's important to note that had we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, it would have had minimal impact on our Q1 net revenue growth because payment volume growth was very similar across both quarters.
Service revenues grew 5%, roughly in line, with nominal payments volume growth last quarter. Data processing grew 6%, with high teens value-added services growth continuing to be partially offset by the mix shift away from higher-yielding cross-border transactions. International transaction revenues were down 28%, 4 points better than cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, due to favorable country mix and currency volatility benefits. Other revenues grew 5% led by value-added services but continue to be negatively impacted by declines in the usage of travel-related card benefits.
Client incentives were 24.6% of gross revenues, approximately 1 point lower than expected. This was driven by 3 factors. First, a few large deals expected to be signed in the first quarter were delayed to the second quarter. Second, cross-border volume was better than we expected, particularly in the month of December. As we have said in the past, client incentives are mostly tied to payments volume, so outperformance in high-yielding cross-border volumes lowers our incentives as a percent of gross revenues. And third, payments volume growth only improved 0.5 point versus last quarter. As such, there was minimal impact on current quarter client incentives from current quarter volume.
On the operating expense front, we continue to benefit from actions we implemented last spring. Our head count is lower, our spending on external services has been scaled back, travel continues to be very restricted and some marketing spend has been curtailed. Both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses declined 10%, which was better than expected, partly due to timing shifts in client co-marketing as well as certain product and technology investments to later in the year.
Non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $112 million for the fiscal quarter. This was over $30 million lower than expected due to 2 nonrecurring items. First, investment income tied to deferred compensation was higher. This is offset in personnel costs and, therefore, income neutral. And second, an interest expense reserve was released due to the conclusion of certain tax audits. The non-GAAP tax rate was lower than expected at 16.6%. During the quarter, the conclusion of tax audits in certain jurisdictions resulted in an $81 million benefit. In addition to this specific benefit, our tax rate is typically lower in the first quarter due to the impact of employee equity vesting.
GAAP and non-GAAP EPS was $1.42, a decrease of 3%. We bought 8.7 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $202.30 for $1.8 billion this quarter. Our Board has authorized a new $8 billion share repurchase program, bringing total funds available for repurchases to over $11 billion. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned approximately $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. In December, we repaid $3 billion of debt upon maturity of senior notes issued 5 years ago.
Moving on to some perspectives on the second fiscal quarter, starting with business driver trends through January 21. Through January 21, U.S. payments volume growth was 12%, with U.S. debit growing 30% and credit declining 6%. Debit growth is 10 points higher than the November, December run rate fueled by government stimulus payments distributed right around January 1. Weekly growth trends show a sharp step-up in growth in the first week of January and a step-down in week 3. January credit growth has slowed 3 points since December, which is more in line with the November trend.
While U.S. payments volume growth has accelerated, there are many countries where constant dollar growth is slowing due to increased restrictions as COVID infections rise. In Asia Pacific, Japan, Australia, India and Singapore payments volume growth has slowed 4 to 5 points versus December. In Europe, countries such as the U.K., Italy, Denmark and Germany all have at least 10 points slower growth in January. So far, growth rates are relatively steady in both CEMEA and Latin America.
Through January 21, processed transactions growth remained at 4% with acceleration in the U.S., offset by slowing growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis, declined 33%, in line with the first quarter but below the trends we saw in December.
In a fast-changing environment, accurate forecasting remains difficult. How long will elevated spending driven by stimulus payments last? How long will stepped up restrictions and lockdowns persist? How will these 2 countervailing trends balance out country by country? Will cross-border travel sustain the slow recovery even as some new restrictions go into play? These are just some of the uncertainties as we look ahead to the next 3 months.
Based on the trends to this point, our best sense is that the second quarter gross revenue growth rate will recover to be flattish with last year with most of the improvement driven by international revenues. Growth in other -- in the other revenue lines is expected to have a small uptick due to easier year-over-year comparisons in the second half of March.
First quarter client incentives were 1 point below our expectations. Second quarter client incentives could be 1 point above the high end of the 25.5% to 26.5% range we expect for the year. This would put first half incentives right in the middle of the range. There are several reasons for the step-up of client incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the second quarter even with continued improvement in cross border.
First, as I mentioned earlier, a few large deals moved from the first to the second quarter, one of which, Wells Fargo, was signed in January as Al noted. Second, as we told you in October, many clients did not meet certain volume thresholds in calendar year 2020 and, as such, did not earn corresponding incentives. As volume recovers in 2021, we expect clients will hit growth thresholds and earn these incentives. We accrue incentives accordingly, starting with the first quarter of the new calendar year. This quarter is a larger increase unique to the year of the recovery. And third, the impact of renewals we had already expected in the second quarter.
Due to the step-up in client incentives as a percent of gross revenue, the net revenue decline in the second quarter is expected to be comparable to the decline we reported in the first quarter even as the gross revenue growth rate continues to recover. Exchange rate shifts could benefit second quarter net revenue growth by less than 1 point.
We expect operating expenses to grow in the low to mid-single digits in the second quarter as we begin to lap the expense reductions implemented last year. We still plan to grow expenses in the double digits in the second half as we step up investments on key growth initiatives in anticipation of a return to normalcy by the end of fiscal 2021. Nonoperating expense should be $145 million approximately, which is similar to the first quarter, if you exclude the 2 nonrecurring items I mentioned earlier.
There is no change in our tax rate expectations. It is still too early to predict what impact the U.S. election will have on our taxes. As always, we will provide updates as the year progresses.
In summary, as you can see, our business remains resilient. Both debit and e-commerce growth are sustaining well above pre-COVID levels as the accelerated shift to digital payments becomes a habit. Cross-border growth is poised to recover sharply once vaccines facilitate reopening of borders and we lap last year's steep declines. Our new flows and value-added services businesses have continued to grow robustly through the worst of the pandemic.
As Al indicated, we have stayed focused on our long-term growth initiatives, and we'll be stepping up the level of investment in the second half in anticipation of a post-COVID world with accelerating growth.
With that, I'll turn this back to Mike."

Well, first of all, let me answer the last part of the question. This was a single lawsuit brought by a single regulator about one specific M&A transaction, so I don't believe that this portends anything about the future and our ability to continue to try to acquire companies. As we said a couple of weeks ago, we ended up making the decision that this was just going to go on for too long. And we all know that the payments marketplace is moving with great speed on so many fronts. And the idea that we would tie ourselves up on this transaction, and frankly, the plan would tie themselves up through long-term litigation that could go all the way through an appeal, in and of itself was not appealing to us in terms of all the other things that we thought we could be investing in and spending management time on and spending our dollars on.
We're continuing to forge down a path of making sure that we are a real player in this space of open banking and believe that we have a lot of the assets already. What Plaid was going to do was going to get us into the -- specifically into the data extraction type of business, which would have added to our network of networks. But it doesn't, in and of itself, prevent us from doing more going forward. We also still have the ability in that space to partner with Plaid. We have the ability to partner with other players around the world. And in many cases, that might give us the ability to partner with players that understand the nuances of specific markets in which they do work.
We'll continue to look to make sure that we -- to the degree that any use cases are going to form here, the most -- the use case that probably would have the most chance of stepping out and being something that takes -- has some legs behind it would be account to account. And I think we're very well positioned there. We're positioned well to make sure that we can provide payment capabilities for the various fintechs that we are doing business with today, and we have the ability to continue to sell value-added services to all of those players. So I think that ultimately, as we have in the past, we will invest to grow internally, we will look to partner and we will look to buy. And it will be a combination of capabilities and approaches that will allow us to continue to be a player in this space."

And we do have -- well, we think we have the Tokyo Olympics coming up in the summer months. I mean there are some people who think that might be in some peril. At the moment, it's going forward. We held marketing to really set relatively modest levels in this past quarter, but I would certainly expect us to be driving marketing up. Basically, when we go to market in our business, it's a combination of putting people resources, our technology resources and our marketing muscle behind whatever we're doing. And so those are the areas that I would expect to see us grow going forward.
And then, of course, I mean we really have dramatically curtailed T&E and professional services. And I think that to the degree that later in the year we begin to get some people back to offices and we begin to see some people get back on airplanes, we'll see some modest increases in those expense areas. But we've been really careful about both our people-level spending and our technology-level spending and our marketing-level spending. And I think as conditions warrant, we'll be dialing those up. Vasant gave you some insight into what -- where we think expenses are going to be in the second half. And we think there's some really good opportunities that I want to make sure that if, in fact, as we believe that we'll be in some form of normalcy by the end of this fiscal year, we want to make sure that we have good momentum going into fiscal '22."

And all of those will tend to continue to produce very good volumes, and they'll move with transactions as transaction tools. About 1/3 of our value-added services are split between services revenue, which tends to be card benefits that are offered as a package. And then in other revenue, we have volumes that are not -- I'm sorry, we have services not tied to volumes, things like consultants, our consulting practice and travel-related card benefits that obviously have been down. So I think as travel would be -- to come back at some point, that obviously would help that volume.
So -- with that color we saw -- obviously, in a world where e-commerce and omni-commerce is becoming a big deal. Cyber volume was very, very good and grow revenue. We continue to have more and more customers engage with us on risk and identity services.

There's use cases where we haven't laid any traps, and our plan is to continue to do that.
If we look at the very first Visa Direct use case which continues to grow substantially, P2P payments, there's still lots to do both in domestic P2P payments, but we think our key future growth area is in cross-border P2P and remittance, and we're beginning to take steps there to enable that. And I mentioned in my remarks the fact that we've got relationships with 4 of the 5 top global money transfer operators, and that's helping us quite a bit. I think Earned Wage Access really continues to be a real opportunity. And I touched a little bit on a few of those cases.

But in some cases, the player is the actual lender. In some cases, they're sourcing a lender. In some cases, the installments are very short term, weeks at a time. In some cases, they're long term.

But Vasant, when we look at the incentive side, I know you guys said that it was timing related why it came in below the range this quarter, but it will come in high -- I think you said higher than the range or potentially could be for the next quarter. When we think about when you first guided to the 25.5% to 26.5% range, it was embedding cross-border activity similar to the September quarter, which was -- ended up being better. So I guess I just want to know, you're assuming now some deterioration or more conservatism in cross-border before maybe it gets better later in the year.
And then I guess, Al, maybe I could just squeeze in. Structurally, again, things like debit are seeming to be somewhat sustainable. It's not all just people using more nondiscretionary. I'm curious what you would identify now, after having seen about a year of the pandemic almost, where are the top 2 or 3 items you think structurally are impacting your business longer-term and here to stay potentially?"

And at this point, the visibility is greatest in the first half since we're halfway through it, and we think we'll be right in the middle of the range. There are many variables here that go into it in a time like this when things are moving around quite a bit. Certainly, cross-border doing better helps. Renewals will have an impact. Sometimes they happen when we expect, sometimes they don't.
There's also the year-over-year improvements that our clients have. As you know, last year, many clients, because of the pandemic, didn't hit certain thresholds. This year, if things are recovering faster, there could be -- we think they'll all make their thresholds and more. That has a year-over-year impact and it varies by client. So there's a bunch of these things moving around at the same time. And the good news is we think we're right in the middle of the range, and we'll give you more as we go through the year."

Not -- you've got the stimulus payments that are on prepaid cards, which count in -- we count prepaid in our debit business. As e-commerce has moved into more everyday categories, people are using debit. People are more comfortable in tough situations, tough times, to use money they have versus borrow money that they don't have. But I think when I look ahead structurally, to answer your question, look, I think e-commerce adoption has probably accelerated 3 to 5 years in the last year. And I don't think that's going backward. I think that people who have gotten used to shopping on their phone or their tablet or their computer are going to continue to do that.
I think the other thing that I look at structurally that's really exciting is there's a great opportunity to continue to grow both sides of this 2-sided market of buyers and sellers. Wallet proliferation is continuing. And we're working really hard to get credentials in wallets, which just adds to the -- these wallets, in essence, of becoming issuers. And that helps generate more buyers. And the cost of acceptance is going down around the world as more and more players are getting into it, and that's going to grow the number of sellers on our network. And as that network grows, I think that's going to be a really positive thing for us.
Obviously, e-commerce comes with the issue of no cash, but I think that people are getting increasingly concerned about cash. And the combination of tap to pay in the physical world where the card doesn't need to leave your hands to go to anybody else in order to transact and the fact that e-commerce doesn't -- cash is not an option, those are -- all of those things, I think structurally, are very positive for us. The thing -- on the flip side also, I mentioned that while business travel is a small piece of our overall travel, that will be one of those things that will be a little bit slower to come back and maybe never back at the level it was pre-COVID-19."

You saw that already in the first quarter, our cross-border was better than we expected. And as a result, our revenues were also quite a bit better than we expected. We're saying that we will step up our investment in the second half and expect our expenses to grow double digits, but if the cross-border business comes back in a meaningful way, I mean that's clearly going to be much better growth on the top line than that double-digit increase in expenses that we're planning.
Also, you should remember that we start lapping the declines in our expenses from last year. Our expenses last year declined by 5% or so in the second half. So when we grow them double digits this year, this fiscal year in the second half, over a 2-year period, we're only growing them about 5%. So net-net, I mean cross-border coming back is going to have a very positive impact on our business, especially if it comes back faster than we might be expecting. In any case, the comparisons get better, so you will begin to see growth in the cross-border business just because of what happened last year."

I mean clearly, the mix of the business between debit and credit has an impact. You all know that debit has clearly outperformed as the primary driver of cash conversion globally. And then in those parts of the world like the U.S. where debit has been a mechanism for distribution of stimulus payments, it's also benefited from that. So mix of business makes a big difference. We are not seeing any reason why that it will not continue to outperform. And credit is recovering, and that's a positive trend.
If you look at places around the world, I mean in Europe, the bulk of the slowdown from Q1 to Q2 was the growing of -- the fact that we had that benefit in the first quarter. We've had some small impact from restrictions. But unless restrictions are becoming more significant, this trend seems to be improving almost everywhere. You saw that in Latin America and CEMEA where we saw meaningful acceleration, and we're not seeing much impact on those trends from additional cases.
So overall the U.S., as I said in my comments, it's almost as if the pandemic didn't happen, right? We grew around 8% first quarter last year, we grew 8% again first quarter this year where, if you believe our growth rate is 8% or 9%, we're almost back on the growth rate. Internationally, we're getting there. And we think that, that trend is meaningfully improving, as you saw. Where we're lagging certainly, where the trend is still soft, is Asia where restrictions remain still significant. And in Europe, there's some increasing restrictions now, and we'll see how they play out."

Even with vaccine proliferation on the horizon, COVID-19 infections really continue to rise, causing restrictions to be implemented in many parts of the world. Amidst the pandemic, Visa delivered strong financial results in our fiscal first quarter. And our strategy to enable money movement globally remains clear: pursuing growth through consumer payments, new flows and value-added services.
On our call today, let me discuss our Q1 results and then provide detail on our momentum this quarter with clients and the valuable solutions they utilize to drive money movement globally. As I review our Q1 results, recall we are going over a quarter where no one had ever heard of COVID-19.
Payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border volume all improved from Q4. Payments volume improved 0.5 point, processing transaction growth improved 1 point and cross-border volume improved 8 points. Net revenues in the fiscal first quarter were $5.7 billion, a year-over-year decrease of 6%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.42, a decrease of 3%. Through our dividends and buybacks, we returned $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in Q1.
Vasant will cover the spending in great detail, so I want to make a few high-level comments on holiday spending. U.S. holiday spending was quite different this year, but had a similar overall growth to the last 3 years of holiday season led by strong retail growth, somewhat offset by travel, entertainment and fuel. This year, in the U.S., we generally saw a continuation of the trends that have been occurring during COVID: strong debit and e-commerce and weaker credit and card presence. Outside the United States, holiday retail spending growth broadly accelerated, with growth in Canada, the U.K., Brazil and Australia all rising by 5 or more points over last year.
Now let me transition to our progress with clients. We continued to win and renew business as we transfer money movement globally through consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. In consumer payments, we continue to focus on digitizing the $18 trillion spent in cash and check globally by working with partners to grow end points and deepen customer engagement with innovation. We are growing credentials with traditional issuers, fintechs and wallets.
Let me start with North America. We are very pleased to have renewed our long-standing partnership with Wells Fargo across consumer debit, credit, small business and commercial for the next 6 years. The Bank of Montreal, Canada's fourth largest bank and the only top 5 Canadian bank not previously issuing with Visa, announced a new partnership with us to issue 2 affluent-lifestyle credit card products in the Canadian market. These products are digital-first, targeting the affluent millennial segment and offer strong rewards and value to cardholders in a differentiated and innovative way.
In our Asia Pacific region, we won the debit business of Malaysia's AmBank after winning the credit business just a quarter ago. Our relationship with LINE Pay also deepened this quarter on 2 fronts. First in Japan, LINE Pay is now issuing a Visa virtual prepaid card. And second, Visa secured an exclusive partnership with LINE BK, Thailand's first social banking platform, for issuance of Visa Debit cards. Within the first month, LINE BK issued 180,000 Visa Debit credentials.
In Russia, YooMoney, one of the country's largest electronic payment services with more than 120,000 merchants worldwide and 40 million end points, signed on to issue Visa credentials in their wallet and enable Visa Direct.
In Europe, we had several notable wins as we continue to increase our business on the continent. Visa secured a business agreement with Santander Group, becoming the preferred partner in credit and commercial for Santander banks across 7 countries in Continental Europe. We also won the prepaid issuance of Mooney, the first proximity banking and payments company in Italy, which offers its services through both digital and retail channels with over 45,000 points of sale in rural and urban areas that can reach 20 million customers. Isbank, the largest private bank in Turkey with 20 million cards, has selected Visa for its consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios. Last, we renewed 2 portfolios with a leading U.K. issuer, one for consumer credit and one for commercial charge card.
We also continue to deepen engagement with our partners to find new ways to remove friction and enhance the client experience through innovation. Just yesterday, we announced the global partnership with TransferWise and the first use case of Visa Cloud Connect, a new way to securely connect to VisaNet through the cloud. The new platform will enable the expansion of TransferWise's multicurrency debit cards in Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, the U.K. and the U.S. and deliver a range of financial services via a mobile app to their customers, including currency exchange and P2P payments, all linked to a Visa card.
Tap to pay continues to expand, representing almost 2/3 of all face-to-face transactions, excluding the United States. In the United States, we have approximately 300 million contactless cards in place now and have high single-digit penetration of face-to-face transactions. Even at this level, the U.S. is now the fourth largest country in the number of tap to pay transactions. Enablement continues to grow as all 500 of Costco's fuel locations and Chipotle and Nordstrom stores now except tap to pay. I'm also pleased to report that the New York City MTA has completed their rollout to all subways and buses. Processing is also a way to bring Visa's innovations to market, and we have made significant progress in Latin America this past quarter in Ecuador, Colombia and Peru and now have reached 100% processing penetration in Chile.
As I close out the consumer payments section, I wanted to note the progress in India. We continue to grow credentials. The Amazon Pay ICICI Bank co-branded credit card in India has set a country record by issuing over 1 million cards in just 20 months. On the acceptance front, India now has 6.5 million acceptance points, including over 1 million QR points, up almost 20 percentage points from a year ago, and 65% of all terminals are tap to pay enabled. The Reserve Bank of India recently raised the contactless limit, which will soon cover 90%-plus of all transactions in India.
Visa has entered into new partnerships with leading acquirers, such as SBI Payments, to launch acceptance solutions such as Tap to Phone and contactless. And Visa is partnering with the largest acquirer in India, HDFC Bank, in the launch and scale-up of SmartHub, an app solution bundling payments, banking and value-added services to help small merchants grow their businesses. We're also contributing to India's Payment Infrastructure Development Fund to encourage growth of physical and digital acceptance in underpenetrated geographies by adding 1 million points of sale and 2 million QR points per year over the next 3 years. All of these efforts build on our leading credit and debit market share in India.
Now on to the second lever of growth, new flows, which represents $185 trillion in opportunity. We are pursuing this opportunity with our traditional commercial card solutions as well as newer capabilities like Visa Direct and B2B Connect. While we're making progress across all new flows, I'll highlight a few advancements from this quarter.
In B2C, big economy payouts and Earned Wage Access continue to grow meaningfully in the wake of COVID. This quarter with DoorDash, we launched the DasherDirect business prepaid card in the U.S., offering the over 1 million Dashers on the DoorDash platform access to daily deposits of earned wages and rich card benefits. In Canada, SkipTheDishes, the country's largest food delivery network, rolled out their Visa Direct-enabled courier payouts called Fast Cash.
P2P, which represents $20 trillion of the flows was Visa Direct's first use case and continued to grow substantially. A key area of future growth is cross-border P2P or remittance. Four of the top 5 global money transfer operators were onboarded in fiscal year '20: TransferWise, Western Union, Remitly and MoneyGram, which noted a 500% increase year-over-year in real-time transfers in December alone.
Our efforts to expand remittance also extends to fintechs and banks who can enable this capability. Zeepay, a fast-growing African fintech, will use Visa Direct to allow Africans to send money across European and North American corridors and soon will expand to all major corridors globally. TransferGo, a global money transfer company that supports migrant workers to send money back to their relatives without paying unnecessary bank fees, has enabled Visa Direct in 55 markets and has the potential to expand to a total of 178 countries in the future, with the upcoming additions such as the U.K., Italy and Nigeria. Across the globe, in the first quarter, Visa Direct transactions grew almost 60%.
Now on to B2B. In cross-border, Goldman Sachs' Transaction Banking recently signed on to employ Visa B2B Connect for cross-border B2B money movement, offering its corporate clients the ability to transact in over 80 markets globally. We are very pleased that our partnership with Goldman continues to deepen on multiple fronts.
In the virtual card-based business, we've expanded our relationship with U.K.-based Conferma Pay to launch Visa Commercial Pay, which has 3 offerings: a mobile app enabling virtual card issuance and management for business incidentals; two, a solution to manage business travel spend with enhanced data; and three, an integrated payables platform that can seamlessly send payments to suppliers. Barclays has already launched this functionality for their commercial clients.
Currently, essentially all of these new flows are transacted in traditional fiat currencies. But there's a growing interest in digital currencies, and I wanted to take a minute to talk about how Visa thinks about crypto in general and our approach.
In this space, we see ways that we can add differentiated value to the ecosystem. And we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help make cryptocurrencies more safe, useful and applicable for payments through our global presence, our partnership approach and our trusted brand. We think of the crypto market in 2 segments. First, there are cryptocurrencies that represent new assets such as Bitcoin. Second, there are digital currencies or stable coins that are directly backed by existing fiat currencies.
We see all currencies in that first segment as digital gold. They are predominantly held as assets that are not used as a form of payment in a significant way at this point. Our strategy here is to work with wallets and exchanges to enable users to purchase these currencies using their Visa credentials or to cash out onto our Visa credential to make a fiat purchase at any of the 70 million merchants where Visa is accepted globally. This is similar to our approach to connect closed-loop wallets such as LINE Pay and Paytm.
For the second segment, fiat-backed digital currencies, including stable coins and central bank digital currencies, these are an emerging payments innovation that could have the potential to be used for global commerce, much like any other fiat currency. We think of digital currencies running on public blockchains as additional networks just like RTP or ACH networks, so we see them as part of our network of networks strategy.
Across both of these segments, we are the clear leader in this space. Today, 35 of the leading digital currency platforms and wallets have already chosen to issue Visa, including coin-based Crypto.com, BlackFi, Fold and BitPanda. These wallet relationships represent the potential for more than 50 million Visa credentials. The next leading network has a fraction of that. And it goes without saying, to the extent a specific digital currency becomes a recognized means of exchange, there's no reason why we cannot add it to our network, which already supports over 160 currencies today.
Let me now turn to our third growth lever, value-added services. Here, we saw our revenue grow at 19% in Q1, and let me name a few services with notable progress this quarter.
As e-commerce explodes, interest in CyberSource remained strong for merchants as well as from fintechs and acquirers looking to leverage our capabilities to offer to their clients. This quarter, 2 additional leading acquirers signed on to use CyberSource: KBank in Thailand and NAB in Australia. As one of the largest debit and prepaid issuer processors, we've been looking to expand Visa DPS globally. In that vein, we are pleased to share that we're bringing our Visa Debit processing system to Europe. DKB, our largest issuing bank in Germany, has chosen DPS as its debit processor and recently processed Visa's inaugural European DPS transaction via their platform. DKB will also be able to take advantage of nearly 20 value-added services through this connection.
We have believed for years that installments represent an important opportunity in payments. To enable this capability, we offer our own network solution for issuers, merchants and fintech installment providers to use directly or also work with many -- and we also work with many installment providers to develop new solutions. This quarter, we have updates on both fronts.
We signed a global deal with Afterpay, extending our U.S. relationship to an additional 7 countries where Afterpay will use Visa technology to accelerate its global expansion. In addition, Visa and Afterpay will test and collaborate on the application of new technologies like tokenization and Visa Direct. We announced in July that Commerce Bank in the United States was piloting a network solution and has now -- it has now launched with over -- with about 300,000 customers live. Visa also signed Scotiabank as the first Canadian bank to launch a post-purchase installment pilot with employees in December with a full market rollout slated for mid-2021.
All of these growth levers, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, are driven by our network of networks strategy, which is enabling all forms of payments, utilizing all networks and providing the value-added services you would expect from Visa as we enable money movement.
In closing, a few points. Domestic volumes driven by debit and e-commerce are really holding up well. Holiday spending, while differing in terms of categories and timing, was quite good. Q1 overall was a very solid quarter and positive momentum continued, albeit we are still impacted by COVID-19. We are continuing to work very hard to balance expense management in recognition of the short-term realities and investing in an exciting set of growth opportunities as we always manage the business for the long term. We continue to be focused on our 3 growth levers, all of which are supported by our network of networks. And lastly, we are hopeful that as vaccines roll out and become more readily available, lockdowns, travel restrictions and capacity constraints will be lessened or eliminated, enabling travel, entertainment and other commerce to grow.
With that, over to Vasant for more color on our volumes and our financials."

This will be the last quarter where our performance is compared to a quarter with no COVID impact whatsoever. As such,",2553,"Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. During our fiscal first quarter last year, COVID-19 was not yet a word in the English language. This will be the last quarter where our performance is compared to a quarter with no COVID impact whatsoever. As such, our results this quarter provide a clear picture of the state of the recovery.
Overall the quarter was stronger than we expected with net revenue down 6%, largely due to the cross-border business. EPS declined only 3% helped by lower expenses and a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shifts versus last year increased reported net revenue growth by less than 0.5 point and EPS growth by less than 1 point.
As we approach the first anniversary of the pandemic, where do we stand across our key business drivers relative to where we might have been had the pandemic never happened? Global payments volume is 4 to 5 points short of where we might have been, debit has outperformed helped by accelerated cash displacement and credit is still a drag. In the U.S., we are actually back to our pre-pandemic growth trajectory with debit significantly ahead, offsetting credit underperformance.
As you know, where we are well behind is in our cross-border business. In the first quarter of fiscal '21, our cross-border volumes were almost 40% lower, excluding intra-Europe volumes, than they might have been had the pandemic never happened, largely due to travel. Cross-border travel volume, both card-present and card-not-present, is still down almost 70% relative to where it might have been at this point.
Let's start with a review of the key business drivers in the fiscal first quarter. Global payments volume and transaction growth rates were modestly better than the prior quarter. The cross-border volume recovery continued even as most borders remain completely or partially closed. The trajectory of the domestic spending recovery varies across the globe. Some regions and countries are recovering fast, others are holding steady, while some have slowed in recent weeks as a result of new restrictions. What remains consistent globally is very strong debit and e-commerce spending, which is partially offset by weaker credit and in-store spending. Although constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, is still down 33%, there was an 8-point improvement from last quarter.
Payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew 4.5%. Debit was up 17%, 3 percentage points lower than last quarter. While credit declined 6%, up 3 percentage points from Q4. Growth excluding China was 7%, up almost 1 point as Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded card conversions, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. volume growth -- U.S. payments volume growth was 8%, up 0.5 point from last quarter. Debit growth remained strong at 21%. Debit growth was 3 points lower than the fourth quarter, largely driven by a step-down in unemployment benefits distributed via Visa prepaid cards.
Credit spending declined 3% year-over-year, a 4-point improvement versus last quarter, driven by an acceleration in retail spending and some recovery in travel and restaurant spending. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, continued to grow over 30% in the quarter, primarily driven by retail spending. The decline in card-present spending was consistent with last quarter. However, performance did deteriorate through the quarter as rising COVID cases led to further government-imposed restrictions in several states and cities. Card-present spending slowdowns were more significant in the restaurant segment as well as during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend across most segments.
Across 10 categories, growth was relatively consistent with the prior quarter. Categories which have been growing above their pre-COVID levels have remained elevated, including food and drugstores, home improvement and retail goods. For categories that are the hardest hit by this pandemic, including travel, entertainment, fuel and restaurants, spending remained depressed with year-over-year declines consistent with last quarter. International payments volume grew 2% in Q1, or 6% excluding China, both of which are up 1 point versus last quarter.
A few regional highlights. CEMEA remains our best-performing region, growing 19% in constant dollars in the quarter, a more than 4-point improvement over Q4. The easing of COVID-related restrictions, particularly in the Middle East, and client wins drove the robust growth.
Latin America grew 16% in constant dollars, a nearly 10-point acceleration from last quarter. This growth acceleration is fueled by limited COVID-related restrictions in most countries, elevated e-commerce spending compared to other regions and growing our market share with client wins in a few of the larger countries.
Europe grew 5% in constant dollars, a 4-point slowdown versus last quarter. This deceleration was driven partially by renewed restrictions in the second half of the quarter due to rapidly rising COVID infection rates, particularly in the U.K., France, Italy and Germany. And also, as you may remember, growth in Europe last quarter benefited from a nonrecurring event in the U.K. related to purchases of higher interest-bearing savings funds.
Asia Pacific declined 8% in constant dollars. Excluding China, Q1 spending was flat, a 4-point improvement since last quarter. There continued to be more COVID-related restrictions in effect across Asia than other parts of the world. However, several larger markets, such as New Zealand, Australia, Korea and Japan, have returned to growth.
Processed transactions growth was 4%, up 1 point from last quarter. Growth accelerated faster than payments volume as transaction sizes continue to normalize ex Europe. Increased COVID-related restrictions in Europe are driving higher average ticket sizes, causing transactions growth to slow. Latin America is benefiting from processing wins in several countries, including Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Chile.
Visa Direct continues to perform very well, with transactions growing almost 60% globally this quarter. Growth remained strong in every region as we continue to launch new use cases; further penetrate existing use cases, such as Earned Wage Access and cross-border remittance; and expand existing use cases to new geographies.
Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, declined 33% in Q1, an 8-point improvement from the last quarter. Travel-related spend declined 64% but improved 6 points versus the fourth quarter. Card-not-present nontravel growth was 20%, up 3 points, fueled by strong retail spending in November and December. Constant dollar cross-border volume, including transactions within Europe, declined 21% in the quarter.
Although cross-border travel performance improved steadily through the quarter, the travel improvement was concentrated in only a few markets where borders are open. Travel from the U.S. to several countries in Latin America remained strong, including Mexico and the Caribbean. The U.A.E. has been open to travelers, attracting people from Europe, Russia and other Gulf countries. Also, travel across countries within the former Soviet Union has been growing.
Unfortunately, the majority of borders remain closed or imposed significant requirements on international travelers. The World Tourism Organization reported in December that out of 217 countries, 118 countries, or 54%, still had completely or partially closed their borders to foreign visitors. Of the remaining 99 countries, the majority are mandating COVID tests with quarantines. Very few countries have no COVID restrictions. Significant obstacles in crossing borders remain the single most important factor driving the slow recovery of cross-border travel.
A quick review of first quarter financial results. Net revenue declined 6%, better than our expectations, primarily due to stronger-than-expected cross-border volumes and lower client incentives. Value-added services continue to perform well, growing 19%. It's important to note that had we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, it would have had minimal impact on our Q1 net revenue growth because payment volume growth was very similar across both quarters.
Service revenues grew 5%, roughly in line, with nominal payments volume growth last quarter. Data processing grew 6%, with high teens value-added services growth continuing to be partially offset by the mix shift away from higher-yielding cross-border transactions. International transaction revenues were down 28%, 4 points better than cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, due to favorable country mix and currency volatility benefits. Other revenues grew 5% led by value-added services but continue to be negatively impacted by declines in the usage of travel-related card benefits.
Client incentives were 24.6% of gross revenues, approximately 1 point lower than expected. This was driven by 3 factors. First, a few large deals expected to be signed in the first quarter were delayed to the second quarter. Second, cross-border volume was better than we expected, particularly in the month of December. As we have said in the past, client incentives are mostly tied to payments volume, so outperformance in high-yielding cross-border volumes lowers our incentives as a percent of gross revenues. And third, payments volume growth only improved 0.5 point versus last quarter. As such, there was minimal impact on current quarter client incentives from current quarter volume.
On the operating expense front, we continue to benefit from actions we implemented last spring. Our head count is lower, our spending on external services has been scaled back, travel continues to be very restricted and some marketing spend has been curtailed. Both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses declined 10%, which was better than expected, partly due to timing shifts in client co-marketing as well as certain product and technology investments to later in the year.
Non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $112 million for the fiscal quarter. This was over $30 million lower than expected due to 2 nonrecurring items. First, investment income tied to deferred compensation was higher. This is offset in personnel costs and, therefore, income neutral. And second, an interest expense reserve was released due to the conclusion of certain tax audits. The non-GAAP tax rate was lower than expected at 16.6%. During the quarter, the conclusion of tax audits in certain jurisdictions resulted in an $81 million benefit. In addition to this specific benefit, our tax rate is typically lower in the first quarter due to the impact of employee equity vesting.
GAAP and non-GAAP EPS was $1.42, a decrease of 3%. We bought 8.7 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $202.30 for $1.8 billion this quarter. Our Board has authorized a new $8 billion share repurchase program, bringing total funds available for repurchases to over $11 billion. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned approximately $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. In December, we repaid $3 billion of debt upon maturity of senior notes issued 5 years ago.
Moving on to some perspectives on the second fiscal quarter, starting with business driver trends through January 21. Through January 21, U.S. payments volume growth was 12%, with U.S. debit growing 30% and credit declining 6%. Debit growth is 10 points higher than the November, December run rate fueled by government stimulus payments distributed right around January 1. Weekly growth trends show a sharp step-up in growth in the first week of January and a step-down in week 3. January credit growth has slowed 3 points since December, which is more in line with the November trend.
While U.S. payments volume growth has accelerated, there are many countries where constant dollar growth is slowing due to increased restrictions as COVID infections rise. In Asia Pacific, Japan, Australia, India and Singapore payments volume growth has slowed 4 to 5 points versus December. In Europe, countries such as the U.K., Italy, Denmark and Germany all have at least 10 points slower growth in January. So far, growth rates are relatively steady in both CEMEA and Latin America.
Through January 21, processed transactions growth remained at 4% with acceleration in the U.S., offset by slowing growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis, declined 33%, in line with the first quarter but below the trends we saw in December.
In a fast-changing environment, accurate forecasting remains difficult. How long will elevated spending driven by stimulus payments last? How long will stepped up restrictions and lockdowns persist? How will these 2 countervailing trends balance out country by country? Will cross-border travel sustain the slow recovery even as some new restrictions go into play? These are just some of the uncertainties as we look ahead to the next 3 months.
Based on the trends to this point, our best sense is that the second quarter gross revenue growth rate will recover to be flattish with last year with most of the improvement driven by international revenues. Growth in other -- in the other revenue lines is expected to have a small uptick due to easier year-over-year comparisons in the second half of March.
First quarter client incentives were 1 point below our expectations. Second quarter client incentives could be 1 point above the high end of the 25.5% to 26.5% range we expect for the year. This would put first half incentives right in the middle of the range. There are several reasons for the step-up of client incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the second quarter even with continued improvement in cross border.
First, as I mentioned earlier, a few large deals moved from the first to the second quarter, one of which, Wells Fargo, was signed in January as Al noted. Second, as we told you in October, many clients did not meet certain volume thresholds in calendar year 2020 and, as such, did not earn corresponding incentives. As volume recovers in 2021, we expect clients will hit growth thresholds and earn these incentives. We accrue incentives accordingly, starting with the first quarter of the new calendar year. This quarter is a larger increase unique to the year of the recovery. And third, the impact of renewals we had already expected in the second quarter.
Due to the step-up in client incentives as a percent of gross revenue, the net revenue decline in the second quarter is expected to be comparable to the decline we reported in the first quarter even as the gross revenue growth rate continues to recover. Exchange rate shifts could benefit second quarter net revenue growth by less than 1 point.
We expect operating expenses to grow in the low to mid-single digits in the second quarter as we begin to lap the expense reductions implemented last year. We still plan to grow expenses in the double digits in the second half as we step up investments on key growth initiatives in anticipation of a return to normalcy by the end of fiscal 2021. Nonoperating expense should be $145 million approximately, which is similar to the first quarter, if you exclude the 2 nonrecurring items I mentioned earlier.
There is no change in our tax rate expectations. It is still too early to predict what impact the U.S. election will have on our taxes. As always, we will provide updates as the year progresses.
In summary, as you can see, our business remains resilient. Both debit and e-commerce growth are sustaining well above pre-COVID levels as the accelerated shift to digital payments becomes a habit. Cross-border growth is poised to recover sharply once vaccines facilitate reopening of borders and we lap last year's steep declines. Our new flows and value-added services businesses have continued to grow robustly through the worst of the pandemic.
As Al indicated, we have stayed focused on our long-term growth initiatives, and we'll be stepping up the level of investment in the second half in anticipation of a post-COVID world with accelerating growth.
With that, I'll turn this back to Mike."

Well, first of all, let me answer the last part of the question. This was a single lawsuit brought by a single regulator about one specific M&A transaction, so I don't believe that this portends anything about the future and our ability to continue to try to acquire companies. As we said a couple of weeks ago, we ended up making the decision that this was just going to go on for too long. And we all know that the payments marketplace is moving with great speed on so many fronts. And the idea that we would tie ourselves up on this transaction, and frankly, the plan would tie themselves up through long-term litigation that could go all the way through an appeal, in and of itself was not appealing to us in terms of all the other things that we thought we could be investing in and spending management time on and spending our dollars on.
We're continuing to forge down a path of making sure that we are a real player in this space of open banking and believe that we have a lot of the assets already. What Plaid was going to do was going to get us into the -- specifically into the data extraction type of business, which would have added to our network of networks. But it doesn't, in and of itself, prevent us from doing more going forward. We also still have the ability in that space to partner with Plaid. We have the ability to partner with other players around the world. And in many cases, that might give us the ability to partner with players that understand the nuances of specific markets in which they do work.
We'll continue to look to make sure that we -- to the degree that any use cases are going to form here, the most -- the use case that probably would have the most chance of stepping out and being something that takes -- has some legs behind it would be account to account. And I think we're very well positioned there. We're positioned well to make sure that we can provide payment capabilities for the various fintechs that we are doing business with today, and we have the ability to continue to sell value-added services to all of those players. So I think that ultimately, as we have in the past, we will invest to grow internally, we will look to partner and we will look to buy. And it will be a combination of capabilities and approaches that will allow us to continue to be a player in this space."

And we do have -- well, we think we have the Tokyo Olympics coming up in the summer months. I mean there are some people who think that might be in some peril. At the moment, it's going forward. We held marketing to really set relatively modest levels in this past quarter, but I would certainly expect us to be driving marketing up. Basically, when we go to market in our business, it's a combination of putting people resources, our technology resources and our marketing muscle behind whatever we're doing. And so those are the areas that I would expect to see us grow going forward.
And then, of course, I mean we really have dramatically curtailed T&E and professional services. And I think that to the degree that later in the year we begin to get some people back to offices and we begin to see some people get back on airplanes, we'll see some modest increases in those expense areas. But we've been really careful about both our people-level spending and our technology-level spending and our marketing-level spending. And I think as conditions warrant, we'll be dialing those up. Vasant gave you some insight into what -- where we think expenses are going to be in the second half. And we think there's some really good opportunities that I want to make sure that if, in fact, as we believe that we'll be in some form of normalcy by the end of this fiscal year, we want to make sure that we have good momentum going into fiscal '22."

And all of those will tend to continue to produce very good volumes, and they'll move with transactions as transaction tools. About 1/3 of our value-added services are split between services revenue, which tends to be card benefits that are offered as a package. And then in other revenue, we have volumes that are not -- I'm sorry, we have services not tied to volumes, things like consultants, our consulting practice and travel-related card benefits that obviously have been down. So I think as travel would be -- to come back at some point, that obviously would help that volume.
So -- with that color we saw -- obviously, in a world where e-commerce and omni-commerce is becoming a big deal. Cyber volume was very, very good and grow revenue. We continue to have more and more customers engage with us on risk and identity services.

And to an earlier question I think Don asked, we're going to continue to invest in that area. And look, there's markets where we haven't even really laid any trap for Visa Direct. There's use cases where we haven't laid any traps, and our plan is to continue to do that.
If we look at the very first Visa Direct use case which continues to grow substantially, P2P payments, there's still lots to do both in domestic P2P payments, but we think our key future growth area is in cross-border P2P and remittance, and we're beginning to take steps there to enable that. And I mentioned in my remarks the fact that we've got relationships with 4 of the 5 top global money transfer operators, and that's helping us quite a bit. I think Earned Wage Access really continues to be a real opportunity. And I touched a little bit on a few of those cases. But there's still lots of geographies and lots of organizations that we have the ability to penetrate to grow that.
And then you've got on the B2C use cases, things like food and grocery delivery and online gaming and insurance claim payouts. So all of those are, I would say, in the early innings of a baseball game in terms of our ability to continue to make progress and drive those. So I continue to believe that this platform of which we can generate dozens and dozens of use cases will, for quite some, time be really important to us from a growth perspective."

I think I've said before, I think Vasant said before, we're not in the business of picking winners and losers. We see our job as enablement no matter what the model is. But in some cases, the player is the actual lender. In some cases, they're sourcing a lender. In some cases, the installments are very short term, weeks at a time. In some cases, they're long term. Some providers only do installments. Some allow multiple payment options: pay now, pay on delivery, pay off on various numbers of installments. And then obviously, this is where it's exciting for us, multiple ways to pay off installments: virtual cards, debit cards, ACH. And it's also a payment model today that's heavily funded by the merchant.
Our strategy, Chris, is to be broad, to play with multiple third-party providers and offer a Visa platform to enable issuers to offer pay now -- buy now, pay now -- pay later capability. And we seek to work with all these options. And obviously, what we want to do is get virtual cards for Visa in place as one option for repayment. We also want to put Visa cards on file as another option. And I would remind you that these installments do break -- at its core, these installments break a transaction or a purchase into 3 or 4 or 5 payment transactions, which is good for us, because it gives us more transactions on which to earn fees."

So I guess I just want to know, you're assuming now some deterioration or more conservatism in cross-border before maybe it gets better later in the year.
And then I guess, Al, maybe I could just squeeze in. Structurally, again, things like debit are seeming to be somewhat sustainable. It's not all just people using more nondiscretionary.

There are many variables here that go into it in a time like this when things are moving around quite a bit. Certainly, cross-border doing better helps. Renewals will have an impact. Sometimes they happen when we expect, sometimes they don't.
There's also the year-over-year improvements that our clients have. As you know, last year, many clients, because of the pandemic, didn't hit certain thresholds. This year, if things are recovering faster, there could be -- we think they'll all make their thresholds and more. That has a year-over-year impact and it varies by client. So there's a bunch of these things moving around at the same time. And the good news is we think we're right in the middle of the range, and we'll give you more as we go through the year."

Not -- you've got the stimulus payments that are on prepaid cards, which count in -- we count prepaid in our debit business. As e-commerce has moved into more everyday categories, people are using debit. People are more comfortable in tough situations, tough times, to use money they have versus borrow money that they don't have. But I think when I look ahead structurally, to answer your question, look, I think e-commerce adoption has probably accelerated 3 to 5 years in the last year. And I don't think that's going backward. I think that people who have gotten used to shopping on their phone or their tablet or their computer are going to continue to do that.
I think the other thing that I look at structurally that's really exciting is there's a great opportunity to continue to grow both sides of this 2-sided market of buyers and sellers. Wallet proliferation is continuing. And we're working really hard to get credentials in wallets, which just adds to the -- these wallets, in essence, of becoming issuers. And that helps generate more buyers. And the cost of acceptance is going down around the world as more and more players are getting into it, and that's going to grow the number of sellers on our network. And as that network grows, I think that's going to be a really positive thing for us.
Obviously, e-commerce comes with the issue of no cash, but I think that people are getting increasingly concerned about cash. And the combination of tap to pay in the physical world where the card doesn't need to leave your hands to go to anybody else in order to transact and the fact that e-commerce doesn't -- cash is not an option, those are -- all of those things, I think structurally, are very positive for us. The thing -- on the flip side also, I mentioned that while business travel is a small piece of our overall travel, that will be one of those things that will be a little bit slower to come back and maybe never back at the level it was pre-COVID-19."

You saw that already in the first quarter, our cross-border was better than we expected. And as a result, our revenues were also quite a bit better than we expected. We're saying that we will step up our investment in the second half and expect our expenses to grow double digits, but if the cross-border business comes back in a meaningful way, I mean that's clearly going to be much better growth on the top line than that double-digit increase in expenses that we're planning.
Also, you should remember that we start lapping the declines in our expenses from last year. Our expenses last year declined by 5% or so in the second half. So when we grow them double digits this year, this fiscal year in the second half, over a 2-year period, we're only growing them about 5%. So net-net, I mean cross-border coming back is going to have a very positive impact on our business, especially if it comes back faster than we might be expecting.

I mean clearly, the mix of the business between debit and credit has an impact. You all know that debit has clearly outperformed as the primary driver of cash conversion globally. And then in those parts of the world like the U.S. where debit has been a mechanism for distribution of stimulus payments, it's also benefited from that. So mix of business makes a big difference. We are not seeing any reason why that it will not continue to outperform. And credit is recovering, and that's a positive trend.
If you look at places around the world, I mean in Europe, the bulk of the slowdown from Q1 to Q2 was the growing of -- the fact that we had that benefit in the first quarter. We've had some small impact from restrictions. But unless restrictions are becoming more significant, this trend seems to be improving almost everywhere. You saw that in Latin America and CEMEA where we saw meaningful acceleration, and we're not seeing much impact on those trends from additional cases.
So overall the U.S., as I said in my comments, it's almost as if the pandemic didn't happen, right? We grew around 8% first quarter last year, we grew 8% again first quarter this year where, if you believe our growth rate is 8% or 9%, we're almost back on the growth rate. Internationally, we're getting there. And we think that, that trend is meaningfully improving, as you saw. Where we're lagging certainly, where the trend is still soft, is Asia where restrictions remain still significant. And in Europe, there's some increasing restrictions now, and we'll see how they play out."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to provide a few quick stats on the quarter and then share my thoughts on what's ahead as the world continues to recover. The recovery is going to take many different shapes, and the timing will differ around the world based on vaccination rollouts and the easing of restrictions. But we believe we're at the beginning of the end of the pandemic and the recovery is well underway, at least in a number of markets. 
First, Q2 results, revenue declined 2% year-over-year, but would be slightly positive at 20 basis points if service revenues were recognized on current quarter payments volume. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.38, a decrease of 1%. When looking at volumes and transactions growth, keep in mind that we're now lapping the start of the pandemic. As growth rates are now less indicative of performance in the business trajectory, we're going to also provide some metrics compared to 2019 on a constant dollar basis. So payments volume grew 11%, improving 7 points from Q1 and reached 116% of 2019, which is up 3 points from Q1. Cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe, declined 21%, but improved 12 points from Q1 and is 75% of 2019 levels, 3 points better than Q1. Process transactions growth of 8% improved 4 points from Q1 and represented 116% of 2019, which is consistent with the first quarter. 
This quarter, we continued to make progress across our 3 growth levers. First, consumer payments. In Asia Pacific, we renewed our partnership with Rakuten Card, a subsidiary of Rakuten Group, the largest e-commerce marketplace in Japan. In Korea, these are one of the first hotel chain co-brand in the country with Marriott and Shinhan Card, Korea's largest issuer. In China, we renewed our credit portfolios with CITIC Bank and Agricultural Bank of China, 2 of the top 10 largest banks in the country. Also on the co-brand front in Brazil, Samsung in partnership with Banco Itaú, will issue their inaugural co-brand in Latin America with Visa targeting Samsung's 57 million Brazilian users. In Europe, Visa won incremental business with [ PNB Paribas Fortis ] in Belgium. This expands our relationship to include 4 million debit cards in addition to our existing credit relationship. In Switzerland, we've gained significant traction in growing Visa Debit. Since this January of 2019, we have signed 13 new debit deals, representing an incremental 2.6 million cards. 
In new flows, Visa Direct transactions grew almost 60% in the second quarter. We're pleased to have clients going live now on with Visa Direct payouts, which offers a flexible set of APIs for Visa partners globally to use a single point of connection for push payments to cards and accounts. Moneygram, Goldman Sachs Transaction Banking, Standard Charter Bank Hong Kong and Kit Global are among the first to start utilizing Visa Direct payouts for B2C, cross-border P2P and B2b payouts. 
A few additional highlights on specific Visa Direct use cases include that in the marketplace payouts, Airbnb, which now has 4 million hosts globally, will offer host payouts using Visa Direct in select markets. In cross-border P2P, [ Remitly ], a top digital remittance fintech, has renewed its Visa direct relationships, building upon the past 2 years of partnership. And Monobank in Ukraine enabled cross-border P2P to their 1.7 million cardholders. 
In the payroll category, the earned wage access use case continues to grow, with 25 earned wage access platforms now offering Visa Direct for fast and convenient access to employee earnings. G2C continues to grow as well. [ Global Blue ], a leading tax-free shopping solutions company covering 52 countries and 35 million tax-free transactions in 2019, is utilizing Visa Direct to distribute tax refund payments across Europe. Separate from Visa Direct, we supported the U.S. government's disbursements of economic impact payments to nearly 13 million Visa prepaid credentials in the U.S. so far this year. 
And now to our third growth, our value-added services, we're continuing to see strong adoption. Let me highlight a couple of examples. For [ CyberSource Plantic ], a European acquirer and payment services provider that delivers payment processing and currency conversion solutions to over 600,000 merchants. We'll be partnering with CyberSource to simplify payments across the hospitality, food and beverage and retail sectors. KeyBanc, a top U.S. acquirer, will begin to offer CyberSource to its merchant clients. And as e-commerce continues to grow, Decision Manager, a key risk offering of CyberSource, increased transactions over 30% fiscal year-to-date. 
Our other risk fraud and authentication capabilities grew as well. For example, we've now crossed the $2 billion token milestone, up from 1.4 billion tokens just in September. One of our key authentication capabilities, [ Cardinal Commerce], grew revenue almost 40 -- almost 50% year-over-year this quarter by rapidly expanding beyond its U.S. origins. In the next year, we plan to more than double our clients in Europe and Central Europe, Middle East and Africa. 
So while the pandemic has disrupted the world, it has not changed our strategy. In fact, it has reinforced our belief that our 3 areas of focus will deliver robust growth for years to come. As we look ahead with COVID recovery underway, a few key important realities, namely the way consumers feel about e-commerce, cash and travel, will particularly impact Visa. The pandemic has accelerated e-commerce, global card-not-present credentials  [indiscernible] cross-border, excluding Intra-Europe, it's averaged 20% growth. We believe this shift is likely to persist as the convenience of e-commerce is indisputable, and its growth continues to be robust even as card-present begins to return. In March, in the United States, as some states loosened transactions, card-present as a percentage of 2019 spend improved 11 points versus February. While at the same time, card-not-present, excluding travel, still expanded 8 points. 
If you look at that in Japan, where restrictions were also lifted, card-present improved 6 points and card-not-present, excluding travel, still improved 4 points in that same comparison between March and February. 
The pandemic has accelerated the digitization of cash and we see the impact in debit and tap to pay. When we look at cash usage in the last 12 months, just on the Visa brand, such as with ATM withdrawals, we see that global debit cash volumes have decreased by 7%, while debit payments growth payment volume has grown 16%, both on a constant dollar basis. This 20-point gap is more than double the historic gap in growth rates and relatively consistent globally, demonstrating cash digitization in both mature and emerging regions. Overall, Visa tap-to-pay transactions have grown over 30% year-over-year in March. 
In Europe, less than a year since contactless limits increased across the region, Visa has seen 1 billion additional touch-free transactions. In the United States, 1 in 10 face-to-face Visa transactions are now done with a tap, more than a 2x increase since the beginning of the pandemic. In New York City, the penetration is nearly 30%, demonstrating the potential of focused issuance and merchant enablement, along with transit. In the past 3 years alone, we've enabled nearly 250 transit systems globally, and we can see, based on our research, that enabling tap-to-pay on transit and bring more than a 15% lift in transactions for merchants in the surrounding neighborhoods. The decline in travel is temporary, and we're starting to see some early signs of recovery. 
Cross-border travel-related spending, excluding Intra-Europe, improved from Q1, driven by 2 factors. First, those who are abroad are spending more likely because of fewer restrictions. This quarter, essentially all of the cross-border travel spend improvement was driven by higher spend per card rather than more active cards. Second, we continue to see strength from countries with open border. For example, U.S. to Mexico volume was almost 20% above 2019 levels for the quarter. We also sourced several top corridors between the U.S. and Latin America improved by more than 10 points through the quarter versus 2019. Travel will certainly take more time to recover than other sectors, but we believe personal travel, in particular, will come back, and that's good for Visa for 2 primary reasons. One, because the vast majority of the travel we capture on our credentials is consumer; and two, we are the global leader in travel co-brands. 
With the backdrop of travel cash digitization and e-commerce, let's briefly explore the future potential of our 3 growth levers. In consumer payments, in the last 2 years, we've grown our credentials to 3.6 billion in physical merchant locations to over 70 million, up 7% and 34%, respectively. And remember that our merchant locations only count our partners like PayPal and square each as one. That said, there's ample opportunity as we focus on specific regions and partners. Looking at regions, even with our leading position in both emerging and developed markets, our market-driven approach to growing credentials is succeeding. And Europe is an excellent example. From 2018 to 2020, we grew active card credentials by 10%. And looking ahead, we have line of sight to more than 25 million additional credentials across 50 clients in the next few years. 
Let me cite a couple of recent partnerships that would show this rapid growth. Since [ Fintech Revolut ] signed a global agreement in September 2019 selecting Visa as their lead issuing partner, they've increased the number of cards and payments volume by more than 200% through December 2020. Crypto.com has launched Visa cards in 39 markets across their 10 million user base since 2018. And just this quarter, they signed a global growth agreement with us, covering 12 markets with plans to expand to even more. There are so many more partners issuing credentials and building acceptance. For example, wallet providers represent the potential for another 2 billion credentials and [ 70 billion ] acceptance locations over time, and the pace of growth here is fast. [ Go Money ] in Russia recently signed on to issue Visa credentials and has achieved more than 1 million credentials in just 5 months. 
In fiscal Q2 last year, we announced that STC Pay, Saudi Arabia's largest wireless operator with 25 million subscribers, planned to embed credentials in their STC Pay wallets. To date, more than 1 million Visa credentials have been issued. Our ongoing partnership with Paytm has enabled us to add more than the 250,000 contactless-enabled acceptance locations at new to card merchants. Well, the number of Visa credentials issued by Paytm has more than doubled since September of 2020, reaching a total of $3 million. 
Around the world, tap to phone has also been a significant acceptance effort. Today, more than 35 markets offer it with 13 more being added this year. Wallets and tap to phone are just a couple of next-gen partners and capabilities that we believe will help us bring the [ 1.7 billion ] unbanked into the financial mainstream, growing the pie for digital payments. The growth will come from a regional approach and openness to partnering with traditional and new players and by developing new ways to engage the ecosystem, all rooted in our strong brand and in technology. 
In new flows, our success in the United States is a real asset. While [ B2B ] has been impacted by the pandemic, our strategies against $120 trillion opportunity represent near, medium and longer-term growth for Visa. In the near term, we're focused on supporting businesses small and large. To date, we've helped 12 million micro and small businesses to digitize and grow against our 50 million global goal. And we continue to focus on card-based solutions. Visa has about 20% more commercial issuers today than we did 4 years ago.  In the medium term, Visa B2B Connect addresses the major pain points with the current top solution and cross-border the B2B, and we are continuing to add banks to reach scale. In the longer term, we're working with key partners to solve the challenges of accounts payable and accounts receivable. 
For the other $65 trillion of new flows, Visa Direct has 5 clear competitive advantages that we believe will continue to drive growth. The first one is reach. In Visa Direct, the endpoints are card credentials and bank accounts. And we can reach 5 billion endpoints globally. This is unrivaled by anyone else. Second, operating scale. Visa Direct is built upon the operating scale of VisaNet and leverages its real-time authorization, clearing and settlement capabilities. This means we can deliver industry-leading solutions with low marginal cost. Third is commitment to a network of network strategy. Visa Direct is truly multi-rail, which provides clients flexibility and efficiency. Just in the last year, it has utilized 16 card-based networks, 65 ACM schemes, 7 RTP networks and 5 payment gateways. That is more connections, coverage and capability that we've seen from any other network offering. 
Fourth, investments in our capabilities. We have invested in leading technology stack for both payouts and account funding capabilities. For example, our account funding capabilities include unique codes to help clients manage risk, compliance and authorizations for money movement transactions with APIs to streamline implementation for apps, neobanks and fintechs. To our knowledge, no one else has this capability. Fifth is commercialization. We've now enabled over 20 use cases with more than 450 new program launches, and we will continue to expand by: one, growing existing use cases like marketplaces and cross-border P2P; two, bringing existing use cases like P2P, payroll and earned wage access to other new markets; and three, developing new use cases such as tipping. Visa Direct also brings a network effect in terms of benefits to Visa. For every dollar received on a debit card through Visa Direct, about half of it is then used for debit card purchases. Furthermore, cardholders who received payments through Visa Direct then spend up to 50% more than those who do not. So Visa Direct is actually not only helping new flows, but it is helping consumer payments. 
Lastly, let's turn to value-added services, which are being utilized by our clients more and more. In fiscal year 2020, more than 60% of our clients used at least 5 value-added services from Visa and more than 30% of our clients use 10 or more. Our toolbox is large with hands on consulting, sophisticated and flexible technology platforms valuable data and insight and card benefits, all which will improve with the recovery. We also have 3 platform businesses that scale very profitably, CyberSource, issuer processing and risk identity and authentication. With the recovery and the continued strength in e-commerce and debit, these capabilities are well aligned with trends towards digitization. 
Let me just speak about CyberSource as an example. Our strategy to partner with acquirers creates a leveraged opportunity for future growth, both transaction growth and cross-selling value-added services. We mentioned last year that Japanese acquirer SMCC, was going to start offering CyberSource capabilities to its merchant customers. Starting with 1 nationwide convenience store chain and rapidly expanding to over 30,000 merchants, SMCC is now delivering next-generation acquiring solutions to Japanese merchants and CyberSource is processing over 0.5 million e-commerce and in person transactions per day. 
With all this opportunity across the 3 levers, we are investing heavily to drive future growth in several areas, including simple, compelling user experiences. Examples include tap to pay, tap to phone and quick [indiscernible]. Capabilities to scale new flows and value-added services, examples include new Visa Direct use cases and advancing fraud and identity solutions. Specific markets that can benefit from targeted resources such as Europe and Africa, innovations in the payments ecosystem, such as crypto APIs for banks and digital currency settlement. 
So to close, Visa has weathered the COVID storm and is emerging from the pandemic even stronger. There's significant opportunity ahead and Visa's existing present scale and capabilities position us well to capture more growth in the future. With that, now let me turn it over to Vasant for more colors on our financials and what we see ahead. Vasant, over to you."
38043467,710499687,2259810,"Visa Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal second quarter results were stronger than we expected, with net revenue down 2%, largely due to improving cross-border volumes and lower-than-expected client incentives. GAAP EPS was flat to last year an",2088,"Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal second quarter results were stronger than we expected, with net revenue down 2%, largely due to improving cross-border volumes and lower-than-expected client incentives. GAAP EPS was flat to last year and non-GAAP EPS declined 1%, helped by a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shift increased net revenue by 0.5 point but lowered EPS by 0.5 point due to currency-related benefits in the second quarter last year. 
As Al mentioned, as we lap the most significant COVID-19 impact starting in March 2020, year-over-year growth rates are not the best indicator of the underlying trend. To help you better assess both the magnitude and the trajectory of the recovery so far, we have also provided growth rates for key performance metrics relative to fiscal year '19. In constant dollars, global payments volume, year-over-year growth was over 11%, fueled by continued strength in debit as well as improving credit spending. Compared to the corresponding quarter in 2019, global payments volume was 16% higher, a 3-point acceleration from the first quarter. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 13% or 20% higher than 2019 as Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by newer branded card conversion, which have minimal revenue impact. 
U.S. payments volume growth was 18% and up 24% from 2019, benefiting from economic impact payments in early January and mid-March as well as the relaxing of COVID-related restrictions in many states, partially offset by bad weather, lowering spending in mid-February. Even after adjusting for economic impact payments, U.S. payments volumes have bounced back to the pre-COVID trend line. Debit growth accelerated 13 points to 34%, up 44% from 2019, boosted by the 2 economic impact payments in this quarter. Credit growth was 2%, up 6% from 2019. The credit improvement was helped by increases in retail, travel, restaurant and entertainment spending, mostly starting in early March, as restrictions were relaxed in many states. It is important to note that credit has improved without debit slowing, pointing to accelerated cash displacement. 
Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, continue to grow over 30% in the quarter and was 55% above 2019 levels, primarily driven by retail spend. The most notable sign of a domestic recovery was card-present spend growing 4%, which is up 3% over 2019, an 8-point acceleration from the first quarter, led by retail and restaurant spending. Improving card-present spending does not slow e-commerce, indicating that e-commerce strength is likely to continue even as card-present spend recovers. 
[ International comps in ] dollar payments volume growth was 6%, up 9% from 2019. A few regional highlights. CEMEA remains our fastest growing region, growing 26%, up 50% from 2019 levels. The easing of COVID-related restrictions, particularly in the Middle East and Russia as well as client wins, drove the robust growth. Latin America grew 23%, up 40% from 2019, with consistently strong performance across the region, mostly fueled by accelerating e-commerce adoption and usage as well as client wins. Europe grew 2%, up 8% from 2019, but decelerated from the last quarter as many countries put significant COVID restrictions in place, particularly the U.K., France, Italy and Germany. 
In Asia Pacific, excluding China, second quarter spending grew 4%, up 8% from 2019. Performance across the region varied based on the level of COVID restrictions with markets like New Zealand and Singapore growing strongly, while markets like Hong Kong and Japan, which had restrictions for most of the quarter, the weaker. 
Global process transaction growth was 8%, up [ 15% ] from 2019, lagging volume growth due to higher ticket sizes, particularly in the U.S. and significant COVID restrictions in Europe. Visa Direct continues to perform well, with transactions growing almost 60% globally this quarter, consistent with the first quarter. The cross-border volume recovery continued despite most borders remaining completely or partially closed. [ Counting down ] of cross border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, declined 21% in the second quarter and was at 75% of 2019 volumes. Looking at the trajectory versus 2019, this was a 3-point improvement from the first quarter. We're seeing a typical seasonal uptick in March and into April, which is a positive sign as we look ahead to the summer. Card-not-present, excluding travel volume, continued to be very strong, growing 28% year-over-year, up 44% from 2019, driven mostly by retail spending and some benefit from cryptocurrency purchases. Cross-border travel-related spend declined 55% year-over-year and was at 39% of 2019 levels. Card-present spend as a percentage of 2019 expanded 3 points versus the first quarter. 
Some color on the state of cross-border travel as we approach the important summer travel season. Travel to and from the U.S. and Latin America is the best-performing corridor, almost at 90% of 2019 levels by March. Helped by U.S. travel, travel into Latin America in general has recovered to over 80% of 2019. Travel between Russia and neighboring countries, as well as travel in and out of the Gulf states, has helped CEMEA cross-border travel to recover 2/3 of its peak COVID volume. Cross-border travel in and out of Asian countries remains very depressed, down almost 75% versus 2019 and flatlining for the past 6 months. 
Traveling to the U.S., an important corridor for us, was also down 70% versus 2019 in March, but has been recovering slowly. The significant U.S. Canada border restrictions, travel is still down about 80% relative to 2019 in this corridor. As Europe has increased COVID restrictions, travel in and around Europe remain hard hit, down over [ 60% ] versus 2019 in March. 
Moving now to a quick review of second quarter financial results. Net revenue declined 2%. Had we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, net revenue growth would have been slightly positive. Service revenues grew 8%, helped by small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 11% with strong value-added services growth, continuing to be partially offset by the mix shift away from higher-yielding cross border transactions. International transaction revenue was down 19%, in line with nominal cross-border volumes, excluding Intra-Europe. Other revenues were flat, negatively impacted by low usage of travel-related card benefits and client marketing projects pushed to later in the year, while advisory services continue to grow strongly. In total, value-added services revenue continued to perform well, growing 14% with strong growth in CyberSource security and identity solutions. This quarter, we reclassified some prior period travel-related card benefits as value-added services and as such, our previously reported first quarter revenue growth would have been similar to the second quarter on a comparable basis. 
Prime incentives were 25.8% of gross revenues, lower than expected due to better than cross border volume, lifting gross revenue and lower Europe and Asia Pacific volumes benefiting client incentives. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 3%, in line with expectations. We recorded gains from our equity investments of $156 million. Excluding investment gains, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $109 million for the fiscal second quarter, below our expectations primarily due to 2 benefits, one of which is offset in personnel expenses, and the other is related to the completion of certain tax audits. These completed audits also benefited our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate with a non-GAAP tax rate lower-than-expected at 16.8%. 
GAAP and non-GAAP EPS was $0.0138 -- $1.38. We bought 8.3 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $208.51 for $1.7 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned approximately $2.4 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. 
Turning from the past to the future, I'll start with key business driver trends through April 21. As you look at these weekly trends, keep in mind 3 key factors: one, year-over-year growth is lapping the 2020 loads in many cases; two, the timing of Easter is impactful; three, in the U.S., there are peaks in debit spending when economic impact payments are deposited in people's bank accounts. Through April 21, U.S. payments volume growth was 64%, with U.S. debit growing 67% and credit up 61%. Compared to 2019, U.S. payments volume, debit and credit were up 29%, 51% and 9%, respectively, all consistent with the March trend. 
Looking outside the U.S., trends versus 2019 are relatively stable. Notable exceptions include the U.K. improving as restrictions relaxed, while India is slowing as restrictions increase. Process transaction growth was 58%, up 16% from 2019, which is consistent with the second quarter. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis grew 63% and was at 78% of 2019, which is 3 points above the second quarter and 1 point above March. 
As we look ahead, there are several positive cross-border travel indicators to highlight. Travel bubbles are being created. Australia and New Zealand is already in place with an immediate and substantial uptick in bookings. Hong Kong, Singapore is starting in late May with more likely. So far, all indications are that some popular tourist destinations in Southern Europe will be open for the summer, and bookings are trending well. Just this week, it was announced that Europe's border will be open to vaccinated visitors from the U.S. This summer. As the U.S. vaccination program moves along fast, it is possible that travel to and from the U.S. will gather momentum into the summer. Airlines are adding capacity in anticipation. The trajectory of the cross-border travel recovery remains the key metric to watch. We will be monitoring all leading indicators easing the border restrictions, forward bookings as well as surveys of consumer intentions, and we'll update you as we learn more. 
As in previous quarters, accurate forecasting is difficult in this fast-changing environment. Assuming stable to improving trends relative to FY '19 continue, Q3 net revenue growth is expected to be in the high teens. The cross-border travel recovery trajectory will be the key factor to watch. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenue are expected to increase 1 to 1.5 points above the second quarter levels as client volumes grew significantly over last year below and service fees are recognized with the quarter lag. We plan to increase operating expenses in the mid-teens in the third quarter as we step up investments on marketing and key initiatives to capture the significant growth opportunities I described. We expect nonoperating expense to be around $130 million consistent with the second quarter, excluding the nonrecurring impacts I mentioned earlier. Our tax rate expectations are 19% to 19.5% and again, consistent with last quarter's expectations before the tax audit completion in the second quarter I mentioned earlier. 
In closing, we're stepping up our investments to drive accelerated growth in a post-COVID world. A few points to highlight. Our net revenue and profits are at fiscal year '19 levels, even as a rebound in travel, especially cross-border travel, still remains ahead of us after the world is vaccinated and borders reopened. There is significant pent-up demand for travel, in particular, personal travel. Large swaths of new consumers worldwide have been introduced to the ease, convenience and security that digital payments can offer. This is evidenced by the significant global growth in debit as consumers abandon cash at an accelerated pace. These are habits, we believe will not only stick, but also continue to grow, helped by initiatives such as tap to pay. 
Consumers, merchants and governments globally have recognized the value of e-commerce through the pandemic. Governments are upgrading their digital infrastructure. Merchants are significantly enhancing their e-commerce capabilities and more consumers are turning to e-commerce across more categories and also cross-border. We expect these trends will only accelerate. Within our new flows business, Visa Direct has continued to grow at extraordinary rates. The pandemic has expanded adoption of use cases in P2P, B2C and G2C. Many use cases and markets are just starting to scale. B2B remains a huge opportunity, and we are committed to our three-pronged approach to drive growth, cost based, cross-border and large enterprise accounts receivable and payables with many capabilities scaling or launching in the new future -- in the near future. 
Our value-added services have sustained high-growth despite lower usage of travel-related services. Debit and e-commerce acceleration have driven growth in our debit processing, security and identity and CyberSource businesses and a recovery in travel-related services lies ahead. As a result, we see acceleration across all 3 vectors of growth in consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. As Al indicated, we are investing in the strategies and capabilities required to capture these growth opportunities. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Mike for the Q&A session."

And that's kind of the high volume, lower value types of transactions. I think we are continuing to make progress in connecting more banks around the world to B2B Connect. And as we complete the grow out of that network over the next few years, I see us as having great capability to drive  cross-border B2B, high-value, lower volume types of transactions. 
So I think the combination of our capabilities what has happened in terms of continued adoption of digitization and the capabilities that we have built and the use cases that we are working with today and anticipate adding to the mix over time, I think this is going to become increasingly important and growing part of our business."

Today, in the second quarter, 2/3 of our business was cross-border e-commerce, 1/3 was travel. It says two things. One, how much our cross-border e-commerce business has grown and the second, how much recovery is left in our cross-border travel business because as Al said, most of our cross-border travel is personal travel, and there's a substantial amount of personal travel that is going to come back once borders reopen. 
So the traditional cross-border e-commerce is an area of significant growth. We've seen that as people move online, they become somewhat less sensitive to where the product is shipped from. And there's just a lot more cross-border e-commerce. The other use case that holds a lot of potential is to the extent that crypto related transactions become significant and we're enabling, as you know, a vast number of them. One use case that is particularly useful in either stablecoin or bitcoin type scenarios is cross-border. And that is another new use case that could have a lot of attention in the long term."

I think the people being concerned about cash and much more comfortable shopping online, the combination of that will continue. I think that will also -- we'll also see structurally much more tap to pay as people find that to be a more helpful way to shop. I think we've seen governments during this pandemic become bigger clients, and they're increasingly interested in showing the way in terms of digitizing more of what they do as a government. And I think we'll see more of that activity sticking as well. 
I think that in general, we had -- before the pandemic, very little separation in growth rate between debit and credit in any given month or quarter, they would kind of grow within a percentage point of each other. We saw incredible separation during the pandemic as much as 40 points of differential in terms of growth. We're now seeing, in this quarter, credit come back a bit and start to drift into positive territory. But I think that at least for the foreseeable future and maybe for longer, that I think you're going to see debit continue to grow above credit. Although as travel comes back, that should certainly help bounce back credit values, particularly since most of the travel co-brand cards and many of the actual travelers tend to use credit cards."

And what we see in this pandemic, especially as it has gone on for quite a while is there's often a hurdle in getting people to change habits. So people are used to using cash, getting them to use digital forms of payment, that takes some time. This pandemic has caused a range of changes in behavior because there was no choice, whether it's in emerging markets, where there was a greater propensity to use cash or certain cultures, you heard of Germany and Japan as having been very cash-based economies for a very long time or habits in terms of people using cash for certain categories like food and drug, that's changing. Or people using more cash at a physical point of sale, as Al said, with the cash dirty risk as well as tap to pay, making payments easier at the physical point of sale. We're seeing a substantial shift towards cash utilization even at the physical point of sale. 
And then the point you said about smaller and smaller transactions that used to be cash moving digital, again, tap to pay is a big engine for that. And the trajectory of tap to pay remains very significant. And we are probably within a year of coming to the point where the U.S. will be in takeoff ways on tap to pay too, which is a very big market."

And people are doing much more everyday shopping post the pandemic than they did pre the pandemic. The amount of food orders that are placed and take out orders that are placed buying normal household staples, that might have been -- many of them were in person or the vast majority and maybe even some of them were in cash. But we're just seeing the type of transaction that typically goes along with debit is everyday spend. And so what we're seeing, as a real structural changes, every day spend is moved from in-person to e-commerce in a big way. 
I do think, though, that credit will make a rebound, particularly as some of the larger discretionary spending comes back in, as the affluent gets back into making travel reservations as the online travel agency business starts to grow, I think that there'll be a closing of the gap between credit -- debit growth and credit growth. But again, as I said to Darrin, I'm not sure that we get back to those 2 different card platforms growing at the same level going forward. I think we certainly closed the gap. But I think at least as far out as odd looking right now, debit will continue to outpace the growth of credit."

And we've seen by building partnerships with numbers of fintechs over the course of the last year or 2, a tremendous amount of opportunity to grow Visa credentials, either by having these players become issuers and acquirers for us, which is a very big and important trend, particularly in developing countries, but also just getting currencies and credentials into some of the existing wallets. 
But we believe there's an enormous opportunity to grow the number of credentials, and it's something that we're certainly focused on particularly, as we talk to the fintechs, the wallets and the neobanks around the world."

So let me give a little bit of background to talk about where we see the opportunities. So first of all, there's 2 market segments as we see it. One is -- are the bitcoin, the kind of -- which are primarily assets held by people, they're not used much in the former payments. We kind of think of them as the digital gold. And then there are digital currencies, including Central Bank digital currencies and stablecoin, that are directly backed by existing fiat currencies. And they're definitely emerging as a payment option and they're running a public blockchain, which is really, in essence, an additional network, much like an RTP or ACH might be. 
So our focus is on 5 different opportunities that we see in this space. And I would say that this is a space that we are leaning into in a very, very big way, and I think are extremely well positioned. The first opportunity is really at the core of what we do, which is enabling consumers to make a purchase of these currencies or bitcoin and we're working hard with wallets and exchanges to just make sure we're facilitating acceptance and people's ability to use their Visa cards to buy. And Vasant referenced that in his remarks that we saw some increase, some of the volume gain for people making these purchases on Visa cards. 
Secondly, the second opportunity is enabling digital currency cash outs to fiat. So converting a digital currency to a fiat on a Visa credential, which then makes that -- those funds available for shopping at any one of the 70 million of these merchants and gives immediate utility to the digital currency. And we're the clear leader here. We've got over 35 digital currency platforms and wallets that have chosen to work with us. Coinbase, Crypto.com, [ Block 5 fold, ] [ Bitpan ] are just some examples. And so that's certainly a second big opportunity. 
Thirdly, is enabling financial institutions and fintech partners to be able to have a crypto option for their customers. So what we've done in this space is we've created APIs that enable financial institution customers to purchase custody or even trade digital currencies held by [ Anchorage ], which is the first federally charted digital asset bank in the U.S. And we've done our first rollout with First Boulevard, which is a digital neobank focused on building generational wealth for the black community. So that's the third opportunity. Just helping FIs and fintechs have this crypto option for their customers. 
Fourth one is settlement, which you started to reference, we've upgraded our infrastructure to allow a financial institution to settle with these in a digital currency with stablecoin, starting with [ U.S. DC ]. As you think you know today, we transact in 160 currencies every day, and we settle every evening in 25 currencies. So we're going to now be able to support digital currencies as an additional settlement currency on our network. And on our end, we're going to -- settling in U.S. DC is pretty similar to settling in U.S. dollars. But the mechanics of receiving these funds is a bit different and requires some integration work with several crypto custodian like -- players like Anchorage. 
And then the fifth area of opportunity is just working with central banks. Central Bank digital currency is being explored in many nations. And I think it could end up being -- prove to be quite valuable in countries where the infrastructure to distribute cash is either unavailable or limited. And it's one of the factors that hinders these 1.7 billion people I referred to in my remarks that are outside the financial mainstream for being in the financial mainstream. So we're talking to central banks about the criticality, though, of public-private partnerships, and in particular, the criticality of acceptance because for these central bank digital currencies, to have value, they're going to have to both be secure in the minds of consumers. And that's something we have a long track record with and can help. And then secondly, obviously, they have to have some form of utility. 
So Dan, that's a bit about how we're thinking about crypto with a real focus on digital currencies and those 5 opportunities."

We think there's a tremendous amount of growth when we look at various geographies. And we look at the 1.7 billion people that are outside the financial mainstream. 
When we look at new flows, there's the $185 trillion of opportunity there. So we think we've got 2 big efforts going in both B2B and Visa Direct to take advantage of those. And value-added services is relatively do as well, but we've got a -- in terms of how we talk about it, we've had many value out of services or capabilities or solutions for years. And they've always contributed well to our revenue, but we're increasingly been focused on in the last 2 years. And we're driving a lot more revenue and higher revenue growth than we had in consumer payments through value-added services. And so we think there's still a tremendous amount of upside. I commented about the fact that we're getting high usage from a lot of our clients, but there's still a huge amount of room to grow with existing -- with clients that are already using value-added services, as well as clients that are not consuming as many of their value-added services. 
So I look ahead and say the future is very, very bright. And adding on top of that, a lot of what we've talked about in terms of digitization and the fact that we will come out of this pandemic, and we'll start to see travel recover. All of those are extremely good trends for us."

I mean, we could see -- we could work with all bunch of options, virtual cards from Visa could be used for repayment. A Visa card on file could be used for repayment. We could explore Visa Direct as a way for installments to be paid off.

Service revenues, as you know, we're recognizing with a quarter lag. So the service revenues you see in the third quarter, remember, will not reflect the revenues related to the volumes in the third quarter. So the third quarter will have a big ramp in volumes, as you're seeing, because we are lapping. But the revenues and service fees will reflect the revenues from the volumes in the second quarter. It's important to remind people of that. 
In terms of the cross-border business, I think you see what the trends are. In terms of transactions, I think the trends are fairly stable at this point quarter-over-quarter. A point to make on incentives, it's important for you to note that last year, third quarter was when our incentives were really hit because volumes declined, even though we recognize service fee into the lag, our incentives are recognized in the quarter based on quarter volume. So this quarter, we'll see a big ramp in volumes relative to last year, which is going to cause incentives to go up a lot and be compared to a quarter last year where they went down. 
The second thing is we have these incentives tied to certain thresholds being achieved. Last year, because of all the drops, thresholds were not achieved. This year, we're assuming there will be. So you get an additional amount of incentives because clients are going to hit certain thresholds. So you have to factor in the fact that year-over-year incentives growth is going to be quite high in the third quarter. And factor in the fact that we won't have the benefit of the volumes in our service fees because of the lag. So you should make sure you have all that as you think about our third quarter revenue growth."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to provide a few quick stats on the quarter and then share my thoughts on what's ahead as the world continues to recover. The recovery is going to take many different shapes, and the timing will differ around the world based on vaccination rollouts and the easing of restrictions. But we believe we're at the beginning of the end of the pandemic and the recovery is well underway, at least in a number of markets.
First, Q2 results, revenue declined 2% year-over-year, but would be slightly positive at 20 basis points if service revenues were recognized on current-quarter payment volume. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.38, a decrease of 1%. When looking at volumes and transactions growth, keep in mind that we're now lapping the start of the pandemic. As growth rates are now less indicative of performance in the business trajectory, we're going to also provide some metrics compared to 2019 on a constant dollar basis.
So payments volume grew 11%, improving 7 points from Q1 and reached 116% of 2019, which is up 3 points from Q1. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, declined 21%, but improved 12 points from Q1 and is 75% of 2019 levels, 3 points better than Q1. Process transactions growth of 8% improved 4 points from Q1 and represented 116% of 2019, which is consistent with the first quarter.
This quarter, we continued to make progress across our 3 growth levers. First, consumer payments. In Asia Pacific, we renewed our partnership with Rakuten Card, a subsidiary of Rakuten Group, the largest e-commerce marketplace in Japan. In Korea, Visa won the first hotel chain co-brand in the country with Marriott and Shinhan Card, Korea's largest issuer. In China, we renewed our credit portfolios with CITIC Bank and Agricultural Bank of China, 2 of the top 10 largest banks in the country.
Also on the co-brand front in Brazil, Samsung in partnership with Banco ItaÃº, will issue their inaugural co-brand in Latin America with Visa targeting Samsung's 57 million Brazilian users. In Europe, Visa won incremental business with BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium. This expands our relationship to include 4 million debit cards in addition to our existing credit relationship. In Switzerland, we've gained significant traction in growing Visa Debit. Since January of 2019, we have signed 13 new debit deals, representing an incremental 2.6 million cards.
In new flows, Visa Direct transactions grew almost 60% in the second quarter. We're pleased to have clients going live now with Visa Direct payouts, which offers a flexible set of APIs for Visa partners globally to use a single point of connection for push payments to cards and accounts. MoneyGram, Goldman Sachs Transaction Banking, Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong and KyckGlobal are among the first to start utilizing Visa Direct payouts for B2C, cross-border P2P and B2 small B payouts.
A few additional highlights on specific Visa Direct use cases include that in the marketplace payouts -- in marketplace payouts, Airbnb, which now has 4 million homes globally, will offer host payouts using Visa Direct in select markets. In cross-border P2P, Remitly, a top digital remittance fintech, has renewed its Visa Direct relationship, building upon the past 2 years of partnership. And Monobank in Ukraine enabled cross-border P2P to their 1.7 million cardholders.
In the payroll category, the earned wage access use case continues to grow, with 25 earned wage access platforms now offering Visa Direct for fast and convenient access to employee earnings. G2C continues to grow as well. Global Blue, a leading tax-free shopping solutions company covering 52 countries and 35 million tax-free transactions in 2019, is utilizing Visa Direct to distribute tax refund payments across Europe. Separate from Visa Direct, we supported the U.S. government's disbursements of economic impact payments to nearly 13 million Visa prepaid credentials in the U.S. so far this year.
And now to our third growth, our value-added services, we're continuing to see strong adoption. Let me highlight a couple of examples. For CyberSource, Planet, a European acquirer and payment services provider that delivers payment processing and currency conversion solutions to over 600,000 merchants, will be partnering with CyberSource to simplify payments across the hospitality, food and beverage and retail sectors. KeyBanc, a top U.S. acquirer, will begin to offer CyberSource to its merchant clients. And as e-commerce continues to grow, Decision Manager, a key risk offering of CyberSource, increased transactions over 30% fiscal year-to-date.
Our other risk fraud and authentication capabilities grew as well. For example, we've now crossed the 2 billion token milestone, up from 1.4 billion tokens just in September. One of our key authentication capabilities, CardinalCommerce, grew revenue almost 40 -- almost 50% year-over-year this quarter by rapidly expanding beyond its U.S. origins. In the next year, we plan to more than double our clients in Europe and Central Europe, Middle East and Africa.
So while the pandemic has disrupted the world, it has not changed our strategy. In fact, it has reinforced our belief that our 3 areas of focus will deliver robust growth for years to come. As we look ahead with COVID recovery underway, a few key important realities, namely the way consumers feel about e-commerce, cash and travel will particularly impact Visa. The pandemic has accelerated e-commerce. Global card-not-present credentials, excluding travel, grew over 20% in the quarter versus last year. Our growth in card-not-present payment volume, excluding travel, has averaged at least 30% in the United States, Canada, Brazil, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, India and Singapore over the last 3 quarters. And in global cross-border, excluding intra-Europe, it's averaged 20% growth.
We believe this shift is likely to persist as the convenience of e-commerce is indisputable, and its growth continues to be robust even as card-present begins to return. In March, in the United States, as some states loosened transactions, card-present as a percentage of 2019 spend improved 11 points versus February. While at the same time, card-not-present, excluding travel, still expanded 8 points. If you look at that in Japan, where restrictions were also lifted, card-present improved 6 points and card-not-present, excluding travel, still improved 4 points in that same comparison between March and February.
The pandemic has accelerated the digitization of cash, and we see the impact in debit and tap to pay. When we look at cash usage in the last 12 months, just on the Visa brand, such as with ATM withdrawals, we see that global debit cash volumes have decreased by 7%, while debit payments growth -- payment volume has grown 16%, both on a constant dollar basis. This 20-point gap is more than double the historic gap in growth rates and relatively consistent globally, demonstrating cash digitization in both mature and emerging regions.
Overall, Visa tap to pay transactions have grown over 30% year-over-year in March. In Europe, less than a year since contactless limits increased across the region, Visa has seen 1 billion additional touch-free transactions. In the United States, 1 in 10 face-to-face Visa transactions are now done with a tap, more than a 2x increase since the beginning of the pandemic. In New York City, the penetration is nearly 30%, demonstrating the potential of focused issuance and merchant enablement, along with transit. In the past 3 years alone, we've enabled nearly 250 transit systems globally, and we can see, based on our research, that enabling tap to pay on transit can bring more than a 15% lift in transactions for merchants in the surrounding neighborhoods.
The decline in travel is temporary, and we're starting to see some early signs of recovery. Cross-border travel-related spending, excluding intra-Europe, improved from Q1, driven by 2 factors. First, those who are abroad are spending more likely because of fewer restrictions. This quarter, essentially all of the cross-border travel spend improvement was driven by higher spend per card rather than more active cards.
Second, we continue to see strength from countries with open border. For example, U.S. to Mexico volume was almost 20% above 2019 levels for the quarter. We also saw several top corridors between the U.S. and Latin America improve by more than 10 points through the quarter versus 2019. Travel will certainly take more time to recover than other sectors, but we believe personal travel, in particular, will come back, and that's good for Visa for 2 primary reasons. One, because the vast majority of the travel we capture on our credentials is consumer; and two, we are the global leader in travel co-brands.
With the backdrop of travel cash digitization and e-commerce, let's briefly explore the future potential of our 3 growth levers. In consumer payments, in the last 2 years, we've grown our credentials to 3.6 billion and physical merchant locations to over 70 million, up 7% and 34%, respectively. And remember that our merchant locations only count our partners like PayPal and Square each as one. That said, there's ample opportunity as we focus on specific regions and partners.
Looking at regions, even with our leading position in both emerging and developed markets, our market-driven approach to growing credentials is succeeding. And Europe is an excellent example. From 2018 to 2020, we grew active card credentials by 10%. And looking ahead, we have line of sight to more than 25 million additional credentials across 50 clients in the next few years.
Let me cite a couple of recent partnerships that would show this rapid growth. Since fintech Revolut signed a global agreement in September 2019 selecting Visa as their lead issuing partner, they've increased the number of cards and payments volume by more than 200% through December 2020. Crypto.com has launched Visa cards in 39 markets across their 10 million user base since 2018. And just this quarter, they signed a global growth agreement with us, covering 12 markets with plans to expand to even more. There are so many more partners issuing credentials and building acceptance. For example, wallet providers represent the potential for another 2 billion credentials and 70 billion acceptance locations over time, and the pace of growth here is fast. YooMoney in Russia recently signed on to issue Visa credentials and has achieved more than 1 million credentials in just 5 months.
In fiscal Q2 last year, we announced that stc pay, Saudi Arabia's largest wireless operator with 25 million subscribers, plan to embed credentials in their stc pay wallet. To date, more than 1 million Visa credentials have been issued. Our ongoing partnership with Paytm has enabled us to add more than the 250,000 contactless-enabled acceptance locations at new to card merchants. Well, the number of Visa credentials issued by Paytm has more than doubled since September of 2020, reaching a total of 3 million.
Around the world, tap to phone has also been a significant acceptance effort. Today, more than 35 markets offer it, with 13 more being added this year. Wallets and tap to phone are just a couple of next-gen partners and capabilities that we believe will help us bring the 1.7 billion unbanked into the financial mainstream, growing the pie for digital payments. The growth will come from a regional approach and open it to partnering with traditional and new players and by developing new ways to engage the ecosystem, all rooted in our strong brand and in technology.
In new flows, our success in the United States is a real asset. While B2B has been impacted by the pandemic, our strategies against the $120 trillion opportunity represent near, medium and longer-term growth for Visa. In the near term, we're focused on supporting businesses small and large. To date, we've helped 12 million micro and small businesses to digitize and grow against our 50 million global goal. And we continue to focus on card-based solutions. Visa has about 20% more commercial issuers today than we did 4 years ago. In the medium term, Visa B2B Connect addresses the major pain points with the current top solution and cross-border B2B, and we are continuing to add banks to reach scale. In the longer term, we're working with key partners to solve the challenges of accounts payable and accounts receivable.
For the other $65 trillion of new flows, Visa Direct has 5 clear competitive advantages that we believe will continue to drive growth. The first one is reach. In Visa Direct, the endpoints are card credentials and bank accounts. And we can reach 5 billion endpoints globally. This is unrivaled by anyone else. Second, operating scale. Visa Direct has built upon the operating scale of VisaNet and leverages its real-time authorization, clearing and settlement capabilities. This means we can deliver industry-leading solutions with low marginal cost.
Third is commitment to a network of network strategy. Visa Direct is truly multi-rail, which provides clients flexibility and efficiency. Just in the last year, it has utilized 16 card-based networks, 65 ACM schemes, 7 RTP networks and 5 payment gateways. That is more connections, coverage and capability than we've seen from any other network offering.
Fourth, investments in our capabilities. We have invested in leading technology stack for both payouts and account funding capabilities. For example, our account funding capabilities include unique codes to help clients manage risk, compliance and authorizations for money movement transactions with APIs to streamline implementation for apps, neobanks and fintechs. To our knowledge, no one else has this capability.
Fifth is commercialization. We've now enabled over 20 use cases with more than 450 new program launches, and we will continue to expand by: one, growing existing use cases like marketplaces and cross-border P2P; two, bringing existing use cases like P2P, payroll and earned wage access to other new markets; and three, developing new use cases such as tipping. Visa Direct also brings a network effect in terms of benefits to Visa. For every dollar received on a debit card through Visa Direct, about half of it is then used for debit card purchases. Furthermore, cardholders who received payments through Visa Direct then spend up to 50% more than those who do not. So Visa Direct is actually not only helping new flows, but it is helping consumer payments.
Lastly, let's turn to value-added services, which are being utilized by our clients more and more. In fiscal year 2020, more than 60% of our clients used at least 5 value-added services from Visa and more than 30% of our clients use 10 or more. Our toolbox is large with hands-on consulting, sophisticated and flexible technology platforms, valuable data and insight and card benefits, all which will improve with the recovery. We also have 3 platform businesses that scale very profitably, CyberSource, issuer processing and risk identity and authentication. With the recovery and the continued strength in e-commerce and debit, these capabilities are well aligned with trends towards digitization.
Let me just speak about CyberSource as an example. Our strategy to partner with acquirers creates a leveraged opportunity for future growth, both transaction growth and cross-selling value-added services. We mentioned last year that Japanese acquirer SMCC, was going to start offering CyberSource capabilities to its merchant customers. Starting with 1 nationwide convenience store chain and rapidly expanding to over 30,000 merchants, SMCC is now delivering next-generation acquiring solutions to Japanese merchants, and CyberSource is processing over 0.5 million e-commerce and in person transactions per day.
With all this opportunity across the 3 levers, we are investing heavily to drive future growth in several areas, including simple, compelling user experiences. Examples include tap to pay, tap to phone and click to pay. Capabilities to scale new flows and value-added services. Examples include new Visa Direct use cases and advancing fraud and identity solutions. Specific markets that can benefit from targeted resources such as Europe and Africa. Innovations in the payments ecosystem, such as crypto APIs for banks and digital currency settlement.
So to close, Visa has weathered the COVID storm and is emerging from the pandemic even stronger. There's significant opportunity ahead and Visa's existing present scale and capabilities position us well to capture more growth in the future.
With that, now let me turn it over to Vasant for more colors on our financials and what we see ahead. Vasant, over to you."
38043467,710499687,2259908,"Visa Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal second quarter results were stronger than we expected, with net revenue down 2%, largely due to improving cross-border volumes and lower-than-expected client incentives. GAAP EPS was flat to last year, a",2076,"Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal second quarter results were stronger than we expected, with net revenue down 2%, largely due to improving cross-border volumes and lower-than-expected client incentives. GAAP EPS was flat to last year, and non-GAAP EPS declined 1%, helped by a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shift increased net revenue by 0.5 point but lowered EPS by 0.5 point due to currency-related benefits in the second quarter last year.
As Al mentioned, as we lap the most significant COVID-19 impact starting in March 2020, year-over-year growth rates are not the best indicator of the underlying trend. To help you better assess both the magnitude and the trajectory of the recovery so far, we have also provided growth rates for key performance metrics relative to fiscal year '19. In constant dollars, global payments volume year-over-year growth was over 11%, fueled by continued strength in debit as well as improving credit spending. Compared to the corresponding quarter in 2019, global payments volume was 16% higher, a 3-point acceleration from the first quarter. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 13% or 20% higher than 2019 as Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded card conversion, which have minimal revenue impact.
U.S. payments volume growth was 18% and up 24% from 2019, benefiting from economic impact payments in early January and mid-March as well as the relaxing of COVID-related restrictions in many states, partially offset by bad weather, lowering spending in mid-February. Even after adjusting for economic impact payments, U.S. payments volumes have bounced back to the pre-COVID trend line. Debit growth accelerated 13 points to 34%, up 44% from 2019, boosted by the 2 economic impact payments in this quarter. Credit growth was 2%, up 6% from 2019. The credit improvement was helped by increases in retail, travel, restaurant and entertainment spending, mostly starting in early March, as restrictions were relaxed in many states. It is important to note that credit has improved without debit slowing, pointing to accelerated cash displacement.
Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, continued to grow over 30% in the quarter and was 55% above 2019 levels, primarily driven by retail spend. The most notable sign of a domestic recovery was card presence spend growing 4%, which is up 3% over 2019, an 8-point acceleration from the first quarter, led by retail and restaurant spending. Improving card-present spending does not slow e-commerce, indicating that e-commerce strength is likely to continue even as card-present spend recovers.
International comps in dollar payments volume growth was 6%, up 9% from 2019. A few regional highlights. CEMEA remains our fastest growing region, growing 26%, up 50% from 2019 levels. The easing of COVID-related restrictions, particularly in the Middle East and Russia as well as client wins, drove the robust growth. Latin America grew 23%, up 40% from 2019, with consistently strong performance across the region, mostly fueled by accelerating e-commerce adoption and usage as well as client wins. Europe grew 2%, up 8% from 2019, but decelerated from the last quarter as many countries put significant COVID restrictions in place, particularly the U.K., France, Italy and Germany.
In Asia Pacific, excluding China, second quarter spending grew 4%, up 8% from 2019. Performance across the region varied based on the level of COVID restrictions, with markets like New Zealand and Singapore growing strongly, while markets like Hong Kong and Japan, which had restrictions for most of the quarter, the weaker.
Global process transaction growth was 8%, up 15% from 2019, lagging volume growth due to higher ticket sizes, particularly in the U.S. and significant COVID restrictions in Europe. Visa Direct continues to perform well, with transactions growing almost 60% globally this quarter, consistent with the first quarter. The cross-border volume recovery continued, despite most borders remaining completely or partially closed. Comping down of cross border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, declined 21% in the second quarter and was at 75% of 2019 volumes. Looking at the trajectory versus 2019, this was a 3-point improvement from the first quarter. We're seeing a typical seasonal uptick in March and into April, which is a positive sign as we look ahead to the summer.
Card-not-present, excluding travel volume, continued to be very strong, growing 28% year-over-year, up 44% from 2019, driven mostly by retail spending and some benefit from cryptocurrency purchases. Cross-border travel-related spend declined 55% year-over-year and was at 39% of 2019 levels. Card-present spend as a percentage of 2019 expanded 3 points versus the first quarter.
Some color on the state of cross-border travel as we approach the important summer travel season. Travel to and from the U.S. and Latin America is the best-performing corridor, almost at 90% of 2019 levels by March. Helped by U.S. travel, travel into Latin America in general has recovered to over 80% of 2019. Travel between Russia and neighboring countries as well as travel in and out of the Gulf states has helped EMEA cross-border travel to recover 2/3 of its pre-COVID volume. Cross-border travel in and out of Asian countries remains very depressed, down almost 75% versus 2019 and flatlining for the past 6 months.
Travel into the U.S., an important corridor for us, was also down 70% versus 2019 in March, but has been recovering slowly. With significant U.S.-Canada border restrictions, travel is still down about 80% relative to 2019 in this corridor. As Europe has increased COVID restrictions, travel in and out of Europe remains hard hit, down over 60% versus 2019 in March.
Moving now to a quick review of second quarter financial results. Net revenue declined 2%. Had we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, net revenue growth would have been slightly positive. Service revenues grew 8%, helped by small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 11% with strong value-added services growth, continuing to be partially offset by the mix shift away from higher-yielding cross-border transactions. International transaction revenue was down 19%, in line with nominal cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Other revenues were flat, negatively impacted by low usage of travel-related card benefits and client marketing projects pushed to later in the year, while advisory services continue to grow strongly.
In total, value-added services revenue continued to perform well, growing 14%, with strong growth in CyberSource, security and identity solutions. This quarter, we reclassified some prior period travel-related card benefits as value-added services and as such, our previously reported first quarter revenue growth would have been similar to the second quarter on a comparable basis. Client incentives were 25.8% of gross revenues, lower than expected due to better than cross border volume lifting gross revenue and lower Europe and Asia Pacific volumes benefiting client incentives. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 3%, in line with expectations. We recorded gains from our equity investments of $156 million. Excluding investment gains, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $109 million for the fiscal second quarter, below our expectations primarily due to 2 benefits, one of which is offset in personnel expenses, and the other is related to the completion of certain tax audits. These completed audits also benefited our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates, with a non-GAAP tax rate lower-than-expected at 16.8%.
GAAP and non-GAAP EPS was $0.0138 -- $1.38. We bought 8.3 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $208.51 or $1.7 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned approximately $2.4 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter.
Turning from the past to the future, I'll start with key business driver trends through April 21. As you look at these weekly trends, keep in mind 3 key factors: one, year-over-year growth is lapping the 2020 lows in many cases; two, the timing of Easter is impactful; three, in the U.S., there are peaks in debit spending when economic impact payments are deposited in people's bank accounts. Through April 21, U.S. payments volume growth was 64%, with U.S. debit growing 67% and credit up 61%. Compared to 2019, U.S. payment volume, debit and credit were up 29%, 51% and 9%, respectively, all consistent with the March trend.
Looking outside the U.S., trends versus 2019 are relatively stable. Notable exceptions include the U.K. improving as restrictions relaxed, while India is slowing as restrictions increase. Process transaction growth was 58%, up 16% from 2019, which is consistent with the second quarter. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis grew 63% and was at 78% of 2019, which is 3 points above the second quarter and 1 point above March.
As we look ahead, there are several positive cross-border travel indicators to highlight. Travel bubbles are being created. Australia and New Zealand is already in place with an immediate and substantial uptick in bookings. Hong Kong, Singapore is starting in late May with more likely. So far, all indications are that some popular tourist destinations in Southern Europe will be open for the summer, and bookings are trending well. Just this week, it was announced that Europe's borders will be open to vaccinated visitors from the U.S. this summer. As the U.S. vaccination program moves along fast, it is possible that travel to and from the U.S. will gather momentum into the summer. Airlines are adding capacity in anticipation.
The trajectory of the cross-border travel recovery remains the key metric to watch. We will be monitoring all leading indicators, easing of border restrictions, forward bookings as well as surveys of consumer intentions, and we'll update you as we learn more.
As in previous quarters, accurate forecasting is difficult in this fast-changing environment. Assuming stable to improving trends relative to FY '19 continue, Q3 net revenue growth is expected to be in the high teens. The cross-border travel recovery trajectory will be the key factor to watch. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenue are expected to increase 1 to 1.5 points above the second quarter levels as client volumes grow significantly over last year's low and service fees are recognized with a quarter lag.
We plan to increase operating expenses in the mid-teens in the third quarter as we step up investments on marketing and key initiatives to capture the significant growth opportunities Al described. We expect nonoperating expense to be around $130 million consistent with the second quarter, excluding the nonrecurring impacts I mentioned earlier. Our tax rate expectations are 19% to 19.5%, again, consistent with last quarter's expectations before the tax audit completion in the second quarter I mentioned earlier.
In closing, we're stepping up our investments to drive accelerated growth in a post-COVID world. A few points to highlight. Our net revenue and profits are at fiscal year '19 levels, even as a rebound in travel, especially cross-border travel, still remains ahead of us after the world is vaccinated and borders reopen. There is significant pent-up demand for travel, in particular, personal travel.
Large swaths of new consumers worldwide have been introduced to the ease, convenience and security that digital payments can offer. This is evidenced by the significant global growth in debit as consumers abandon cash at an accelerated pace. These are habits, we believe, will not only stick, but also continue to grow, helped by initiatives such as tap to pay.
Consumers, merchants and governments globally have recognized the value of e-commerce through the pandemic. Governments are upgrading their digital infrastructures. Merchants are significantly enhancing their e-commerce capabilities and more consumers are turning to e-commerce across more categories and also cross-border. We expect these trends will only accelerate.
Within our new flows business, Visa Direct has continued to grow at extraordinary rates. The pandemic has expanded adoption of use cases in P2P, B2C and G2C. Many use cases and markets are just starting to scale. B2B remains a huge opportunity, and we are committed to our three-pronged approach to drive growth, cost based, cross-border and large enterprise accounts receivables and payables, with many capabilities scaling or launching in the new future -- in the near future.
Our value-added services have sustained high-growth despite lower usage of travel-related services. Debit and e-commerce acceleration have driven growth in our debit processing, security and identity and CyberSource businesses, and a recovery in travel-related services lies ahead. As a result, we see acceleration across all 3 vectors of growth, in consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. As Al indicated, we're investing in the strategies and capabilities required to capture these growth opportunities.
With that, I'll hand it back to Mike for the Q&A session."

And that's kind of the high volume, lower value types of transactions.
I think we are continuing to make progress in connecting more banks around the world to B2B Connect. And as we complete the grow out of that network over the next few years, I see us as having great capability to drive  cross-border B2B, high value, lower volume types of transactions. So I think the combination of our capabilities what has happened in terms of continued adoption of digitization and the capabilities that we have built and the use cases that we are working with today and anticipate adding to the mix over time, I think is going to become an increasingly important and growing part of our business."

One, how much our cross-border e-commerce business has grown, and the second, how much recovery is left in our cross-border travel business because as Al said, most of our cross-border travel is personal travel, and there's a substantial amount of personal travel that is going to come back once borders reopen.
So the traditional cross-border e-commerce is an area of significant growth. We've seen that as people move online, they become somewhat less sensitive to where the product is shipped from and there's just a lot more cross-border e-commerce. The other use case that holds a lot of potential is to the extent that crypto-related transactions become significant, and we're enabling, as you know, a vast number of them, one use case that is particularly useful in either stablecoin or Bitcoin-type scenarios is cross-border. And that is another new use case that could have a lot of potential in the long term."

I think the people being concerned about cash and much more comfortable shopping online, the combination of that will continue. I think that will also -- we'll also see structurally much more tap to pay as people find that to be a more helpful way to shop. I think we've seen governments during this pandemic become bigger clients, and they're increasingly interested in showing the way in terms of digitizing more of what they do as a government. And I think we'll see more of that activity sticking as well.
I think that in general, we had, before the pandemic, very little separation in growth rate between debit and credit. In any given month or quarter, they would kind of grow within a percentage point of each other. We saw an incredible separation during the pandemic as much as 40 points of differential in terms of growth. We're now seeing, in this quarter, credit come back a bit and start to drift into positive territory. But I think that at least for the foreseeable future and maybe for longer, that I think you're going to see debit continue to grow above credit. Although as travel comes back, that should certainly help bounce back credit volumes, particularly since most of the travel co-brand cards and many of the actual travelers tend to use credit cards."

And what we see in this pandemic, especially as it has gone on for quite a while is there's often a hurdle in getting people to change habits. So people are used to using cash, getting them to use digital forms of payment, that takes some time. This pandemic has caused a range of changes in behavior because there was no choice, whether it's in emerging markets where there was a greater propensity to use cash, or certain cultures, you heard of Germany and Japan as having been very cash-based economies for a very long time or habits in terms of people using cash for certain categories like food and drug, that's changing.
Or people using more cash at the physical point of sale, as Al said, with the cash dirty risk as well as tap to pay making payments easier at the physical point of sale, we're seeing a substantial shift towards cash utilization even at the physical point of sale. And then the point you said about smaller and smaller transactions that used to be cash moving digital, again, tap to pay is a big engine for that. And the trajectory of tap to pay remains very significant. And we are probably within a year of coming to the point where the U.S. will be in take-off phase on tap to pay too, which is a very big market."

And people are doing much more everyday shopping post the pandemic than they did pre the pandemic. The amount of food orders that are placed and take-out orders that are placed, buying normal household staples that might have been -- many of them were in-person or the vast majority and maybe even some of them were in cash. But we're just seeing the type of transaction that typically goes along with debit is everyday spend. And so what we're seeing as a real structural change is everyday spend has moved from in-person to e-commerce in a big way.
I do think, though, that credit will make a rebound, particularly as some of the larger discretionary spending comes back in, as the affluent gets back into making travel reservations, as the online travel agency business starts to grow, I think that there'll be a closing of the gap between credit -- debit growth and credit growth. But again, as I said to Darrin, I'm not sure that we get back to those 2 different card platforms growing at the same level going forward. I think we certainly closed the gap. But I think at least as far out as odd looking right now, debit will continue to outpace the growth of credit."

But we believe there's an enormous opportunity to grow the number of credentials, and it's something that we're certainly focused on, particularly, as we talk to the fintechs, the wallets and the neobanks around the world."

So let me give a little bit of background to talk about where we see the opportunities. So first of all, there's 2 market segments as we see it. One is -- are the Bitcoin, the kind of -- which are primarily assets held by people. They're not used much in the former payments. We kind of think of them as the digital gold. And then there are digital currencies, including Central Bank digital currencies and stablecoins that are directly backed by existing fiat currencies. And they're definitely emerging as a payment option, and they're running a public blockchain, which is really, in essence, an additional network, much like an RTP or ACH might be.
So our focus is on 5 different opportunities that we see in this space. And I would say that this is a space that we are leaning into in a very, very big way and I think are extremely well positioned. The first opportunity is really at the core of what we do, which is enabling consumers to make a purchase of these currencies or Bitcoin and we're working hard with wallets and exchanges to just make sure we're facilitating acceptance in people's ability to use their Visa cards to buy. And Vasant referenced that in his remarks that we saw some increase, some of the volume gain for people making these purchases on Visa cards.
Secondly, the second opportunity is enabling digital currency cash outs to fiat. So converting a digital currency to a fiat on a Visa credential, which then makes that -- those funds available for shopping at any 1 of the 70 million Visa merchants and gives immediate utility to the digital currency. And we're the clear leader here. We've got over 35 digital currency platforms and wallets that have chosen to work with us. Coinbase, Crypto.com, BlockFi, Fold, Bitpanda are just some examples. And so that's certainly a second big opportunity.
Thirdly, is enabling financial institutions and fintech partners to be able to have a crypto option for their customers. So what we've done in this space is we've created APIs that enable financial institution customers to purchase, custody or even trade digital currencies held by Anchorage, which is the first federally charted digital asset bank in the U.S. And we've done our first rollout with First Boulevard, which is a digital neobank focused on building generational wealth for the black community. So that's the third opportunity. Just helping FIs and fintechs have this crypto option for their customers.
Fourth one is settlement, which you started to reference. We've upgraded our infrastructure to allow a financial institution to settle with these in a digital currency with stablecoin, starting with USDC. As you know, today, we transact in 160 currencies every day, and we settle every evening in 25 currencies. So we're going to now be able to support digital currencies as an additional settlement currency on our network. And on our end, we're going to -- settling in USDC is pretty similar to settling in U.S. dollars. But the mechanics of receiving these funds is a bit different and requires some integration work with several crypto custodian like -- players like Anchorage.
And then the fifth area of opportunity is just working with central banks. Central bank digital currency is being explored in many nations. And I think it could end up being -- prove to be quite valuable in countries where the infrastructure to distribute cash is either unavailable or limited. And it's one of the factors that hinders these 1.7 billion people I referred to in my remarks that are outside the financial mainstream for being in the financial mainstream.
So we're talking to central banks about the criticality, though, of public-private partnerships, and in particular, the criticality of acceptance because for these central bank digital currencies, to have value, they're going to have to both be secure in the minds of consumers. And that's something we have a long track record with and can help. And then secondly, obviously, they have to have some form of utility.
So Dan, that's a bit about how we're thinking about crypto with a real focus on digital currencies and those 5 opportunities."

Back to Tien-Tsin's question about credential growth, we think there's a tremendous amount of growth in credentials. We think there's tremendous amount of growth in acceptance footprint. We think there's a tremendous amount of growth when we look at various geographies. And we look at the 1.7 billion people that are outside the financial mainstream.
When we look at new flows, there's the $185 trillion of opportunity there. So we think we've got 2 big efforts going in both B2B and Visa Direct to take advantage of those. And value-added services is relatively new as well, but we've got a -- in terms of how we talk about it, we've had many value-added services or capabilities or solutions for years. And they've always contributed well to our revenue, but we're increasingly been focused on in the last 2 years.
And we're driving a lot more revenue and higher revenue growth than we had in consumer payments through value-added services and so we think there's still a tremendous amount of upside there. I commented about the fact that we're getting high usage from a lot of our clients, but there's still a huge amount of room to grow with existing -- with clients that are already using value-added services, as well as clients that are not consuming as many of their value-added services. 
So I look ahead and say the future is very, very bright. And adding on top of that, a lot of what we've talked about in terms of digitization and the fact that we will come out of this pandemic, and we'll start to see travel recover, all of those are extremely good trends for us."

As you alluded to, we have both a strategy of working with third-party providers as well as offering our own Visa proprietary platform that would allow issuers to offer their own buy now, pay later capability. And we see it as potentially having a very, very good effect for us.
I mean we could see -- we could work with all bunch of options, virtual cards from Visa could be used for repayment. A Visa card on file could be used for repayment. We could explore Visa Direct as a way for installments to be paid off. And in many of those cases, if that's the case, what ends up happening is a single purchase turns into a number of installments so that one transaction can end up being 3 to 4 or 5 payment transactions, which is certainly very, very good for us.
We also think that this is a space where we can sell value-added services, data and analytics, the broadband of providers, underwriting, for example, or risk products to help some of the third-party providers.

And while we haven't been able to study that, what we think is happening is that with -- in places that people can travel, there tend to be also just less restrictions. And that's just opening up more options for people to actually spend. And for instance, instead of doing takeout, go to a restaurant and eat a more expensive meal, order a nice bottle of wine, et cetera. So I think that right now, what we're seeing is simply higher spend per card in terms of travel. We haven't commented on spend per card beyond that."

Service revenues, as you know, we're recognizing with a quarter lag. So the service revenues you see in the third quarter, remember, will not reflect the revenues related to the volumes in the third quarter. So the third quarter will have a big ramp in volumes, as you're seeing, because we are lapping. But the revenues in service fees will reflect the revenues from the volumes in the second quarter. It's important to remind people of that.
In terms of the cross-border business, I think you see what the trends are. In terms of transactions, I think the trends are fairly stable at this point quarter-over-quarter. A point to make on incentives, it's important for you to note that last year, third quarter was when our incentives were really hit because volumes declined, even though we recognize service fees in the lag, our incentives are recognized in the quarter based on quarter volume. So this quarter, we'll see a big ramp in volumes relative to last year, which is going to cause incentives to go up a lot and be compared to a quarter last year where they went down.
The second thing is we have these incentives tied to certain thresholds being achieved. Last year, because of all the drops, thresholds were not achieved. This year, we're assuming there will be. So you get an additional amount of incentives because clients are going to hit certain thresholds. So you have to factor in the fact that year-over-year incentives growth is going to be quite high in the third quarter and factor in the fact that we won't have the benefit of the volumes in our service fees because of the lag. So you should make sure you have all that as you think about our third quarter revenue growth."

We had a really strong fiscal third quarter as payments volume, process transactions across border volume, all improved globally.

We had a really strong fiscal third quarter as payments volume, process transactions across border volume, all improved globally. In our time today, I will first cover our results and then discuss our performance to date across our 3 growth levers: consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. 
The first Q3 results Net revenue rose 27% or 39% if service revenues were recognized on the current quarter's payment volume. This growth far exceeded our expectations due to strength in the U.S., improving cross-border volumes and lower-than-expected client incentives, largely due to deal timing. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.49, up 41%. As we look at volumes and transactions, keep in mind that year-over-year growth rates are less indicative of performance and the business trajectory due to the COVID-19 impact. So once again, we provide metrics compared to 2019 on a constant dollar basis as well as year-over-year growth rates. Payments volume was 121% of 2019, which is up 5 points from the second quarter and represents a 34% year-over-year growth rate. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe, was 82% of 2019, 7 points better than the second quarter and up 53% year-over-year. 
Process transactions were 120% of 2019, up 4 points from Q2 and up 39% year-over-year. Vasant will provide more color on our results. So now let me transition to progress relative to our business strategy. Efforts across our 3 growth levers helped to fuel strong results while positioning us to capture future opportunities. In consumer payments this quarter, we saw a favorable secular trends and had a number of wins with large issuers, co-brands and fintechs. 
Cash displacement trends continued this quarter. Globally, cash volume on Visa debit credentials, the dollar amount of cash taken out of ATMs was 98% of 2019 levels flat on Visa debit credentials was 140% of 2019 levels, up 5 points from Q2. While debit remained strong and has accelerated since Q2, credit spending is now also improving. Global credit payments volume was 104% of 2019, up 4 points from the second quarter. 
At the same time, face-to-face payments, the volume trends are stable to improving, while e-commerce or card-present remains elevated. When we average across our top markets where we process versus 2019, we see card present improved 10 points while card-not-present, excluding travel, improved 1 point in Q3 over Q2. Travel is starting to recover both domestically and in cross-border again, averaging across our top markets where we process versus 2019, domestic travel spending improved more than 20 points in Q3 over Q2. And Globally, cross-border travel, excluding intra-Europe versus 2019 improved 6 points in Q3 over Q2, and exited the quarter with June at 50% of 2019. 
Simply looking at the absolute levels, it was a record quarter for Visa with $2.7 trillion in payments volume and [Audio Gap] 
the payment transactions per day globally, which is up $6 million per day from the last quarter and nearly 160 million transactions per day from a year ago. And we expect much more recovery to come, especially in the areas of credit and cross-border travel. Tap to pay is a key accelerator for many of these trends, including face-to-face spending in both credit and debit. We continue to see countries increase in tap-to-pay limits. For example, in Brazil, the limit was doubled 5 months ago, and the face-to-face tap-to-pay penetration has already more than doubled from 6% to 14% in that short period. In the United States this quarter, we surpassed $370 million tap to pay enabled cards, and we now have 3 cities above 25% face-to-face tap-to-pay penetration, New York, San Francisco and San Jose. Merchant progress continued as well. Target has doubled its tap-to-pay penetration in the last year to 2 out of every 5 face-to-face transactions, and Costco's U.S. gas stations have reached 40% penetration in tap-to-pay payments since enabling this feature approximately 6 months ago. 
Now shifting to clients. We continue to win with large issuers globally. Let me share a few examples from the quarter. In the United States, we are pleased to have renewed our long-standing partnership with Navy Fellow Credit Union, the largest U.S. credit union with over 10.5 million members for a multiyear credit, debit and processing agreement. Also in the U.S., Google Pay introduced a Visa virtual car that links to U.S. Android users Google Pay balances, enabling these users to spend their balances at stores. In Italy, we extended our agreement with Banca Sella, part of the seller group, the largest private and independent banking group in Italy for the consumer credit and commercial portfolios with plans to launch a new innovative digital credit, small business solution. In Singapore, we're expanding our strong partnership with DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia. We have we will continue to grow in the DBS debit portfolio. In Latin America, we renewed the HSBC debit portfolio, 1 of the top 5 portfolios in Mexico. In our CEMEA region, we won the consumer credit portfolio of Cotter National Bank, the largest financial institution in the Middle East and Africa. And we renewed the credit portfolio of Saudi British Bank, one of the largest Saudi banks. We're also building momentum as a global leader in co-brands. In the U.S. alone, we have 7 of the top 10 co-brands. And this quarter, we're pleased to renew Hyatt in the U.S. and renew and grow the Williams-Sonoma co-brand, which will be relaunched with an expanded scope across the Williams-Sonoma brand, including Conery Bond and West Elm. We secured a new co-brand relationship with PayPal in Australia and Marketo Libra, the largest e-commerce retailer in Latin America. In partnership with Banco Itau, we also won the co-brand business of Magalu, a major retailer with 1 of the largest co-brand portfolios in Brazil. Finally, in the Asia Pacific region, we have secured a significant part of line past business with the partnership renewal in Taiwan, the largest co-brand program in the country. 
Fintech are also core to our consumer payments growth. In this quarter, we forged new partnerships and deepened relationships with onetime clients. I just mentioned LinePay in Taiwan, and we also continue to see strong momentum in our partnership with LinePay in Japan and with Line BK in Thailand. 
Over the last year, they have added more than 2 million Visa credentials across those markets. Likewise, in India, long-time partner, PayTM has issued 6 million virtual Visa debit cards. In addition, they recently started to issue physical Visa debit cards, which they expect to ramp up over the coming months. CakalaPay, one of the top 3 mobile wallet providers in Korea with more than 30 million users recently signed on to issue Visa credit cards. In the Middle East, we're partnering with STC Pay the fintech subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's largest telecom operator to embed [Indiscernible] pay wallets. More than 1 million Visa credentials have been issued since September of '20. Rappi, Latin America Super app with over 70 million users have now started issuing Visa credit cards in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Peru with plans to expand to additional countries in coming months. And in the crypto space, we recently signed 3 partnerships, 1 with Pala to partner on cryptocurrency solutions for the global unbanked and 2 with crypto exchanges, FTX and coin Zoom to begin offering Visa cards. We now have more than 50 crypto wallet and platforms, up from 35 in Q1 and more than the next leading network. And collectively, they drove over $1 billion in payments volume at represents a significant engine of growth. The market opportunity in new flows is 10x greater, and we continue to make progress in our efforts. We had several capabilities within carded B2B that have been gaining traction. Our freedom solution enables corporates to control and monitor corporate card spending and expand to new use cases, including payables and virtual card capabilities. Across Australia and New Zealand, we have renewed our long-standing partnerships with ANZ Bank for Freedom's expense management capabilities as well as NAB and VNZ to deliver expense management and payable solutions. And in the United States, Wells Fargo will deliver these capabilities to their corporate clients as part of our partnership we announced earlier this year. This is commercial pay, which offers a mobile app enabling virtual card issuance and management of business incidentals with enhanced data will be part of OCBC Bank's virtual purchasing card offering in Singapore. Visa Direct transaction growth remains robust with nearly $0.5 billion more transactions this quarter than in the third quarter of last year. We continue to see large banks enable Visa Direct payouts for their customers, including CIBC this quarter. In the payroll category, ADP, a leading global technology company providing human capital management solutions recently integrated its wisely offering with Visa Direct to provide ADP clients with a digitally enabled convenient and cost-effective solution for employee off-cycle payments. In the P2P space, the WhatsApp app payment feature powered by Visa Direct and Visa Cloud token framework launched in Brazil in May, and we're seeing early success with a significant number of Visa credentials enrolled and sizable growth in P2P money transfers. PayPal announced instant transfers for merchant settlement and P2P via Visa Direct in Australia. We also developed new use cases this quarter for Visa Direct First, go fund me, is integrating Visa Direct to soon launch funds disbursement to individuals and organizations Second, trade, the Canadian brokerage platform announced the launch of Instant Deposit, allowing investors to fund their trade accounts in seconds. 
Let's now move to our third growth lever, value-added services, where revenue growth grew 28% in Q3. Let me discuss our efforts across a few of our capabilities. First, installments. In addition to investing in and partnering with numerous installment providers globally, we've also developed our own solution, which had some notable progress in the quarter. In Canada, Scotiabank is extending their post-purchase installments. They're offering to eligible Visa retail credit clients. CIBC is launching installments during purchase and Desjardin, North America's largest financial cooperative will be offering during purchase installments for their eligible Visa customers. In addition, Global Payments is enabling our installment solution for their merchant customers. 
Second, CyberSource, our omnichannel gateway platform has grown as a result of 3 drivers: one, increased e-commerce and omnichannel volumes; two, more business creating online and omnichannel presences while leveraging our risk tools; and three, more acquirers white labeling the solution. This past quarter, top 20 U.S. acquirer [Indiscernible] at Qatar National Bank, both signed out to utilize sidesources capabilities. Third, DPS. I mentioned the processing agreement earlier with Navy Federal, they intend to utilize DPS. In addition, current, one of the fastest-growing U.S. fintechs with nearly 3 million members have selected Visa DPS as its partner. Current will integrate with DPS' newest all digital processing solution called DPS Forward, which combines issuer processing capabilities with a new suite of APIs that integrate with modern digital banking players to create unique card programs and payment solutions. Finally, Visa consulting and analytics. Our advisory teams have delivered nearly 1,000 projects year-to-date in 88 countries to help our clients be more successful. Let me just share a couple of examples. 
In Latin America, we developed a digital acquisition platform and helped one of the top issuers in the region improve credit approval turnaround times from days to minutes while also better qualify and leads to reach a 4x improvement in approval rate deflected their prior solution. Globally, we have launched a new program called Visa Portfolio Health Check, where we review client portfolios tracking 30-plus key performance indicators. Year-to-date, we have held health checks across 55 countries, identifying nearly 300 specific opportunities worth nearly $50 billion in incremental payment volume. 
Before I close, let me touch briefly on the 2 recently announced acquisitions. First, out of the open banking platform, PINK. This has proven infrastructure and sustained investment in resilient cybersecurity and fraud prevention, combined with PINK's API, their technology and customer relationships is expected to help accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe by ensuring a secure, reliable platform for innovation, which will help consumers and businesses. 
Second is the acquisition of Currency Cloud, a global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide their customer and business customers innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments around the world. As part of our network of network strategy, the combination of currency Cloud's capabilities on the front end of the transaction through their API and our settlement capabilities across VisaNet and other Visa networks, such as Plus or port and Visa B2B Connect will be very compelling value propositions for our partners. 
In closing, as we look to finish our fiscal year, I'm very encouraged by the recovery trajectory across the board and pleased with the momentum in many of our key growth areas. Our recently launched new brand campaign describes Visa-as-a-Network working for everyone, and we are increasingly sitting at the center of enabling money movement. I'm confident that our strategy combined with -- our network-to-network strategy, combined with our 3 growth levers of consumer payments, new flows and value-added services remains more relevant than ever and positions us well as we look forward to a robust recovery. 
With that, let me turn it over to Vasant. Vasant?"
38043467,1673196600,2352168,"Visa Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal third quarter results exceeded our expectations with net revenues up 27% and driven by robust growth in both credit and debit in the U.S., higher cross-border volumes from a faster-than-anticipated recovery",2190,"Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal third quarter results exceeded our expectations with net revenues up 27% and driven by robust growth in both credit and debit in the U.S., higher cross-border volumes from a faster-than-anticipated recovery in travel as well as a spike in cryptocurrency purchases and lower client incentives, largely due to deal timing. As we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, net revenue growth would have been 39%. The reason for this large difference in growth is a result of the significant quarter-over-quarter change in growth rates of payments volumes both last year and this year. The third quarter last year experienced the steepest drop in payments volume and third quarter this year has been our strongest growth quarter since the pandemic started. When adjusted for the service fee recognition lag, net revenues for Q3 FY '20 are lower and net revenues for Q3 this year are higher. GAAP EPS grew 10%, primarily due to a nonrecurring noncash step-up in deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recently announced increase in U.K. tax rates starting in 2023. Non-GAAP EPS rose 41%, helped by lower-than-expected expense growth and a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shifts lifted net revenue growth by 1 point and EPS growth by 2 points. As we did last quarter, to help you better assess both the magnitude and the trajectory of the recovery, we have also provided key performance metrics relative to fiscal year '19. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 34%, led by continued strength in debit as well as improved credit spending. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, Global Payments volume was 21% higher a 5-point acceleration from the second quarter with debit and credit improving by 5 points and 4 points, respectively. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 38% or 25% higher than 2019 and a 5-point acceleration from the second quarter. Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded card conversion, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was 40% and up 30% over 2019, benefiting from economic impact payments in the first half of the quarter and then from the lifting of COVID-related restrictions across the country. Debit growth accelerated 4 points, up 48% from 2019, remaining strong throughout the quarter as the trend towards accelerated cash digitization and e-commerce was sustained even as the economy reopened. Credit growth improved 8 points up 14 points from 2019. The credit improvement was fueled by 2 interrelated factors: a significant acceleration in travel, entertainment and restaurant spending as well as the resurgence of affluent cardholder spending. Card-present spend accelerated by 9 points to 12% about 2019, even as [Indiscernible] as in volume, excluding travel, improved 4 points to 59% over '19. Online shopping habits acquired during the pandemic are persisting. As the U.S. reopened, travel and entertainment spending improved steadily through the quarter, both up about 25 points from the second quarter. Travel is approaching 2019 levels in July, while entertainment surpassed 2019 levels in May. Restaurant spending in the quarter was over 20% above 2019 levels. Growth across all other spend categories remain strong and stable. International constant dollar payments volume growth improved 4 points from the second quarter, up 13% over 2019 levels. 
A few regional highlights. Growth in our CEMEA region remained strong, up 48% from 2019 levels, consistent with Q2, fueled by cash utilization and client wins. Latin America was also up 48% from 2019, accelerating 8 points from the second quarter with robust performance across the region, fueled by market share gains. Brazil volumes are seemingly unaffected by the high level of COVID cases due to significant cash utilization and large increases in e-commerce adoption. We're also benefiting from our digital partnerships and client wins in Brazil. Europe was up 17% from 2019, improving 9 points from the second quarter, the largest sequential acceleration among our regions. Across Europe, restrictions were relaxed and in-store spending recovered while e-commerce spend remains strong. Asia Pacific remains our weakest region up 5% from 2019 and down 3 points from the second quarter, excluding China. Performance across the region varied based on the level of infections and COVID-related restrictions. There were intermittent restrictions during the quarter in Australia, Japan and Singapore. Much of Southeast Asia was significantly impacted by rising COVID infections and result in lockdowns. In India, a sharp slowdown in spending starting in mid-April and through May was followed by a quick rebound with July trending well above 2019 levels. Global profit transaction growth was 20% over 2019, improving 4 points from the second quarter as transactions increased with volume across every region, except the U.S., where transaction growth still lags payments volume growth due to higher ticket sizes. Visa Direct transaction growth remained robust in the mid-50s. The cross-border volume recovery continued as more countries open their borders Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, was at 82% of 2019 volumes, a 7-point improvement from Q2, led by a steady increase in travel as well as a spike in cross-border cryptocurrency purchases from mid-April through the end of May. Cross-border Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, continued to be very strong, up 56% from 2019, improving 12 points from the second quarter. The crypto prudency purchases representing most of that acceleration. We have seen more active cards and more spend per card in cryptocurrency purchases. We saw the normal seasonal uptick in cross-border travel spending during March and April. However, cross-border travel in May and June was stronger than the typical seasonal trend as many bottles reopened or ease requirements.  Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe, was at 45% of 2019 levels, expanding 6 points in the second quarter, rising from 40% of 2019 in April to 50% in June. The state of the cross-border travel recovery varies significantly across regions, depending on bother openings, quarantines and other requirements as well as infection levels. Outbound travel from the U.S. and Latin America was back to around 60% of 2019 levels in the third quarter, but as Europe and EMEA were about halfway back. Inbound travel has recovered the most into Latin America and EMEA with Latin America above 2019 levels due to Mexico, but as the U.S. and Europe are only about 1/3 of 2019 levels. Asia Pacific cross-border travel, both in and out, has recovered the least still at around 1/4 of 2019 levels. We have seen immediate impacts when popular travel destinations open their bothers. Greece open borders in April and inbound card present spend rose nearly 30 points by the end of June relative to 2019 levels. France opened on June 9, and inbound card-present volume rose nearly 20 points by the end of June relative to 2019. Travel to Mexico has been strong for several quarters, while the third quarter accelerated further helped by travel from the U.S. and this vaccination progress. 
Since April, core cross-border spend in Mexico from the U.S. rose nearly 50 points to over 170% of 2019 levels. 
Moving now to a quick review of third quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 17%, led by 11% growth in the second quarter constant dollar payments volume, helped further by favorable exchange rates and mix as well as small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 32% due to very strong domestic processed transaction growth, particularly outside the U.S. The 7 percentage point difference between revenue and processed transaction growth reflected the mix shift away from higher-yielding cross-border transactions. In addition, while value-added services recorded in data processing revenues had strong and accelerating growth, this was lower than overall process transaction growth, which benefited from lapping effects. International transaction revenues were up 54%, 8 points lower than nominal cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, due to lapping high currency volatility last year and a less favorable regional mix. Other revenues grew 31%, led by consulting and data services and helped by lapping COVID impacts last year. In total, value-added services revenue grew 28%. Of the 14-point acceleration from the second quarter, about 2/3 was due to COVID-related lapping effects. Client incentives were 25.8% of gross revenues, consistent with the second quarter but lower than our expectations due to both numerator and denominator effects.  A lower-than-expected numerator as some deals were delayed and are now expected for the fourth quarter, also higher incentives from U.S. outperformance were largely offset by lower incentives from underperformance in Asia Pacific.  A higher-than-expected denominator as we had stronger cross-border volumes and value-added services revenue, both of which don't have significant incentives associated with them. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 12%, below our expectations, mostly due to timing of some initiatives being pushed into Q4, particularly marketing spend and professional fees. Marketing expenses did grow over 50% in the quarter as we lapped reductions in spending at the outset of COVID last year. G&A expenses decreased year-over-year due to favorable foreign currency fluctuations and lower indirect taxes. We recorded gains from our equity investments of $439 million Visa has minority investments in over 50 strategic partners. When there is a new financing round or an IPO, per the accounting rules, we mark our investments to market, which can result in gains or losses. Our investment portfolio has been performing very well. There were gains across several of our investments. The gain recorded this quarter was largely driven by 1 partner financing round and another partner's IPO. Excluding investment gains, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $114 million in the fiscal third quarter. Our GAAP tax rate was 41.3% due to a $1 billion nonrecurring noncash tax charge pertaining to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities and the taxes related to investment gains. The non-GAAP tax rate was lower than expected at 17.9% due to the recognition of a tax benefit. GAAP EPS was $1.18, an non-GAAP EPS was $1.49, up 41% over last year. We bought 9.5 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $227.83 for $2.2 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned approximately $2.9 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. 
Moving on to our outlook for the fourth quarter. I'll start with business trends through July 21. U.S. payments volume growth was 31%, above 2019, consistent with the third quarter, with debit up 46% and credit up 17% versus 2019. As we've said before, weekly numbers can have noise in them. For example, in the third week of July 2019, and a major online retailer had their annual sales event, which impacted performance indexed to 2019, particularly e-commerce spending using credit. International payments volume trends versus 2019 are moderately about a third quarter, but in line with June. Notable exceptions include improvements in India, Canada and Brazil, with modest slowdown in Australia and Japan. Process transaction growth continued to improve, up 23% versus 2019. The Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis were 81% of 2019, which is 1 point below the third quarter in June. 
Travel-related spending versus 2019 improved 3 points compared to June, offset by lower e-commerce growth, mostly due to cryptocurrency purchases falling back to pre-April levels. The recent announcement by the U.K. and Canada regarding border openings in August should be helpful in the fourth quarter, while Asia Pacific remained largely close to travelers. Assuming July trends continue, fourth quarter net revenue growth is expected to be in line with the third quarter. We expect the benefit from the service fee recognition lab and the cross-border travel recovery to be partially offset by cryptocurrency purchases falling back to pre-April levels as well as smaller year-over-year lapping benefits in transaction processing and value-added services revenues. We expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenue to increase 0.5 point to 1 point versus the third quarter due to delays from the third quarter and the typical increase we see in Q4 due to the end of fiscal year-end deal closing -- end of fiscal year deal closings. The third quarter was the first quarter of growth relative to fiscal year '19, we have had since the pandemic started. Based on current trends, we expect fourth quarter net revenue growth relative to fiscal year '19 to be in the same range as the third quarter. 
Q4 operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-teens inclusive of some expenses planned for the third quarter, which were pushed into Q4. Nonoperating expense is expected to be around $125 million our tax rate expectations are in the 19% to 19.5% range. In summary, we had a stronger-than-expected third quarter as economies and bottles reopened. Even as card present recovered, e-commerce spend stayed strong. [Indiscernible] spending sustained high growth rates as cash digitization remains robust. The cross-border travel recovery is gaining momentum. Our new flows and value-added services businesses continue to grow at high rates as they have all through the pandemic. We are stepping up investments in key growth initiatives as we look ahead to several quarters of recovery and prepare to capture the exciting opportunities available to us in the post-COVID era. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Mike for questions and answers."

So structurally, debit is benefiting from cash digitization picking up as well as the move to e-commerce. What you are seeing though is that credit is accelerating quite fast. And if you look at the numbers, the biggest quarter-over-quarter recovery has been quite significant in credit. Structurally, I think what we're seeing is the affluent customer come back to spending because economies have reopened and the plastic sector that would benefit from reopening like restaurants, travel and entertainment, are also picking up. There are so many things going on here that are, let's call it, recovery related or fundamental changes like cash digitization and e-commerce that it's too early to tell whether there is a significant structural change between the use of debit and credit. I think credit has got quite a few quarters to go of recovery, and the trend remains quite robust even as we look at July."

There's an awful lot of players in the open banking space in Europe because of the fact that it is in ground -- it is ground zero. And we do think that the combination of our various capabilities and relationships, combined with Tink's technology and relationship is going to ideally accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe. 
It's early days, but there is going to be an increased adoption of open banking. And we see making progress in Europe first even beyond the 18 markets that Tink is in, and there's no reason why we can't take the business to other parts of the world, particularly in Asia and CEMEA."

And that requires both signing key partners. We had announced last quarter, I guess, the signing of Goldman Sachs transaction banking as a user of B2B Connect. And we're using bank integrators like ACI and Fiserv and bottom line to help us as well in terms of of driving more players in B2B Connect. 
At this point, that's our emphasis. Our emphasis is building out this -- the robustness of this network. So it has more endpoints and more clients. Again, we see this as a $10 billion opportunity, and we think that B2B Connect is -- has the capability to be a much better than Swift kind of alternative for driving payments without having to build -- cross-border payments without having to build out a corresponding banking network. 
So we've continued to sign players, and they've continued to do their infrastructure connections to us, and we've started to drive transactions.

Certainly, people were buying less travel benefits from us. There were less transactions in certain cases, against which we could sell value-added services. 
But as I said, we started to see transactions really roar back this quarter. For the first time ever, we averaged over 600 million transactions a quarter -- in the quarter -- and for every day in the quarter, I should say. And that was up 160 from -- by more than 160 million transactions a day a year ago during the pandemic. So I think that as we start to get into what I believe is going to be a robust recovery and a continued growth in transactions, we're going to continue to see our platform type services, CyberSource, our issuer processing, our risk and identity services, which represent about 2/3 of our value-added services grow very nicely. 
I think we've continued to start to see recoveries on the other side in things like our consulting. And I think as travel comes back, our card benefits and travel-related card benefits will increase. So I think that while we went during the height of the pandemic, we got off our trajectory of where we wanted to be in 5 years. I feel like we're going to get right back on that trajectory and maybe even do better than we might have thought we would do. 
In terms of new flows, I'd say a couple of things. One is, obviously, Visa Direct continues to do very well. I cited that it was almost 0.5 billion more transactions in the quarter than in the prior year. And I think in Vasant's remarks, he talked about mid-50s percent growth levels continuing. And we've seen this for numbers of quarters now. 
And in the B2B space, we're starting to see some recovery. The B2B space looks like the consumer credit space. So it's -- the commercial volumes kind of echoing or following that, mirroring that, although small business is obviously recovering quicker than large market. But as I think as people start to come back to work, as business travel starts to return, I feel good that the commercial volume will continue to come back as well. So again, I would say that in the new flows area, while we, again, went off trajectory from what we would have said at Investor Day, the reality is I think we'll get right back on now as we're seeing a really -- a very good beginning to what I think will be a robust recovery."

So as it relates to the second part of your question, if you look at the trends in the first 3 weeks of July, and I want to emphasize, as we've said before, that 3 weeks don't make a trend.

So as it relates to the second part of your question, if you look at the trends in the first 3 weeks of July, and I want to emphasize, as we've said before, that 3 weeks don't make a trend. And you shouldn't read too much into it. I told you that the third week of July in the U.S. was impacted by what happened in the third week of July in 2019 because that's sort of -- we often look at it as a clean year. But when you look at week-by-week numbers, there's always going to be unusual things about what happened in the same week in 2019 or what day of the week was when or what holidays impact were and so on. 
So setting that aside, what you saw in the first 3 weeks of July was quite a bit of stability on the cross-border side. And we think that's sort of the trend for the fourth quarter. We see some of the cryptocurrency cross-border purchases have fallen back to pre actual levels. We had a spike in April and May, as we mentioned. So that will -- has pulled back in July, as you can see. 
That was replaced by travel continuing to recover. And so that gives you a certain amount of stability. The big question mark is what kind of a summer travel improvement will we get in cross-border travel given that while borders have opened and substantially more borders are open than they were before, it's still not normal and that all borders are not open, and especially borders in Asia are not open. So I think our best sort of view of the fourth quarter as it relates to cross-border travel and cross-border in general is that cross-border in general, stays relatively stable with the third quarter with travel recovering and cryptocurrency purchases falling back a bit. And so on balance, we're at neutral. 
In terms of the domestic businesses around the world, we provided you some color in the comments. Everything we're seeing so far, if you adjust for unique things that's happened in 2019 is a trend that either stable or slightly better in the U.S. and around the world, either stable or slightly better with no evidence right now anywhere of delta impact in the spending. 
And an important correlation there is mobility. Mobility is highly correlated with spending we find. And mobility indexes in general, are either stable or climbing still even as infections are climbing in many parts of the world. And even where infections have gone up a lot, mobility doesn't seem to be impacted yet. No evidence of it, nor are we seeing any impact on spending."

I might use a different phrase than pent-up demand. I think it's a little bit of a return to normal. And I'd also bring back the -- we're starting -- gyms are open, people are going to sporting events. And then I'd come back to something Vasant cited in response to one of the earlier questions, which is the affluent customers jumped back into the marketplace. These are the people that drive up white table cloth restaurant spending, these are the people who make discretionary purchases, these are the people who are heading to Mexico and other places as borders open up. And so I think, again, I'd echo what Vasant said that mobility can continue to improve. I think we just get closer and closer to returning to a more normal.

If you apply that to our international revenue line, it gives you a sense of it. 
Now we do have some additional cross-border revenues in the data processing line because that is -- there's data processing revenue associated with cross-border too. So if you do the math, I mean, you can see that it's a sizable amount of revenue. 
Yes, you're right, incentives are not generally tied to cross border. There are in some parts of the world particularly Asia, where for travel-related portfolios, we may have some incentives tied to cross-border in those portfolios. So a fair chunk of it would flow through to the net revenue line. And that's one of the reasons, in fact, why our incentives as a percent of gross revenues have climbed, it's because of this mix shift. 
As far as how that -- how much of that flows through to the bottom line, our approach has been we need to invest as much as we need to invest to grow the business. There are significant opportunities available. We've already told you that our expenses will grow in the mid-teens in the fourth quarter. If cross-border recovers faster, that won't necessarily change our investment plans. And we've never managed for margins. Margins are an outcome. Our goal is to drive as much volume and revenue growth as we can and to invest what we need to to drive that growth."

Look, the reality is the world is shrinking from the perspectives of how easy it is for people to buy from sellers in different countries and different regions around the world. We've seen a dramatic increase, millions and millions of people shopping online during the pandemic, who never shopped online before. So our expectation is that you're going to continue to see very, very good growth in cross-border e-commerce going forward. 
I think that the whole e-commerce trend, both domestically and in terms of cross-border is something you're not going to be able to nor want to go back to the way it was before. I think that this is a fundamental change in how people shop, and it's going to continue to drive cash digitization that we've been talking about. 
Currencycloud, the acquisition we announced, I don't know, 1 week or 2 ago, I think builds on and extends our existing capabilities to provide better FX services and easier connectivity to fintech, financial institutions and other partners, and they have a really cool set of APIs. And we think the combination of Currencycloud's capabilities on the front end of a transaction via those APIs and our settlement capabilities across VisaNet and our other networks, B2B Connect, Earthport, Plus, et cetera, is going to create a very powerful combination. 
So ultimately, our intention is to provide global reach here with simplicity and flexibility at competitive pricing, and we want to leverage our settlement scale and make sure that we're also leveraging our sophistication and managing risk. So we like the asset in Currencycloud. We like this to be a combination of Visa's capabilities and Currencycloud's capabilities. And we like the fact that from a dynamics perspective, we see cross-border travel continuing to come back over time. And we see the e-commerce cross-border continuing to be robust as we look forward."

And going back to your question about moving past sort of our traditional business of enabling payments to merchants cross-border. You've heard us talk about the extraordinary progress we're making in remittances, for example. We signed up all the major remittance providers and we can provide a very flexible, very attractive proposition for their consumers at a very attractive cost. And remittances is almost as big in volume as foreign direct investment, and it's not an area that we served before. 
Beyond that, you heard earlier about Visa payment service -- payout service, which is very valuable to pay big economy players around the world as well as it has a big role to play in marketplace payouts and so on. 
The third one I would highlight is the partnerships we signed with a whole range of cryptocurrency wallets, that enable the use of Visa credentials where they issue at 70 million merchants around the world, and a big chunk of that business is expected to be cross-border, too. So our business in cross-border has gone well beyond the traditional, let's call it, C2B space to P2P cross-border, to B2B cross-border, of course, and a significant chunk of B2C cross-border."

As we've said, we've already given you some indications of our posture as it relates to investment. We are preparing for multiple quarters of recovery. You heard earlier about the conversation about the cross-border recovery that still remains ahead of us. So clearly, there's plenty of recovery still to come. And we are investing in preparation for the post-COVID world, where we see extraordinary opportunities in new flows and value-added services. So we are stepping up investments and our expenses are growing in the mid-teens and so on. But in terms of projecting where revenues are going to be or what the volume trends are going to be, we'll favor a lot of that discussion and pricing and our thoughts for that for October."

So I think that travel is going to -- has started to come back. It will continue to come back as mobility increases, as restrictions get lifted, et cetera. And I think issuers are trying to make sure that as that happens and as the affluent consumer and the middle market consumer starts to get in their car and get on airplanes more that their product will be top of wallet.

So essentially, most of the time, cryptocurrency impacts our business is when purchases go up. A lot of the people who buy crypto are buying them from entities that are non-U.S. based, often based in Europe. So these end up being cross-border transactions when they buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. And so when there is a spike in buying activity, you will see that in some of our cross-border e-commerce numbers. 
In terms of quantifying how much it is, if you look at the -- our cross-border e-commerce business ex travel has been quite stable through several weeks and months. You'll see a bump up in April and into May, and you can attribute a fair amount of that strictly to cryptocurrency purchases. We've had this before. There was another spike when there was a big run-up in crypto prices and then a collapse, I don't know, must have been a year ago. So it has happened before. It has now fallen back to pre-April levels, although it's still running at a level that is higher than it was 6 months ago. But you can quantify it if you look at the numbers."

We had a really strong fiscal third quarter as payments volume, process transactions and cross-border volume all improved globally. In our time today, I will first cover our results and then discuss our performance to date across our 3 growth levers: consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. 
The first Q3 results. Net revenue rose 27% or 39% if service revenues were recognized on the current quarter's payment volume. This growth far exceeded our expectations due to the strength in the U.S., improving cross-border volumes and lower-than-expected client incentives, largely due to deal timing. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.49, up 41%. 
As we look at volumes and transactions, keep in mind that year-over-year growth rates are less indicative of performance and the business trajectory due to the COVID-19 impact. So once again, we provide metrics compared to 2019 on a constant dollar basis as well as year-over-year growth rates. 
Payments volume was 121% of 2019, which is up 5 points from the second quarter and represents a 34% year-over-year growth rate. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, was 82% of 2019, 7 points better than the second quarter and up 53% year-over-year. Process transactions were 120% of 2019, up 4 points from Q2 and up 39% year-over-year. 
Vasant will provide more color on our results. So now let me transition to progress relative to our business strategy. Efforts across our 3 growth levers helped to fuel strong results while positioning us to capture future opportunities. 
In consumer payments this quarter, we saw a favorable secular trend and had a number of wins with large issuers, co-brands and fintechs. Cash displacement trends continued this quarter. Globally, cash volume on Visa debit credentials, the dollar amount of cash taken out of ATMs, was 98% of 2019 levels, flat [Audio Gap] on Visa debit credentials was 140% of 2019 levels, up 5 points from Q2. 
While debit remained strong and has accelerated since Q2, credit spending is now also improving. Global credit payment volume was 104% of 2019, up 4 points from the second quarter. At the same time, face-to-face payments volume trends are stable to improving, while e-commerce or card-not-present remains elevated. When we average across our top markets where we process versus 2019, we see card-present improve 10 points, while card-not-present, excluding travel, improved 1 point in Q3 over Q2. 
Travel is starting to recover both domestically and in cross-border. Again, averaging across our top markets where we process versus 2019, domestic travel spending improved more than 20 points in Q3 over Q2. Globally, cross-border travel, excluding intra-Europe, versus 2019 improved 6 points in Q3 over Q2 and exited the quarter with June at 50% of 2019. Simply looking at the absolute levels, it was a record quarter for Visa with $2.7 trillion in payments volume and payment transactions per day globally, which is up 16 million per day from the last quarter and nearly 160 million transactions per day from a year ago. And we expect much more recovery to come, especially in the areas of credit and cross-border travel. 
Tap to pay is a key accelerator for many of these trends, including face-to-face spending in both credit and debit. We continue to see countries increase in tap to pay limits. For example, in Brazil, the limit was doubled 5 months ago and the face-to-face tap to pay penetration has already more than doubled from 6% to 14% in that short period. In the United States this quarter, we surpassed 370 million tap to pay-enabled cards, and we now have 3 cities above 25% face-to-face tap to pay penetration: New York, San Francisco and San Jose. Merchant progress continued as well. Target has doubled its tap to pay penetration in the last year to 2 out of every 5 face-to-face transactions, and Costco's U.S. gas stations have reached 40% penetration in tap to pay payments since enabling this feature approximately 6 months ago. 
Now shifting to clients. We continue to win with large issuers globally. Let me share a few examples from the quarter. In the United States, we are pleased to have renewed our long-standing partnership with Navy Federal Credit Union, the largest U.S. credit union with over 10.5 million members for a multiyear credit, debit and processing agreement. Also in the U.S., Google Pay introduced a Visa virtual card that links to U.S. Android users' Google Pay balances, enabling these users to spend their balances at stores. 
In Italy, we extended our agreement with Banca Sella, part of the Sella Group, the largest private and independent banking group in Italy, for the consumer credit and commercial portfolios with plans to launch a new innovative digital credit small business solution. In Singapore, we're expanding our strong partnership with DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia. We have [ renewed ] and we will continue to grow in the DBS debit portfolio. In Latin America, we renewed the HSBC debit portfolio, 1 of the top 5 portfolios in Mexico. In our CEMEA region, we won the consumer credit portfolio of Qatar National Bank, the largest financial institution in the Middle East and Africa. And we renewed the credit portfolio of Saudi British Bank, one of the largest Saudi banks. 
We're also building momentum as a global leader in co-brands. In the U.S. alone, we have 7 of the top 10 co-brands. And this quarter, we're pleased to renew Hyatt in the U.S. and renew and grow the Williams-Sonoma co-brand, which will be relaunched with an expanded scope across the Williams-Sonoma brand, including Pottery Barn and West Elm. We secured a new co-brand relationship with PayPal in Australia and MercadoLibre, the largest e-commerce retailer in Latin America. In partnership with Banco ItaÃº, we also won the co-brand business of Magalu, a major retailer with one of the largest co-brand portfolios in Brazil. Finally, in the Asia Pacific region, we have secured a significant part of LINE Pay's business with a partnership renewal in Taiwan, the largest co-brand program in the country. 
Fintechs are also core to our consumer payments growth. In this quarter, we forged new partnerships and deepened relationships with onetime clients. I just mentioned LINE Pay in Taiwan, and we also continue to see strong momentum in our partnership with LINE Pay in Japan and with LINE BK in Thailand. Over the last year, they have added more than 2 million Visa credentials across those markets. Likewise, in India, long-time partner, Paytm has issued 6 million virtual Visa debit cards. In addition, they recently started to issue physical Visa debit cards, which they expect to ramp up over the coming months. KakaoPay, one of the top 3 mobile wallet providers in Korea with more than 30 million users, recently signed on to issue Visa credit cards. In the Middle East, we're partnering with stc pay, the fintech subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's largest telecom operator to embed stc pay wallets. More than 1 million Visa credentials have been issued since September of '20. Rappi, Latin America's super app with over 70 million users, have now started issuing Visa credit cards in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Peru with plans to expand to additional countries in coming months. 
And in the crypto space, we recently signed 3 partnerships: one with Tala to partner on cryptocurrency solutions for the global unbanked; and two, with crypto exchanges, FTX and CoinZoom, to begin offering Visa cards. We now have more than 50 crypto wallet and platforms, up from 35 in Q1 and more than the next leading network. And collectively, they drove over $1 billion in payments volume in just [Audio Gap] represents a significant engine of growth. 
The market opportunity in new flows is 10x greater, and we continue to make progress in our efforts. We had several capabilities within carded B2B that have been gaining traction. Our Freedom Solution enables corporates to control and monitor corporate card spending and expand to new use cases, including payables and virtual card capabilities. Across Australia and New Zealand, we have renewed our long-standing partnerships with ANZ Bank for Freedom's expense management capabilities as well as NAB and BNZ to deliver expense management and payable solutions. And in the United States, Wells Fargo will deliver these capabilities to their corporate clients as part of our partnership we announced earlier this year. 
Visa's Commercial Pay, which offers a mobile app enabling virtual card issuance and management of business incidentals with enhanced data, will be part of OCBC Bank's virtual purchasing card offering in Singapore. Visa Direct transaction growth remains robust with nearly $0.5 billion more transactions this quarter than in the third quarter of last year. We continue to see large banks enable Visa Direct payouts for their customers, including CIBC this quarter. 
In the payroll category, ADP, a leading global technology company providing human capital management solutions recently integrated its Wisely offering with Visa Direct to provide ADP clients with a digitally-enabled, convenient and cost-effective solution for employee off-cycle payments. 
In the P2P space, the WhatsApp payment feature powered by Visa Direct and Visa Cloud token framework launched in Brazil in May, and we're seeing early success with a significant number of Visa credentials enrolled and sizable growth in P2P money transfers. PayPal announced instant transfers for merchant settlement and P2P via Visa Direct in Australia. 
We also developed new use cases this quarter for Visa Direct. First, GoFundMe is integrating Visa Direct to soon launch funds disbursement to individuals and organizations. Second, Questrade, the Canadian brokerage platform, announced the launch of Instant Deposit, allowing investors to fund their trade accounts in seconds. 
Let's now move to our third growth lever, value-added services, where revenue growth grew 28% in Q3. Let me discuss our efforts across a few of our capabilities. 
First, installments. In addition to investing in and partnering with numerous installment providers globally, we've also developed our own solution, which had some notable progress in the quarter. In Canada, Scotiabank is extending their post-purchase installments offering to -- they're offering to eligible Visa retail credit clients. CIBC is launching installments during purchase and Desjardin, North America's largest financial cooperative, will be offering during purchase installments for their eligible Visa customers. In addition, Global Payments is enabling our installment solution for their merchant customers. 
Second, CyberSource, our omnichannel gateway platform, has grown as a result of 3 drivers: one, increased e-commerce and omnichannel volumes; two, more business creating online and omnichannel presences while leveraging our risk tools; and three, more acquirers white labeling the solution.
This past quarter, top 20 U.S. acquirer Paya and Qatar National Bank, both signed up to utilize CyberSource's capabilities. 
Third, DPS. I mentioned the processing agreement earlier with Navy Federal, they intend to utilize DPS. In addition, Current, one of the fastest-growing U.S. fintechs with nearly 3 million members, have selected Visa DPS as its partner. Current will integrate with DPS' newest all digital processing solution called DPS Forward, which combines issuer processing capabilities with a new suite of APIs that integrate with modern digital banking players to create unique card programs and payment solutions. 
Finally, Visa Consulting and Analytics. Our advisory teams have delivered nearly 1,000 projects year-to-date in 88 countries to help our clients be more successful. Let me just share a couple of examples. In Latin America, we developed a digital acquisition platform and helped one of the top issuers in the region improve credit approval turnaround times from days to minutes while also better qualifying leads to reach a 4x improvement in approval rate compared their prior solution. 
Globally, we have launched a new program called Visa Portfolio Health Check, where we review client portfolios tracking 30-plus key performance indicators. Year-to-date, we have held health checks across 55 countries, identifying nearly 300 specific opportunities worth nearly $50 billion in incremental payment volume. 
Before I close, let me touch briefly on the 2 recently announced acquisitions. First, out of the open banking platform, Tink. Visa's proven infrastructure and sustained investment in resilient cybersecurity and fraud prevention, combined with Tink's APIs, their technology and customer relationships is expected to help accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe by ensuring a secure, reliable platform for innovation, which will help consumers and businesses. 
Second is the acquisition of Currencycloud, a global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide their customer and business customers innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments around the world. As part of our network of networks strategy, the combination of Currencycloud's capabilities on the front end of the transaction through their API and our settlement capabilities across VisaNet and other Visa networks, such as Plus, Earthport and Visa B2B Connect will be very compelling value propositions for our partners. 
In closing, as we look to finish our fiscal year, I'm very encouraged by the recovery trajectory across the board and pleased with the momentum in many of our key growth areas. Our recently launched new brand campaign describes Visa-as-a-Network working for everyone, and we are increasingly sitting at the center of enabling money movement. I'm confident that our strategy combined with -- our network-to-network strategy (sic) [ network of networks strategy ], combined with our 3 growth levers of consumer payments, new flows and value-added services remains more relevant than ever and positions us well as we look forward to a robust recovery. 
With that, let me turn it over to Vasant. Vasant?"
38043467,1673196600,2352197,"Visa Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Visa Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal third quarter results exceeded our expectations with net revenues up 27%, driven by robust growth in both credit and debit in the U.S., higher cross-border volumes from a faster-than-anticipated recovery in",2181,"Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal third quarter results exceeded our expectations with net revenues up 27%, driven by robust growth in both credit and debit in the U.S., higher cross-border volumes from a faster-than-anticipated recovery in travel as well as a spike in cryptocurrency purchases and lower client incentives, largely due to deal timing. Had we recognized service revenues on current quarter payments volume, net revenue growth would have been 39%. The reason for this large difference in growth is a result of the significant quarter-over-quarter change in growth rates of payments volumes both last year and this year. 
The third quarter last year experienced the steepest drop in payments volume and third quarter this year has been our strongest growth quarter since the pandemic started. When adjusted for the service fee recognition lag, net revenues for Q3 FY '20 are lower and net revenues for Q3 this year are higher. GAAP EPS grew 10%, primarily due to a nonrecurring noncash step-up in deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recently announced increase in U.K. tax rates starting in 2023. Non-GAAP EPS rose 41%, helped by lower-than-expected expense growth and a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shifts lifted net revenue growth by 1 point and EPS growth by 2 points. 
As we did last quarter, to help you better assess both the magnitude and the trajectory of the recovery, we have also provided key performance metrics relative to fiscal year '19. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 34%, led by continued strength in debit as well as improved credit spending. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, global payments volume was 21% higher, a 5-point acceleration from the second quarter with debit and credit improving by 5 points and 4 points, respectively. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 38% or 25% higher than 2019 and a 5-point acceleration from the second quarter. Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded card conversion, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was 40% and up 30% over 2019, benefiting from economic impact payments in the first half of the quarter and then from the lifting of COVID-related restrictions across the country. 
Debit growth accelerated 4 points, up 48% from 2019, remaining strong throughout the quarter as the trend towards accelerated cash digitization and e-commerce was sustained even as the economy reopened. Credit growth improved 8 points, up 14 points from 2019. The credit improvement was fueled by 2 interrelated factors: a significant acceleration in travel, entertainment and restaurant spending; as well as the resurgence of affluent cardholder spending. Card-present spend accelerated by 9 points to 12% about 2019, even as card-not-present volume, excluding travel, improved 4 points to 59% over '19. Online shopping habits acquired during the pandemic are persisting. 
As the U.S. reopen, travel and entertainment spending improved steadily through the quarter, both up about 25 points from the second quarter. Travel is approaching 2019 levels in July, while entertainment surpassed 2019 levels in May. Restaurant spending in the quarter was over 20% above 2019 levels. Growth across all other spend categories remain strong and stable. International constant dollar payments volume growth improved 4 points from the second quarter, up 13% over 2019 levels. 
A few regional highlights. Growth in our CEMEA region remained strong, up 48% from 2019 levels, consistent with Q2, fueled by cash utilization and client wins. Latin America was also up 48% from 2019, accelerating 8 points from the second quarter with robust performance across the region, fueled by market share gains. Brazil volumes are seemingly unaffected by the high level of COVID cases due to significant cash utilization and large increases in e-commerce adoption. We're also benefiting from our digital partnerships and client wins in Brazil. Europe was up 17% from 2019, improving 9 points from the second quarter, the largest sequential acceleration among our regions. Across Europe, restrictions were relaxed and in-store spending recovered while e-commerce spend remained strong. 
Asia Pacific remains our weakest region, up 5% from 2019 and down 3 points from the second quarter, excluding China. Performance across the region varied based on the level of infections and COVID-related restrictions. There were intermittent restrictions during the quarter in Australia, Japan and Singapore. Much of Southeast Asia was significantly impacted by rising COVID infections and resulting lockdowns. In India, a sharp slowdown in spending starting in mid-April and through May was followed by a quick rebound with July spending well above 2019 levels. 
Global profit transaction growth was 20% over 2019, improving 4 points from the second quarter as transactions increased with volume across every region, except the U.S., where transaction growth still lags payments volume growth due to higher ticket sizes. Visa Direct transaction growth remained robust in the mid-50s. 
The cross-border volume recovery continued as more countries open their borders. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, was at 82% of 2019 volumes, a 7-point improvement from Q2, led by a steady increase in travel as well as a spike in cross-border cryptocurrency purchases from mid-April through the end of May. Cross-border card-not-present volume, excluding travel, continued to be very strong, up 56% from 2019, improving 12 points from the second quarter, with cryptocurrency purchases representing most of that acceleration. We have seen more active cards and more spend per card in cryptocurrency purchases. 
We saw the normal seasonal uptick in cross-border travel spending during March and April. However, cross-border travel in May and June was stronger than the typical seasonal trend as many borders reopened or eased requirements. Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe, was at 45% of 2019 levels, expanding 6 points in the second quarter, rising from 40% in 2019 April to 50% in June. The state of the cross-border travel recovery varies significantly across regions, depending on border openings, quarantines and other requirements as well as infection levels. Outbound travel from the U.S. and Latin America was back to around 60% of 2019 levels in the third quarter, but as Europe and CEMEA were about halfway back. 
Inbound travel has recovered the most into Latin America and CEMEA, with Latin America above 2019 levels due to Mexico, but as the U.S. and Europe are only about 1/3 of 2019 levels. Asia Pacific cross-border travel, both in and out, has recovered the least still at around 1/4 of 2019 levels. We have seen immediate impacts when popular travel destinations open their bothers. Greece opened borders in April and inbound card-present spend rose nearly 30 points by the end of June relative to 2019 levels. France opened on June 9, and inbound card-present volume rose nearly 20 points by the end of June relative to 2019. Travel to Mexico has been strong for several quarters, while the third quarter accelerated further helped by travel from the U.S. amidst vaccination progress. Since April, carp-present cross-border spend in Mexico from the U.S. rose nearly 50 points to over 170% of 2019 levels. 
Moving now to a quick review of third quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 17%, led by 11% growth in the second quarter constant dollar payments volume, helped further by favorable FX exchange rates and mix as well as small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 32% due to very strong domestic processed transaction growth, particularly outside the U.S. The 7 percentage point difference between revenue and processed transaction growth reflected the mix shift away from higher-yielding cross-border transactions. In addition, while value-added services recorded in data processing revenues had strong and accelerating growth, this was lower than overall process transaction growth, which benefited from lapping effects. International transaction revenues were up 54%, 8 points lower than nominal cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, due to lapping high currency volatility last year and a less favorable regional mix. 
Other revenues grew 31%, led by consulting and data services and helped by lapping COVID impacts last year. In total, value-added services revenue grew 28%. Of the 14-point acceleration from the second quarter, about 2/3 was due to COVID-related lapping effects. 
Client incentives were 25.8% of gross revenues, consistent with the second quarter but lower than our expectations due to both numerator and denominator effects. A lower-than-expected numerator as some deals were delayed and are now expected for the fourth quarter, also higher incentives from U.S. outperformance were largely offset by lower incentives from underperformance in Asia Pacific. A higher-than-expected denominator as we had stronger cross-border volumes and value-added services revenue, both of which don't have significant incentives associated with them. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 12%, below our expectations, mostly due to timing of some initiatives being pushed into Q4, particularly marketing spend and professional fees. Marketing expenses did grow over 50% in the quarter as we lapped reductions in spending at the outset of COVID last year. 
G&A expenses decreased year-over-year due to favorable foreign currency fluctuations and lower indirect taxes. We recorded gains from our equity investments of $439 million. Visa has minority investments in over 50 strategic partners. When there is a new financing round or an IPO, per the accounting rules, we mark our investments to market, which can result in gains or losses. Our investment portfolio has been performing very well. There were gains across several of our investments. The gain recorded this quarter was largely driven by 1 partner's financing round and another partner's IPO. Excluding investment gains, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $114 million in the fiscal third quarter. 
Our GAAP tax rate was 41.3% due to a $1 billion nonrecurring noncash tax charge pertaining to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities and the taxes related to investment gains. The non-GAAP tax rate was lower than expected at 17.9% due to the recognition of a tax benefit. 
GAAP EPS was $1.18, non-GAAP EPS was $1.49, up 41% over last year. We bought 9.5 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $227.83 for $2.2 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned approximately $2.9 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. 
Moving on to our outlook for the fourth quarter. I'll start with business trends through July 21. U.S. payments volume growth was 31% above 2019, consistent with the third quarter, with debit up 46% and credit up 17% versus 2019. As we've said before, weekly numbers can have noise in them. For example, in the third week of July 2019, a major online retailer had their annual sales event, which impacted performance indexed to 2019, particularly e-commerce spending using credit. International payments volume trends versus 2019 are moderately about a third quarter, but in line with June. Notable exceptions include improvements in India, Canada and Brazil, with modest slowdown in Australia and Japan. 
Process transaction growth continued to improve, up 23% versus 2019. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis were 81% of 2019, which is 1 point below the third quarter in June. 
Travel-related spending versus 2019 improved 3 points compared to June, offset by lower e-commerce growth, mostly due to cryptocurrency purchases falling back to pre-April levels. The recent announcement by the U.K. and Canada regarding border openings in August should be helpful in the fourth quarter, while Asia Pacific remained largely closed to travelers. 
Assuming July trends continue, fourth quarter net revenue growth is expected to be in line with the third quarter. We expect the benefit from the service fee recognition lag and the cross-border travel recovery to be partially offset by cryptocurrency purchases falling back to pre-April levels as well as smaller year-over-year lapping benefits in transaction processing and value-added services revenues. We expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenue to increase 0.5 point to 1 point versus the third quarter due to delays from the third quarter and the typical increase we see in Q4 due to the end of fiscal year-end deal closing -- end of fiscal year deal closings. 
The third quarter was the first quarter of growth, relative to fiscal year '19, we have had since the pandemic started. Based on current trends, we expect fourth quarter net revenue growth relative to fiscal year '19 to be in the same range as the third quarter. 
Q4 operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-teens inclusive of some expenses planned for the third quarter, which were pushed into Q4. Nonoperating expense is expected to be around $125 million. Our tax rate expectations are in the 19% to 19.5% range. 
In summary, we had a stronger-than-expected third quarter as economies and borders reopen. Even as card present spend recovered, e-commerce spend stayed strong. Debit spending sustained high growth rates as cash digitization remains robust. The cross-border travel recovery is gaining momentum. Our new flows and value-added services businesses continue to grow at high rates as they have all through the pandemic. We are stepping up investments in key growth initiatives as we look ahead to several quarters of recovery and prepare to capture the exciting opportunities available to us in the post-COVID era. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Mike for questions and answers."

So debit is the engine of cash digitization. So structurally, debit is benefiting from cash digitization picking up as well as the move to e-commerce. 
What you are seeing though is that credit is accelerating quite fast. And if you look at the numbers, the biggest quarter-over-quarter recovery has been quite significant in credit. Structurally, I think what we're seeing is the affluent customer come back to spending because the economies have reopened and the plastic sectors that would benefit from reopening like restaurants, travel and entertainment, are also picking up. There's so many things going on here that are, let's call it, recovery related or fundamental changes like cash digitization and e-commerce that it's too early to tell whether there is a significant structural change between the use of debit and credit. I think credit has got quite a few quarters to go of recovery, and the trend remains quite robust even as we look at July."

I mean, versus other markets, there's an awful lot of players in the open banking space in Europe because of the fact that it is in ground -- it is ground zero. And we do think that the combination of our various capabilities and relationships, combined with Tink's technology and relationships, that's going to ideally accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe. It's early days, but there is going to be an increased adoption of open banking, and we see making progress in Europe first, even beyond the 18 markets that take us in.

And that requires both signing key partners. We had announced last quarter, I guess, the signing of Goldman Sachs transaction banking as a user of B2B Connect. And we're using bank integrators like ACI and Fiserv and Bottomline to help us as well in terms of driving more players in B2B Connect. 
At this point, that's our emphasis. Our emphasis is building out this -- the robustness of this network. So it has more endpoints and more clients. Again, we see this as a $10 billion opportunity, and we think that B2B Connect is -- has the capability to be a much better than Swift kind of alternative for driving payments without having to build -- cross-border payments without having to build out a corresponding banking network. 
So we've continued to sign players, and they've continued to do their infrastructure connections to us. And we've started to drive transactions.

Obviously, in some of our value-added services, we actually saw declines during the pandemic. Certainly, people were buying less travel benefits from us. There were less transactions in certain cases against which we could sell value-added services. 
But as I said, we started to see transactions really roar back this quarter. For the first time ever, we averaged over 600 million transactions a quarter -- in the quarter -- and for every day in the quarter, I should say. And that was up 160 from -- by more than 160 million transactions a day a year ago during the pandemic. So I think that as we start to get into what I believe is going to be a robust recovery and a continued growth in transactions, we're going to continue to see our platform type services, CyberSource, our issuer processing, our risk and identity services, which represent about 2/3 of our value-added services grow very nicely. 
I think we've continued to start to see recoveries on the other side in things like our consulting. And I think as travel comes back, our card benefits and travel-related card benefits will increase. So I think that while we went -- during the height of the pandemic, we got off our trajectory of where we wanted to be in 5 years, I feel like we're going to get right back on that trajectory and maybe even do better than we might have thought we would do. 
In terms of new flows, I'd say a couple of things. One is, obviously, Visa Direct continues to do very well. I cited that it was almost 0.5 billion more transactions in the quarter than the prior year. And I think in Vasant's remarks, he talked about mid-50s percent growth levels continuing. And we've seen this for numbers of quarters now. 
And in the B2B space, we're starting to see some recovery. The B2B space looks like the consumer credit space. So it's -- the commercial volumes kind of echoing or following that, mirroring that, although small business is obviously recovering quicker than large market. But as I think -- as people start to come back to work, as business travel starts to return, I feel good that the commercial volume will continue to come back as well. So again, I would say that in the new flows area, while we, again, went off trajectory from what we would have said at Investor Day, the reality is I think we'll get right back on now as we're seeing a really -- a very good beginning to what I think will be a robust recovery."

So as it relates to your -- the second part of your question, if you look at the trends in the first 3 weeks of July -- and I want to emphasize, as we've said before, that 3 weeks don't make a trend and you shouldn't read too much into it. I told yo",456,"Sure. So as it relates to your -- the second part of your question, if you look at the trends in the first 3 weeks of July -- and I want to emphasize, as we've said before, that 3 weeks don't make a trend and you shouldn't read too much into it. I told you that the third week of July in the U.S. was impacted by what happened in the third week of July in 2019 because that's sort of -- we often look at it as a clean year. But when you look at week-by-week numbers, there's always going to be unusual things about what happened in the same week in 2019 or what day of the week was when or what holidays impact were and so on. 
So setting that aside, what you saw in the first 3 weeks of July was quite a bit of stability on the cross-border side. And we think that's sort of the trend for the fourth quarter. We see some of the cryptocurrency cross-border purchases have fallen back to pre-April levels. We had a spike in April and May, as we mentioned. So that will -- has pulled back in July, as you can see. 
That was replaced by travel continuing to recover. And so that gave you a certain amount of stability. The big question mark is what kind of a summer travel improvement will we get in cross-border travel given that while borders have opened and substantially more borders are open than there were before, it's still not normal in that all borders are not open, and especially borders in Asia are not open. So I think our best sort of view of the fourth quarter as it relates to cross-border travel and cross-border in general is that cross-border in general, stays relatively stable with the third quarter with travel recovering and cryptocurrency purchases falling back a bit. And so on balance, we're at neutral. 
In terms of the domestic businesses around the world, we provided you some color in the comments. Everything we're seeing so far, if you adjust for unique things that's happened in 2019 is a trend that either stable or slightly better in the U.S. and around the world, either stable or slightly better with no evidence right now anywhere of delta impact in the spending. 
And an important correlation there is mobility. Mobility is highly correlated with spending, we find. And mobility indexes in general, are either stable or climbing still even as infections are climbing in many parts of the world. And even where infections have gone up a lot, mobility doesn't seem to be impacted yet. No evidence of it, nor are we seeing any impact on spending."

I might use a different phrase than pent-up demand. I think it's a little bit of a return to normal. And I'd also bring back the -- we're starting -- gyms are open, people are going to sporting events. And then I'd come back to something Vasant cited in response to one of the earlier questions, which is the affluent customers jumped back into the marketplace. These are the people that drive up white table cloth restaurant spending, these are the people who make discretionary purchases, these are the people who are heading to Mexico and other places as borders open up. And so I think, again, I'd echo what Vasant said that mobility can continue to improve. I think we just get closer and closer to returning to a more normal and therefore, feel like that there's going to be a good run here of a good recovery for the business."

Can we just revisit the incremental net revenue opportunity from that? I know there's a lower correlation of rebates incentives from cross-border and it's a higher-margin business. So maybe if you could just reconfirm that. And then would you let much of that pass-through for shareholders just given that we've missed out on 1.5 years of cross-border to the same magnitude we should have had?"

We would have been indexing closer to 120 or 121, I suppose, if you assume 10%. And that delta between 82 and 121 gives you a sense. If you apply that to our international revenues line, it gives you a sense of it. 
Now we do have some additional cross-border revenues in the data processing line because that is -- there's data processing revenue associated with cross-border too. So if you do the math, I mean, you can see that it's a sizable amount of revenue. 
Yes, you're right, incentives are not generally tied to cross border. There are in some parts of the world, particularly Asia, where for travel-related portfolios, we may have some incentives tied to cross-border in those portfolios. So a fair chunk of it would flow through to the net revenue line. And that's one of the reasons, in fact, why our incentives as a percent of gross revenues have climbed. It's because of this mix shift. 
As far as how that -- how much of that flows through to the bottom line, our approach has been we need to invest as much as we need to invest to grow the business. There are significant opportunities available. We've already told you that our expenses will grow in the mid-teens in the fourth quarter. If cross-border recovers faster, that won't necessarily change our investment plans. And we've never managed for margins. Margins are an outcome. Our goal is to drive as much volume and revenue growth as we can and to invest what we need to, to drive that growth."

Look, the reality is the world is shrinking from the perspectives of how easy it is for people to buy from sellers in different countries and different regions around the world. And we've seen a dramatic increase, millions and millions of people shopping online during the pandemic, who never shopped online before. So our expectation is that you're going to continue to see very, very good growth in cross-border e-commerce going forward. 
I think that the whole e-commerce trend, both domestically and in terms of cross-border is something you're not going to be able to nor want to kind of go back to the way it was before. I think that this is a fundamental change in how people shop, and it's going to continue to drive cash digitization that we've been talking about. 
Currencycloud, the acquisition we announced, I don't know, 1 week or 2 ago, I think builds on and extends our existing capabilities to provide better FX services and easier connectivity to fintechs, financial institutions and other partners, and they have a really cool set of APIs. And we think the combination of Currencycloud's capabilities on the front end of a transaction via those APIs and our settlement capabilities across VisaNet and our other networks, B2B Connect, Earthport, Plus, et cetera, is going to create a very powerful combination. 
So ultimately, our intention is to provide global reach here with simplicity and flexibility at competitive pricing. And we want to leverage our settlement scale and make sure that we're also leveraging our sophistication in managing risk. So we like the asset in Currencycloud. We like this to be a combination of Visa's capabilities and Currencycloud's capabilities. And we like the fact that from a dynamics perspective, we see cross-border travel continuing to come back over time. And we see the e-commerce cross-border continuing to be robust as we look forward."

You've heard us talk about the extraordinary progress we're making in remittances. For example, we signed up all the major remittance providers and we can provide a very flexible, very attractive proposition for their consumers at a very attractive cost. And remittances is almost as big in volume as foreign direct investment, and it's not an area that we served before. 
Beyond that, you heard earlier about Visa payment service -- payout service, which is very valuable to pay the economy players around the world as well as it has a big role to play in marketplace payouts and so on. 
The third one I would highlight is the partnerships we've signed with a whole range of cryptocurrency wallets, that enable the use of Visa credentials that they issue at 70 million merchants around the world. And a big chunk of that business is expected to be cross-border, too. So our business in cross-border has gone well beyond the traditional, let's call it, C2B space to P2P cross-border to B2B cross-border, of course, and a significant chunk of B2C cross-border."

In terms of quantifying how much it is, if you look at the -- our cross-border e-commerce business ex travel has been quite stable through several weeks and months. You'll see a bump up in April and into May, and you can attribute a fair amount of that strictly to cryptocurrency purchases. We've had this before. There was another spike when there was a big run-up in crypto prices and then a collapse, I don't know, must have been a year ago. So it has happened before.

In the fourth quarter and throughout fiscal 2021, Visa has delivered strong results against the backdrop of economic uncertainty and the lingering impacts of the COVID pandemic. In doing so, we demonstrated the resiliency of our business and validated our growth strategy as we continue to drive the rapid growth of digital payments and enable innovation in money movement globally. 
A quick summary of Q4 results. Fourth quarter payments volume was 121% of 2019, up about 0.8 points from Q3 and up 17% year-over-year. Despite the backdrop of a global pandemic, this quarter, we also set a record with total global payments volume of $2.8 trillion. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, was 86% of 2019, 4 points better than Q3 and up 46% year-over-year. And processed transactions were 124% of 2019, up 4 points from Q3 and up 21% year-over-year. Our net revenues grew 29% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, up 44%. 
In talking to many of you over the last few months, I know you're wondering what's ahead for Visa and the payments ecosystem as we emerge from the pandemic. So rather than doing my usual report card on the quarter, I'm going to speak more broadly today about the 4 key reasons why we believe that Visa is even better positioned for growth than before the pandemic. 
One, there's still enormous opportunity ahead in consumer payments. Two, we continue to enhance our network of networks capability to facilitate money movement more seamlessly and securely for all players in the ecosystem and accelerate the penetration of new flows. Third, value-added services simultaneously help our clients leverage our scale and sophistication while diversifying Visa's business and driving more volume. Four, we enable much of the disruption and innovation in the payments ecosystem, which helps to accelerate Visa's growth. 
So let me start with number one, the enormous opportunity in consumer payments. We see that the pandemic has helped to further digitize cash. In the last 12 months, global debit cash volumes, which are primarily the amount of cash withdrawn from Visa debit cards has increased 4%, while debit payments volume has grown 23%, both on a constant dollar basis. 
In 2021, the number of monthly active e-commerce credentials and spend per active credential continued to grow strongly. For example, in the United States, monthly active credentials and active spend per credential both grew by more than 20% on average versus 2019. We've grown credentials for both traditional and new players to 3.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year. After renewing client contracts that represented 55% of our payments volume in the previous 2 years, we renewed contracts that represented nearly 20% in 2021. 
Let me just highlight a few of those deals in Q4. In our Asia Pacific region, we renewed 3 of Visa's top 20 issuers, including China Merchants Bank and Bank of China. In North America, we renewed 3 of the top 15 issuers. PNC renewed the prepaid consumer credit and debit, commercial credit and small business credit and debit portfolios. Regions also renewed the prepaid consumer credit and debit, commercial credit and small business credit and debit portfolios. And RBC and Visa have entered into a renewal of their agreement with respect to the issuance of credit, debit and prepaid cards in Canada. 
Fintechs have also fueled our growth in the last year, nearly 30% more fintechs issued Visa credentials, and they have more than doubled their payments volume. Furthermore, fintechs are scaling. We've also grown acceptance to more than 80 million merchant locations, up 14% year-over-year. And when you include small businesses behind players like Stripe and Square, the number is north of 100 million merchant locations. 
We've grown tap to pay to 70% of all face-to-face transactions globally. Excluding the United States, we have more than 70 countries with over 50% contactless penetration. U.S. penetration is now over 15%, more than double from just a year ago with 400 million cards, quadruple what we had 2 years ago. We know from other markets that tapping brings increased spending and transactions while digitizing cash. 
We also continue to innovate to make it easier for partners to access and utilize our platforms and capabilities. One recent example is Visa Cloud Connect, which enables clients to connect to VisaNet via the cloud, eliminating the need for investment in local data centers, telecommunications infrastructure and any specialized payment hardware. 
To summarize, consumer payments is an opportunity and Visa credentials, acceptance and innovation that make us feel confident about our ability to accelerate growth in the future. 
Moving now to our network of networks. We continue to enhance our capabilities to facilitate money movement seamlessly and securely for all players in the ecosystem while accelerating the penetration of new flows. The total new flows opportunity is $185 trillion. Payments infrastructure, regulations and settlement systems are all very local in nature, which creates a lot of complexity in a world of global trade. 
Our network of networks capability enables Visa as a single connection point to help clients to move value domestically and cross-border over all networks, including Visa's own networks, RTPs, ACHs and new networks in the future like stable coins and public blockchains. 
In FY '21, we continue to build out Visa Direct's global reach, surpassing 5 billion transactions across 500 programs and nearly 550 enablers such as acquirers, processors, banks and fintechs. In the U.S. alone, nearly 120 million cards have sent or received funds using Visa Direct. Visa Direct is unique as it has more endpoints and more use cases compared to the next competitor and offers flexible technology. 
Our growth plan for Visa Direct focus is on 4 key levers: first, entrench existing use cases. P2P is our largest use case. And in FY '21, we surpassed 200 P2P programs globally. Insurance disbursements is another use case. And this quarter, we added nationwide to begin distributing claims. 
Second, we want to capture the cross-border opportunity. For cross-border P2P, during the fourth quarter, we added Paysend. And soon, Western Union's U.S. customers will be able to send funds to eligible Visa cards in the Philippines, Thailand, Colombia and Jamaica, followed by a robust expansion plan for other countries. Beyond remittances, we're also leveraging our cross-border capabilities for marketplaces, supplier payments, student tuition payments and more. 
Our third lever to grow is scale the over 20 live use cases. Recent examples include tipping fundraising, brokerage account funding and airline vouchers. And in the fourth quarter, we added Yardi in the rental space area for property managers to distribute the security deposits. 
Finally, scale new markets. Visa Direct has scaled rapidly in several markets, but there are many more where the market conditions are right for acceleration. 
For example, in Peru, we have a strong P2P footprint and are now adding new use cases like the innovative payroll solution, launched a partnership with of salary on-demand provider that also seeks to improve financial inclusion. Globally, we have more than quadrupled the number of earned wage access providers on our platform since 2019. 
In short, we are just scratching the surface on Visa Direct and expect to drive rapid growth in the years ahead to capture the $65 trillion market opportunity. 
We also have many examples of partners utilizing Visa Direct and our B2B capabilities. This quarter, we're pleased that Beam will offer their 400,000-plus business customers the ability to make B2B payments via Visa Direct and through Visa virtual cards. We also have wins with credit racks in Europe for travel virtual cards and ignition and Standard Bank in CEMEA in fleet and an exclusive agreement for physical and virtual cards with ramp of P2P, finance automation fintech here in the United States. 
We also continue to strengthen and expand our relationship with JPMorgan commercial card through a new commercial card agreement and through JPMorgan's participation in Visa's commercial pay solution. These initiatives will support virtual card capabilities, spur growth and new payment flows and drive incremental volume over time. 
Visa B2B Connect now operates in more than 100 markets and offers a multilateral network with distributed ledger technology that addresses the pain points of existing solutions, which include transparency and speed. We're also pleased to have launched a partnership with Citi to be a global settlement bank for Visa B2B Connect, which broadens the endpoints available for clients to include cities, business accounts for moving money cross-border and their clearing capabilities for banks that have not yet been integrated into the B2B Connect network. Given the size and breadth of Citi and our role in facilitating money movement, we're very excited about this capability to expand the Visa B2B Connect network. 
Looking ahead, open banking plays in a central role in the network of networks. We believe Visa can accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe with our pending acquisition of Tink. Together, we can provide a secure, reliable platform for innovation that could be expanded globally. 
Whether it's leveraging account data for value-added services or facilitating account-to-account or pay-by-bank money movement, open banking creates opportunities for Visa to offer our clients and partners a one-stop shop from money movement, security, data and valuable customer experiences. Blockchains also will continue to expand our network of networks. Our settlement capabilities and our continued innovation around crypto APIs and services have been key to winning new partnerships. We have nearly 60 crypto platform partners with the capability to issue Visa credentials, and we're already capturing over $3.5 billion of payment volume in FY '21. 
The third reason we're even better positioned for growth post COVID is value-added services, where our scale and sophistication simultaneously help our clients be more successful while diversifying Visa's business and driving more value. Our value-added solutions differentiate Visa's network, enable our clients to adapt to the changing payments ecosystem and deliver valuable services across other rails, enhancing our network and network capabilities. 
In 2021, 40% of our clients use 5 or more value-added services, and nearly 30% use 10 or more, which is up from 20% in 2020. Let me highlight a few services that have grown significantly in 2021. 
CyberSource added 28 new acquirer partners and 45,000 merchants as a result -- and as a result, we are growing payments volume twice as fast as our broader client base. And our risk solution on cyber was called Decision Manager grew over 30%. We have doubled the number of tokens over the past year to 2.6 billion and enhance the capabilities to manage them through Visa Cloud token. Across more than 8,600 issuers and 800,000 merchants, tokens have led to a 2.5% increase in approval rates and a 28% reduction in fraud rates. 
Visa advanced authorization and Visa risk manager, utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, which helped reduced fraud by $26 billion, screening 30% more transactions in 2021 than in 2020. All of our efforts in authentication, risk identity and authorization optimization, have led to cross-border card-not-present approval rates, increasing by nearly 2% in the past year. Therefore, value-added services revenue grew 25% in Q4 and also drove additional volume. Since the pandemic began, our VAS revenue has averaged a quarterly growth rate in the high teens and was approximately $5 billion in FY '21. 
Finally, the fourth reason that we believe we have great room to grow is that we can enable much of the disruption and innovation in the payments ecosystem, which helps accelerate Visa's growth. Visa's past, present and future are about fostering innovation and enabling new partners, capabilities and use cases. We enable the disruptors. We help them scale. Disruptors are good for payments and good for Visa. Given our role in the ecosystem, we don't pick winners and losers, and we're well positioned for growth across many potential outcomes. 
Let's take Wallets as an example. Wallets have done a tremendous job of building a user base in some cases, building acceptance. But at some point, they reach a point where they are seeking additional growth, and many of them are embedding Visa credentials in their wallets, so the consumer can use it anywhere Visa is accepted as well as receive and send cross-border P2P payments. 
LINE Pay is an excellent example with 4 portfolios totaling 5.6 million Visa credentials across 3 countries, including a new co-brand in Thailand that was launched in the fourth quarter. 
Buy now, pay later, or BNPL, is a newer example, but we think will have a similar outcome. While installments are fast growing, they're just a fraction of the total industry's payment volume committed to be about $100 billion to $150 billion, but we are bringing scale to disruptors. We have a two-pronged strategy where we provide a network solution as well as solutions for our BNPL fintech partners. 
The network solution offered issuers the ability to extend installments to their existing credit clients and merchants to offer a seamless installment option to their customer with flexible terms. We continue to expand our partnerships in Q4 with HSBC in Malaysia, Monera Canada's largest payment processor by volume and ANZ in Australia with 2022 large [indiscernible]. 
We also partner with fintechs in a number of ways. We generate revenue when customers pay their installments with a Visa card through virtual cards for B2B or consumer payments and through value-added services. The majority of the installment payoffs are on cards today. 
For example, in Canada, over the last year, the number of Visa cards used to repay installments has grown more than 300%. We believe we're currently experiencing BNPL 1.0. Individual fintechs and companies are cutting individual deals merchant by merchant. Eventually, we believe the business model will evolve to BNPL 2.0 where fintech partners issue Visa credentials to leverage our acceptance and platforms to overcome the difficulty of scaling acceptance globally merchant by merchant. 
We're already seeing this evolution begin to take shape. Just this quarter, signed a global brand deal to accelerate expansion and scale into several markets. 
So to close, Visa is better positioned than before the pandemic to capture the opportunity ahead, supported by the strong growth in consumer payments, the scale of our platforms, network and capabilities and new flows and value-added services becoming a greater portion of our revenue. And as cross-border volumes return over the next 2 years, it will only help to further drive our growth. 
Furthermore, over the history of our company, we have demonstrated that our innovation, willingness to partner and compelling and competitive offerings have made our business resilient and successful. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Vasant to review Q4 and also provide a view of what we believe the -- all these opportunities mean for Visa's financial performance in the coming year. Vasant, over to you."

Fiscal year 2021 was certainly a year of 2 very different halves. In the first half, net revenues declined 4%, and non-GAAP EPS was down 2% as we lapped a pre-COVID first half of 2020. In the second half, the rec",2354,"Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. 
Fiscal year 2021 was certainly a year of 2 very different halves. In the first half, net revenues declined 4%, and non-GAAP EPS was down 2% as we lapped a pre-COVID first half of 2020. In the second half, the recovery was well underway, and we were lapping some of the worst 2020 COVID impacts. As a result, net revenue grew 28%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 43%. 
Fiscal fourth quarter results were better than we expected, with net revenues up 29% driven by strong U.S. domestic trends, robust value-added services growth and higher cross-border volumes from a faster-than-anticipated recovery in travel. Had we recognized service revenues on current quarter's payment volumes, net revenue growth would have been approximately 22%. 
GAAP EPS grew 70%, including equity investment gains and a onetime noncash tax expense last year. Non-GAAP EPS rose 44% helped by a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shifts increased both net revenue and EPS growth by approximately 0.5 point. 
In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 17%, led by continued strength in debit as well as improving credit spending. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, global payments volume was 21% higher, a 0.8 percentage point acceleration from Q3, with debit slowing 1 point and credit improving by 3 points versus Q3. 
Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 18% or 26% higher than 2019 and a 1 point acceleration from the third quarter. Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded cash conversion, which have minimal revenue impact. 
U.S. payments volume was up 30% over 2019, consistent with the third quarter. Credit improved 3 points to 17% above '19, helped by consumer, small business and commercial spending. Debit slowed 4 points but remained very strong at 44% [ of our ] 2019 without much benefit from economic impact payments. 
Card-present spend improved 3 points to 15% of our 2019, its highest level yet in the pandemic, driven by higher fuel and restaurant spending. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, slowed 6 points to 53% over 2019 as some food and drug spending shifted back to card-present and retail spend was not as strong without the benefit of stimulus payments. 
International constant dollar payments volume improved 3 points from Q3, up 15% over 2019 levels. 
A few regional highlights. Latin America was up 58% from 2019, accelerated 10 points from the third quarter with robust performance across the region, fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region remained strong, up 48% from 2019 levels, consistent with Q3, also fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Europe was up 20% from 2019, improving 3 points from Q3 due mostly to strong performance across Continental Europe. Asia Pacific remains our weakest region, up 5% from 2019 and consistent with Q3, excluding China. Many countries instituted restrictions in the quarter, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Singapore, but all have started to recover in the past few weeks. India payments volume has fully recovered from the severe COVID outbreak in Q3. 
Global process transactions were 24% over 2019, improving 4 points from the third quarter as transactions improved faster than volume. Tap to pay penetration increased in many markets, and ticket sizes started to return to normal in the U.S. 
Visa Direct transactions grew 35%, down from the 50s in the previous 3 quarters. This quarter, we lapped a very strong Q4 of fiscal year '20 when Visa Direct hit 1 billion transactions for the first time. Stimulus payments have ended, and we are lapping the COVID-related spike in P2P, which is moderating U.S. growth rates. 
Meanwhile, the international business is ramping nicely as well as growth from use cases such as cross-border remittances, earned wage access and marketplace payouts. The cross-border volume recovery continued as more countries open their borders while e-commerce spending, excluding travel remains strong. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, was at 86% of 2019 volumes, a 4-point improvement from Q3 driven by the continued recovery in travel that started in May. Cross-border card-not-present volume, excluding travel, continued to be very strong at 43% of our 2019, declining 13 points from the third quarter but consistent with Q2. As a reminder, the boost we saw in Q3 was primarily from cryptocurrency purchases. 
Cross-border travel-related spending, excluding intra-Europe versus 2019, improved 13 points from Q3 to Q4. It has risen from 40% of 2019 in April to 50% in June to 61% in September. 
In terms of where travel-related spending is improving, aside from Asia Pacific, outbound spend in each region is indexing at similar levels versus 2019, and each improved by between 10 to 20 points in Q4 versus Q3. The largest improvements were in Canada, the Middle East and across Europe. Europe inbound spend improved by 24 points versus 2019 as popular travel destinations such as France and Italy relax their border restrictions. 
As we have seen consistently during the pandemic, there is pent-up demand for travel as bookings accelerate when the borders opened. Latin America remains by far the strongest destination, well over 2019 levels. U.S. to Mexico travel remained robust, with spend more than 60% of our 2019 levels in Q4. Asia Pacific remains mostly closed and did not meaningfully improve in the fourth quarter, remaining below 30% of 2019, both inbound and outbound. 
Moving now to a quick review of fourth quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 41%, consistent with 39% nominal growth in third quarter payments volume and helped by small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 20%, in line with 21% processed transactions growth with a small impact from unfavorable country mix. International transaction revenues were up 41%, 7 points lower than nominal cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, due to lapping high currency volatility last year and unfavorable regional mix. Other revenues grew 36% led by consulting and data services as well as travel benefits. In total, value-added services revenue grew 25%, led by security and identity as well as consulting and data services with some benefit from COVID-related lapping effects. 
Client incentives were 26.7% of gross revenues, in line with our expectations. The 90 basis point increase from Q3 was primarily driven by strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America and fewer adjustments for underperformance in certain geographies, partially offset by improving cross-border volumes. 
Operating expenses grew 15%, in line with our expectations. Marketing expenses grew 58% in the quarter as we stepped up spending and also lapped reductions in Q4 last year. Personnel and professional services spend also accelerated as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives. We recorded gains from our equity investments of $101 million. Excluding investment gains, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $118 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5% was lower than expected due to the resolution of a tax matter. 
GAAP EPS was $1.65 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, up 44% over last year. We bought 13.2 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $231.33 for $3.1 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned over $3.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. On October 22, Visa's Board of Directors authorized a 17% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.375 per share. For the full year, net revenues increased 10%, and non-GAAP EPS of $5.91 was up 17%. We returned $11.5 billion in capital to shareholders by repurchasing 39.7 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $219.34 for $8.7 billion and by paying dividends of $2.8 billion. 
Before we discuss the year ahead, let me share performance through the first 3 weeks of October. U.S. payments volume was up 32% [ above ] 2019, consistent with September, with debit at 44% and credit at 22% above 2019. Processed transactions were 26% above 2019. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, on a constant dollar basis was 94% of 2019, which is up 8 points from Q4 and 2 points from September. 
Travel-related spending versus 2019 improved 4 points compared to September to 65% of 2019. Card-not-present nontravel was 49% above 2019, up 6 points from the fourth quarter and down 2 points from September. 
Looking ahead to fiscal year 2022. Our business has been on a recovery track for the past 3 to 4 quarters. However, we are not back to normal yet globally. There are many factors to consider as we project the trajectory of the recovery. Debit and e-commerce have outperformed and stayed resilient even as credit recovers and in-store shopping returns. The full impact of stimulus payments and support programs ending remains to be seen. Cross-border travel is recovering well, but still well below pre-COVID levels with a pace of recovery dependent on cross-border on border openings. Asia has not reopened to the degree the rest of the world has. The timing of reopening in key countries across Asia, both domestically and for cross-border travel is a key variable. Most importantly, COVID variants are still with, us and vaccination rates remain low in large parts of the globe. With these factors as the backdrop, forecasting the trajectory of the return to normalcy remains difficult. Visibility 4 quarters out, while improved, is still not great. 
For the past few quarters, we have been providing you our best sense of the business 1 quarter at a time, and we will continue that practice in fiscal year '22. Assuming current trends are sustained through December, we would expect first quarter net revenue growth in the high teens. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenue are likely to be in the 26% to 27% range, in line with the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. Sustained investment spending, combined with low comparables last year, leads to operating expenses continuing to grow in the mid-teens. Nonoperating expense is expected to be in the $120 million to $130 million range and tax rate in the 19% to 19.5% range. 
Looking 4 quarters out, projecting gross revenue growth poses the greatest challenge. It is significantly dependent on the pace of the cross-border travel recovery as well as the other factors I just mentioned. It is all a function of your assumptions for these variables. 
In order to be helpful, we will share the assumptions we are making for internal planning purposes. Domestic volumes and transactions, we are assuming no disruptions from COVID-related lockdowns. As such, we assume that the recovery trajectory underway in payments volume and processed transactions stays intact through fiscal year '22. 
For cross-border travel, we assume the recovery underway continues steadily through fiscal year '22 to reach 2019 levels in the summer of 2023. We assume the index to 2019 climbs from around 60 currently to around 80 by September 2022. We also assume the strong growth in cross-border e-commerce continues. 
We expect new flows and value-added services growth in the high teens. We expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to range between 26% to 27% for the year, consistent with the fourth quarter fiscal year '21 levels. Pre COVID, this percentage increased by 50 to 100 basis points each year due to the impact of new deals and renewals. 
In fiscal year '22, we expect to benefit from revenue mix improvement as cross-border travel continues to recover, partially offset by the lapping of incentive reductions we had in fiscal year '21 due to the COVID impact. These assumptions result in high end of mid-teens net revenue growth for fiscal year '22, including over 0.5 point of exchange rate drag from the strengthening dollar. First quarter growth in the high teens will moderate through the year as we lap the recovery in fiscal year '21. 
As I said, these are our assumptions for internal planning purposes. We will continue to provide our outlook for the business 1 quarter at a time through fiscal year '22. 
In terms of the other elements of the P&L, we expect operating expenses to grow in the low teens in fiscal year '22 as we step up investments across all 3 lines of business to lay the foundation for sustained higher growth post COVID. We have already increased marketing investment. We will invest heavily in our technology platforms to continue to enhance functionality, flexibility, security and reliability. 
We will invest to sustain the high growth we have in our new flows and value-added services business. and we will continue to add resources in market to help our clients utilize all of our new capabilities. Expense growth will be higher in the first half and moderate in the second half as we lap the resumption of investment spending in fiscal year '21. 
Nonoperating expense is expected to be in the $120 million to $130 million range each quarter, and our tax rate for the year is also expected to stay in the 19% to 19.5% range. None of these assumptions include Tink or Currencycloud, which we expect to close in the first half of the fiscal year. They will not be material to fiscal year '22 revenue or non-GAAP EPS. 
Visa remains a network of choice for innovators and money movement. We enable the innovators and disruptors. We help them scale, and in turn, innovators drive our growth. We have continued to enhance the functionality and flexibility of our network to substantially expand the money movement use cases we serve, supporting the new generation of fintechs as well as driving growth in our new flows business. 
Our value-added services add differentiation and create more value for our clients than alternative network can. Our network of network strategy substantially increases our nodes, which we believe can create more value for all network participants than any closed loop or geographically limited network. As we said at our Investor Day, we have a 10x growth opportunity ahead of us, and we are well positioned to capture it. We ended fiscal year '21 with good momentum, a high-growth, resilient debit and e-commerce business, recovering credit and cross-border travel and new flows and value-added services are newer growth engines driving further acceleration. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Mike for Q&A."

Look, I think, first of all, open banking, as you know, is in its early stages. We believe by jumping into the middle of it, that we can help the ecosystem determine what is the best routing for different transactions. There are certainly are transactions that will lend themselves to AA kind of approach, which we know is one of the things that people will think about as a threat. 
But there's an awful lot of transactions, many, many transactions, where people appreciate the protections that are provided by a network like Visa dispute resolution, fraud, security and the like. When money is moved instantaneously, that's nice at 1 level. But if -- once it's moved, it's awfully hard to get it back. 
And it's much more about other elements than just speed. We also think by getting involved with Tink where we're right we have the opportunity to really learn as we go. And we think that there's an opportunity to potentially provide value-added services even on transactions that might route in -- over a different network. 
So I would say, Lisa, the bottom line is you could see some transactions that are incremental, that might move off VisaNet or off of our normal rails. But the way we look at it is by leaning in, we're going to learn more about it, and we're going to be able to influence what's happening, and we'll also be able to make sure that we can provide other capabilities and value-added services to the various transactions."

I would also say, though, that our Visa Direct platform is much more mature in the United States than it is in other markets. Vasant somewhat alluded to that point in his remarks. And that has certainly helps spark some of the growth as well. 
I also think that the U.S. prior to the pandemic at least, was more advanced in e-commerce capabilities and was much -- adjusted even more quickly than other markets might have as we saw a rapid move towards cash digitization as COVID set upon us in March of 2020. 
All that said, we are setting out to invest around the globe, and we want our business to grow in all markets and territories in which we do work. We're more than happy to have the U.S. continue to grow. But I think as I look at the future of the business over the next 5 to 10 years, I expect still healthy growth in the United States, but I do expect our volumes to continue to grow in a nice way around the world. 
I mean, you saw it this prior quarter, as good as the growth was in the U.S. in the quarter, both Latin America and CEMEA had very, very strong quarters.

The one thing to think about as we look ahead, as we said earlier, as Al said in his comments, contactless payments are already 70% penetrated outside the U.S. So that's still a growth engine in the U.S. that is just beginning to take off. And given the size of the U.S., that will be a meaningful contributor to transactions growth.

The point I was making is that, in many ways, BNPL is a closed-loop capability somewhat akin to what wallets were 3 years ago. And closed loops just end up hitting a wall. They don't end up -- they end up hitting a wall where it's hard to scale. It's hard to bring the level and depth of choice that you can to your customers. And so what I think is going to happen is that BNPL players will become issuers who will issue Visa credentials that will have the -- their value proposition for installments embedded within the product itself so that they can, therefore, scale very, very quickly by immediately having access to the 100 million merchants that I referenced in my remarks. And so that's what I believe, based on history is going to happen, and that's what I'm referring to when I say BNPL 2.0."

So that's a clear upside there. 
It is a higher-yielding corridor. And so clearly, there will be benefit there as the travel from Canada, travel from Europe is permitted. In general, I mean, it's hard to predict the mix. It is incorporated in our views of how cross-border is going to improve cross-border travel for it to go from what we said to the levels we're assuming at the end of fiscal year '22. You would have to assume improvement in inbound to the U.S., and that's all part of the equation."

And so we lean into all of these new players very, very early. It's one of the reasons why we have the position we have right now in crypto, where we have partnerships with over 60 players because we leaned in right from the beginning. And all of them have the capability and many of them are already issuing Visa credentials. 
I think some of these players will help continue to digitize payments and take money away from cash. I think that it's extremely likely that some transactions will be to A2A. But there's A2A transactions today. A lot of just regular bill pay is for all types of purposes A2A, so I'm not really sure it's that new bigger deal. But that said, we think that we're in a far better position by leaning in and working with these players. 
And if we don't actually have the transaction on our network or we're out of the processing of the transaction overall, there's still the possibility of providing other capabilities from our toolbox of solutions and value-added services to bring to the party. 
So how it's all going to play out, we'll have to see, but I'm optimistic that the position that we're taking, which is to lean into all of this is going to put us in the best place to be successful."

In effect, we get your money from point A to point B. The entire journey may not be on our rails. Maybe parts of the journey are on some other rails, but we can get it there, and we provide all the things you expect from Visa, which is the trust our brand brings, the reliability, the flexibility, the security, the dispute resolution and all those capabilities.

So in terms of the structural changes that have happened that are sustainable, the cash digitization engine is clearly extremely healthy. And that is a big driver of debit because debit is the -- sort of the first gateway to digital payments that consumers use. And we've seen that debit has sustained its growth almost globally even as we've seen card-present come back and reopening happened and seamless payments go away. There's been quite a bit of resilience to debit strength helped by Visa Direct, too. So all indications are that the cash digitization engine, especially in emerging markets, has really taken off because habits are being formed and people have gotten used to using digital forms of payment. So we think there's quite a bit of resilience there, and there's evidence of that even as things have started to normalize. 
The shift to e-commerce, too, has been remarkably resilient. We've seen -- if you see the charts we send out with our press release, you can see card-present has a pretty decent recovery in the past few quarters. And if you look at how well e-commerce has held up, card-not-present has held up. Again, there's been quite a bit of resilience there. Many new categories, people have gotten used to doing -- using e-commerce. 
And the biggest thing is cross-border e-commerce. Cross-border e-commerce has been extremely resilient. If you look at it, it's indexing in the 140s. We saw a spike last quarter because of cryptocurrencies, but it's back into the 140s as it was in the second quarter. which is very hefty growth compared to its prior growth rate, and it has held up even as cross-border travel is coming back and even as card-present spending is coming back. So those 2 structural changes have shown quite a bit of resilience. 
Once you look past those, our value-added services have held up extremely well through the pandemic. If you look at the average growth in our value-added services over the past 6 to 8 quarters when we had the pandemic, it's been in the high teens. And our new flow businesses have been extremely high growth, too. We're expecting high teens next year. So those 2 newer growth engines have shown quite a bit of resilience all the way through the pandemic, and that clearly lays a great foundation for the future as they become a larger and larger part of our business. If they're growing faster than our core consumer payments business, so that's a structurally higher growth rate because they're a larger part of our mix."

The RTP rails are typically always owned by bank consortiums or central banks. They are in the business of building the rails and then handing them over and then, in some cases, operating the rails, which, by the way, are, as Al said, open to everybody to use at regulated rates. 
So the competitor you're referring to does not own RTP rails, to the best of my knowledge anywhere. They have, in some cases, the opportunity to operate them in return for building them. In some cases, they just build them and move on. And they're not proprietary rails. They're open to everybody, including us. 
And we looked at it hard, and we concluded that the business of building these rails is not an attractive business, and the business of using these rails and the business of adding value-added capabilities and intelligence to these rails is a good business, and that's the business that we choose to be in."

I think from Vasant's comment, it sounds like there was just some country mix.

So there really wasn't really any change in yield. 
Now clearly, the cross-border business is, relatively speaking, still recovering and below where it was, and therefore, the yields have been impacted by the mix shifting away from cross-border. And the mix improving is clearly helping the yields. But from one quarter to another, the yields were relatively stable. There was nothing unusual going on there. I'm sure after the call, if there's any confusion, Mike and Jennifer could clear it up. But my short answer would be the yields were just fine, and there was nothing unusual there."

And I think there's -- I feel very good about the way the business is advancing right now. 
I think consumer payments is positioned to stay strong. But in response to the question a few questions ago, I think e-commerce is going to sustain. I think tap to pay is going to sustain. We're starting to see some of the benefits of our acceptance footprint in places like Latin America grow, and we're starting to see more of a shift to PV and away from cash throughout that region. So consumer payments is still bread and butter for our company and the growing credentials, growing acceptance points and continuing to work with our issuing partners on engagement and getting the most out of their existing customer base remain a very, very high priority for us. 
And I think we've gotten really good traction on our 2 other revenue streams in new flows and value-added services. And we've got new flows valued Visa Direct, we've talked a bunch about and feel very good about that. And I think as the world starts to see people return to the office and travel start to return, I think that's going to help the B2B space. And I think a lot of what I commented on in terms of wins and advances in value-added services in fiscal '21 will continue into fiscal '22. 
So I think, in short, I like the fact that we've got a more diverse business model and more levers to pull. Of course, we want to continue to plant flags in geographies where the business is still -- or payments and money movement a little bit more nascent. But all in all, I'm quite bullish on how the business looks as we enter fiscal '22.

Every day, our network is -- gets more flexible and adds more capability. 
We are -- we've got substantially more services now to sell to our clients, and there are many new types of issuers and new types of acceptance points. So we're significantly increasing the number of -- sort of the boots on the ground, closest to our clients. So there's a big investment in -- from the ground closest to clients to make our clients easily incorporate these services into their business and also to bring in all these new types of fintechs, if you want to call them, the innovators into our ecosystem. 
The third dimension also is the broadening of our brand. You've seen our new brand positioning. If you have watched the Olympics, you couldn't have missed it. It reflects what the future of Visa is. It's not just about consumer payments. So there's clearly an investment in making sure that, that message gets across. 
So broadly speaking, it's enabling new use cases, new geographies, new clients and then repositioning the whole brand for essentially the leader in money movement."

To the best of my knowledge, Tim, I don't think that the A2A options offer any of those kinds of protections to consumers today that I'm aware of. And I think we'll have to see as A2A advances and as we get deeper into open banking, particularly starting in Europe, which is really ground 0 for open banking and obviously one of the reasons why we're excited about owning Tink, we'll have to see whether we think that there's a way for us to step in to try to help provide some of those protections for A2A or it could well be that A2A just ties to different profile of -- for the different profile of protections or lack thereof for those transactions versus transactions that run on a network like Visa."

Margins are an outcome. They're not an objective. Our business does tend to have a high fixed cost structure. The marginal transaction comes at low marginal cost. 
Our value-added services businesses have good margins. Our new flows businesses have good margins. Yields and margins are different. New flows businesses can have different yields than our core payments business. But given that it leverages the infrastructure and it's very much a scale business does come with very good margins. 
So you saw what happened to margins this year. We had a nice improvement from the drop we had in the COVID era.

In the fourth quarter and throughout fiscal 2021, Visa has delivered strong results against the backdrop of economic uncertainty and the lingering impacts of the COVID pandemic. In doing so, we demonstrated the resiliency of our business and validated our growth strategy as we continue to drive the rapid growth of digital payments and enable innovation in money movement globally. 
A quick summary of Q4 results. Fourth quarter payments volume was 121% of 2019, up about 0.8 points from Q3 and up 17% year-over-year. Despite the backdrop of a global pandemic, this quarter, we also set a record with total global payments volume of $2.8 trillion. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, was 86% of 2019, 4 points better than Q3 and up 46% year-over-year. And processed transactions were 124% of 2019, up 4 points from Q3 and up 21% year-over-year. Our net revenues grew 29% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, up 44%. 
In talking to many of you over the last few months, I know you're wondering what's ahead for Visa and the payments ecosystem as we emerge from the pandemic. So rather than doing my usual report card on the quarter, I'm going to speak more broadly today about the 4 key reasons why we believe that Visa is even better positioned for growth than before the pandemic. One, there's still enormous opportunity ahead in consumer payments. Two, we continue to enhance our network of networks capability to facilitate money movement more seamlessly and securely for all players in the ecosystem and accelerate the penetration of new flows. Third, value-added services simultaneously help our clients leverage our scale and sophistication while diversifying Visa's business and driving more volume. Four, we enable much of the disruption and innovation in the payments ecosystem, which helps to accelerate Visa's growth. 
So let me start with number one, the enormous opportunity in consumer payments. We see that the pandemic has helped to further digitize cash. In the last 12 months, global debit cash volumes, which are primarily the amount of cash withdrawn from Visa debit cards, has increased 4%, while debit payments volume has grown 23%, both on a constant dollar basis. In 2021, the number of monthly active e-commerce credentials and spend per active credential continued to grow strongly. For example, in the United States, monthly active credentials and active spend per credential both grew by more than 20% on average versus 2019. We've grown credentials for both traditional and new players to 3.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year. After renewing client contracts that represented 55% of our payments volume in the previous 2 years, we renewed contracts that represented nearly 20% in 2021. 
Let me just highlight a few of those deals in Q4. In our Asia Pacific region, we renewed 3 of Visa's top 20 issuers, including China Merchants Bank and Bank of China. And in North America, we renewed 3 of the top 15 issuers. PNC renewed the prepaid consumer credit and debit, commercial credit and small business credit and debit portfolios. Regions also renewed the prepaid consumer credit and debit, commercial credit and small business credit and debit portfolios. And RBC and Visa have entered into a renewal of their agreement with respect to the issuance of credit, debit and prepaid cards in Canada. 
Fintechs have also fueled our growth. In the last year, nearly 30% more fintechs issued Visa credentials, and they have more than doubled their payments volume. Furthermore, fintechs are scaling. We've also grown acceptance to more than 80 million merchant locations, up 14% year-over-year. And when you include small businesses behind players like Stripe and Square, the number is north of 100 million merchant locations. 
We've grown tap-to-pay to 70% of all face-to-face transactions globally. Excluding the United States, we have more than 70 countries with over 50% contactless penetration. U.S. penetration is now over 15%, more than double from just a year ago with 400 million cards, quadruple what we had 2 years ago. We know from other markets that tapping brings increased spending and transactions while digitizing cash. 
We also continue to innovate to make it easier for partners to access and utilize our platforms and capabilities. One recent example is Visa Cloud Connect, which enables clients to connect to VisaNet via the cloud, eliminating the need for investment in local data centers, telecommunications infrastructure and any specialized payment hardware. 
To summarize, consumer payments is an opportunity and it's Visa's credentials, acceptance and innovation that make us feel confident about our ability to accelerate growth in the future. 
Moving now to our network of networks. We continue to enhance our capabilities to facilitate money movement seamlessly and securely for all players in the ecosystem while accelerating the penetration of new flows. The total new flows opportunity is $185 trillion. Payments infrastructure, regulations and settlement systems are all very local in nature, which creates a lot of complexity in a world of global trade. Our network of networks capability enables Visa as a single connection point to help clients to move value domestically and cross-border over all networks, including Visa's own networks, RTPs, ACHs and new networks in the future, like stable coins and public blockchains. 
In FY '21, we continue to build out Visa Direct's global reach, surpassing 5 billion transactions across 500 programs and nearly 550 enablers, such as acquirers, processors, banks and fintechs. In the U.S. alone, nearly 120 million cards have sent or received funds using Visa Direct. Visa Direct is unique as it is more -- has more end points and more use cases compared to the next competitor and offers flexible technology. 
Our growth plan for Visa Direct focus is on 4 key levers. First, entrench existing use cases. P2P is our largest use case. And in FY '21, we surpassed 200 P2P programs globally. Insurance disbursements is another use case. In this quarter, we added Nationwide to begin distributing claims. 
Second, we want to capture the cross-border opportunity. For cross-border P2P, during the fourth quarter, we added Paysend. And soon, Western Union's U.S. customers will be able to send funds to eligible Visa cards in the Philippines, Thailand, Colombia and Jamaica, followed by a robust expansion plan for other countries. Beyond remittances, we're also leveraging our cross-border capabilities for marketplaces, supplier payments, student tuition payments and more. 
Our third lever to grow is scale the over 20 live use cases. Recent examples include tipping fundraising, brokerage account funding and airline vouchers. And in the fourth quarter, we added Yardi in the rental space area for property managers to distribute security deposits. 
Finally, scale new markets. Visa Direct has scaled rapidly in several markets, but there are many more where the market conditions are right for acceleration. For example, in Peru, we have a strong P2P footprint and are now adding new use cases like the innovative payroll solution, launched a partnership with [ Tu Sueldo Y ], a salary on-demand provider that also seeks to improve financial inclusion. Globally, we have more than quadrupled the number of earned wage access providers on our platform since 2019. In short, we are just scratching the surface on Visa Direct and expect to drive rapid growth in the years ahead to capture the $65 trillion market opportunity. 
We also have many examples of partners utilizing Visa Direct and our B2B capabilities. This quarter, we're pleased that [ BIM ] will offer their 400,000-plus business customers the ability to make B2B payments via Visa Direct and through Visa virtual cards. We also have wins with Credorax in Europe for travel virtual cards and [ Ignition ] and Standard Bank in CEMEA in fleet and an exclusive agreement for physical and virtual cards with ramp of P2P, finance automation fintech here in the United States. We also continue to strengthen and expand our relationship with JPMorgan commercial card through a new commercial card agreement and through JPMorgan's participation in Visa's Commercial Pay solution. These initiatives will support virtual card capabilities, spur growth and new payment flows and drive incremental volume over time. 
Visa B2B Connect now operates in more than 100 markets and offers a multilateral network with distributed ledger technology that addresses the pain points of existing solutions, which include transparency and speed. We're also pleased to have launched a partnership with Citi to be a global settlement bank for Visa B2B Connect, which broadens the end points available for clients to include cities, business accounts for moving money cross-border and their clearing capabilities for banks that have not yet been integrated into the B2B Connect network. Given the size and breadth of Citi and our role in facilitating money movement, we're very excited about this capability to expand the Visa B2B Connect network. 
Looking ahead, open banking plays in a central role in the network of networks. We believe Visa can accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe with our pending acquisition of Tink. Together, we can provide a secure, reliable platform for innovation that could be expanded globally. Whether it's leveraging account data for value-added services or facilitating account-to-account or pay-by-bank money movement, open banking creates opportunities for Visa to offer our clients and partners a one-stop shop for money movement, security, data and valuable customer experiences. 
Blockchains also will continue to expand our network of networks. Our settlement capabilities and our continued innovation around crypto APIs and services have been key to winning new partnerships. We have nearly 60 crypto platform partners with the capability to issue Visa credentials, and we're already capturing over $3.5 billion of payment volume in FY '21. 
The third reason we're even better positioned for growth post COVID is value-added services, where our scale and sophistication simultaneously help our clients be more successful while diversifying Visa's business and driving more value. Our value-added solutions differentiate Visa's network, enable our clients to adapt to the changing payments ecosystem and deliver valuable services across other rails, enhancing our network of network capabilities. In 2021, 40% of our clients used 5 or more value-added services and nearly 30% used 10 or more, which is up from 20% in 2020. 
Let me highlight a few services that have grown significantly in 2021. CyberSource added 28 new acquirer partners and 45,000 merchants as a result -- and as a result, we are growing payments volume twice as fast as our broader client base, and our risk solution on CyberSource called Decision Manager grew over 30%. We have doubled the number of tokens over the past year to 2.6 billion and enhanced the capabilities to manage them through Visa Cloud token. Across more than 8,600 issuers and 800,000 merchants, tokens have led to a 2.5% increase in approval rates and a 28% reduction in fraud rates. Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, which helped reduced fraud by $26 billion, screening 30% more transactions in 2021 than in 2020. 
All of our efforts in authentication, risk, identity and authorization optimization have led to cross-border card-not-present approval rates increasing by nearly 2% in the past year. Therefore, value-added services revenue grew 25% in Q4 and also drove additional volume. Since the pandemic began, our VAS revenue has averaged a quarterly growth rate in the high teens and was approximately $5 billion in FY '21. 
Finally, the fourth reason that we believe we have great room to grow is that we can enable much of the disruption and innovation in the payments ecosystem, which helps accelerate Visa's growth. Visa's past, present and future are about fostering innovation and enabling new partners, capabilities and use cases. We enable the disruptors. We help them scale. Disruptors are good for payments and good for Visa. Given our role in the ecosystem, we don't pick winners and losers, and we're well positioned for growth across many potential outcomes. 
Let's take wallets as an example. Wallets have done a tremendous job of building a user base, in some cases building acceptance. But at some point, they reach a point where they are seeking additional growth, and many of them are embedding Visa credentials in their wallets so the consumer can use it anywhere Visa is accepted as well as receive and send cross-border P2P payments. LINE Pay is an excellent example with 4 portfolios totaling 5.6 million Visa credentials across 3 countries, including a new co-brand in Thailand that was launched in the fourth quarter. 
Buy now pay later, or BNPL, is a newer example but, we think, will have a similar outcome. While installments are fast-growing, they're just a fraction of the total industry's payment volume estimated to be about $100 billion to $150 billion, but we are bringing scale to disruptors. We have a two-pronged strategy where we provide a network solution as well as solutions for our BNPL fintech partners. The network solution offers issuers the ability to extend installments to their existing credit clients and merchants to offer a seamless installment option to their customer with flexible terms. We continue to expand our partnerships in Q4 with HSBC in Malaysia; Moneris, Canada's largest payment processor by volume; and ANZ in Australia with 2022 large [ payments ]. 
We also partner with fintechs in a number of ways. We generate revenue when customers pay their installments with a Visa card through virtual cards for B2B or consumer payments and through value-added services. The majority of the installment payoffs are on cards today. For example, in Canada, over the last year, the number of Visa cards used to repay installments has grown more than 300%. 
We believe we're currently experiencing BNPL 1.0. Individual fintechs and companies are cutting individual deals merchant by merchant. Eventually, we believe the business model will evolve to BNPL 2.0, where fintech partners issue Visa credentials to leverage our acceptance and platforms to overcome the difficulty of scaling acceptance globally, merchant by merchant. We're already seeing this evolution begin to take shape. Just this quarter, [ a partner ] signed a global brand deal to accelerate expansion and scale into several markets. 
So to close, Visa is better positioned than before the pandemic to capture the opportunity ahead, supported by the strong growth in consumer payments, the scale of our platforms, network and capabilities and new flows and value-added services becoming a greater portion of our revenue. And as cross-border volumes return over the next 2 years, it will only help to further drive our growth. Furthermore, over the history of our company, we have demonstrated that our innovation, willingness to partner and compelling and competitive offerings have made our business resilient and successful. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Vasant to review Q4 and also provide a view of what we believe these -- all these opportunities mean for Visa's financial performance in the coming year. Vasant, over to you."

Fiscal year 2021 was certainly a year of 2 very different halves. In the first half, net revenues declined 4% and non-GAAP EPS was down 2% as we lapped a pre-COVID first half of 2020. In the second half, the recove",2344,"Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal year 2021 was certainly a year of 2 very different halves. In the first half, net revenues declined 4% and non-GAAP EPS was down 2% as we lapped a pre-COVID first half of 2020. In the second half, the recovery was well underway and we were lapping some of the worst 2020 COVID impacts. As a result, net revenue grew 28%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 43%. 
Fiscal fourth quarter results were better than we expected, with net revenues up 29%, driven by strong U.S. domestic trends, robust value-added services growth and higher cross-border volumes from a faster-than-anticipated recovery in travel. Had we recognized service revenues on current quarter's payment volumes, net revenue growth would have been approximately 22%. GAAP EPS grew 70%, including equity investment gains and a onetime noncash tax expense last year. Non-GAAP EPS rose 44%, helped by a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shifts increased both net revenue and EPS growth by approximately 0.5 point. 
In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 17%, led by continued strength in debit as well as improving credit spending. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, global payments volume was 21% higher, a 0.8 percentage point acceleration from Q3, with debit slowing 1 point and credit improving by 3 points versus Q3. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 18% or 26% higher than 2019 and a 1 point acceleration from the third quarter. Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded cost conversion, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume was up 30% over 2019, consistent with the third quarter. 
Credit improved 3 points to 17% above '19, helped by consumer, small business and commercial spending. Debit slowed 4 points but remained very strong at 44% above 2019 without much benefit from economic impact payments. Card-present spend improved 3 points to 15% above 2019, its highest level yet in the pandemic, driven by higher fuel and restaurant spending. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, slowed 6 points to 53% over 2019 as some food and drug spending shifted back to card-present and retail spend was not as strong without the benefit of stimulus payments. 
International constant dollar payments volume improved 3 points from Q3, up 15% over 2019 levels. A few regional highlights. Latin America was up 58% from 2019, accelerated 10 points from the third quarter with robust performance across the region, fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region remained strong, up 48% from 2019 levels, consistent with Q3, also fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Europe was up 20% from 2019, improving 3 points from Q3 due mostly to strong performance across Continental Europe. Asia Pacific remains our weakest region, up 5% from 2019 and consistent with Q3 excluding China. Many countries instituted restrictions in the quarter, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Singapore, but all have started to recover in the past few weeks. India payments volume has fully recovered from the severe COVID outbreak in Q3. 
Global processed transactions were 24% over 2019, improving 4 points from the third quarter as transactions improved faster than volume. Tap-to-pay penetration increased in many markets and ticket sizes started to return to normal in the U.S. Visa Direct transactions grew 35%, down from the 50s in the previous 3 quarters. This quarter, we lapped a very strong Q4 of fiscal year '20 when Visa Direct hit 1 billion transactions for the first time. Stimulus payments have ended, and we are lapping the COVID-related spike in P2P, which is moderating U.S. growth rates. 
Meanwhile, the international business is ramping nicely as well as growth from use cases such as cross-border remittances, earned wage access and marketplace payouts. The cross-border volume recovery continued as more countries open their borders while e-commerce spending, excluding travel, remains strong. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, was at 86% of 2019 volumes, a 4-point improvement from Q3 driven by the continued recovery in travel that started in May. Cross-border card-not-present volume, excluding travel, continued to be very strong at 43% above 2019, declining 13 points from the third quarter but consistent with Q2. As a reminder, the boost we saw in Q3 was primarily from cryptocurrency purchases. 
Cross-border travel-related spending, excluding intra-Europe, versus 2019, improved 13 points from Q3 to Q4. It has risen from 40% of 2019 in April to 50% in June to 61% in September. In terms of where travel-related spending is improving, aside from Asia Pacific, outbound spend in each region is indexing at similar levels versus 2019, and each improved by between 10 to 20 points in Q4 versus Q3. The largest improvements were in Canada, the Middle East and across Europe. Europe inbound spend improved by 24 points versus 2019 as popular travel destinations such as France and Italy relaxed their border restrictions. As we have seen consistently during the pandemic, there is pent-up demand for travel as bookings accelerate when a border is opened. Latin America remains by far the strongest destination, well over 2019 levels. U.S. to Mexico travel remained robust, with spend more than 60% above 2019 levels in Q4. Asia Pacific remains mostly closed and did not meaningfully improve in the fourth quarter, remaining below 30% of 2019, both inbound and outbound. 
Moving now to a quick review of fourth quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 41%, consistent with 39% nominal growth in third quarter payments volume and helped by small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 20%, in line with 21% processed transactions growth with a small impact from unfavorable country mix. International transaction revenues were up 41%, 7 points lower than nominal cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, due to lapping high currency volatility last year and unfavorable regional mix. Other revenues grew 36%, led by consulting and data services as well as travel benefits. In total, value-added services revenue grew 25%, led by security and identity as well as consulting and data services with some benefit from COVID-related lapping effects. Client incentives were 26.7% of gross revenues, in line with our expectations. The 90 basis point increase from Q3 was primarily driven by strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America and fewer adjustments for underperformance in certain geographies, partially offset by improving cross-border volumes. 
Operating expenses grew 15%, in line with our expectations. Marketing expenses grew 58% in the quarter as we stepped up spending and also lapped reductions in Q4 last year. Personnel and professional services spend also accelerated as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives. We recorded gains from our equity investments of $101 million. Excluding investment gains, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $118 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5% was lower than expected due to the resolution of a tax matter. GAAP EPS was $1.65. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, up 44% over last year. 
We bought 13.2 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $231.33 for $3.1 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned over $3.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. On October 22, Visa's Board of Directors authorized a 17% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.375 per share. For the full year, net revenues increased 10%, and non-GAAP EPS of $5.91 was up 17%. We returned $11.5 billion in capital to shareholders by repurchasing 39.7 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $219.34 for $8.7 billion and by paying dividends of $2.8 billion. 
Before we discuss the year ahead, let me share performance through the first 3 weeks of October. U.S. payments volume was up 32% above 2019, consistent with September, with debit at 44% and credit at 22% above 2019. Processed transactions were 26% above 2019. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, on a constant dollar basis was 94% of 2019, which is up 8 points from Q4 and 2 points from September. Travel-related spending versus 2019 improved 4 points compared to September to 65% of 2019. Card-not-present non-travel was 49% above 2019, up 6 points from the fourth quarter and down 2 points from September. 
Looking ahead to fiscal year 2022. Our business has been on a recovery track for the past 3 to 4 quarters. However, we are not back to normal yet globally. There are many factors to consider as we project the trajectory of the recovery. Debit and e-commerce have outperformed and stayed resilient even as credit recovers and in-store shopping returns. The full impact of stimulus payments and support programs ending remains to be seen. Cross-border travel is recovering well but still well below pre-COVID levels with a pace of recovery dependent on cross-border -- on border openings. Asia has not reopened to the degree the rest of the world has. The timing of reopening in key countries across Asia, both domestically and for cross-border travel, is a key variable. Most importantly, COVID variants are still with us and vaccination rates remain low in large parts of the globe. 
With these factors as the backdrop, forecasting the trajectory of the return to normalcy remains difficult. Visibility 4 quarters out, while improved, is still not great. For the past few quarters, we have been providing you our best sense of the business one quarter at a time, and we will continue that practice in fiscal year '22. 
Assuming current trends are sustained through December, we would expect first quarter net revenue growth in the high teens. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenue are likely to be in the 26% to 27% range, in line with the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. Sustained investment spending, combined with low comparables last year, leads to operating expenses continuing to grow in the mid-teens. Nonoperating expense is expected to be in the $120 million to $130 million range and tax rate in the 19% to 19.5% range. 
Looking 4 quarters out, projecting gross revenue growth poses the greatest challenge. It is significantly dependent on the pace of the cross-border travel recovery as well as the other factors I just mentioned. It is all a function of your assumptions for these variables. In order to be helpful, we will share the assumptions we are making for internal planning purposes. For domestic volumes and transactions, we are assuming no disruptions from COVID-related lockdowns. As such, we assume that the recovery trajectory underway in payments volume and processed transactions stays intact through fiscal year '22. 
For cross-border travel, we assume the recovery underway continues steadily through fiscal year '22 to reach 2019 levels in the summer of 2023. We assume the index to 2019 climbs from around 60 currently to around 80 by September 2022. We also assume the strong growth in cross-border e-commerce continues. We expect new flows and value-added services growth in the high teens. We expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to range between 26% to 27% for the year, consistent with the fourth quarter fiscal year '21 levels. Pre-COVID, this percentage increased by 50 to 100 basis points each year due to the impact of new deals and renewals. 
In fiscal year '22, we expect to benefit from revenue mix improvement as cross-border travel continues to recover, partially offset by the lapping of incentive reductions we had in fiscal year '21 due to the COVID impact. These assumptions result in high end of mid-teens net revenue growth for fiscal year '22, including over 0.5 point of exchange rate drag from the strengthening dollar. First quarter growth in the high teens will moderate through the year as we lap the recovery in fiscal year '21. As I said, these are our assumptions for internal planning purposes. We will continue to provide our outlook for the business one quarter at a time through fiscal year '22. 
In terms of the other elements of the P&L, we expect operating expenses to grow in the low teens in fiscal year '22 as we step up investments across all 3 lines of business to lay the foundation for sustained higher growth post COVID. We have already increased marketing investment. We will invest heavily in our technology platforms to continue to enhance functionality, flexibility, security and reliability. We will invest to sustain the high growth we have in our new flows and value-added services business, and we will continue to add resources in market to help our clients utilize all of our new capabilities. Expense growth will be higher in the first half and moderate in the second half as we lap the resumption of investment spending in fiscal year '21. Nonoperating expense is expected to be in the $120 million to $130 million range each quarter, and our tax rate for the year is also expected to stay in the 19% to 19.5% range. None of these assumptions include Tink or Currencycloud, which we expect to close in the first half of the fiscal year. They will not be material to fiscal year '22 revenue or non-GAAP EPS. 
Visa remains a network of choice for innovators and money movement. We enable the innovators and disruptors. We help them scale, and in turn, innovators drive our growth. We have continued to enhance the functionality and flexibility of our network to substantially expand the money movement use cases we serve, supporting the new generation of fintechs as well as driving growth in our new flows business. Our value-added services add differentiation and create more value for our clients than alternative networks can. Our network of network strategy substantially increases our nodes, which we believe can create more value for all network participants than any closed-loop or geographically limited network. As we said at our Investor Day, we have a 10x growth opportunity ahead of us, and we are well positioned to capture it. We ended fiscal year '21 with good momentum, a high-growth, resilient debit and e-commerce business, recovering credit and cross-border travel, and new flows and value-added services are newer growth engines driving further acceleration. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Mike for Q&A."

Look, I think -- first of all, open banking, as you know, is in its early stages. We believe by jumping into the middle of it that we can help the ecosystem determine what is the best routing for different transactions. There are certainly are transactions that will lend themselves to A2A kind of approach, which we know is one of the things that people will think about as a threat. But there's an awful lot of transactions, many, many transactions, where people appreciate the protections that are provided by a network like Visa, dispute resolution, fraud, security and the like. When money is moved instantaneously, that's nice at one level. But if -- once it's moved, it's awfully hard to get it back. And it's much more about other elements than just speed. 
We also think by getting involved with Tink, where we're right at an -- where we have the opportunity to really learn as we go, and we think that there's an opportunity to potentially provide value-added services even on transactions that might route in -- over a different network. So I would say, Lisa, the bottom line is you could see some transactions that are incremental, that might move off VisaNet or off of our normal rails. But the way we look at it is by leaning in, we're going to learn more about it and we're going to be able to influence what's happening, and we'll also be able to make sure that we can provide other capabilities and value-added services to the various transactions."

It certainly is the explosion of some of the neobanks and fintechs, although you're seeing those really develop all the way around the world. I would also say though that our Visa Direct platform is much more mature in the United States than it is in other markets. Vasant somewhat alluded to that point in his remarks. And that has certainly helped spark some of the growth as well. I also think that the U.S., prior to the pandemic at least, was more advanced in e-commerce capabilities and was much -- adjusted even more quickly than other markets might have as we saw a rapid move towards cash digitization as COVID set upon us in March of 2020. 
All that said, we are setting out to invest around the globe and we want our business to grow in all markets and territories in which we do work. We're more than happy to have the U.S. continue to grow. But I think as I look at the future of the business over the next 5 to 10 years, I expect still healthy growth in the United States, but I do expect our volumes to continue to grow in a nice way around the world. I mean you saw it this prior quarter. As good as the growth was in the U.S. in the quarter, both Latin America and CEMEA had very, very strong quarters. And international growth was really held back by Asia Pacific, which has really been hit very, very hard by lockdowns and restrictions as a result of the pandemic."

The one thing to think about as we look ahead, as we said earlier, as Al said in his comments, contactless payments are already 70% penetrated outside the U.S. So that's still a growth engine in the U.S. that is just beginning to take off. And given the size of the U.S., that will be a meaningful contributor to transactions growth. And we also know that tap-to-pay digitizes cash and allows us to capture a much larger share of transactions at the point of sale."

And so we're getting -- instead of 1 transaction, we're getting 4 transactions. And certainly, that's very good for us. 
The point I was making is that in many ways, BNPL is a closed-loop capability somewhat akin to what wallets were 3 years ago. And closed loops just end up hitting a wall. They don't end up -- they end up hitting a wall where it's hard to scale. It's hard to bring the level of -- and depth of choice that you can to your customers. And so what I think is going to happen is that BNPL players will become issuers who will issue Visa credentials that will have the -- their value proposition for installments embedded within the product itself so that they can, therefore, scale very, very quickly by immediately having access to the 100 million merchants that I referenced in my remarks. And so that's what I believe, based on history, is going to happen. And that's what I'm referring to when I say BNPL 2.0."

The U.S. border, the inbound to the U.S., we refer to the fact that international revenues have not grown as much as international volumes. Part of the reason is the inbound travel has been quite strong into the CEMEA region in Latin America, which have been quite open. And it has improved quite a bit in Europe. And because of the U.S. being largely restricted for inbound travel other than for U.S. citizens, inbound to the U.S. is still -- it's better than Asia, but it is, I'd say, weaker than any of the other regions ex Asia. So that's a clear upside there. It is a higher-yielding corridor. And so clearly, there will be benefit there as the travel from Canada, travel from Europe is permitted. In general, I mean it's hard to predict the mix. It is incorporated in our views of how cross-border is going to improve. Cross-border travel, for it to go from what we said to the levels we're assuming at the end of fiscal year '22, you would have to assume improvement in inbound to the U.S., and that's all part of the equation."

And so we lean into all of these new players very, very early. It's one of the reasons why we have the position we have right now in crypto, where we have partnerships with over 60 players, because we leaned in right from the beginning. And all of them have the capability and many of them are already issuing Visa credentials. I think some of these players will help continue to digitize payments and take money away from cash. I think that it's extremely likely that some transactions will be A2A. But there's A2A transactions today. A lot of just regular bill pay, for all types of purpose, is A2A. So I'm not really sure it's that new, a big a deal. 
But that said, we think that we're in a far better position by leaning in and working with these players. And if we don't actually have the transaction on our network or we're out of the processing of the transaction overall, there's still the possibility of providing other capabilities from our toolbox of solutions and value-added services to bring to the party.

So in terms of the structural changes that have happened that are sustainable, the cash digitization engine is clearly extremely healthy. And that is a big driver of debit because debit is the -- sort of the first gateway to digital payments that consumers use. And we've seen that debit has sustained its growth almost globally even as we've seen card-present come back and reopening happened and seamless payments go away. There's been quite a bit of resilience to debit strength helped by Visa Direct, too. So all indications are that the cash digitization engine, especially in emerging markets, has really taken off because habits are being formed and people have gotten used to using digital forms of payment. So we think there's quite a bit of resilience there, and there's evidence of that even as things have started to normalize. 
The shift to e-commerce, too, has been remarkably resilient. We've seen -- if you see the charts we send out with our press release, you can see card-present has a pretty decent recovery in the past few quarters. And if you look at how well e-commerce has held up, card-not-present has held up. Again, there's been quite a bit of resilience there. Many new categories, people have gotten used to doing -- using e-commerce. And the biggest thing is cross-border e-commerce. Cross-border e-commerce has been extremely resilient. If you look at it, it's indexing in the 140s. We saw a spike last quarter because of cryptocurrencies, but it's back into the 140s as it was in the second quarter, which is very hefty growth compared to its prior growth rate, and it has held up even as cross-border travel is coming back and even as card-present spending is coming back. So those 2 structural changes have shown quite a bit of resilience. 
Once you look past those, our value-added services have held up extremely well through the pandemic. If you look at the average growth in our value-added services over the past 6 to 8 quarters when we had the pandemic, it's been in the high teens. And our new flows businesses have been extremely high growth, too. We're expecting high teens next year. So those 2 newer growth engines have shown quite a bit of resilience all the way through the pandemic, and that clearly lays a great foundation for the future as they become a larger and larger part of our business if they're growing faster than our core consumer payments business. So that's a structurally higher growth rate because they're a larger part of our mix."

We're starting to see some of the benefits of our acceptance footprint in places like Latin America grow, and we're starting to see more of a shift to PV and away from cash throughout that region. So consumer payments is still bread and butter for our company and the growing credentials, growing acceptance points and continuing to work with our issuing partners on engagement and getting the most out of their existing customer base remain a very, very high priority for us.

Tien-Tsin, just to sort of give you a sense of where all the investment money is going, I mean the broad theme is we have substantially expanded the services we offer, the use cases we serve. And so what that means is we are investing significantly to continue to make our network more flexible, add more functionality. Every day, our network is -- gets more flexible and adds more capability. We are -- we've got substantially more services now to sell to our clients, and there are many new types of issuers and new types of acceptance points. So we're significantly increasing the number of -- sort of the boots on the ground, closest to our clients. So there's a big investment in -- from the ground closest to clients to make our clients easily incorporate these services into their business and also to bring in all these new types of fintechs, if you want to call them, the innovators into our ecosystem. 
The third dimension also is the broadening of our brand. You've seen our new brand positioning. If you have watched the Olympics, you couldn't have missed it. It reflects what the future of Visa is. It's not just about consumer payments. So there's clearly an investment in making sure that, that message gets across. So broadly speaking, it's enabling new use cases, new geographies, new clients and then repositioning the whole brand for essentially the leader in money movement."

To the best of my knowledge, Tim, I don't think that the A2A options offer any of those kinds of protections to consumers today that I'm aware of. And I think we'll have to see as A2A advances and as we get deeper into open banking, particularly starting in Europe, which is really ground zero for open banking and obviously one of the reasons why we're excited about owning Tink, we'll have to see whether we think that there's a way for us to step in to try to help provide some of those protections for A2A or it could well be that A2A just ties to different profile of -- for the different profile of protections or lack thereof for those transactions versus transactions on -- that run on a network like Visa."

Yields and margins are different. New flows businesses can have different yields than our core payments business. But given that it leverages the infrastructure and it's very much a scale business does come with very good margins. So you saw what happened to margins this year. We had a nice improvement from the drop we had in the COVID era. So net-net, I mean we don't see anything vastly different from a margin perspective in the future. It will still be driven by the same factors. As I said, it's an outcome, not an objective."

In the fourth quarter and throughout fiscal 2021, Visa has delivered strong results against the backdrop of economic uncertainty and the lingering impacts of the COVID pandemic. In doing so, we demonstrated the resiliency of our business and validated our growth strategy as we continue to drive the rapid growth of digital payments and enable innovation in money movement globally. 
A quick summary of Q4 results. Fourth quarter payments volume was 121% of 2019, up about 0.8 points from Q3 and up 17% year-over-year. Despite the backdrop of a global pandemic, this quarter, we also set a record with total global payments volume of $2.8 trillion. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, was 86% of 2019, 4 points better than Q3 and up 46% year-over-year. And processed transactions were 124% of 2019, up 4 points from Q3 and up 21% year-over-year. Our net revenues grew 29% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, up 44%. 
In talking to many of you over the last few months, I know you're wondering what's ahead for Visa and the payments ecosystem as we emerge from the pandemic. So rather than doing my usual report card on the quarter, I'm going to speak more broadly today about the 4 key reasons why we believe that Visa is even better positioned for growth than before the pandemic. One, there's still enormous opportunity ahead in consumer payments. Two, we continue to enhance our network of networks capability to facilitate money movement more seamlessly and securely for all players in the ecosystem and accelerate the penetration of new flows. Third, value-added services simultaneously help our clients leverage our scale and sophistication while diversifying Visa's business and driving more volume. Four, we enable much of the disruption and innovation in the payments ecosystem, which helps to accelerate Visa's growth. 
So let me start with number one, the enormous opportunity in consumer payments. We see that the pandemic has helped to further digitize cash. In the last 12 months, global debit cash volumes, which are primarily the amount of cash withdrawn from Visa debit cards, has increased 4%, while debit payments volume has grown 23%, both on a constant dollar basis. In 2021, the number of monthly active e-commerce credentials and spend per active credential continued to grow strongly. For example, in the United States, monthly active credentials and active spend per credential both grew by more than 20% on average versus 2019. We've grown credentials for both traditional and new players to 3.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year. After renewing client contracts that represented 55% of our payments volume in the previous 2 years, we renewed contracts that represented nearly 20% in 2021. 
Let me just highlight a few of those deals in Q4. In our Asia Pacific region, we renewed 3 of Visa's top 20 issuers, including China Merchants Bank and Bank of China. And in North America, we renewed 3 of the top 15 issuers. PNC renewed the prepaid consumer credit and debit, commercial credit and small business credit and debit portfolios. Regions also renewed the prepaid consumer credit and debit, commercial credit and small business credit and debit portfolios. And RBC and Visa have entered into a renewal of their agreement with respect to the issuance of credit, debit and prepaid cards in Canada. 
Fintechs have also fueled our growth. In the last year, nearly 30% more fintechs issued Visa credentials, and they have more than doubled their payments volume. Furthermore, fintechs are scaling. We've also grown acceptance to more than 80 million merchant locations, up 14% year-over-year. And when you include small businesses behind players like Stripe and Square, the number is north of 100 million merchant locations. 
We've grown tap-to-pay to 70% of all face-to-face transactions globally. Excluding the United States, we have more than 70 countries with over 50% contactless penetration. U.S. penetration is now over 15%, more than double from just a year ago with 400 million cards, quadruple what we had 2 years ago. We know from other markets that tapping brings increased spending and transactions while digitizing cash. 
We also continue to innovate to make it easier for partners to access and utilize our platforms and capabilities. One recent example is Visa Cloud Connect, which enables clients to connect to VisaNet via the cloud, eliminating the need for investment in local data centers, telecommunications infrastructure and any specialized payment hardware. 
To summarize, consumer payments is an opportunity and it's Visa's credentials, acceptance and innovation that make us feel confident about our ability to accelerate growth in the future. 
Moving now to our network of networks. We continue to enhance our capabilities to facilitate money movement seamlessly and securely for all players in the ecosystem while accelerating the penetration of new flows. The total new flows opportunity is $185 trillion. Payments infrastructure, regulations and settlement systems are all very local in nature, which creates a lot of complexity in a world of global trade. Our network of networks capability enables Visa as a single connection point to help clients to move value domestically and cross-border over all networks, including Visa's own networks, RTPs, ACHs and new networks in the future, like stable coins and public blockchains. 
In FY '21, we continue to build out Visa Direct's global reach, surpassing 5 billion transactions across 500 programs and nearly 550 enablers, such as acquirers, processors, banks and fintechs. In the U.S. alone, nearly 120 million cards have sent or received funds using Visa Direct. Visa Direct is unique as it is more -- has more end points and more use cases compared to the next competitor and offers flexible technology. 
Our growth plan for Visa Direct focus is on 4 key levers. First, entrench existing use cases. P2P is our largest use case. And in FY '21, we surpassed 200 P2P programs globally. Insurance disbursements is another use case. In this quarter, we added Nationwide to begin distributing claims. 
Second, we want to capture the cross-border opportunity. For cross-border P2P, during the fourth quarter, we added Paysend. And soon, Western Union's U.S. customers will be able to send funds to eligible Visa cards in the Philippines, Thailand, Colombia and Jamaica, followed by a robust expansion plan for other countries. Beyond remittances, we're also leveraging our cross-border capabilities for marketplaces, supplier payments, student tuition payments and more. 
Our third lever to grow is scale the over 20 live use cases. Recent examples include tipping fundraising, brokerage account funding and airline vouchers. And in the fourth quarter, we added Yardi in the rental space area for property managers to distribute security deposits. 
Finally, scale new markets. Visa Direct has scaled rapidly in several markets, but there are many more where the market conditions are right for acceleration. For example, in Peru, we have a strong P2P footprint and are now adding new use cases like the innovative payroll solution, launched a partnership with [ Tu Sueldo Y ], a salary on-demand provider that also seeks to improve financial inclusion. Globally, we have more than quadrupled the number of earned wage access providers on our platform since 2019. In short, we are just scratching the surface on Visa Direct and expect to drive rapid growth in the years ahead to capture the $65 trillion market opportunity. 
We also have many examples of partners utilizing Visa Direct and our B2B capabilities. This quarter, we're pleased that [ BIM ] will offer their 400,000-plus business customers the ability to make B2B payments via Visa Direct and through Visa virtual cards. We also have wins with Credorax in Europe for travel virtual cards and [ Ignition ] and Standard Bank in CEMEA in fleet and an exclusive agreement for physical and virtual cards with ramp of P2P, finance automation fintech here in the United States. We also continue to strengthen and expand our relationship with JPMorgan commercial card through a new commercial card agreement and through JPMorgan's participation in Visa's Commercial Pay solution. These initiatives will support virtual card capabilities, spur growth and new payment flows and drive incremental volume over time. 
Visa B2B Connect now operates in more than 100 markets and offers a multilateral network with distributed ledger technology that addresses the pain points of existing solutions, which include transparency and speed. We're also pleased to have launched a partnership with Citi to be a global settlement bank for Visa B2B Connect, which broadens the end points available for clients to include cities, business accounts for moving money cross-border and their clearing capabilities for banks that have not yet been integrated into the B2B Connect network. Given the size and breadth of Citi and our role in facilitating money movement, we're very excited about this capability to expand the Visa B2B Connect network. 
Looking ahead, open banking plays in a central role in the network of networks. We believe Visa can accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe with our pending acquisition of Tink. Together, we can provide a secure, reliable platform for innovation that could be expanded globally. Whether it's leveraging account data for value-added services or facilitating account-to-account or pay-by-bank money movement, open banking creates opportunities for Visa to offer our clients and partners a one-stop shop for money movement, security, data and valuable customer experiences. 
Blockchains also will continue to expand our network of networks. Our settlement capabilities and our continued innovation around crypto APIs and services have been key to winning new partnerships. We have nearly 60 crypto platform partners with the capability to issue Visa credentials, and we're already capturing over $3.5 billion of payment volume in FY '21. 
The third reason we're even better positioned for growth post COVID is value-added services, where our scale and sophistication simultaneously help our clients be more successful while diversifying Visa's business and driving more value. Our value-added solutions differentiate Visa's network, enable our clients to adapt to the changing payments ecosystem and deliver valuable services across other rails, enhancing our network of network capabilities. In 2021, 40% of our clients used 5 or more value-added services and nearly 30% used 10 or more, which is up from 20% in 2020. 
Let me highlight a few services that have grown significantly in 2021. CyberSource added 28 new acquirer partners and 45,000 merchants as a result -- and as a result, we are growing payments volume twice as fast as our broader client base, and our risk solution on CyberSource called Decision Manager grew over 30%. We have doubled the number of tokens over the past year to 2.6 billion and enhanced the capabilities to manage them through Visa Cloud token. Across more than 8,600 issuers and 800,000 merchants, tokens have led to a 2.5% increase in approval rates and a 28% reduction in fraud rates. Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, which helped reduced fraud by $26 billion, screening 30% more transactions in 2021 than in 2020. 
All of our efforts in authentication, risk, identity and authorization optimization have led to cross-border card-not-present approval rates increasing by nearly 2% in the past year. Therefore, value-added services revenue grew 25% in Q4 and also drove additional volume. Since the pandemic began, our VAS revenue has averaged a quarterly growth rate in the high teens and was approximately $5 billion in FY '21. 
Finally, the fourth reason that we believe we have great room to grow is that we can enable much of the disruption and innovation in the payments ecosystem, which helps accelerate Visa's growth. Visa's past, present and future are about fostering innovation and enabling new partners, capabilities and use cases. We enable the disruptors. We help them scale. Disruptors are good for payments and good for Visa. Given our role in the ecosystem, we don't pick winners and losers, and we're well positioned for growth across many potential outcomes. 
Let's take wallets as an example. Wallets have done a tremendous job of building a user base, in some cases building acceptance. But at some point, they reach a point where they are seeking additional growth, and many of them are embedding Visa credentials in their wallets so the consumer can use it anywhere Visa is accepted as well as receive and send cross-border P2P payments. LINE Pay is an excellent example with 4 portfolios totaling 5.6 million Visa credentials across 3 countries, including a new co-brand in Thailand that was launched in the fourth quarter. 
Buy now pay later, or BNPL, is a newer example but, we think, will have a similar outcome. While installments are fast-growing, they're just a fraction of the total industry's payment volume estimated to be about $100 billion to $150 billion, but we are bringing scale to disruptors. We have a two-pronged strategy where we provide a network solution as well as solutions for our BNPL fintech partners. The network solution offers issuers the ability to extend installments to their existing credit clients and merchants to offer a seamless installment option to their customer with flexible terms. We continue to expand our partnerships in Q4 with HSBC in Malaysia; Moneris, Canada's largest payment processor by volume; and ANZ in Australia with 2022 large [ payments ]. 
We also partner with fintechs in a number of ways. We generate revenue when customers pay their installments with a Visa card through virtual cards for B2B or consumer payments and through value-added services. The majority of the installment payoffs are on cards today. For example, in Canada, over the last year, the number of Visa cards used to repay installments has grown more than 300%. 
We believe we're currently experiencing BNPL 1.0. Individual fintechs and companies are cutting individual deals merchant by merchant. Eventually, we believe the business model will evolve to BNPL 2.0, where fintech partners issue Visa credentials to leverage our acceptance and platforms to overcome the difficulty of scaling acceptance globally, merchant by merchant. We're already seeing this evolution begin to take shape. Just this quarter, [ a partner ] signed a global brand deal to accelerate expansion and scale into several markets. 
So to close, Visa is better positioned than before the pandemic to capture the opportunity ahead, supported by the strong growth in consumer payments, the scale of our platforms, network and capabilities and new flows and value-added services becoming a greater portion of our revenue. And as cross-border volumes return over the next 2 years, it will only help to further drive our growth. Furthermore, over the history of our company, we have demonstrated that our innovation, willingness to partner and compelling and competitive offerings have made our business resilient and successful. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Vasant to review Q4 and also provide a view of what we believe these -- all these opportunities mean for Visa's financial performance in the coming year. Vasant, over to you."

Fiscal year 2021 was certainly a year of 2 very different halves. In the first half, net revenues declined 4% and non-GAAP EPS was down 2% as we lapped a pre-COVID first half of 2020. In the second half, the recove",2344,"Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal year 2021 was certainly a year of 2 very different halves. In the first half, net revenues declined 4% and non-GAAP EPS was down 2% as we lapped a pre-COVID first half of 2020. In the second half, the recovery was well underway and we were lapping some of the worst 2020 COVID impacts. As a result, net revenue grew 28%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 43%. 
Fiscal fourth quarter results were better than we expected, with net revenues up 29%, driven by strong U.S. domestic trends, robust value-added services growth and higher cross-border volumes from a faster-than-anticipated recovery in travel. Had we recognized service revenues on current quarter's payment volumes, net revenue growth would have been approximately 22%. GAAP EPS grew 70%, including equity investment gains and a onetime noncash tax expense last year. Non-GAAP EPS rose 44%, helped by a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shifts increased both net revenue and EPS growth by approximately 0.5 point. 
In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 17%, led by continued strength in debit as well as improving credit spending. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, global payments volume was 21% higher, a 0.8 percentage point acceleration from Q3, with debit slowing 1 point and credit improving by 3 points versus Q3. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 18% or 26% higher than 2019 and a 1 point acceleration from the third quarter. Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded cost conversion, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume was up 30% over 2019, consistent with the third quarter. 
Credit improved 3 points to 17% above '19, helped by consumer, small business and commercial spending. Debit slowed 4 points but remained very strong at 44% above 2019 without much benefit from economic impact payments. Card-present spend improved 3 points to 15% above 2019, its highest level yet in the pandemic, driven by higher fuel and restaurant spending. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, slowed 6 points to 53% over 2019 as some food and drug spending shifted back to card-present and retail spend was not as strong without the benefit of stimulus payments. 
International constant dollar payments volume improved 3 points from Q3, up 15% over 2019 levels. A few regional highlights. Latin America was up 58% from 2019, accelerated 10 points from the third quarter with robust performance across the region, fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region remained strong, up 48% from 2019 levels, consistent with Q3, also fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Europe was up 20% from 2019, improving 3 points from Q3 due mostly to strong performance across Continental Europe. Asia Pacific remains our weakest region, up 5% from 2019 and consistent with Q3 excluding China. Many countries instituted restrictions in the quarter, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Singapore, but all have started to recover in the past few weeks. India payments volume has fully recovered from the severe COVID outbreak in Q3. 
Global processed transactions were 24% over 2019, improving 4 points from the third quarter as transactions improved faster than volume. Tap-to-pay penetration increased in many markets and ticket sizes started to return to normal in the U.S. Visa Direct transactions grew 35%, down from the 50s in the previous 3 quarters. This quarter, we lapped a very strong Q4 of fiscal year '20 when Visa Direct hit 1 billion transactions for the first time. Stimulus payments have ended, and we are lapping the COVID-related spike in P2P, which is moderating U.S. growth rates. 
Meanwhile, the international business is ramping nicely as well as growth from use cases such as cross-border remittances, earned wage access and marketplace payouts. The cross-border volume recovery continued as more countries open their borders while e-commerce spending, excluding travel, remains strong. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, was at 86% of 2019 volumes, a 4-point improvement from Q3 driven by the continued recovery in travel that started in May. Cross-border card-not-present volume, excluding travel, continued to be very strong at 43% above 2019, declining 13 points from the third quarter but consistent with Q2. As a reminder, the boost we saw in Q3 was primarily from cryptocurrency purchases. 
Cross-border travel-related spending, excluding intra-Europe, versus 2019, improved 13 points from Q3 to Q4. It has risen from 40% of 2019 in April to 50% in June to 61% in September. In terms of where travel-related spending is improving, aside from Asia Pacific, outbound spend in each region is indexing at similar levels versus 2019, and each improved by between 10 to 20 points in Q4 versus Q3. The largest improvements were in Canada, the Middle East and across Europe. Europe inbound spend improved by 24 points versus 2019 as popular travel destinations such as France and Italy relaxed their border restrictions. As we have seen consistently during the pandemic, there is pent-up demand for travel as bookings accelerate when a border is opened. Latin America remains by far the strongest destination, well over 2019 levels. U.S. to Mexico travel remained robust, with spend more than 60% above 2019 levels in Q4. Asia Pacific remains mostly closed and did not meaningfully improve in the fourth quarter, remaining below 30% of 2019, both inbound and outbound. 
Moving now to a quick review of fourth quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 41%, consistent with 39% nominal growth in third quarter payments volume and helped by small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 20%, in line with 21% processed transactions growth with a small impact from unfavorable country mix. International transaction revenues were up 41%, 7 points lower than nominal cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, due to lapping high currency volatility last year and unfavorable regional mix. Other revenues grew 36%, led by consulting and data services as well as travel benefits. In total, value-added services revenue grew 25%, led by security and identity as well as consulting and data services with some benefit from COVID-related lapping effects. Client incentives were 26.7% of gross revenues, in line with our expectations. The 90 basis point increase from Q3 was primarily driven by strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America and fewer adjustments for underperformance in certain geographies, partially offset by improving cross-border volumes. 
Operating expenses grew 15%, in line with our expectations. Marketing expenses grew 58% in the quarter as we stepped up spending and also lapped reductions in Q4 last year. Personnel and professional services spend also accelerated as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives. We recorded gains from our equity investments of $101 million. Excluding investment gains, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $118 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5% was lower than expected due to the resolution of a tax matter. GAAP EPS was $1.65. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, up 44% over last year. 
We bought 13.2 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $231.33 for $3.1 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned over $3.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. On October 22, Visa's Board of Directors authorized a 17% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.375 per share. For the full year, net revenues increased 10%, and non-GAAP EPS of $5.91 was up 17%. We returned $11.5 billion in capital to shareholders by repurchasing 39.7 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $219.34 for $8.7 billion and by paying dividends of $2.8 billion. 
Before we discuss the year ahead, let me share performance through the first 3 weeks of October. U.S. payments volume was up 32% above 2019, consistent with September, with debit at 44% and credit at 22% above 2019. Processed transactions were 26% above 2019. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, on a constant dollar basis was 94% of 2019, which is up 8 points from Q4 and 2 points from September. Travel-related spending versus 2019 improved 4 points compared to September to 65% of 2019. Card-not-present non-travel was 49% above 2019, up 6 points from the fourth quarter and down 2 points from September. 
Looking ahead to fiscal year 2022. Our business has been on a recovery track for the past 3 to 4 quarters. However, we are not back to normal yet globally. There are many factors to consider as we project the trajectory of the recovery. Debit and e-commerce have outperformed and stayed resilient even as credit recovers and in-store shopping returns. The full impact of stimulus payments and support programs ending remains to be seen. Cross-border travel is recovering well but still well below pre-COVID levels with a pace of recovery dependent on cross-border -- on border openings. Asia has not reopened to the degree the rest of the world has. The timing of reopening in key countries across Asia, both domestically and for cross-border travel, is a key variable. Most importantly, COVID variants are still with us and vaccination rates remain low in large parts of the globe. 
With these factors as the backdrop, forecasting the trajectory of the return to normalcy remains difficult. Visibility 4 quarters out, while improved, is still not great. For the past few quarters, we have been providing you our best sense of the business one quarter at a time, and we will continue that practice in fiscal year '22. 
Assuming current trends are sustained through December, we would expect first quarter net revenue growth in the high teens. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenue are likely to be in the 26% to 27% range, in line with the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. Sustained investment spending, combined with low comparables last year, leads to operating expenses continuing to grow in the mid-teens. Nonoperating expense is expected to be in the $120 million to $130 million range and tax rate in the 19% to 19.5% range. 
Looking 4 quarters out, projecting gross revenue growth poses the greatest challenge. It is significantly dependent on the pace of the cross-border travel recovery as well as the other factors I just mentioned. It is all a function of your assumptions for these variables. In order to be helpful, we will share the assumptions we are making for internal planning purposes. For domestic volumes and transactions, we are assuming no disruptions from COVID-related lockdowns. As such, we assume that the recovery trajectory underway in payments volume and processed transactions stays intact through fiscal year '22. 
For cross-border travel, we assume the recovery underway continues steadily through fiscal year '22 to reach 2019 levels in the summer of 2023. We assume the index to 2019 climbs from around 60 currently to around 80 by September 2022. We also assume the strong growth in cross-border e-commerce continues. We expect new flows and value-added services growth in the high teens. We expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to range between 26% to 27% for the year, consistent with the fourth quarter fiscal year '21 levels. Pre-COVID, this percentage increased by 50 to 100 basis points each year due to the impact of new deals and renewals. 
In fiscal year '22, we expect to benefit from revenue mix improvement as cross-border travel continues to recover, partially offset by the lapping of incentive reductions we had in fiscal year '21 due to the COVID impact. These assumptions result in high end of mid-teens net revenue growth for fiscal year '22, including over 0.5 point of exchange rate drag from the strengthening dollar. First quarter growth in the high teens will moderate through the year as we lap the recovery in fiscal year '21. As I said, these are our assumptions for internal planning purposes. We will continue to provide our outlook for the business one quarter at a time through fiscal year '22. 
In terms of the other elements of the P&L, we expect operating expenses to grow in the low teens in fiscal year '22 as we step up investments across all 3 lines of business to lay the foundation for sustained higher growth post COVID. We have already increased marketing investment. We will invest heavily in our technology platforms to continue to enhance functionality, flexibility, security and reliability. We will invest to sustain the high growth we have in our new flows and value-added services business, and we will continue to add resources in market to help our clients utilize all of our new capabilities. Expense growth will be higher in the first half and moderate in the second half as we lap the resumption of investment spending in fiscal year '21. Nonoperating expense is expected to be in the $120 million to $130 million range each quarter, and our tax rate for the year is also expected to stay in the 19% to 19.5% range. None of these assumptions include Tink or Currencycloud, which we expect to close in the first half of the fiscal year. They will not be material to fiscal year '22 revenue or non-GAAP EPS. 
Visa remains a network of choice for innovators and money movement. We enable the innovators and disruptors. We help them scale, and in turn, innovators drive our growth. We have continued to enhance the functionality and flexibility of our network to substantially expand the money movement use cases we serve, supporting the new generation of fintechs as well as driving growth in our new flows business. Our value-added services add differentiation and create more value for our clients than alternative networks can. Our network of network strategy substantially increases our nodes, which we believe can create more value for all network participants than any closed-loop or geographically limited network. As we said at our Investor Day, we have a 10x growth opportunity ahead of us, and we are well positioned to capture it. We ended fiscal year '21 with good momentum, a high-growth, resilient debit and e-commerce business, recovering credit and cross-border travel, and new flows and value-added services are newer growth engines driving further acceleration. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Mike for Q&A."

Look, I think -- first of all, open banking, as you know, is in its early stages. We believe by jumping into the middle of it that we can help the ecosystem determine what is the best routing for different transactions. There are certainly are transactions that will lend themselves to A2A kind of approach, which we know is one of the things that people will think about as a threat. But there's an awful lot of transactions, many, many transactions, where people appreciate the protections that are provided by a network like Visa, dispute resolution, fraud, security and the like. When money is moved instantaneously, that's nice at one level. But if -- once it's moved, it's awfully hard to get it back. And it's much more about other elements than just speed. 
We also think by getting involved with Tink, where we're right at an -- where we have the opportunity to really learn as we go, and we think that there's an opportunity to potentially provide value-added services even on transactions that might route in -- over a different network. So I would say, Lisa, the bottom line is you could see some transactions that are incremental, that might move off VisaNet or off of our normal rails. But the way we look at it is by leaning in, we're going to learn more about it and we're going to be able to influence what's happening, and we'll also be able to make sure that we can provide other capabilities and value-added services to the various transactions."

It certainly is the explosion of some of the neobanks and fintechs, although you're seeing those really develop all the way around the world. I would also say though that our Visa Direct platform is much more mature in the United States than it is in other markets. Vasant somewhat alluded to that point in his remarks. And that has certainly helped spark some of the growth as well. I also think that the U.S., prior to the pandemic at least, was more advanced in e-commerce capabilities and was much -- adjusted even more quickly than other markets might have as we saw a rapid move towards cash digitization as COVID set upon us in March of 2020. 
All that said, we are setting out to invest around the globe and we want our business to grow in all markets and territories in which we do work. We're more than happy to have the U.S. continue to grow. But I think as I look at the future of the business over the next 5 to 10 years, I expect still healthy growth in the United States, but I do expect our volumes to continue to grow in a nice way around the world. I mean you saw it this prior quarter. As good as the growth was in the U.S. in the quarter, both Latin America and CEMEA had very, very strong quarters.

The one thing to think about as we look ahead, as we said earlier, as Al said in his comments, contactless payments are already 70% penetrated outside the U.S. So that's still a growth engine in the U.S. that is just beginning to take off. And given the size of the U.S., that will be a meaningful contributor to transactions growth. And we also know that tap-to-pay digitizes cash and allows us to capture a much larger share of transactions at the point of sale."

And so we're getting -- instead of 1 transaction, we're getting 4 transactions. And certainly, that's very good for us. 
The point I was making is that in many ways, BNPL is a closed-loop capability somewhat akin to what wallets were 3 years ago. And closed loops just end up hitting a wall. They don't end up -- they end up hitting a wall where it's hard to scale. It's hard to bring the level of -- and depth of choice that you can to your customers. And so what I think is going to happen is that BNPL players will become issuers who will issue Visa credentials that will have the -- their value proposition for installments embedded within the product itself so that they can, therefore, scale very, very quickly by immediately having access to the 100 million merchants that I referenced in my remarks. And so that's what I believe, based on history, is going to happen. And that's what I'm referring to when I say BNPL 2.0."

The U.S. border, the inbound to the U.S., we refer to the fact that international revenues have not grown as much as international volumes. Part of the reason is the inbound travel has been quite strong into the CEMEA region in Latin America, which have been quite open. And it has improved quite a bit in Europe. And because of the U.S. being largely restricted for inbound travel other than for U.S. citizens, inbound to the U.S. is still -- it's better than Asia, but it is, I'd say, weaker than any of the other regions ex Asia. So that's a clear upside there. It is a higher-yielding corridor. And so clearly, there will be benefit there as the travel from Canada, travel from Europe is permitted. In general, I mean it's hard to predict the mix. It is incorporated in our views of how cross-border is going to improve. Cross-border travel, for it to go from what we said to the levels we're assuming at the end of fiscal year '22, you would have to assume improvement in inbound to the U.S., and that's all part of the equation."

It's one of the reasons why we have the position we have right now in crypto, where we have partnerships with over 60 players, because we leaned in right from the beginning. And all of them have the capability and many of them are already issuing Visa credentials. I think some of these players will help continue to digitize payments and take money away from cash. I think that it's extremely likely that some transactions will be A2A. But there's A2A transactions today. A lot of just regular bill pay, for all types of purpose, is A2A. So I'm not really sure it's that new, a big a deal. 
But that said, we think that we're in a far better position by leaning in and working with these players.

So in terms of the structural changes that have happened that are sustainable, the cash digitization engine is clearly extremely healthy. And that is a big driver of debit because debit is the -- sort of the first gateway to digital payments that consumers use. And we've seen that debit has sustained its growth almost globally even as we've seen card-present come back and reopening happened and seamless payments go away. There's been quite a bit of resilience to debit strength helped by Visa Direct, too. So all indications are that the cash digitization engine, especially in emerging markets, has really taken off because habits are being formed and people have gotten used to using digital forms of payment. So we think there's quite a bit of resilience there, and there's evidence of that even as things have started to normalize. 
The shift to e-commerce, too, has been remarkably resilient. We've seen -- if you see the charts we send out with our press release, you can see card-present has a pretty decent recovery in the past few quarters. And if you look at how well e-commerce has held up, card-not-present has held up. Again, there's been quite a bit of resilience there. Many new categories, people have gotten used to doing -- using e-commerce. And the biggest thing is cross-border e-commerce. Cross-border e-commerce has been extremely resilient. If you look at it, it's indexing in the 140s. We saw a spike last quarter because of cryptocurrencies, but it's back into the 140s as it was in the second quarter, which is very hefty growth compared to its prior growth rate, and it has held up even as cross-border travel is coming back and even as card-present spending is coming back. So those 2 structural changes have shown quite a bit of resilience. 
Once you look past those, our value-added services have held up extremely well through the pandemic. If you look at the average growth in our value-added services over the past 6 to 8 quarters when we had the pandemic, it's been in the high teens. And our new flows businesses have been extremely high growth, too. We're expecting high teens next year. So those 2 newer growth engines have shown quite a bit of resilience all the way through the pandemic, and that clearly lays a great foundation for the future as they become a larger and larger part of our business if they're growing faster than our core consumer payments business. So that's a structurally higher growth rate because they're a larger part of our mix."

And through Visa Direct or B2B Connect and utilizing for the first or last mile an ACH network or an RTP network gives us a great capability to reach what we believe is an unprecedented level of end points around the world that we think is very, very much a differentiator. And Visa Direct, beyond its reach because we're using our VisaNet platform, offers incredible operating scale. It allows us to leverage our value-added services that operate on VisaNet.

The RTP rails are typically always owned by bank consortiums or central banks. They are in the business of building the rails and then handing them over and then, in some cases, operating the rails, which by the way are, as Al said, open to everybody to use at regulated rates. 
So the competitor you're referring to does not own RTP rails, to the best of my knowledge anywhere. They have, in some cases, the opportunity to operate them in return for building them. In some cases, they just build them and move on. And they're not proprietary rails. They're open to everybody, including us. And we looked at it hard, and we concluded that the business of building these rails is not an attractive business. And the business of using these rails and the business of adding value-added capabilities and intelligence to these rails is a good business, and that's the business that we choose to be in."

So there really wasn't really any change in yield. Now clearly, the cross-border business is, relatively speaking, still recovering and below where it was. And therefore, the yields have been impacted by the mix shifting away from cross-border. And the mix improving is clearly helping the yields. But from one quarter to another, the yields were relatively stable. There was nothing unusual going on there. I'm sure after the call, if there's any confusion, Mike and Jennifer could clear it up. But my short answer would be the yields were just fine, and there was nothing unusual there."

And I think there's -- I feel very good about the way the business is advancing right now. I think consumer payments is positioned to stay strong. But in response to the question a few questions ago, I think e-commerce is going to sustain. I think tap-to-pay is going to sustain. We're starting to see some of the benefits of our acceptance footprint in places like Latin America grow, and we're starting to see more of a shift to PV and away from cash throughout that region. So consumer payments is still bread and butter for our company and the growing credentials, growing acceptance points and continuing to work with our issuing partners on engagement and getting the most out of their existing customer base remain a very, very high priority for us. 
And I think we've gotten really good traction on our 2 other revenue streams in new flows and value-added services. And we've got new flows, value -- Visa Direct. We've talked a bunch about and feel very good about that. And I think as the world starts to see people return to the office and travel start to return, I think that's going to help the B2B space. And I think a lot of what I commented on in terms of wins and advances in value-added services in fiscal '21 will continue into fiscal '22. So I think, in short, I like the fact that we've got a more diverse business model and more levers to pull. Of course, we want to continue to plant flags in geographies where the business is still -- or payments and money movement is a little bit more nascent. But all in all, I'm quite bullish on how the business looks as we enter fiscal '22. Vasant, do you want to add anything?"

Every day, our network is -- gets more flexible and adds more capability. We are -- we've got substantially more services now to sell to our clients, and there are many new types of issuers and new types of acceptance points. So we're significantly increasing the number of -- sort of the boots on the ground, closest to our clients. So there's a big investment in -- from the ground closest to clients to make our clients easily incorporate these services into their business and also to bring in all these new types of fintechs, if you want to call them, the innovators into our ecosystem. 
The third dimension also is the broadening of our brand. You've seen our new brand positioning. If you have watched the Olympics, you couldn't have missed it. It reflects what the future of Visa is. It's not just about consumer payments. So there's clearly an investment in making sure that, that message gets across. So broadly speaking, it's enabling new use cases, new geographies, new clients and then repositioning the whole brand for essentially the leader in money movement."

To the best of my knowledge, Tim, I don't think that the A2A options offer any of those kinds of protections to consumers today that I'm aware of. And I think we'll have to see as A2A advances and as we get deeper into open banking, particularly starting in Europe, which is really ground zero for open banking and obviously one of the reasons why we're excited about owning Tink, we'll have to see whether we think that there's a way for us to step in to try to help provide some of those protections for A2A or it could well be that A2A just ties to different profile of -- for the different profile of protections or lack thereof for those transactions versus transactions on -- that run on a network like Visa."

Yields and margins are different. New flows businesses can have different yields than our core payments business.

In the fourth quarter and throughout fiscal 2021, Visa has delivered strong results against the backdrop of economic uncertainty and the lingering impacts of the COVID pandemic. In doing so, we demonstrated the resiliency of our business and validated our growth strategy as we continue to drive the rapid growth of digital payments and enable innovation in money movement globally. 
A quick summary of Q4 results. Fourth quarter payments volume was 121% of 2019, up about 0.8 points from Q3 and up 17% year-over-year. Despite the backdrop of a global pandemic, this quarter, we also set a record with total global payments volume of $2.8 trillion. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, was 86% of 2019, 4 points better than Q3 and up 46% year-over-year. And processed transactions were 124% of 2019, up 4 points from Q3 and up 21% year-over-year. Our net revenues grew 29% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, up 44%. 
In talking to many of you over the last few months, I know you're wondering what's ahead for Visa and the payments ecosystem as we emerge from the pandemic. So rather than doing my usual report card on the quarter, I'm going to speak more broadly today about the 4 key reasons why we believe that Visa is even better positioned for growth than before the pandemic. One, there's still enormous opportunity ahead in consumer payments. Two, we continue to enhance our network of networks capability to facilitate money movement more seamlessly and securely for all players in the ecosystem and accelerate the penetration of new flows. Third, value-added services simultaneously help our clients leverage our scale and sophistication while diversifying Visa's business and driving more volume. Four, we enable much of the disruption and innovation in the payments ecosystem, which helps to accelerate Visa's growth. 
So let me start with number one, the enormous opportunity in consumer payments. We see that the pandemic has helped to further digitize cash. In the last 12 months, global debit cash volumes, which are primarily the amount of cash withdrawn from Visa debit cards, has increased 4%, while debit payments volume has grown 23%, both on a constant dollar basis. In 2021, the number of monthly active e-commerce credentials and spend per active credential continued to grow strongly. For example, in the United States, monthly active credentials and active spend per credential both grew by more than 20% on average versus 2019. We've grown credentials for both traditional and new players to 3.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year. After renewing client contracts that represented 55% of our payments volume in the previous 2 years, we renewed contracts that represented nearly 20% in 2021. 
Let me just highlight a few of those deals in Q4. In our Asia Pacific region, we renewed 3 of Visa's top 20 issuers, including China Merchants Bank and Bank of China. And in North America, we renewed 3 of the top 15 issuers. PNC renewed the prepaid consumer credit and debit, commercial credit and small business credit and debit portfolios. Regions also renewed the prepaid consumer credit and debit, commercial credit and small business credit and debit portfolios. And RBC and Visa have entered into a renewal of their agreement with respect to the issuance of credit, debit and prepaid cards in Canada. 
Fintechs have also fueled our growth. In the last year, nearly 30% more fintechs issued Visa credentials, and they have more than doubled their payments volume. Furthermore, fintechs are scaling. We've also grown acceptance to more than 80 million merchant locations, up 14% year-over-year. And when you include small businesses behind players like Stripe and Square, the number is north of 100 million merchant locations. 
We've grown tap-to-pay to 70% of all face-to-face transactions globally. Excluding the United States, we have more than 70 countries with over 50% contactless penetration. U.S. penetration is now over 15%, more than double from just a year ago with 400 million cards, quadruple what we had 2 years ago. We know from other markets that tapping brings increased spending and transactions while digitizing cash. 
We also continue to innovate to make it easier for partners to access and utilize our platforms and capabilities. One recent example is Visa Cloud Connect, which enables clients to connect to VisaNet via the cloud, eliminating the need for investment in local data centers, telecommunications infrastructure and any specialized payment hardware. 
To summarize, consumer payments is an opportunity and it's Visa's credentials, acceptance and innovation that make us feel confident about our ability to accelerate growth in the future. 
Moving now to our network of networks. We continue to enhance our capabilities to facilitate money movement seamlessly and securely for all players in the ecosystem while accelerating the penetration of new flows. The total new flows opportunity is $185 trillion. Payments infrastructure, regulations and settlement systems are all very local in nature, which creates a lot of complexity in a world of global trade. Our network of networks capability enables Visa as a single connection point to help clients to move value domestically and cross-border over all networks, including Visa's own networks, RTPs, ACHs and new networks in the future, like stable coins and public blockchains. 
In FY '21, we continue to build out Visa Direct's global reach, surpassing 5 billion transactions across 500 programs and nearly 550 enablers, such as acquirers, processors, banks and fintechs. In the U.S. alone, nearly 120 million cards have sent or received funds using Visa Direct. Visa Direct is unique as it is more -- has more end points and more use cases compared to the next competitor and offers flexible technology. 
Our growth plan for Visa Direct focus is on 4 key levers. First, entrench existing use cases. P2P is our largest use case. And in FY '21, we surpassed 200 P2P programs globally. Insurance disbursements is another use case. In this quarter, we added Nationwide to begin distributing claims. 
Second, we want to capture the cross-border opportunity. For cross-border P2P, during the fourth quarter, we added Paysend. And soon, Western Union's U.S. customers will be able to send funds to eligible Visa cards in the Philippines, Thailand, Colombia and Jamaica, followed by a robust expansion plan for other countries. Beyond remittances, we're also leveraging our cross-border capabilities for marketplaces, supplier payments, student tuition payments and more. 
Our third lever to grow is scale the over 20 live use cases. Recent examples include tipping fundraising, brokerage account funding and airline vouchers. And in the fourth quarter, we added Yardi in the rental space area for property managers to distribute security deposits. 
Finally, scale new markets. Visa Direct has scaled rapidly in several markets, but there are many more where the market conditions are right for acceleration. For example, in Peru, we have a strong P2P footprint and are now adding new use cases like the innovative payroll solution, launched a partnership with [ Tu Sueldo Y ], a salary on-demand provider that also seeks to improve financial inclusion. Globally, we have more than quadrupled the number of earned wage access providers on our platform since 2019. In short, we are just scratching the surface on Visa Direct and expect to drive rapid growth in the years ahead to capture the $65 trillion market opportunity. 
We also have many examples of partners utilizing Visa Direct and our B2B capabilities. This quarter, we're pleased that [ BIM ] will offer their 400,000-plus business customers the ability to make B2B payments via Visa Direct and through Visa virtual cards. We also have wins with Credorax in Europe for travel virtual cards and [ Ignition ] and Standard Bank in CEMEA in fleet and an exclusive agreement for physical and virtual cards with ramp of P2P, finance automation fintech here in the United States. We also continue to strengthen and expand our relationship with JPMorgan commercial card through a new commercial card agreement and through JPMorgan's participation in Visa's Commercial Pay solution. These initiatives will support virtual card capabilities, spur growth and new payment flows and drive incremental volume over time. 
Visa B2B Connect now operates in more than 100 markets and offers a multilateral network with distributed ledger technology that addresses the pain points of existing solutions, which include transparency and speed. We're also pleased to have launched a partnership with Citi to be a global settlement bank for Visa B2B Connect, which broadens the end points available for clients to include cities, business accounts for moving money cross-border and their clearing capabilities for banks that have not yet been integrated into the B2B Connect network. Given the size and breadth of Citi and our role in facilitating money movement, we're very excited about this capability to expand the Visa B2B Connect network. 
Looking ahead, open banking plays in a central role in the network of networks. We believe Visa can accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe with our pending acquisition of Tink. Together, we can provide a secure, reliable platform for innovation that could be expanded globally. Whether it's leveraging account data for value-added services or facilitating account-to-account or pay-by-bank money movement, open banking creates opportunities for Visa to offer our clients and partners a one-stop shop for money movement, security, data and valuable customer experiences. 
Blockchains also will continue to expand our network of networks. Our settlement capabilities and our continued innovation around crypto APIs and services have been key to winning new partnerships. We have nearly 60 crypto platform partners with the capability to issue Visa credentials, and we're already capturing over $3.5 billion of payment volume in FY '21. 
The third reason we're even better positioned for growth post COVID is value-added services, where our scale and sophistication simultaneously help our clients be more successful while diversifying Visa's business and driving more value. Our value-added solutions differentiate Visa's network, enable our clients to adapt to the changing payments ecosystem and deliver valuable services across other rails, enhancing our network of network capabilities. In 2021, 40% of our clients used 5 or more value-added services and nearly 30% used 10 or more, which is up from 20% in 2020. 
Let me highlight a few services that have grown significantly in 2021. CyberSource added 28 new acquirer partners and 45,000 merchants as a result -- and as a result, we are growing payments volume twice as fast as our broader client base, and our risk solution on CyberSource called Decision Manager grew over 30%. We have doubled the number of tokens over the past year to 2.6 billion and enhanced the capabilities to manage them through Visa Cloud token. Across more than 8,600 issuers and 800,000 merchants, tokens have led to a 2.5% increase in approval rates and a 28% reduction in fraud rates. Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, which helped reduced fraud by $26 billion, screening 30% more transactions in 2021 than in 2020. 
All of our efforts in authentication, risk, identity and authorization optimization have led to cross-border card-not-present approval rates increasing by nearly 2% in the past year. Therefore, value-added services revenue grew 25% in Q4 and also drove additional volume. Since the pandemic began, our VAS revenue has averaged a quarterly growth rate in the high teens and was approximately $5 billion in FY '21. 
Finally, the fourth reason that we believe we have great room to grow is that we can enable much of the disruption and innovation in the payments ecosystem, which helps accelerate Visa's growth. Visa's past, present and future are about fostering innovation and enabling new partners, capabilities and use cases. We enable the disruptors. We help them scale. Disruptors are good for payments and good for Visa. Given our role in the ecosystem, we don't pick winners and losers, and we're well positioned for growth across many potential outcomes. 
Let's take wallets as an example. Wallets have done a tremendous job of building a user base, in some cases building acceptance. But at some point, they reach a point where they are seeking additional growth, and many of them are embedding Visa credentials in their wallets so the consumer can use it anywhere Visa is accepted as well as receive and send cross-border P2P payments. LINE Pay is an excellent example with 4 portfolios totaling 5.6 million Visa credentials across 3 countries, including a new co-brand in Thailand that was launched in the fourth quarter. 
Buy now pay later, or BNPL, is a newer example but, we think, will have a similar outcome. While installments are fast-growing, they're just a fraction of the total industry's payment volume estimated to be about $100 billion to $150 billion, but we are bringing scale to disruptors. We have a two-pronged strategy where we provide a network solution as well as solutions for our BNPL fintech partners. The network solution offers issuers the ability to extend installments to their existing credit clients and merchants to offer a seamless installment option to their customer with flexible terms. We continue to expand our partnerships in Q4 with HSBC in Malaysia; Moneris, Canada's largest payment processor by volume; and ANZ in Australia with 2022 large [ payments ]. 
We also partner with fintechs in a number of ways. We generate revenue when customers pay their installments with a Visa card through virtual cards for B2B or consumer payments and through value-added services. The majority of the installment payoffs are on cards today. For example, in Canada, over the last year, the number of Visa cards used to repay installments has grown more than 300%. 
We believe we're currently experiencing BNPL 1.0. Individual fintechs and companies are cutting individual deals merchant by merchant. Eventually, we believe the business model will evolve to BNPL 2.0, where fintech partners issue Visa credentials to leverage our acceptance and platforms to overcome the difficulty of scaling acceptance globally, merchant by merchant. We're already seeing this evolution begin to take shape. Just this quarter, [ a partner ] signed a global brand deal to accelerate expansion and scale into several markets. 
So to close, Visa is better positioned than before the pandemic to capture the opportunity ahead, supported by the strong growth in consumer payments, the scale of our platforms, network and capabilities and new flows and value-added services becoming a greater portion of our revenue. And as cross-border volumes return over the next 2 years, it will only help to further drive our growth. Furthermore, over the history of our company, we have demonstrated that our innovation, willingness to partner and compelling and competitive offerings have made our business resilient and successful. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Vasant to review Q4 and also provide a view of what we believe these -- all these opportunities mean for Visa's financial performance in the coming year. Vasant, over to you."

Fiscal year 2021 was certainly a year of 2 very different halves. In the first half, net revenues declined 4% and non-GAAP EPS was down 2% as we lapped a pre-COVID first half of 2020. In the second half, the recove",2344,"Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal year 2021 was certainly a year of 2 very different halves. In the first half, net revenues declined 4% and non-GAAP EPS was down 2% as we lapped a pre-COVID first half of 2020. In the second half, the recovery was well underway and we were lapping some of the worst 2020 COVID impacts. As a result, net revenue grew 28%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 43%. 
Fiscal fourth quarter results were better than we expected, with net revenues up 29%, driven by strong U.S. domestic trends, robust value-added services growth and higher cross-border volumes from a faster-than-anticipated recovery in travel. Had we recognized service revenues on current quarter's payment volumes, net revenue growth would have been approximately 22%. GAAP EPS grew 70%, including equity investment gains and a onetime noncash tax expense last year. Non-GAAP EPS rose 44%, helped by a lower tax rate. Exchange rate shifts increased both net revenue and EPS growth by approximately 0.5 point. 
In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 17%, led by continued strength in debit as well as improving credit spending. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, global payments volume was 21% higher, a 0.8 percentage point acceleration from Q3, with debit slowing 1 point and credit improving by 3 points versus Q3. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 18% or 26% higher than 2019 and a 1 point acceleration from the third quarter. Chinese domestic volumes continue to be impacted by dual-branded cost conversion, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume was up 30% over 2019, consistent with the third quarter. 
Credit improved 3 points to 17% above '19, helped by consumer, small business and commercial spending. Debit slowed 4 points but remained very strong at 44% above 2019 without much benefit from economic impact payments. Card-present spend improved 3 points to 15% above 2019, its highest level yet in the pandemic, driven by higher fuel and restaurant spending. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, slowed 6 points to 53% over 2019 as some food and drug spending shifted back to card-present and retail spend was not as strong without the benefit of stimulus payments. 
International constant dollar payments volume improved 3 points from Q3, up 15% over 2019 levels. A few regional highlights. Latin America was up 58% from 2019, accelerated 10 points from the third quarter with robust performance across the region, fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region remained strong, up 48% from 2019 levels, consistent with Q3, also fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Europe was up 20% from 2019, improving 3 points from Q3 due mostly to strong performance across Continental Europe. Asia Pacific remains our weakest region, up 5% from 2019 and consistent with Q3 excluding China. Many countries instituted restrictions in the quarter, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Singapore, but all have started to recover in the past few weeks. India payments volume has fully recovered from the severe COVID outbreak in Q3. 
Global processed transactions were 24% over 2019, improving 4 points from the third quarter as transactions improved faster than volume. Tap-to-pay penetration increased in many markets and ticket sizes started to return to normal in the U.S. Visa Direct transactions grew 35%, down from the 50s in the previous 3 quarters. This quarter, we lapped a very strong Q4 of fiscal year '20 when Visa Direct hit 1 billion transactions for the first time. Stimulus payments have ended, and we are lapping the COVID-related spike in P2P, which is moderating U.S. growth rates. 
Meanwhile, the international business is ramping nicely as well as growth from use cases such as cross-border remittances, earned wage access and marketplace payouts. The cross-border volume recovery continued as more countries open their borders while e-commerce spending, excluding travel, remains strong. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, was at 86% of 2019 volumes, a 4-point improvement from Q3 driven by the continued recovery in travel that started in May. Cross-border card-not-present volume, excluding travel, continued to be very strong at 43% above 2019, declining 13 points from the third quarter but consistent with Q2. As a reminder, the boost we saw in Q3 was primarily from cryptocurrency purchases. 
Cross-border travel-related spending, excluding intra-Europe, versus 2019, improved 13 points from Q3 to Q4. It has risen from 40% of 2019 in April to 50% in June to 61% in September. In terms of where travel-related spending is improving, aside from Asia Pacific, outbound spend in each region is indexing at similar levels versus 2019, and each improved by between 10 to 20 points in Q4 versus Q3. The largest improvements were in Canada, the Middle East and across Europe. Europe inbound spend improved by 24 points versus 2019 as popular travel destinations such as France and Italy relaxed their border restrictions. As we have seen consistently during the pandemic, there is pent-up demand for travel as bookings accelerate when a border is opened. Latin America remains by far the strongest destination, well over 2019 levels. U.S. to Mexico travel remained robust, with spend more than 60% above 2019 levels in Q4. Asia Pacific remains mostly closed and did not meaningfully improve in the fourth quarter, remaining below 30% of 2019, both inbound and outbound. 
Moving now to a quick review of fourth quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 41%, consistent with 39% nominal growth in third quarter payments volume and helped by small pricing modifications. Data processing grew 20%, in line with 21% processed transactions growth with a small impact from unfavorable country mix. International transaction revenues were up 41%, 7 points lower than nominal cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, due to lapping high currency volatility last year and unfavorable regional mix. Other revenues grew 36%, led by consulting and data services as well as travel benefits. In total, value-added services revenue grew 25%, led by security and identity as well as consulting and data services with some benefit from COVID-related lapping effects. Client incentives were 26.7% of gross revenues, in line with our expectations. The 90 basis point increase from Q3 was primarily driven by strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America and fewer adjustments for underperformance in certain geographies, partially offset by improving cross-border volumes. 
Operating expenses grew 15%, in line with our expectations. Marketing expenses grew 58% in the quarter as we stepped up spending and also lapped reductions in Q4 last year. Personnel and professional services spend also accelerated as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives. We recorded gains from our equity investments of $101 million. Excluding investment gains, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $118 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5% was lower than expected due to the resolution of a tax matter. GAAP EPS was $1.65. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, up 44% over last year. 
We bought 13.2 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $231.33 for $3.1 billion this quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, we returned over $3.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. On October 22, Visa's Board of Directors authorized a 17% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.375 per share. For the full year, net revenues increased 10%, and non-GAAP EPS of $5.91 was up 17%. We returned $11.5 billion in capital to shareholders by repurchasing 39.7 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $219.34 for $8.7 billion and by paying dividends of $2.8 billion. 
Before we discuss the year ahead, let me share performance through the first 3 weeks of October. U.S. payments volume was up 32% above 2019, consistent with September, with debit at 44% and credit at 22% above 2019. Processed transactions were 26% above 2019. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, on a constant dollar basis was 94% of 2019, which is up 8 points from Q4 and 2 points from September. Travel-related spending versus 2019 improved 4 points compared to September to 65% of 2019. Card-not-present non-travel was 49% above 2019, up 6 points from the fourth quarter and down 2 points from September. 
Looking ahead to fiscal year 2022. Our business has been on a recovery track for the past 3 to 4 quarters. However, we are not back to normal yet globally. There are many factors to consider as we project the trajectory of the recovery. Debit and e-commerce have outperformed and stayed resilient even as credit recovers and in-store shopping returns. The full impact of stimulus payments and support programs ending remains to be seen. Cross-border travel is recovering well but still well below pre-COVID levels with a pace of recovery dependent on cross-border -- on border openings. Asia has not reopened to the degree the rest of the world has. The timing of reopening in key countries across Asia, both domestically and for cross-border travel, is a key variable. Most importantly, COVID variants are still with us and vaccination rates remain low in large parts of the globe. 
With these factors as the backdrop, forecasting the trajectory of the return to normalcy remains difficult. Visibility 4 quarters out, while improved, is still not great. For the past few quarters, we have been providing you our best sense of the business one quarter at a time, and we will continue that practice in fiscal year '22. 
Assuming current trends are sustained through December, we would expect first quarter net revenue growth in the high teens. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenue are likely to be in the 26% to 27% range, in line with the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. Sustained investment spending, combined with low comparables last year, leads to operating expenses continuing to grow in the mid-teens. Nonoperating expense is expected to be in the $120 million to $130 million range and tax rate in the 19% to 19.5% range. 
Looking 4 quarters out, projecting gross revenue growth poses the greatest challenge. It is significantly dependent on the pace of the cross-border travel recovery as well as the other factors I just mentioned. It is all a function of your assumptions for these variables. In order to be helpful, we will share the assumptions we are making for internal planning purposes. For domestic volumes and transactions, we are assuming no disruptions from COVID-related lockdowns. As such, we assume that the recovery trajectory underway in payments volume and processed transactions stays intact through fiscal year '22. 
For cross-border travel, we assume the recovery underway continues steadily through fiscal year '22 to reach 2019 levels in the summer of 2023. We assume the index to 2019 climbs from around 60 currently to around 80 by September 2022. We also assume the strong growth in cross-border e-commerce continues. We expect new flows and value-added services growth in the high teens. We expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to range between 26% to 27% for the year, consistent with the fourth quarter fiscal year '21 levels. Pre-COVID, this percentage increased by 50 to 100 basis points each year due to the impact of new deals and renewals. 
In fiscal year '22, we expect to benefit from revenue mix improvement as cross-border travel continues to recover, partially offset by the lapping of incentive reductions we had in fiscal year '21 due to the COVID impact. These assumptions result in high end of mid-teens net revenue growth for fiscal year '22, including over 0.5 point of exchange rate drag from the strengthening dollar. First quarter growth in the high teens will moderate through the year as we lap the recovery in fiscal year '21. As I said, these are our assumptions for internal planning purposes. We will continue to provide our outlook for the business one quarter at a time through fiscal year '22. 
In terms of the other elements of the P&L, we expect operating expenses to grow in the low teens in fiscal year '22 as we step up investments across all 3 lines of business to lay the foundation for sustained higher growth post COVID. We have already increased marketing investment. We will invest heavily in our technology platforms to continue to enhance functionality, flexibility, security and reliability. We will invest to sustain the high growth we have in our new flows and value-added services business, and we will continue to add resources in market to help our clients utilize all of our new capabilities. Expense growth will be higher in the first half and moderate in the second half as we lap the resumption of investment spending in fiscal year '21. Nonoperating expense is expected to be in the $120 million to $130 million range each quarter, and our tax rate for the year is also expected to stay in the 19% to 19.5% range. None of these assumptions include Tink or Currencycloud, which we expect to close in the first half of the fiscal year. They will not be material to fiscal year '22 revenue or non-GAAP EPS. 
Visa remains a network of choice for innovators and money movement. We enable the innovators and disruptors. We help them scale, and in turn, innovators drive our growth. We have continued to enhance the functionality and flexibility of our network to substantially expand the money movement use cases we serve, supporting the new generation of fintechs as well as driving growth in our new flows business. Our value-added services add differentiation and create more value for our clients than alternative networks can. Our network of network strategy substantially increases our nodes, which we believe can create more value for all network participants than any closed-loop or geographically limited network. As we said at our Investor Day, we have a 10x growth opportunity ahead of us, and we are well positioned to capture it. We ended fiscal year '21 with good momentum, a high-growth, resilient debit and e-commerce business, recovering credit and cross-border travel, and new flows and value-added services are newer growth engines driving further acceleration. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Mike for Q&A."

Look, I think -- first of all, open banking, as you know, is in its early stages. We believe by jumping into the middle of it that we can help the ecosystem determine what is the best routing for different transactions. There are certainly are transactions that will lend themselves to A2A kind of approach, which we know is one of the things that people will think about as a threat. But there's an awful lot of transactions, many, many transactions, where people appreciate the protections that are provided by a network like Visa, dispute resolution, fraud, security and the like. When money is moved instantaneously, that's nice at one level. But if -- once it's moved, it's awfully hard to get it back. And it's much more about other elements than just speed. 
We also think by getting involved with Tink, where we're right at an -- where we have the opportunity to really learn as we go, and we think that there's an opportunity to potentially provide value-added services even on transactions that might route in -- over a different network. So I would say, Lisa, the bottom line is you could see some transactions that are incremental, that might move off VisaNet or off of our normal rails. But the way we look at it is by leaning in, we're going to learn more about it and we're going to be able to influence what's happening, and we'll also be able to make sure that we can provide other capabilities and value-added services to the various transactions."

I would also say though that our Visa Direct platform is much more mature in the United States than it is in other markets. Vasant somewhat alluded to that point in his remarks. And that has certainly helped spark some of the growth as well. I also think that the U.S., prior to the pandemic at least, was more advanced in e-commerce capabilities and was much -- adjusted even more quickly than other markets might have as we saw a rapid move towards cash digitization as COVID set upon us in March of 2020. 
All that said, we are setting out to invest around the globe and we want our business to grow in all markets and territories in which we do work. We're more than happy to have the U.S. continue to grow. But I think as I look at the future of the business over the next 5 to 10 years, I expect still healthy growth in the United States, but I do expect our volumes to continue to grow in a nice way around the world. I mean you saw it this prior quarter. As good as the growth was in the U.S. in the quarter, both Latin America and CEMEA had very, very strong quarters.

The point I was making is that in many ways, BNPL is a closed-loop capability somewhat akin to what wallets were 3 years ago. And closed loops just end up hitting a wall. They don't end up -- they end up hitting a wall where it's hard to scale. It's hard to bring the level of -- and depth of choice that you can to your customers. And so what I think is going to happen is that BNPL players will become issuers who will issue Visa credentials that will have the -- their value proposition for installments embedded within the product itself so that they can, therefore, scale very, very quickly by immediately having access to the 100 million merchants that I referenced in my remarks. And so that's what I believe, based on history, is going to happen. And that's what I'm referring to when I say BNPL 2.0."

The U.S. border, the inbound to the U.S., we refer to the fact that international revenues have not grown as much as international volumes. Part of the reason is the inbound travel has been quite strong into the CEMEA region in Latin America, which have been quite open. And it has improved quite a bit in Europe. And because of the U.S. being largely restricted for inbound travel other than for U.S. citizens, inbound to the U.S. is still -- it's better than Asia, but it is, I'd say, weaker than any of the other regions ex Asia. So that's a clear upside there. It is a higher-yielding corridor. And so clearly, there will be benefit there as the travel from Canada, travel from Europe is permitted. In general, I mean it's hard to predict the mix. It is incorporated in our views of how cross-border is going to improve. Cross-border travel, for it to go from what we said to the levels we're assuming at the end of fiscal year '22, you would have to assume improvement in inbound to the U.S., and that's all part of the equation."

And so we lean into all of these new players very, very early. It's one of the reasons why we have the position we have right now in crypto, where we have partnerships with over 60 players, because we leaned in right from the beginning. And all of them have the capability and many of them are already issuing Visa credentials. I think some of these players will help continue to digitize payments and take money away from cash. I think that it's extremely likely that some transactions will be A2A. But there's A2A transactions today. A lot of just regular bill pay, for all types of purpose, is A2A. So I'm not really sure it's that new, a big a deal. 
But that said, we think that we're in a far better position by leaning in and working with these players. And if we don't actually have the transaction on our network or we're out of the processing of the transaction overall, there's still the possibility of providing other capabilities from our toolbox of solutions and value-added services to bring to the party. So how it's all going to play out, we'll have to see, but I'm optimistic that the position that we're taking, which is to lean into all of this, is going to put us in the best place to be successful."

So in terms of the structural changes that have happened that are sustainable, the cash digitization engine is clearly extremely healthy. And that is a big driver of debit because debit is the -- sort of the first gateway to digital payments that consumers use. And we've seen that debit has sustained its growth almost globally even as we've seen card-present come back and reopening happened and seamless payments go away. There's been quite a bit of resilience to debit strength helped by Visa Direct, too. So all indications are that the cash digitization engine, especially in emerging markets, has really taken off because habits are being formed and people have gotten used to using digital forms of payment. So we think there's quite a bit of resilience there, and there's evidence of that even as things have started to normalize. 
The shift to e-commerce, too, has been remarkably resilient. We've seen -- if you see the charts we send out with our press release, you can see card-present has a pretty decent recovery in the past few quarters. And if you look at how well e-commerce has held up, card-not-present has held up. Again, there's been quite a bit of resilience there. Many new categories, people have gotten used to doing -- using e-commerce. And the biggest thing is cross-border e-commerce. Cross-border e-commerce has been extremely resilient. If you look at it, it's indexing in the 140s. We saw a spike last quarter because of cryptocurrencies, but it's back into the 140s as it was in the second quarter, which is very hefty growth compared to its prior growth rate, and it has held up even as cross-border travel is coming back and even as card-present spending is coming back. So those 2 structural changes have shown quite a bit of resilience. 
Once you look past those, our value-added services have held up extremely well through the pandemic. If you look at the average growth in our value-added services over the past 6 to 8 quarters when we had the pandemic, it's been in the high teens. And our new flows businesses have been extremely high growth, too. We're expecting high teens next year. So those 2 newer growth engines have shown quite a bit of resilience all the way through the pandemic, and that clearly lays a great foundation for the future as they become a larger and larger part of our business if they're growing faster than our core consumer payments business. So that's a structurally higher growth rate because they're a larger part of our mix."

So the competitor you're referring to does not own RTP rails, to the best of my knowledge anywhere. They have, in some cases, the opportunity to operate them in return for building them. In some cases, they just build them and move on. And they're not proprietary rails. They're open to everybody, including us.

And therefore, the yields have been impacted by the mix shifting away from cross-border. And the mix improving is clearly helping the yields.

But in response to the question a few questions ago, I think e-commerce is going to sustain. I think tap-to-pay is going to sustain. We're starting to see some of the benefits of our acceptance footprint in places like Latin America grow, and we're starting to see more of a shift to PV and away from cash throughout that region. So consumer payments is still bread and butter for our company and the growing credentials, growing acceptance points and continuing to work with our issuing partners on engagement and getting the most out of their existing customer base remain a very, very high priority for us. 
And I think we've gotten really good traction on our 2 other revenue streams in new flows and value-added services. And we've got new flows, value -- Visa Direct. We've talked a bunch about and feel very good about that. And I think as the world starts to see people return to the office and travel start to return, I think that's going to help the B2B space. And I think a lot of what I commented on in terms of wins and advances in value-added services in fiscal '21 will continue into fiscal '22. So I think, in short, I like the fact that we've got a more diverse business model and more levers to pull. Of course, we want to continue to plant flags in geographies where the business is still -- or payments and money movement is a little bit more nascent.

So there's a big investment in -- from the ground closest to clients to make our clients easily incorporate these services into their business and also to bring in all these new types of fintechs, if you want to call them, the innovators into our ecosystem. 
The third dimension also is the broadening of our brand. You've seen our new brand positioning. If you have watched the Olympics, you couldn't have missed it. It reflects what the future of Visa is.

Yields and margins are different. New flows businesses can have different yields than our core payments business.
