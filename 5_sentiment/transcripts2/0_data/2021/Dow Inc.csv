We hope that you, your families are healthy and safe. 
Starting on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, the Dow team delivered results that exceeded expectations with sales and EBIT growth year-over-year and a sequential net sales increase of 10%. And as the global economy and market fundamentals continue to improve, demand drove volumes above or in line with pre-COVID levels across all operating segments. We captured strong durable goods and construction demand, we grew volumes and do-it-yourself architectural coatings and home care sectors, and we continue to benefit from solid demand and pricing momentum in packaging applications, supporting a sequential net sales increase of 12% in our Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment. This volume increase, combined with improved pricing and margins, particularly in polyethylene and polyurethane applications, delivered 5% revenue growth and higher operating EBIT year-over-year. We supported these strong top line results with a cash flow conversion of 93% in the quarter, driving our full year rate up 30% versus 2019. Cash from continuing operations was $1.7 billion in the quarter, and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Working capital was a $236 million source of cash, even with increased sales. 
We completed the sale of select U.S. Gulf Coast marine and terminal operations and assets, delivering another strategic nonoperational cash lever. And improved financial and operational performance at Sadara was a key contributor in delivering positive year-over-year equity earnings. We also maintained our disciplined approach to capital allocation, completing additional deleveraging as we reduced net debt by $837 million in the quarter. And we continue to reward our shareholders through our industry leading dividend. Overall, our fourth quarter performance was a strong finish to a year where team Dow successfully overcame significant macroeconomic and other external challenges. 
On Slide 4 is a brief recap of our full year achievements. We adapted quickly to the global pandemic and our agile approach to managing volatility in the markets, combined with our prudent adjustments to capital expenditures, proactive cost reductions, working capital interventions, plus delivery of unique cash levers supported demand growth year-over-year in packaging applications, a nearly $500 million structural improvement in working capital, a strong uplift in cash flow from operations, free cash flow of $5 billion and more than $2.6 billion in net debt reduction and continued cash returns to shareholders through our industry leading dividend. We achieved all this, while also making significant progress toward our ambition to be the most innovative customer-centric, inclusive and sustainable materials science company in the world. We found new ways to serve customers in a virtual world, we launched Dow's mobility science platform to better serve an attractive market vertical, we reinforced Dow's commitment to inclusion and diversity through a bold framework to address systemic racism and inequality and followed through with actions aligned to that framework, and we launched new aggressive targets to help eliminate plastic waste and reduce carbon emissions. I am incredibly proud of how the Dow team delivered solid performance and showed tremendous leadership on critical issues throughout 2020. 
Moving to our segment performance on Slide 5. As I mentioned earlier, ongoing improvements in the macroenvironment drove sequential sales gains across all segments and geographies, allowing us to reach year-over-year revenue growth during the quarter for the first time since the start of the pandemic. 
In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $780 million, up more than $130 million versus the same quarter last year and sequentially. Resilient demand, tight market supply, low inventory levels and disciplined price volume management enabled strong polyethylene pricing momentum and margin expansion. Notably, operating EBIT margins expanded 180 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially. Compared to the prior quarter, net sales increased 12%. Price gains continued across all regions and most applications, particularly in consumer packaging, and the business delivered higher volumes with broad-based demand growth. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business continued to see strong momentum through the end of the year. Sales were up year-over-year, primarily driven by steady volumes and improved polyethylene pricing, particularly in Food & Specialty Packaging as well as health and hygiene applications. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered local price gains in all regions, including double-digit gains in the U.S., Canada and Latin America. 
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT was $296 million, up $75 million year-over-year and up $192 million versus the prior quarter. Supply and demand fundamentals in polyurethanes and construction chemicals as well as higher equity earnings from improved performance at Sadara drove this result. On a sequential basis, significant improvement in margin over raw materials drove operating EBIT margins up more than 500 basis points, more than offsetting typical seasonality. The polyurethane and construction and chemicals business reported a double-digit increase in net sales year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher local prices with gains in all regions, except Latin America. Compared to prior quarter, sales growth was driven by strong local pricing and furniture, bedding and appliance end markets. 
The Industrial Solutions business reported flat net sales versus the prior year period. Currency tailwinds and higher volumes in solvents for coatings, industrial fluids, electronics and pharma applications were offset by pricing in industrial manufacturing applications. Compared to the prior quarter, net sales were up double digits due to sequential improvement in price and volume as industrial markets continued to recover and consumer end markets remained strong. 
And finally, the Performance Materials and Coatings segment reported operating EBITDA of $50 million, down year-over-year. Volume growth in downstream silicones and coatings applications was more than offset by price and volume declines in siloxanes. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT was down $25 million as margin expansion in silicon applications was overcome by seasonality in coatings end markets. 
The Consumer Solutions business reported a decline in net sales. The business captured solid demand growth in home care, consumer and electronics and high-performance building applications. These gains were more than offset by continued weak volumes in upstream siloxanes and in high-end personal care applications, such as cosmetics, as a result of paused social and workplace activities. On a sequential basis, volumes improved on recovery in mobility and transportation as well as consumer and electronics and markets. 
The Coatings and Performance Monomers business achieved higher net sales year-over-year, with volumes up double digits. The seasonality impact was moderate, and the business captured resilient demand for architectural coatings as consumers continue to focus on do-it-yourself projects at home. Sequentially, the business also experienced positive pricing momentum, particularly in acrylates, which was more than offset by seasonal weather-related declines for coatings applications in the Northern Hemisphere. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Howard for an update on Sadara, our financial outlook and our plans for digital acceleration."

The strong supply and demand trends that continue to benefit our packaging and polyurethanes businesses this quarter also benefited Sadara. The joint venture again delivered improved financial and operational results, driving equity earnings higher by more than $130 million year-over-year. We expect solid market fundamentals and an improving economy to continue to benefit the joint venture in 2021, supported by Sadara's feedstock flexibility and enhanced global cost curve position. We are also very pleased to report that Sadara declared project completion in the fourth quarter, removing Dow's $4 billion share of the guarantees that supported the joint venture's debt. In addition, in January of this year, Dow, Saudi Aramco and Sadara reached an agreement in principle with the remaining lenders and Sukuk investors on key terms for its debt reprofiling with formal agreements expected to be completed within the first quarter. As a result, Sadara is expected to be cash flow self-sufficient going forward. 
Key provisions of the reprofiling include an extension of the contractual debt maturity from 2029 to 2038; a modified repayment schedule aligned with Sadara's projected cash generation profile, including a grace period until June 2026, during which interest-only payments are required; no upfront payments of principal; and limited support in the form of much lower sponsor guarantees of Sadara's reprofiled debt, in proportion of the sponsor's ownership interest. The impact to Dow's commitments are expected to include the following, which are in proportion to Dow's 35% ownership interest in Sadara. Dow will provide guarantees for $1.3 billion of Sadara's debt, effectively replacing approximately $4 billion of prior guarantees. Dow will provide guarantees for its portion of Sadara interest payments due during the grace period. Our pro rata share of any potential shortfall, which based on Sadara's current performance we do not expect, will be funded by a new $500 million revolving facility in Sadara, guaranteed by Dow. This is expected to be established in the first quarter of 2021. 
And finally, Dow's existing $220 million letter of credit related to the guarantee of one future Sadara debt service payment will also be canceled. As a result of these actions, the company does not expect to provide any further shareholder loans or equity contributions to Sadara. 
Let's now turn to our modeling guidance for first quarter on Slide 7. We exited the fourth quarter with increasing strength, which is carried over into the first quarter. The ISM manufacturing new orders index is trending at its highest level in 10 years. In addition, low interest rates are supporting a resilient housing market and deurbanization trends are driving U.S. housing starts to their highest point since 2006. We expect sequentially higher business results in the first quarter with total sales in the range of $10.7 billion to $11.2 billion, driven by ongoing strength in our polyethylene and polyurethane value chains, improvement in our silicones franchise and supported by our U.S. Gulf Coast ethane advantage. We will see some headwinds sequentially with higher turnaround costs and the reversal of approximately $50 million in onetime benefits from the prior quarter. 
In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we entered the year with good pricing momentum, continued solid demand and elevated breakeven points for high cost naphtha producers as a result of increasing oil prices. We expect these dynamics to be sustained through the quarter. 
The Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment will continue to benefit from strong consumer durables demand, supported by automotive and housing sectors and improvement in industrial end markets. These trends, combined with industry supply limitations and low inventories, should support pricing uplift, although we do see some cost increases from rising propylene pricing as well. 
And finally, for Performance Materials and Coatings, we expect silicones to benefit from ongoing demand expansion in consumer end markets, particularly in electronics, home care and mobility, where our innovation advantages will continue to allow us to capture additional growth opportunities. In Coatings, we expect DIY demand to remain elevated through the first quarter as consumer home improvement trends continue. There will be some turnaround headwinds in the quarter, including completion of a turnaround at our siloxane plant in China that we shortened in the first half of 2020 due to COVID-related labor and supply issues. 
Turning to Slide 8. Looking at the full year, we see strong market fundamentals in many of our key value chains continuing to drive improved operating performance year-over-year. And although we expect the pace of recovery to moderate, it is still likely to be uneven quarter-to-quarter as the vaccine distribution and new strains evolve. As usual, we're providing you with our best full year estimates of several income statement and cash flow items, which are noted on the slide. 
Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, and based on our improved forward outlook versus 2020, we're increasing our capital expenditure target year-over-year to $1.6 billion, and we're targeting an additional $1 billion in deleveraging. Sadara, as previously mentioned, will be a $350 million tailwind for the year with no planned cash contributions. We expect equity earnings to be flat year-over-year as the margin resiliency we see across the portfolio is offset by higher planned JV turnaround expenses. Total turnaround spending will be up versus the prior year as we continue to ensure the reliability of our facilities. And as mentioned last year, we expect our $300 million EBITDA restructuring program to be substantially complete by year-end. We're also providing a share count estimate for the year. However, assuming a sustained EBITDA improvement, we will look at reinstituting our share buyback program later in the year for the purpose of covering dilution. And finally, we expect a full year tax rate in the 23% to 27% range. 
Moving to Slide 9. The events of 2020 provided an opportunity for us to rapidly accelerate our focus on the value of digitalization. Through our digital advances and capabilities, we were able to continue innovating, improving the customer experience, and optimizing our operations. It has become clear that the escalation of digital interactions and transactions driven by COVID-19 will only help us accelerate the delivery of our ambition and be an important part of our customer experience in the future. So building on this solid foundation, today, we're announcing plans to further advance our digitalization efforts by investing in 3 key areas: First, expanding digital tools like machine learning and advanced digital modeling to accelerate material science innovation and put innovation capabilities directly in the hands of our customers; second, further enhancing our e-commerce buying and fulfillment experience for our customers; and third, adopting additional real-time digital manufacturing insights, operational data intelligence and demand sensing, all to enhance the productivity and reliability of our operations. We expect these actions to deliver more than $300 million in incremental annual run rate EBITDA generation by year-end 2025 with an additional onetime $100 million improvement in structural working capital efficiencies. To realize these gains, we will spend approximately $400 million over the next 2 years with an attractive risk-adjusted return on investment exceeding our internal hurdle rate and an expected payback of less than 3 years. 
Our goal is clear, our digital acceleration will help us continue to transform how we work, and importantly, how we engage with our customers. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."
9830660,701618547,2183672,"Dow Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Dow Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Howard, and please turn with me to Slide 10. For more than 3 decades, sustainability has been an imperative to our business. And last year, we announced new brake targets focused on reducing our carbon footprint and addressing plastic waste. We",978,"Thank you, Howard, and please turn with me to Slide 10. For more than 3 decades, sustainability has been an imperative to our business. And last year, we announced new brake targets focused on reducing our carbon footprint and addressing plastic waste. We see these targets as a catalyst for growth and innovation. We've discussed with you our progress on key initiatives to advance the circular economy for plastics. And today, we want to provide visibility on our comprehensive approach to reducing carbon emissions. 
Over the past 15 years, Dow has reduced our overall emissions by 15%, while growing our business. And we see a viable pathway to reduce our net annual carbon emissions by another 15% by 2030. This pathway begins with targeting further efficiencies and optimization at our sites, sourcing renewable energy and clean power, and implementing new emission management technologies. We're working with utilities and regulators to supply clean purchase power to a majority of Dow sites by 2030. We're making good progress. Last year, we increased our agreements to purchase cost competitive renewable energy in Kentucky, Texas, Brazil and Spain, and we're preparing for the full transition of our Terneuzen operations. We're also working to optimize the energy efficiency of our sites by lowering our energy use and developing breakthrough technologies, such as electric, ethylene steam crackers, carbon capture and sequestration, and the potential use of blue hydrogen, now to be among the first in the industry to do so by 2030. We recognize that achieving these goals will also require partnerships with governments, regulatory agencies and other external groups to support the economics of these technologies and evolve regulatory frameworks to focus on emissions reduction. 
Widespread support for decarbonizing emissions is driving demand across the value chain, and Dow is well placed to continue to lead and benefit from this evolution. Many Dow products lower our customers' emissions more than the carbon emissions used to produce them, like enabling lighter, safer and more fuel-efficient automobiles; more energy-efficient buildings; and food that stay safe and fresh longer, all critical for a world set to add 2 billion people by 2050. Ultimately, Dow wins by making our cost to implement this transition lower than our competitors and the value of our products higher. Our objective is to establish a resilient portfolio of lower carbon footprint products to meet rising demand, capture market share and grow value, while reducing emissions for Dow, our customers, and the planet. 
Moving to Slide 11. As we look to 2021 and beyond, we are well positioned to capture additional value growth. Throughout the pandemic, new consumer behaviors emerge that have driven strong demand for our products, and we expect these trends to continue benefiting Dow's consumer-led portfolio even as the pandemic diminishes. Consumers have become accustomed to new ways of purchasing and interacting, increased in-home delivery and takeout dining, paired with heightened awareness of food hygiene and security will sustain demand strength for food and consumer packaging. The resilient housing market is creating higher demand for durable goods, such as furniture and appliances, and more time at home also leads to consumer spending on home improvement, including do-it-yourself coatings. Ongoing public caution about COVID-19, even after widespread vaccine distribution, will support continued demand for health and hygiene applications. We also believe that as vaccination rates increase and we turn the corner on the pandemic, there will be improving demand as travel, entertainment, sports and construction industries and other social activities return to normal. 
Market indicators are showing above GDP growth across several sectors, and as a result, we're beginning to see economic recovery broaden across our portfolio and in many of the end markets that we serve, which is benefiting our higher-margin consumer solutions business. Similarly, this increased confidence is also improving demand in our functional polymers portfolio, which serves mobility, infrastructure, and construction sectors. 
Finally, as we look ahead, Dow's unmatched materials science portfolio is uniquely positioned to address global megatrends and shifting post-COVID trends, providing additional higher-margin growth opportunities for Dow. 
Dow solutions meet increasing consumer needs for new sustainable innovations, such as post-consumer recycled plastics and renewable energy made polyethylene. In 2020, we tripled sales of product made with renewable bio-based feedstocks. As the need for renewable energy increases globally, so will demand for Dow solutions that enable wind power and solar production facilities. Our heat transfer fluids are used in more than 40 large-scale concentrated solar power plants around the world. And through our DowAksa joint venture, we provide polyurethane, carbon fiber systems that deliver a stronger and lighter composite material for wind blades. Electric vehicle sales are on the rise with 2021 growth projections exceeding 2020 records. And our mobility science platform focuses on delivering innovative products to enhance automobile connectivity, lightweighting, comfort, safety and sustainability. Lastly, we see meaningful opportunities to support the rollout of 5G broadband networks. For example, last year, we launched new high-performance thermal gel that promotes both environmental sustainability and efficient assembly of essential 5G infrastructure. 
Underpinning these tailwinds are the global foundational advantages and discipline that set Dow apart. Our unmatched portfolio, global scale, low-cost structure and industry-leading feedstock flexibility give us a competitive edge. Further, the actions that we took in 2020 to bolster our financial position, including the execution of our restructuring program and our disciplined focus on cash generation provides the financial strength and flexibility to support our growth trajectory in line with our financial and operating playbook. 
To close, 2020 was a challenging year for our world. But I could not be more proud of team Dow's performance nor could I be more confident in our future. Dow's competitive advantages are clear, we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us and the actions that we've taken position us to outperform our peers. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Colleen to open up the Q&A."

And toward the end of the year, we saw ethylene start to tighten up and ethylene margins improve. And so that led to some pretty sharp increases in the fourth quarter. You saw PE margins were up in the fourth quarter, about $0.07 a pound in the U.S., about $0.13 in Europe, and up about $0.10 in Asia. 
I think the other thing that happened was as those ethylene margins increased here, you had some wintertime activities that drove some of the cost to manufacture up in China. So you saw competing technologies like cold olefins, where coal prices were up $200 -- to $200 a ton, mainly because of a polar vortex and the fact that they were having some squabbles with the Australians about coal imports. So they weren't able to get it. We also saw LNG exports and LNG demand up sharply throughout Europe and also into Asia. And so that helped. Demand strength on top of the fact that you had these rising prices and inventory levels were low, really all came together to drive that. 
And by the way, demand still continues to look good in the first quarter, inventory levels are still low, operating rates are good. In the U.S. Gulf Coast, our operating rates were in the mid-90s in the fourth quarter. So we're going to continue to see, I think, good margins in the PE business."

We have a lot of electricity uses that are not for the crackers. And obviously, there, we're looking to alternatives, wind and solar, to replace current capacity. And those are cost competitive today. And so we've made a big move in that direction. We have about 580 megawatts of alternative energy under a contract. And we're increasing every year. Our goal is to have 750 megawatts or more by 2025. And I mentioned some of the sites on the script that will go through that. 
The second thing I would say is in the crackers, we're looking at a combination of things, not just electrification. We have a partnership with Shell going on right now to try to prove out electric cracking. That is a longer term development. In the near term, we're also working on a form of fluidized catalytic cracking to go from ethane to ethylene. I've talked about our FCDH process to make propylene out of propane. We're piloting that in Louisiana. That will be built this year and up and running next year. And we believe that can give us a 20% reduction at least in CO2 emissions and a very good scale technology. We can achieve economies of scale at maybe 150,000 tons per year kind of CapEx. 
If you look at what we're doing in parallel, we're looking at EDH. And that could have the potential to reduce our emissions by 40% or more, still using gas as a feedstock in the crackers or gas as a fuel and the crackers. So we've got several technologies that we're looking at, and we're also looking at blue hydrogen also as a way to try to get a more concentrated CO2 stream so that we can combine that with carbon capture and sequestration to be able to reduce carbon emissions."

That means ethane has been the crack, and so you don't have as many byproducts. And that's shortest bit on propylene. And then on purpose propylene, you've had a raft of issues on -- through -- on purpose propylene production, which has meant there hasn't been as much there. And so that has tightened things up. I think acrylates are holding up well because demand has been good -- downstream demand has been good. So there has been some price improvements. Do it yourself, architectural coatings are growing. In fact, they were the big winner last year in terms of market share. I expect the contractor side will come back this year. 
Howard, do you want to talk about the cash?"

It's hard to keep things on the shelves like mattresses and furniture, while we've got these strong housing drives that are going on. 
We are seeing the automotive sector come back. Obviously, we saw it big electric vehicles, we've set records in 2020, and I think we're going to crush those in 2021. But internal combustion engine vehicle is coming back as well. And that is good demand and strong order patterns, even without some of the bigger capital-intensive markets being back on stream. So like the large-scale industrial construction, those types of markets. So I think we're -- I think we've got a good demand at and ahead of us. Housing starts is a very, very solid sign, highest we've seen since 2006. So that drives a lot of content for our products."

Normal seasonality that we would typically see a strong second quarter but having said that, we go into first quarter this year with supply chains being relatively lean, very little inventories in almost all of them. And we've got strong demand going into the first quarter. So it feels like you have a first quarter, second quarter pretty strong season, and we typically see second quarter and into third quarter being the strongest part of the year. I think because of tightness, you're going to continue to see that. 
Secondly, last year, there was a lot of unplanned activities in things like polyethylene that took a lot of capacity off-line. This year, there's a lot of planned activity for turnarounds because of activity that didn't happen last year due to COVID. So you're going to have, on a planned basis, almost the same amount of capacity off-line as we did last year, before you ever get into any unplanned events. And those things, to me, a pretty strong start to 2021. And I'm optimistic that as the vaccination rates improve, we're going to start to see people return more to normal. And we certainly are making progress on getting people vaccinated.

We are taking advantage of -- we had some scheduled turnaround time in first quarter last year when the pandemic hit in China. We're actually completing that work right now in China. So that's got some siloxanes capacity offline. But because building and because the high-end personal care demand haven't been there, that's been okay. So we'll get those things done in this quarter. 
The other thing we've been doing is debottlenecking a lot of our downstream capacity. So we've done a lot of projects downstream to get our what we call our specialties business ready. And I think we're getting ahead of what will be some pent-up demand once we hit an inflection point on these vaccinations. Certainly, people are tired of being at home. They want to travel. They want to get back to life as normal, and that will open things up. And we're gearing up that we should see some of that in the second half of the year."

And in terms of the next 5 years, on a 100% Sadara basis, you're looking at about between $300 million and $350 million of interest expense.

But actually, we saw good performance around the globe, and it continues to tighten up. And we -- you noticed that MEG prices are also starting to rise. So that's really making things move there. We also saw a big step-up in Industrial Solutions. So they're running strong, and we've got new capacity coming to support their growth this year. We had less performance in siloxanes, and that's the one that has the big upside, which I talked about with Vincent's question in the second half. And then polyurethanes and construction chemicals got back to the 80-plus percent operating rate in the fourth quarter, and that continues into this year. 
So we still have upside to deliver. We are going to continue to run the assets hard. We have been spending on reliability to make sure that we can deliver more out of those assets. Texas 9 has been a stellar asset in terms of its production. And we've done a lot of work on debottlenecking and reliability in some of the other spaces.

Then I would say you got to take 2 deducts. There's about $50 million of higher turnaround spending sequentially, really related to the Zongjian plant in China in the siloxanes plant that Jim talked about in the prepared comments.

On the digital side, we'll spend about $150 million, but Sadara will be $350 million tailwind that -- as I talked about. The dividends from our JV companies will be down about $200 million just because we get those dividends from -- in about a year in arrears.

And then I would say, look, we had a number of nonoperating cash flows in 2020, and we're probably not going to be able to deliver the same number because that was a big number. We delivered $5 million of free cash flow out of this machine, which was the best performance since 2013 on an apples-to-apples basis as best you can construct it, but we will have additional tailwinds.

And should we think about M&A as an opportunity for you as we look forward? Or is the cash flow that you generate really just going to be going down to paying down debt and whatever is left over taking down the share count? How should we be thinking about that?"

Still, first and foremost, is safely and reliably operate the plants. That costs us about $1 billion a year. Continues to support that dividend, that's about $2 billion to $2.1 billion a year. We've got some further incremental deleveraging that we need to do in 2021, keep us on trajectory with what we've committed to the ratings agencies. We've got additional priorities to make sure that we're ready for the, I think, the pent-up demand that's coming as we reach these vaccination rates. So we've bumped up incremental growth CapEx. And as Howard said, we will have some cash to buy back shares toward the end of the year to cover dilution. Although if you look at our share count, we've been very steady since the spin. 
And now on top of that, to your point, most of the divestitures and the cash generation have been taking assets that are nonrevenue generating, where there are infrastructure companies out there today that value those and can use those as a growth platform and liberating those from our balance sheet, we'll continue to do that. On the other side, we will look at bolt-on M&A. We've talked about that being not in the billions, but smaller. And that's where we can bring in a technology or a gap in our platform and take advantage of our global footprint to really rapidly grow that as well as get that into our machine and get some economies of scale out of it. So those are some of the things we're looking at, and there are areas that are driven by the market trends that we're seeing on building and construction, mobility space, 5G, these are some of the areas where we want to continue to try to build in the areas of adhesives, sealants, coatings types applications."

And, of course, we saw such huge volatility in oil last year. Most of our feedstock is natural gas liquids. And gas production has been very resilient. And I think gas production is going to continue to be strong next year. We didn't see much of a decrease last year, maybe 10%, and we're already getting back to the levels that we had prior to the COVID pandemic. 
The other thing that people aren't forecasting in some of the natural gas outlooks is the fact that there are so many drilled and uncompleted wells out there, and companies are moving up the learning curve on being able to get those wells completed. And so I think that's going to bring back a lot of supply in the back half of the year. Even with that ethylene tightness I talked about, even with propane going up because of wintertime and even with naphtha going up because you didn't have as much refining capacity, the reality was ethane was still in supply, even at 75%, 1 million BTU crack spread. And I think it's going to continue to stay that way, that natural gas production is going to bring back more ethane to get split out here. 
So I feel good about our position. We have the capability to capture that better than anybody in the industry. And I think we're in for a year ahead where our view, natural gas is kind of range bound and $3, 1 million BTU is probably the high end."

When we started this journey, I think you guys have laid out a plan to return about 65% of your free cash flow to shareholders. So maybe you can just comment on what you think about free cash flow for '21, and why not allocate a little bit more to the capital return side, the buyback side, do you see free cash flow above that $5 billion?

We hope that you, your families are healthy and safe. Starting on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, the Dow team delivered results that exceeded expectations with sales and EBIT growth year-over-y",1138,"Thank you, Colleen, and thanks to everyone for joining us. We hope that you, your families are healthy and safe. 
Starting on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, the Dow team delivered results that exceeded expectations with sales and EBIT growth year-over-year and a sequential net sales increase of 10%. And as the global economy and market fundamentals continue to improve, demand drove volumes above or in line with pre-COVID levels across all operating segments. We captured strong durable goods in construction demand, we grew volumes in do-it-yourself architectural coatings and home care sectors, and we continue to benefit from solid demand and pricing momentum in packaging applications, supporting a sequential net sales increase of 12% in our Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment. 
This volume increase, combined with improved pricing and margins, particularly in polyethylene and polyurethane applications, delivered 5% revenue growth and higher operating EBIT year-over-year. We supported these strong top line results with a cash flow conversion of 93% in the quarter, driving our full year rate up 30% versus 2019. Cash from continuing operations was $1.7 billion in the quarter, and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Working capital was a $236 million source of cash, even with increased sales. 
We completed the sale of select U.S. Gulf Coast marine and terminal operations and assets, delivering another strategic nonoperational cash lever. And improved financial and operational performance at Sadara was a key contributor in delivering positive year-over-year equity earnings. We also maintained our disciplined approach to capital allocation, completing additional deleveraging as we reduced net debt by $837 million in the quarter. And we continue to reward our shareholders through our industry leading dividend. Overall, our fourth quarter performance was a strong finish to a year where team Dow successfully overcame significant macroeconomic and other external challenges. 
On Slide 4 is a brief recap of our full year achievements. We adapted quickly to the global pandemic and our agile approach to managing volatility in the markets, combined with our prudent adjustments to capital expenditures, proactive cost reductions, working capital interventions, plus delivery of unique cash levers supported demand growth year-over-year in packaging applications, a nearly $500 million structural improvement in working capital, a strong uplift in cash flow from operations, free cash flow of $5 billion and more than $2.6 billion in net debt reduction and continued cash returns to shareholders through our industry leading dividend. 
We achieved all this, while also making significant progress toward our ambition to be the most innovative customer-centric, inclusive and sustainable materials science company in the world. We found new ways to serve customers in a virtual world, we launched Dow's MobilityScience platform to better serve an attractive market vertical, we reinforced Dow's commitment to inclusion and diversity through a bold framework to address systemic racism and inequality and followed through with actions aligned to that framework, and we launched new aggressive targets to help eliminate plastic waste and reduce carbon emissions. I am incredibly proud of how the Dow team delivered solid performance and showed tremendous leadership on critical issues throughout 2020. 
Moving to our segment performance on Slide 5. As I mentioned earlier, ongoing improvements in the macroenvironment drove sequential sales gains across all segments and geographies, allowing us to reach year-over-year revenue growth during the quarter for the first time since the start of the pandemic. 
In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $780 million, up more than $130 million versus the same quarter last year and sequentially. Resilient demand, tight market supply, low inventory levels and disciplined price volume management enabled strong polyethylene pricing momentum and margin expansion. Notably, operating EBIT margins expanded 180 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially. Compared to the prior quarter, net sales increased 12%. Price gains continued across all regions and most applications, particularly in consumer packaging, and the business delivered higher volumes with broad-based demand growth. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business continued to see strong momentum through the end of the year. Sales were up year-over-year, primarily driven by steady volumes and improved polyethylene pricing, particularly in food and specialty packaging as well as health and hygiene applications. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered local price gains in all regions, including double-digit gains in the U.S., Canada and Latin America. 
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT was $296 million, up $75 million year-over-year and up $192 million versus the prior quarter. Supply and demand fundamentals in polyurethanes and construction chemicals as well as higher equity earnings from improved performance at Sadara drove this result. On a sequential basis, significant improvement in margin over raw materials drove operating EBIT margins up more than 500 basis points, more than offsetting typical seasonality. The polyurethane and construction and chemicals business reported a double-digit increase in net sales year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher local prices with gains in all regions, except Latin America. Compared to the prior quarter, sales growth was driven by strong local pricing and furniture, bedding and appliance end markets. 
The Industrial Solutions business reported flat net sales versus the prior year period. Currency tailwinds and higher volumes in solvents for coatings, industrial fluids, electronics and pharma applications were offset by pricing in industrial manufacturing applications. Compared to the prior quarter, net sales were up double digits due to sequential improvement in price and volume as industrial markets continued to recover and consumer end markets remained strong. 
And finally, the Performance Materials and Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $50 million, down year-over-year. Volume growth in downstream silicones and coatings applications was more than offset by price and volume declines in siloxanes. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT was down $25 million as margin expansion in silicon applications was overcome by seasonality in coatings end markets. 
The Consumer Solutions business reported a decline in net sales. The business captured solid demand growth in home care, consumer and electronics and high-performance building applications. These gains were more than offset by continued weak volumes in upstream siloxanes and in high-end personal care applications, such as cosmetics, as a result of paused social and workplace activities. On a sequential basis, volumes improved on recovery in mobility and transportation as well as consumer and electronics and markets. 
The Coatings & Performance Monomers business achieved higher net sales year-over-year, with volumes up double digits. The seasonality impact was moderate, and the business captured resilient demand for architectural coatings as consumers continue to focus on do-it-yourself projects at home. Sequentially, the business also experienced positive pricing momentum, particularly in acrylates, which was more than offset by seasonal weather-related declines for coatings applications in the Northern Hemisphere. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Howard for an update on Sadara, our financial outlook and our plans for digital acceleration."

The strong supply and demand trends that continue to benefit our packaging and polyurethanes businesses this quarter also benefited Sadara. The joint venture again delivered improved financial and operational results, driving equity earnings higher by more than $130 million year-over-year. 
We expect solid market fundamentals and an improving economy to continue to benefit the joint venture in 2021, supported by Sadara's feedstock flexibility and enhanced global cost curve position. We are also very pleased to report that Sadara declared project completion in the fourth quarter, removing Dow's $4 billion share of the guarantees that supported the joint venture's debt. In addition, in January of this year, Dow, Saudi Aramco and Sadara reached an agreement in principle with the remaining lenders  and sukuk investors on key terms for its debt reprofiling with formal agreements expected to be completed within the first quarter. As a result, Sadara is expected to be cash flow self-sufficient going forward. 
Key provisions of the reprofiling include an extension of the contractual debt maturity from 2029 to 2038; a modified repayment schedule aligned with Sadara's projected cash generation profile, including a grace period until June 2026, during which interest-only payments are required; no upfront payments of principal; and limited support in the form of much lower sponsor guarantees of Sadara's reprofiled debt, in proportion of the sponsor's ownership interest. The impact to Dow's commitments are expected to include the following, which are in proportion to Dow's 35% ownership interest in Sadara. Dow will provide guarantees for $1.3 billion of Sadara's debt, effectively replacing approximately $4 billion of prior guarantees. Dow will provide guarantees for its portion of Sadara interest payments due during the grace period. Our pro rata share of any potential shortfall, which based on Sadara's current performance, we do not expect will be funded by a new $500 million revolving facility in Sadara, guaranteed by Dow. This is expected to be established in the first quarter of 2021. 
And finally, Dow's existing $220 million letter of credit related to the guarantee of one future Sadara debt service payment will also be canceled. As a result of these actions, the company does not expect to provide any further shareholder loans or equity contributions to Sadara. 
Let's now turn to our modeling guidance for first quarter on Slide 7. We exited the fourth quarter with increasing strength, which is carried over into the first quarter. The ISM manufacturing new orders index is trending at its highest level in 10 years. In addition, low interest rates are supporting a resilient housing market and deurbanization trends are driving U.S. housing starts to their highest point since 2006. We expect sequentially higher business results in the first quarter with total sales in the range of $10.7 billion to $11.2 billion, driven by ongoing strength in our polyethylene and polyurethane value chains, improvement in our silicones franchise and supported by our U.S. Gulf Coast ethane advantage. We will see some headwinds sequentially with higher turnaround costs and the reversal of approximately $50 million in onetime benefits from the prior quarter. 
In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we entered the year with good pricing momentum, continued solid demand and elevated breakeven points for high cost naphtha producers as a result of increasing oil prices. We expect these dynamics to be sustained through the quarter. 
The Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment will continue to benefit from strong consumer durables demand, supported by automotive and housing sectors and improvement in industrial end markets. These trends, combined with industry supply limitations and low inventories, should support pricing uplift, although we do see some cost increases from rising propylene pricing as well. 
And finally, for Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect silicones to benefit from ongoing demand expansion in consumer end markets, particularly in electronics, home care and mobility, where our innovation advantages will continue to allow us to capture additional growth opportunities. In Coatings, we expect DIY demand to remain elevated through the first quarter as consumer home improvement trends continue. There will be some turnaround headwinds in the quarter, including completion of a turnaround at our siloxane plant in China that we shortened in the first half of 2020 due to COVID-related labor and supply issues. 
Turning to Slide 8. Looking at the full year, we see strong market fundamentals in many of our key value chains continuing to drive improved operating performance year-over-year. And although we expect the pace of recovery to moderate, it is still likely to be uneven quarter-to-quarter as the vaccine distribution and new strains evolve. As usual, we're providing you with our best full year estimates of several income statement and cash flow items, which are noted on the slide. 
Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, and based on our improved forward outlook versus 2020, we're increasing our capital expenditure target year-over-year to $1.6 billion, and we're targeting an additional $1 billion in deleveraging. Sadara, as previously mentioned, will be a $350 million tailwind for the year with no planned cash contributions. We expect equity earnings to be flat year-over-year as the margin resiliency we see across the portfolio is offset by higher planned JV turnaround expenses. Total turnaround spending will be up versus the prior year as we continue to ensure the reliability of our facilities. And as mentioned last year, we expect our $300 million EBITDA restructuring program to be substantially complete by year-end. We're also providing a share count estimate for the year. However, assuming a sustained EBITDA improvement, we will look at reinstituting our share buyback program later in the year for the purpose of covering dilution. And finally, we expect a full year tax rate in the 23% to 27% range. 
Moving to Slide 9. The events of 2020 provided an opportunity for us to rapidly accelerate our focus on the value of digitalization. Through our digital advances and capabilities, we were able to continue innovating, improving the customer experience, and optimizing our operations. It has become clear that the escalation of digital interactions and transactions driven by COVID-19 will only help us accelerate the delivery of our ambition and be an important part of our customer experience in the future. 
So building on this solid foundation, today, we're announcing plans to further advance our digitalization efforts by investing in 3 key areas: First, expanding digital tools like machine learning and advanced digital modeling to accelerate material science innovation and put innovation capabilities directly in the hands of our customers; second, further enhancing our e-commerce buying and fulfillment experience for our customers; and third, adopting additional real-time digital manufacturing insights, operational data intelligence and demand sensing, all to enhance the productivity and reliability of our operations. 
We expect these actions to deliver more than $300 million in incremental annual run rate EBITDA generation by year-end 2025 with an additional onetime $100 million improvement in structural working capital efficiencies. To realize these gains, we will spend approximately $400 million over the next 2 years with an attractive risk-adjusted return on investment exceeding our internal hurdle rate and an expected payback of less than 3 years. 
Our goal is clear, our digital acceleration will help us continue to transform how we work, and importantly, how we engage with our customers. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."
9830660,701618547,2184104,"Dow Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Dow Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Howard, and please turn with me to Slide 10. For more than 3 decades, sustainability has been an imperative to our business.

For more than 3 decades, sustainability has been an imperative to our business. And last year, we announced new breakthrough targets focused on reducing our carbon footprint and addressing plastic waste. We see these targets as a catalyst for growth and innovation. We've discussed with you our progress on key initiatives to advance the circular economy for plastics. And today, we want to provide visibility on our comprehensive approach to reducing carbon emissions. 
Over the past 15 years, Dow has reduced our overall emissions by 15%, while growing our business. And we see a viable pathway to reduce our net annual carbon emissions by another 15% by 2030. This pathway begins with targeting further efficiencies and optimization at our sites, sourcing renewable energy and clean power, and implementing new emission management technologies. We're working with utilities and regulators to supply clean purchase power to a majority of Dow sites by 2030. We're making good progress. 
Last year, we increased our agreements to purchase cost competitive renewable energy in Kentucky, Texas, Brazil and Spain, and we're preparing for the full transition of our Terneuzen operations. We're also working to optimize the energy efficiency of our sites by lowering our energy use and developing breakthrough technologies, such as electric, ethylene steam crackers, carbon capture and sequestration, and the potential use of blue hydrogen. Dow could be among the first in the industry to do so by 2030. We recognize that achieving these goals will also require partnerships with governments, regulatory agencies and other external groups to support the economics of these technologies and evolve regulatory frameworks to focus on emissions reduction. 
Widespread support for decarbonizing emissions is driving demand across the value chain, and Dow is well placed to continue to lead and benefit from this evolution. Many Dow products lower our customers' emissions more than the carbon emissions used to produce them, like enabling lighter, safer and more fuel-efficient automobiles; more energy-efficient buildings; and food that stays safe and fresh longer, all critical for a world set to add 2 billion people by 2050. 
Ultimately, Dow wins by making our cost to implement this transition lower than our competitors and the value of our products higher. Our objective is to establish a resilient portfolio of lower carbon footprint products to meet rising demand, capture market share and grow value, while reducing emissions for Dow, our customers, and the planet. 
Moving to Slide 11. As we look to 2021 and beyond, we are well positioned to capture additional value growth. Throughout the pandemic, new consumer behaviors emerge that have driven strong demand for our products, and we expect these trends to continue benefiting Dow's consumer-led portfolio even as the pandemic diminishes. Consumers have become accustomed to new ways of purchasing and interacting. Increased in-home delivery and takeout dining, paired with heightened awareness of food hygiene and security will sustain demand strength for food and consumer packaging. The resilient housing market is creating higher demand for durable goods, such as furniture and appliances, and more time at home also leads to consumer spending on home improvement, including do-it-yourself coatings. Ongoing public caution about COVID-19, even after widespread vaccine distribution, will support continued demand for health and hygiene applications. We also believe that as vaccination rates increase and we turn the corner on the pandemic, there will be improving demand as travel, entertainment, sports and construction industries and other social activities return to normal. 
Market indicators are showing above-GDP growth across several sectors, and as a result, we're beginning to see economic recovery broaden across our portfolio and in many of the end markets that we serve, which is benefiting our higher-margin Consumer Solutions business. Similarly, this increased confidence is also improving demand in our functional polymers portfolio, which serves mobility, infrastructure, and construction sectors. 
Finally, as we look ahead, Dow's unmatched materials science portfolio is uniquely positioned to address global megatrends and shifting post-COVID trends, providing additional higher-margin growth opportunities for Dow. 
Dow solutions meet increasing consumer needs for new sustainable innovations, such as post-consumer recycled plastics and renewable energy-made polyethylene. In 2020, we tripled sales of product made with renewable bio-based feedstocks. As the need for renewable energy increases globally, so will demand for Dow solutions that enable wind power and solar production facilities. Our heat transfer fluids are used in more than 40 large-scale concentrated solar power plants around the world. And through our DowAksa joint venture, we provide polyurethane, carbon fiber systems that deliver a stronger and lighter composite material for wind blades. 
Electric vehicle sales are on the rise with 2021 growth projections exceeding 2020 records. And our MobilityScience platform focuses on delivering innovative products to enhance automobile connectivity, light-weighting, comfort, safety and sustainability. 
Lastly, we see meaningful opportunities to support the rollout of 5G broadband networks. For example, last year, we launched new high-performance thermal gel that promotes both environmental sustainability and efficient assembly of essential 5G infrastructure. 
Underpinning these tailwinds are the global foundational advantages and discipline that set Dow apart. Our unmatched portfolio, global scale, low-cost structure and industry-leading feedstock flexibility give us a competitive edge. Further, the actions that we took in 2020 to bolster our financial position, including the execution of our restructuring program and our disciplined focus on cash generation provides the financial strength and flexibility to support our growth trajectory in line with our financial and operating playbook. 
To close, 2020 was a challenging year for our world. But I could not be more proud of team Dow's performance nor could I be more confident in our future. Dow's competitive advantages are clear, we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us and the actions that we've taken position us to outperform our peers. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Colleen to open up the Q&A."

And toward the end of the year, we saw ethylene start to tighten up and ethylene margins improve. And so that led to some pretty sharp increases in the fourth quarter. You saw PE margins were up in the fourth quarter, about $0.07 a pound in the U.S., about $0.13 in Europe, and up about $0.10 in Asia. 
I think the other thing that happened was as those ethylene margins increased here, you had some wintertime activities that drove some of the cost to manufacture up in China. So you saw competing technologies like cold olefins, where coal prices were up $200 -- to $200 a ton, mainly because of a polar vortex and the fact that they were having some squabbles with the Australians about coal imports. So they weren't able to get it. We also saw LNG exports and LNG demand up sharply throughout Europe and also into Asia. And so that helped. Demand strength on top of the fact that you had these rising prices and inventory levels were low, really all came together to drive that. 
And by the way, demand still continues to look good in the first quarter, inventory levels are still low, operating rates are good. In the U.S. Gulf Coast, our operating rates were in the mid-90s in the fourth quarter. So we're going to continue to see, I think, good margins in the PE business."

We have a lot of electricity uses that are not for the crackers. And obviously, there, we're looking to alternatives, wind and solar, to replace current capacity. And those are cost competitive today. And so we've made a big move in that direction. We have about 580 megawatts of alternative energy under a contract. And we're increasing every year. Our goal is to have 750 megawatts or more by 2025. And I mentioned some of the sites on the script that will go through that. 
The second thing I would say is in the crackers, we're looking at a combination of things, not just electrification. We have a partnership with Shell going on right now to try to prove out electric cracking. That is a longer term development. In the near term, we're also working on a form of fluidized catalytic cracking to go from ethane to ethylene. I've talked about our FCDH process to make propylene out of propane. We're piloting that in Louisiana. That will be built this year and up and running next year. And we believe that can give us a 20% reduction at least in CO2 emissions and a very good scale technology. We can achieve economies of scale at maybe 150,000 tons per year kind of CapEx. 
If you look at what we're doing in parallel, we're looking at EDH. And that could have the potential to reduce our emissions by 40% or more, still using gas as a feedstock in the crackers or gas as a fuel in the crackers. So we've got several technologies that we're looking at, and we're also looking at blue hydrogen also as a way to try to get a more concentrated CO2 stream so that we can combine that with carbon capture and sequestration to be able to reduce carbon emissions."

Spot prices have increased. And it's a combination of reduced supply because ethane has been the preferred crack in the crackers and propane has been much more expensive, again due to that polar vortex I was talking about in Europe and Asia, driving these prices up. That means ethane has been the crack, and so you don't have as many byproducts. And that's shortest bit on propylene. And then on purpose propylene, you've had a raft of issues on -- through -- on purpose propylene production, which has meant there hasn't been as much there. And so that has tightened things up. I think acrylates are holding up well because demand has been good -- downstream demand has been good. So there has been some price improvements. Do-it-yourself, architectural coatings are growing. In fact, they were the big winner last year in terms of market share. I expect the contractor side will come back this year.

It's hard to keep things on the shelves like mattresses and furniture, while we've got these strong housing drives that are going on. 
We are seeing the automotive sector come back. Obviously, we saw it big in electric vehicles, we've set records in 2020, and I think we're going to crush those in 2021. But internal combustion engine vehicle is coming back as well. And that is good demand and strong order patterns, even without some of the bigger capital-intensive markets being back on stream.

Normal seasonality that we would typically see a strong second quarter but having said that, we go into first quarter this year with supply chains being relatively lean, very little inventories in almost all of them. And we've got strong demand going into the first quarter. So it feels like you have a first quarter, second quarter pretty strong season, and we typically see second quarter and into third quarter being the strongest part of the year. I think because of tightness, you're going to continue to see that. 
Secondly, last year, there was a lot of unplanned activities in things like polyethylene that took a lot of capacity off-line. This year, there's a lot of planned activity for turnarounds because of activity that didn't happen last year due to COVID. So you're going to have, on a planned basis, almost the same amount of capacity off-line as we did last year, before you ever get into any unplanned events. And those things, to me, mean a pretty strong start to 2021. And I'm optimistic that as the vaccination rates improve, we're going to start to see people return more to normal.

And I do think personal care will come back. I think it will come back probably up 4%. 
We are taking advantage of -- we had some scheduled turnaround time in first quarter last year when the pandemic hit in China. We're actually completing that work right now in China. So that's got some siloxanes capacity offline. But because building and because the high-end personal care demand haven't been there, that's been okay. So we'll get those things done in this quarter. 
The other thing we've been doing is debottlenecking a lot of our downstream capacity. So we've done a lot of projects downstream to get our what we call our specialties business ready.

We also saw a big step-up in Industrial Solutions. So they're running strong, and we've got new capacity coming to support their growth this year. We had less performance in siloxanes, and that's the one that has the big upside, which I talked about with Vincent's question in the second half.

So we still have upside to deliver. We are going to continue to run the assets hard. We have been spending on reliability to make sure that we can deliver more out of those assets.

China's had some pretty high export levels. And so some empty containers have been moving back to China. Mostly that's been reported in the ag sector, not so much in the plastic sector. I think our supply chains are pretty well stocked in terms of containers, but we keep a close eye on it. So I don't anticipate anything that's long-lasting. I think we'll work through this. 
And they just assigned some of the supply chain imbalances. China came back fast from COVID, and we're coming back now. And so things can, from time to time, get dislocated."

And then it seems supply-demand fundamentals, ethylene, polyethylene, MDI-wise, should tighten up through the course of 2021. You were alluding to how the turnaround schedule for spring and summer for most of these products is pretty heavy, right? And there seems to be a perception that in the back half of the year, as the vaccine rollout happens, people hit the streets more and the like, oil prices go up higher. So I mean, as I sort of piece together all these things, it seems 2021 earnings could be significantly higher than 2020. I mean, am I missing something here?

Then I would say you got to take 2 deducts. There's about $50 million of higher turnaround spending sequentially, really related to the Zongjian plant in China in the siloxanes plant that Jim talked about in the prepared comments. And then there was about $50 million of onetime items that we had in fourth quarter that won't recur. A couple of land sales as well as an IPO that happened that we were able to monetize in or out of our venture capital. 
So overall, earnings are going to be up sequentially, and your point is right. They should be up year-on-year. I think the open question, and Jim, maybe give some comments on the back half of the year. But all things right now are pointing up."

So CapEx is going to be $350 million higher. Mandatory pension will be flat. The restructuring program will be about a $350 million cash outflow, but we won't have any outflow. We finished the DowDuPont separation. So that -- those basically offset each other. 
On the digital side, we'll spend about $150 million, but Sadara will be $350 million tailwind that -- as I talked about. The dividends from our JV companies will be down about $200 million just because we get those dividends from -- in about a year in arrears. So with earnings down in 2020, we'll see dividends down in 2021, but that should reverse in 2022. 
And then I would say, look, we had a number of nonoperating cash flows in 2020, and we're probably not going to be able to deliver the same number because that was a big number. We delivered $5 million of free cash flow out of this machine, which was the best performance since 2013 on an apples-to-apples basis as best you can construct it, but we will have additional tailwinds. So we are working on additional structural improvements in working capital. In the fourth quarter, you saw some of that shine through. We had working capital be a source of cash, even though sales was up, which is hard to do. So we'll look to get another $250 million or $300 million of structural improvement in working capital. We still have the top-up payment from the second Nova litigation. That's still going through the court. So we'll see if that's a 2021 event, but that should still be several hundred million dollars. And then we're still working on best owner lens that don't sail. So I don't have a number for you.

Still, first and foremost, is safely and reliably operate the plants. That costs us about $1 billion a year. Continues to support that dividend, that's about $2 billion to $2.1 billion a year. We've got some further incremental deleveraging that we need to do in 2021, keep us on trajectory with what we've committed to the ratings agencies. We've got additional priorities to make sure that we're ready for the, I think, the pent-up demand that's coming as we reach these vaccination rates. So we've bumped up incremental growth CapEx. And as Howard said, we will have some cash to buy back shares toward the end of the year to cover dilution. Although if you look at our share count, we've been very steady since the spin. 
And now on top of that, to your point, most of the divestitures and the cash generation have been taking assets that are nonrevenue generating, where there are infrastructure companies out there today that value those and can use those as a growth platform and liberating those from our balance sheet, we'll continue to do that. On the other side, we will look at bolt-on M&A. We've talked about that being not in the billions, but smaller. And that's where we can bring in a technology or a gap in our platform and take advantage of our global footprint to really rapidly grow that as well as get that into our machine and get some economies of scale out of it. So those are some of the things we're looking at, and there are areas that are driven by the market trends that we're seeing on building and construction, mobility space, 5G, these are some of the areas where we want to continue to try to build in the areas of adhesives, sealants, coatings types applications."

And, of course, we saw such huge volatility in oil last year. Most of our feedstock is natural gas liquids. And gas production has been very resilient. And I think gas production is going to continue to be strong next year. We didn't see much of a decrease last year, maybe 10%, and we're already getting back to the levels that we had prior to the COVID pandemic. 
The other thing that people aren't forecasting in some of the natural gas outlooks is the fact that there are so many drilled and uncompleted wells out there, and companies are moving up the learning curve on being able to get those wells completed. And so I think that's going to bring back a lot of supply in the back half of the year. Even with that ethylene tightness I talked about, even with propane going up because of wintertime and even with naphtha going up because you didn't have as much refining capacity, the reality was ethane was still in supply, even at 75%, 1 million BTU crack spread. And I think it's going to continue to stay that way, that natural gas production is going to bring back more ethane to get split out here. 
So I feel good about our position. We have the capability to capture that better than anybody in the industry. And I think we're in for a year ahead where our view, natural gas is kind of range bound and $3 1 million BTU is probably the high end."

We hope that you, your families are healthy and safe. Starting on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, the Dow team delivered results that exceeded expectations with sales and EBIT growth year-over-y",1136,"Thank you, Colleen, and thanks to everyone for joining us. We hope that you, your families are healthy and safe. 
Starting on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, the Dow team delivered results that exceeded expectations with sales and EBIT growth year-over-year and a sequential net sales increase of 10%. And as the global economy and market fundamentals continue to improve, demand drove volumes above or in line with pre-COVID levels across all operating segments. We captured strong durable goods in construction demand, we grew volumes in do-it-yourself architectural coatings and home care sectors, and we continue to benefit from solid demand and pricing momentum in packaging applications, supporting a sequential net sales increase of 12% in our Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment. 
This volume increase, combined with improved pricing and margins, particularly in polyethylene and polyurethane applications, delivered 5% revenue growth and higher operating EBIT year-over-year. We supported these strong top line results with a cash flow conversion of 93% in the quarter, driving our full year rate up 30% versus 2019. Cash from continuing operations was $1.7 billion in the quarter, and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Working capital was a $236 million source of cash, even with increased sales. 
We completed the sale of select U.S. Gulf Coast marine and terminal operations and assets, delivering another strategic nonoperational cash lever. And improved financial and operational performance at Sadara was a key contributor in delivering positive year-over-year equity earnings. We also maintained our disciplined approach to capital allocation, completing additional deleveraging as we reduced net debt by $837 million in the quarter. And we continue to reward our shareholders through our industry-leading dividend. Overall, our fourth quarter performance was a strong finish to a year where team Dow successfully overcame significant macroeconomic and other external challenges. 
On Slide 4 is a brief recap of our full year achievements. We adapted quickly to the global pandemic and our agile approach to managing volatility in the markets, combined with our prudent adjustments to capital expenditures, proactive cost reductions, working capital interventions, plus delivery of unique cash levers supported demand growth year-over-year in packaging applications, a nearly $500 million structural improvement in working capital, a strong uplift in cash flow from operations, free cash flow of $5 billion and more than $2.6 billion in net debt reduction and continued cash returns to shareholders through our industry-leading dividend. 
We achieved all this, while also making significant progress toward our ambition to be the most innovative customer-centric, inclusive and sustainable materials science company in the world. We found new ways to serve customers in a virtual world, we launched Dow's MobilityScience platform to better serve an attractive market vertical, we reinforced Dow's commitment to inclusion and diversity through a bold framework to address systemic racism and inequality and followed through with actions aligned to that framework, and we launched new aggressive targets to help eliminate plastic waste and reduce carbon emissions. I am incredibly proud of how the Dow team delivered solid performance and showed tremendous leadership on critical issues throughout 2020. 
Moving to our segment performance on Slide 5. As I mentioned earlier, ongoing improvements in the macroenvironment drove sequential sales gains across all segments and geographies, allowing us to reach year-over-year revenue growth during the quarter for the first time since the start of the pandemic. 
In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $780 million, up more than $130 million versus the same quarter last year and sequentially. Resilient demand, tight market supply, low inventory levels and disciplined price volume management enabled strong polyethylene pricing momentum and margin expansion. Notably, operating EBIT margins expanded 180 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially. Compared to the prior quarter, net sales increased 12%. Price gains continued across all regions and most applications, particularly in consumer packaging, and the business delivered higher volumes with broad-based demand growth. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business continued to see strong momentum through the end of the year. Sales were up year-over-year, primarily driven by steady volumes and improved polyethylene pricing, particularly in food and specialty packaging as well as health and hygiene applications. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered local price gains in all regions, including double-digit gains in the U.S., Canada and Latin America. 
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT was $296 million, up $75 million year-over-year and up $192 million versus the prior quarter. Supply and demand fundamentals in polyurethanes and construction chemicals as well as higher equity earnings from improved performance at Sadara drove this result. On a sequential basis, significant improvement in margin over raw materials drove operating EBIT margins up more than 500 basis points, more than offsetting typical seasonality. The polyurethane and construction and chemicals business reported a double-digit increase in net sales year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher local prices with gains in all regions, except Latin America. Compared to the prior quarter, sales growth was driven by strong local pricing and furniture, bedding and appliance end markets. 
The Industrial Solutions business reported flat net sales versus the prior year period. Currency tailwinds and higher volumes in solvents for coatings, industrial fluids, electronics and pharma applications were offset by pricing in industrial manufacturing applications. Compared to the prior quarter, net sales were up double digits due to sequential improvement in price and volume as industrial markets continued to recover and consumer end markets remained strong. 
And finally, the Performance Materials and Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $50 million, down year-over-year. Volume growth in downstream silicones and coatings applications was more than offset by price and volume declines in siloxanes. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT was down $25 million as margin expansion in silicon applications was overcome by seasonality in coatings end markets. 
The Consumer Solutions business reported a decline in net sales. The business captured solid demand growth in home care, consumer and electronics and high-performance building applications. These gains were more than offset by continued weak volumes in upstream siloxanes and in high-end personal care applications, such as cosmetics, as a result of paused social and workplace activities. On a sequential basis, volumes improved on recovery in mobility and transportation as well as consumer and electronics and markets. 
The Coatings & Performance Monomers business achieved higher net sales year-over-year, with volumes up double digits. The seasonality impact was moderate, and the business captured resilient demand for architectural coatings as consumers continue to focus on do-it-yourself projects at home. Sequentially, the business also experienced positive pricing momentum, particularly in acrylates, which was more than offset by seasonal weather-related declines for coatings applications in the Northern Hemisphere. 
And now I'll turn it over to Howard for an update on Sadara, our financial outlook and our plans for digital acceleration."

The strong supply and demand trends that continue to benefit our packaging and polyurethanes businesses this quarter also benefited Sadara. The joint venture again delivered improved financial and operational results, driving equity earnings higher by more than $130 million year-over-year. 
We expect solid market fundamentals and an improving economy to continue to benefit the joint venture in 2021, supported by Sadara's feedstock flexibility and enhanced global cost curve position. We are also very pleased to report that Sadara declared project completion in the fourth quarter, removing Dow's $4 billion share of the guarantees that supported the joint venture's debt. In addition, in January of this year, Dow, Saudi Aramco and Sadara reached an agreement in principle with the remaining lenders and sukuk investors on key terms for its debt reprofiling with formal agreements expected to be completed within the first quarter. As a result, Sadara is expected to be cash flow self-sufficient going forward. 
Key provisions of the reprofiling include an extension of the contractual debt maturity from 2029 to 2038; a modified repayment schedule aligned with Sadara's projected cash generation profile, including a grace period until June 2026, during which interest-only payments are required; no upfront payments of principal; and limited support in the form of much lower sponsor guarantees of Sadara's reprofiled debt, in proportion of the sponsor's ownership interest. The impact to Dow's commitments are expected to include the following, which are in proportion to Dow's 35% ownership interest in Sadara. Dow will provide guarantees for $1.3 billion of Sadara's debt, effectively replacing approximately $4 billion of prior guarantees. Dow will provide guarantees for its portion of Sadara interest payments due during the grace period. Our pro rata share of any potential shortfall, which based on Sadara's current performance, we do not expect will be funded by a new $500 million revolving facility in Sadara, guaranteed by Dow. This is expected to be established in the first quarter of 2021. 
And finally, Dow's existing $220 million letter of credit related to the guarantee of one future Sadara debt service payment will also be canceled. As a result of these actions, the company does not expect to provide any further shareholder loans or equity contributions to Sadara. 
Let's now turn to our modeling guidance for first quarter on Slide 7. We exited the fourth quarter with increasing strength, which is carried over into the first quarter. The ISM manufacturing new orders index is trending at its highest level in 10 years. In addition, low interest rates are supporting a resilient housing market and deurbanization trends are driving U.S. housing starts to their highest point since 2006. We expect sequentially higher business results in the first quarter with total sales in the range of $10.7 billion to $11.2 billion, driven by ongoing strength in our polyethylene and polyurethane value chains, improvement in our silicones franchise and supported by our U.S. Gulf Coast ethane advantage. We will see some headwinds sequentially with higher turnaround costs and the reversal of approximately $50 million in onetime benefits from the prior quarter. 
In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we entered the year with good pricing momentum, continued solid demand and elevated breakeven points for high cost naphtha producers as a result of increasing oil prices. We expect these dynamics to be sustained through the quarter. 
The Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment will continue to benefit from strong consumer durables demand, supported by automotive and housing sectors and improvement in industrial end markets. These trends, combined with industry supply limitations and low inventories, should support pricing uplift, although we do see some cost increases from rising propylene pricing as well. 
And finally, for Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect silicones to benefit from ongoing demand expansion in consumer end markets, particularly in electronics, home care and mobility, where our innovation advantages will continue to allow us to capture additional growth opportunities. In Coatings, we expect DIY demand to remain elevated through the first quarter as consumer home improvement trends continue. There will be some turnaround headwinds in the quarter, including completion of a turnaround at our siloxane plant in China that we shortened in the first half of 2020 due to COVID-related labor and supply issues. 
Turning to Slide 8. Looking at the full year, we see strong market fundamentals in many of our key value chains continuing to drive improved operating performance year-over-year. And although we expect the pace of recovery to moderate, it is still likely to be uneven quarter-to-quarter as the vaccine distribution and new strains evolve. As usual, we're providing you with our best full year estimates of several income statement and cash flow items, which are noted on the slide. 
Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, and based on our improved forward outlook versus 2020, we're increasing our capital expenditure target year-over-year to $1.6 billion, and we're targeting an additional $1 billion in deleveraging. Sadara, as previously mentioned, will be a $350 million tailwind for the year with no planned cash contributions. We expect equity earnings to be flat year-over-year as the margin resiliency we see across the portfolio is offset by higher planned JV turnaround expenses. Total turnaround spending will be up versus the prior year as we continue to ensure the reliability of our facilities. And as mentioned last year, we expect our $300 million EBITDA restructuring program to be substantially complete by year-end. We're also providing a share count estimate for the year. However, assuming a sustained EBITDA improvement, we will look at reinstituting our share buyback program later in the year for the purpose of covering dilution. And finally, we expect a full year tax rate in the 23% to 27% range. 
Moving to Slide 9. The events of 2020 provided an opportunity for us to rapidly accelerate our focus on the value of digitalization. Through our digital advances and capabilities, we were able to continue innovating, improving the customer experience, and optimizing our operations. It has become clear that the escalation of digital interactions and transactions driven by COVID-19 will only help us accelerate the delivery of our ambition and be an important part of our customer experience in the future. 
So building on this solid foundation, today, we're announcing plans to further advance our digitalization efforts by investing in 3 key areas: First, expanding digital tools like machine learning and advanced digital modeling to accelerate material science innovation and put innovation capabilities directly in the hands of our customers; second, further enhancing our e-commerce buying and fulfillment experience for our customers; and third, adopting additional real-time digital manufacturing insights, operational data intelligence and demand sensing, all to enhance the productivity and reliability of our operations. 
We expect these actions to deliver more than $300 million in incremental annual run rate EBITDA generation by year-end 2025 with an additional onetime $100 million improvement in structural working capital efficiencies. To realize these gains, we will spend approximately $400 million over the next 2 years with an attractive risk-adjusted return on investment exceeding our internal hurdle rate and an expected payback of less than 3 years. 
Our goal is clear, our digital acceleration will help us continue to transform how we work, and importantly, how we engage with our customers. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."
9830660,701618547,2254548,"Dow Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Dow Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Howard, and please turn with me to Slide 10. For more than 3 decades, sustainability has been an imperative to our business.

For more than 3 decades, sustainability has been an imperative to our business. And last year, we announced new breakthrough targets focused on reducing our carbon footprint and addressing plastic waste. We see these targets as a catalyst for growth and innovation. We've discussed with you our progress on key initiatives to advance the circular economy for plastics. And today, we want to provide visibility on our comprehensive approach to reducing carbon emissions. 
Over the past 15 years, Dow has reduced our overall emissions by 15%, while growing our business. And we see a viable pathway to reduce our net annual carbon emissions by another 15% by 2030. This pathway begins with targeting further efficiencies and optimization at our sites, sourcing renewable energy and clean power, and implementing new emission management technologies. We're working with utilities and regulators to supply clean purchase power to a majority of Dow sites by 2030. We're making good progress. 
Last year, we increased our agreements to purchase cost competitive renewable energy in Kentucky, Texas, Brazil and Spain, and we're preparing for the full transition of our Terneuzen operations. We're also working to optimize the energy efficiency of our sites by lowering our energy use and developing breakthrough technologies, such as electric, ethylene steam crackers, carbon capture and sequestration, and the potential use of blue hydrogen. Dow could be among the first in the industry to do so by 2030. We recognize that achieving these goals will also require partnerships with governments, regulatory agencies and other external groups to support the economics of these technologies and evolve regulatory frameworks to focus on emissions reduction. 
Widespread support for decarbonizing emissions is driving demand across the value chain, and Dow is well placed to continue to lead and benefit from this evolution. Many Dow products lower our customers' emissions more than the carbon emissions used to produce them, like enabling lighter, safer and more fuel-efficient automobiles; more energy-efficient buildings; and food that stays safe and fresh longer, all critical for a world set to add 2 billion people by 2050. 
Ultimately, Dow wins by making our cost to implement this transition lower than our competitors and the value of our products higher. Our objective is to establish a resilient portfolio of lower carbon footprint products to meet rising demand, capture market share and grow value, while reducing emissions for Dow, our customers, and the planet. 
Moving to Slide 11. As we look to 2021 and beyond, we are well positioned to capture additional value growth. Throughout the pandemic, new consumer behaviors emerge that have driven strong demand for our products, and we expect these trends to continue benefiting Dow's consumer-led portfolio even as the pandemic diminishes. Consumers have become accustomed to new ways of purchasing and interacting. Increased in-home delivery and takeout dining, paired with heightened awareness of food hygiene and security will sustain demand strength for food and consumer packaging. 
The resilient housing market is creating higher demand for durable goods, such as furniture and appliances, and more time at home also leads to consumer spending on home improvement, including do-it-yourself coatings. Ongoing public caution about COVID-19, even after widespread vaccine distribution, will support continued demand for health and hygiene applications. We also believe that as vaccination rates increase and we turn the corner on the pandemic, there will be improving demand as travel, entertainment, sports and construction industries and other social activities return to normal. 
Market indicators are showing above-GDP growth across several sectors, and as a result, we're beginning to see economic recovery broaden across our portfolio and in many of the end markets that we serve, which is benefiting our higher-margin Consumer Solutions business. Similarly, this increased confidence is also improving demand in our functional polymers portfolio, which serves mobility, infrastructure, and construction sectors. 
Finally, as we look ahead, Dow's unmatched materials science portfolio is uniquely positioned to address global megatrends and shifting post-COVID trends, providing additional higher-margin growth opportunities for Dow. 
Dow solutions meet increasing consumer needs for new sustainable innovations, such as post-consumer recycled plastics and renewable energy-made polyethylene. In 2020, we tripled sales of product made with renewable bio-based feedstocks. As the need for renewable energy increases globally, so will demand for Dow solutions that enable wind power and solar production facilities. Our heat transfer fluids are used in more than 40 large-scale concentrated solar power plants around the world. And through our DowAksa joint venture, we provide polyurethane, carbon fiber systems that deliver a stronger and lighter composite material for wind blades. 
Electric vehicle sales are on the rise with 2021 growth projections exceeding 2020 records. And our MobilityScience platform focuses on delivering innovative products to enhance automobile connectivity, light-weighting, comfort, safety and sustainability. 
Lastly, we see meaningful opportunities to support the rollout of 5G broadband networks. For example, last year, we launched new high-performance thermal gel that promotes both environmental sustainability and efficient assembly of essential 5G infrastructure. 
Underpinning these tailwinds are the global foundational advantages and discipline that set Dow apart. Our unmatched portfolio, global scale, low-cost structure and industry-leading feedstock flexibility give us a competitive edge. Further, the actions that we took in 2020 to bolster our financial position, including the execution of our restructuring program and our disciplined focus on cash generation provides the financial strength and flexibility to support our growth trajectory in line with our financial and operating playbook. 
To close, 2020 was a challenging year for our world. But I could not be more proud of team Dow's performance nor could I be more confident in our future. Dow's competitive advantages are clear, we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us and the actions that we've taken position us to outperform our peers. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Colleen to open up the Q&A."

And toward the end of the year, we saw ethylene start to tighten up and ethylene margins improve. And so that led to some pretty sharp increases in the fourth quarter. You saw PE margins were up in the fourth quarter, about $0.07 a pound in the U.S., about $0.13 in Europe, and up about $0.10 in Asia. 
I think the other thing that happened was as those ethylene margins increased here, you had some wintertime activities that drove some of the cost to manufacture up in China. So you saw competing technologies like cold olefins, where coal prices were up $200 -- to $200 a ton, mainly because of a polar vortex and the fact that they were having some squabbles with the Australians about coal imports. So they weren't able to get it. We also saw LNG exports and LNG demand up sharply throughout Europe and also into Asia. And so that helped. Demand strength on top of the fact that you had these rising prices and inventory levels were low, really all came together to drive that. 
And by the way, demand still continues to look good in the first quarter, inventory levels are still low, operating rates are good. In the U.S. Gulf Coast, our operating rates were in the mid-90s in the fourth quarter. So we're going to continue to see, I think, good margins in the PE business."

We have a lot of electricity uses that are not for the crackers. And obviously, there, we're looking to alternatives, wind and solar, to replace current capacity. And those are cost competitive today. And so we've made a big move in that direction. We have about 580 megawatts of alternative energy under a contract. And we're increasing every year. Our goal is to have 750 megawatts or more by 2025. And I mentioned some of the sites on the script that will go through that. 
The second thing I would say is in the crackers, we're looking at a combination of things, not just electrification. We have a partnership with Shell going on right now to try to prove out electric cracking. That is a longer-term development. In the near term, we're also working on a form of fluidized catalytic cracking to go from ethane to ethylene. I've talked about our FCDH process to make propylene out of propane. We're piloting that in Louisiana. That will be built this year and up and running next year. And we believe that can give us a 20% reduction at least in CO2 emissions and a very good scale technology. We can achieve economies of scale at maybe 150,000 tons per year kind of CapEx. 
If you look at what we're doing in parallel, we're looking at EDH. And that could have the potential to reduce our emissions by 40% or more, still using gas as a feedstock in the crackers or gas as a fuel in the crackers. So we've got several technologies that we're looking at, and we're also looking at blue hydrogen also as a way to try to get a more concentrated CO2 stream so that we can combine that with carbon capture and sequestration to be able to reduce carbon emissions."

And it's a combination of reduced supply because ethane has been the preferred crack in the crackers and propane has been much more expensive, again due to that polar vortex I was talking about in Europe and Asia, driving these prices up. That means ethane has been the crack, and so you don't have as many byproducts. And that's shortest bit on propylene. And then on purpose propylene, you've had a raft of issues on -- through -- on purpose propylene production, which has meant there hasn't been as much there. And so that has tightened things up. I think acrylates are holding up well because demand has been good -- downstream demand has been good. So there has been some price improvements. Do-it-yourself, architectural coatings are growing. In fact, they were the big winner last year in terms of market share. I expect the contractor side will come back this year.

We are seeing the automotive sector come back. Obviously, we saw it big in electric vehicles, we've set records in 2020, and I think we're going to crush those in 2021.

Normal seasonality that we would typically see a strong second quarter but having said that, we go into first quarter this year with supply chains being relatively lean, very little inventories in almost all of them.

So it feels like you have a first quarter, second quarter pretty strong season, and we typically see second quarter and into third quarter being the strongest part of the year. I think because of tightness, you're going to continue to see that. 
Secondly, last year, there was a lot of unplanned activities in things like polyethylene that took a lot of capacity off-line. This year, there's a lot of planned activity for turnarounds because of activity that didn't happen last year due to COVID. So you're going to have, on a planned basis, almost the same amount of capacity off-line as we did last year, before you ever get into any unplanned events.

So do you think that they're going to need to rebuild before the second half, assuming the vaccines are reaching critical mass by then and hopefully, some return to normality is taking place? Or are you more likely to see just sort of a smoother recovery there? How do you foresee that playing out? And then just as a housekeeping question, well, never mind, I'll just leave it there."

So I think building and construction is going to be up -- probably up in the 3% to 4% range. Electronics, 6% or more. Industrial, up 9%. Industrial was off quite a bit last year. Mobility, maybe up 11%. Home and personal care will still be up, even though probably not as high as 2020 because you had some of that pre-COVID buying and that surge that we saw in the third quarter, second quarter to third quarter. And I do think personal care will come back. I think it will come back probably up 4%. 
We are taking advantage of -- we had some scheduled turnaround time in first quarter last year when the pandemic hit in China. We're actually completing that work right now in China. So that's got some siloxanes capacity offline. But because building and because the high-end personal care demand haven't been there, that's been okay. So we'll get those things done in this quarter. 
The other thing we've been doing is debottlenecking a lot of our downstream capacity. So we've done a lot of projects downstream to get our what we call our specialties business ready. And I think we're getting ahead of what will be some pent-up demand once we hit an inflection point on these vaccinations. Certainly, people are tired of being at home. They want to travel. They want to get back to life as normal, and that will open things up. And we're gearing up that we should see some of that in the second half of the year."

It's about 18 months' worth of work that got us to this point where we've got the agreement in principle with the entire lending syndicate of commercial banks, ECAs as well as the sukuk investors. So we've got a 5-year great period where no principal is due until June of 2026. We've matched the principle from 2026 out to 2038 with the projected earnings and cash flows. And in terms of the next 5 years, on a 100% Sadara basis, you're looking at about between $300 million and $350 million of interest expense. So our share would be about $100 million to $125 million a year. But I would say based on Sadara's current performance as well as all the plans that they have in place, they will be cash flow self-sufficient for this year and going forward.

But actually, we saw good performance around the globe, and it continues to tighten up. And we -- you noticed that MEG prices are also starting to rise. So that's really making things move there. We also saw a big step-up in Industrial Solutions. So they're running strong, and we've got new capacity coming to support their growth this year. We had less performance in siloxanes, and that's the one that has the big upside, which I talked about with Vincent's question in the second half. And then polyurethanes and construction chemicals got back to the 80-plus percent operating rate in the fourth quarter, and that continues into this year. 
So we still have upside to deliver. We are going to continue to run the assets hard. We have been spending on reliability to make sure that we can deliver more out of those assets. Texas 9 has been a stellar asset in terms of its production. And we've done a lot of work on debottlenecking and reliability in some of the other spaces.

Then I would say you got to take 2 deducts. There's about $50 million of higher turnaround spending sequentially, really related to the Zongjian plant in China in the siloxanes plant that Jim talked about in the prepared comments. And then there was about $50 million of onetime items that we had in fourth quarter that won't recur. A couple of land sales as well as an IPO that happened that we were able to monetize in or out of our venture capital.

We finished the DowDuPont separation. So that -- those basically offset each other. 
On the digital side, we'll spend about $150 million, but Sadara will be $350 million tailwind that -- as I talked about. The dividends from our JV companies will be down about $200 million just because we get those dividends from -- in about a year in arrears. So with earnings down in 2020, we'll see dividends down in 2021, but that should reverse in 2022. 
And then I would say, look, we had a number of nonoperating cash flows in 2020, and we're probably not going to be able to deliver the same number because that was a big number. We delivered $5 million of free cash flow out of this machine, which was the best performance since 2013 on an apples-to-apples basis as best you can construct it, but we will have additional tailwinds. So we are working on additional structural improvements in working capital. 
In the fourth quarter, you saw some of that shine through. We had working capital be a source of cash, even though sales was up, which is hard to do. So we'll look to get another $250 million or $300 million of structural improvement in working capital. We still have the top-up payment from the second Nova litigation.

We've got additional priorities to make sure that we're ready for the, I think, the pent-up demand that's coming as we reach these vaccination rates. So we've bumped up incremental growth CapEx. And as Howard said, we will have some cash to buy back shares toward the end of the year to cover dilution. Although if you look at our share count, we've been very steady since the spin. 
And now on top of that, to your point, most of the divestitures and the cash generation have been taking assets that are nonrevenue generating, where there are infrastructure companies out there today that value those and can use those as a growth platform and liberating those from our balance sheet, we'll continue to do that. On the other side, we will look at bolt-on M&A. We've talked about that being not in the billions, but smaller. And that's where we can bring in a technology or a gap in our platform and take advantage of our global footprint to really rapidly grow that as well as get that into our machine and get some economies of scale out of it.

We didn't see much of a decrease last year, maybe 10%, and we're already getting back to the levels that we had prior to the COVID pandemic. 
The other thing that people aren't forecasting in some of the natural gas outlooks is the fact that there are so many drilled and uncompleted wells out there, and companies are moving up the learning curve on being able to get those wells completed. And so I think that's going to bring back a lot of supply in the back half of the year. Even with that ethylene tightness I talked about, even with propane going up because of wintertime and even with naphtha going up because you didn't have as much refining capacity, the reality was ethane was still in supply, even at 75%, 1 million BTU crack spread. And I think it's going to continue to stay that way, that natural gas production is going to bring back more ethane to get split out here. 
So I feel good about our position. We have the capability to capture that better than anybody in the industry. And I think we're in for a year ahead where our view, natural gas is kind of range bound and $3 1 million BTU is probably the high end."

We hope that you, your families are healthy and safe. 
Starting on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, the Dow team delivered results that exceeded expectations with sales and EBIT growth year-over-year and a sequential net sales increase of 10%. And as the global economy and market fundamentals continue to improve, demand drove volumes above or in line with pre-COVID levels across all operating segments. We captured strong durable goods in construction demand, we grew volumes in do-it-yourself architectural coatings and home care sectors, and we continue to benefit from solid demand and pricing momentum in packaging applications, supporting a sequential net sales increase of 12% in our Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment. 
This volume increase, combined with improved pricing and margins, particularly in polyethylene and polyurethane applications, delivered 5% revenue growth and higher operating EBIT year-over-year. We supported these strong top line results with a cash flow conversion of 93% in the quarter, driving our full year rate up 30% versus 2019. Cash from continuing operations was $1.7 billion in the quarter, and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Working capital was a $236 million source of cash, even with increased sales. 
We completed the sale of select U.S. Gulf Coast marine and terminal operations and assets, delivering another strategic nonoperational cash lever. And improved financial and operational performance at Sadara was a key contributor in delivering positive year-over-year equity earnings. We also maintained our disciplined approach to capital allocation, completing additional deleveraging as we reduced net debt by $837 million in the quarter. And we continue to reward our shareholders through our industry-leading dividend. Overall, our fourth quarter performance was a strong finish to a year where team Dow successfully overcame significant macroeconomic and other external challenges. 
On Slide 4 is a brief recap of our full year achievements. We adapted quickly to the global pandemic and our agile approach to managing volatility in the markets, combined with our prudent adjustments to capital expenditures, proactive cost reductions, working capital interventions, plus delivery of unique cash levers supported demand growth year-over-year in packaging applications, a nearly $500 million structural improvement in working capital, a strong uplift in cash flow from operations, free cash flow of $5 billion and more than $2.6 billion in net debt reduction and continued cash returns to shareholders through our industry-leading dividend. 
We achieved all this, while also making significant progress toward our ambition to be the most innovative customer-centric, inclusive and sustainable materials science company in the world. We found new ways to serve customers in a virtual world, we launched Dow's MobilityScience platform to better serve an attractive market vertical, we reinforced Dow's commitment to inclusion and diversity through a bold framework to address systemic racism and inequality and followed through with actions aligned to that framework, and we launched new aggressive targets to help eliminate plastic waste and reduce carbon emissions. I am incredibly proud of how the Dow team delivered solid performance and showed tremendous leadership on critical issues throughout 2020. 
Moving to our segment performance on Slide 5. As I mentioned earlier, ongoing improvements in the macroenvironment drove sequential sales gains across all segments and geographies, allowing us to reach year-over-year revenue growth during the quarter for the first time since the start of the pandemic. 
In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $780 million, up more than $130 million versus the same quarter last year and sequentially. Resilient demand, tight market supply, low inventory levels and disciplined price volume management enabled strong polyethylene pricing momentum and margin expansion. Notably, operating EBIT margins expanded 180 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially. Compared to the prior quarter, net sales increased 12%. Price gains continued across all regions and most applications, particularly in consumer packaging, and the business delivered higher volumes with broad-based demand growth. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business continued to see strong momentum through the end of the year. Sales were up year-over-year, primarily driven by steady volumes and improved polyethylene pricing, particularly in food and specialty packaging as well as health and hygiene applications. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered local price gains in all regions, including double-digit gains in the U.S., Canada and Latin America. 
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT was $296 million, up $75 million year-over-year and up $192 million versus the prior quarter. Supply and demand fundamentals in polyurethanes and construction chemicals as well as higher equity earnings from improved performance at Sadara drove this result. On a sequential basis, significant improvement in margin over raw materials drove operating EBIT margins up more than 500 basis points, more than offsetting typical seasonality. The polyurethane and construction and chemicals business reported a double-digit increase in net sales year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher local prices with gains in all regions, except Latin America. Compared to the prior quarter, sales growth was driven by strong local pricing and furniture, bedding and appliance end markets. 
The Industrial Solutions business reported flat net sales versus the prior year period. Currency tailwinds and higher volumes in solvents for coatings, industrial fluids, electronics and pharma applications were offset by pricing in industrial manufacturing applications. Compared to the prior quarter, net sales were up double digits due to sequential improvement in price and volume as industrial markets continued to recover and consumer end markets remained strong. 
And finally, the Performance Materials and Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $50 million, down year-over-year. Volume growth in downstream silicones and coatings applications was more than offset by price and volume declines in siloxanes. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT was down $25 million as margin expansion in silicon applications was overcome by seasonality in coatings end markets. 
The Consumer Solutions business reported a decline in net sales. The business captured solid demand growth in home care, consumer and electronics and high-performance building applications. These gains were more than offset by continued weak volumes in upstream siloxanes and in high-end personal care applications, such as cosmetics, as a result of paused social and workplace activities. On a sequential basis, volumes improved on recovery in mobility and transportation as well as consumer and electronics and markets. 
The Coatings & Performance Monomers business achieved higher net sales year-over-year, with volumes up double digits. The seasonality impact was moderate, and the business captured resilient demand for architectural coatings as consumers continue to focus on do-it-yourself projects at home. Sequentially, the business also experienced positive pricing momentum, particularly in acrylates, which was more than offset by seasonal weather-related declines for coatings applications in the Northern Hemisphere. 
And now I'll turn it over to Howard for an update on Sadara, our financial outlook and our plans for digital acceleration."

The strong supply and demand trends that continue to benefit our packaging and polyurethanes businesses this quarter also benefited Sadara. The joint venture again delivered improved financial and operational results, driving equity earnings higher by more than $130 million year-over-year. 
We expect solid market fundamentals and an improving economy to continue to benefit the joint venture in 2021, supported by Sadara's feedstock flexibility and enhanced global cost curve position. We are also very pleased to report that Sadara declared project completion in the fourth quarter, removing Dow's $4 billion share of the guarantees that supported the joint venture's debt. In addition, in January of this year, Dow, Saudi Aramco and Sadara reached an agreement in principle with the remaining lenders and sukuk investors on key terms for its debt reprofiling with formal agreements expected to be completed within the first quarter. As a result, Sadara is expected to be cash flow self-sufficient going forward. 
Key provisions of the reprofiling include an extension of the contractual debt maturity from 2029 to 2038; a modified repayment schedule aligned with Sadara's projected cash generation profile, including a grace period until June 2026, during which interest-only payments are required; no upfront payments of principal; and limited support in the form of much lower sponsor guarantees of Sadara's reprofiled debt, in proportion of the sponsor's ownership interest. The impact to Dow's commitments are expected to include the following, which are in proportion to Dow's 35% ownership interest in Sadara. Dow will provide guarantees for $1.3 billion of Sadara's debt, effectively replacing approximately $4 billion of prior guarantees. Dow will provide guarantees for its portion of Sadara interest payments due during the grace period. Our pro rata share of any potential shortfall, which based on Sadara's current performance, we do not expect will be funded by a new $500 million revolving facility in Sadara, guaranteed by Dow. This is expected to be established in the first quarter of 2021. 
And finally, Dow's existing $220 million letter of credit related to the guarantee of one future Sadara debt service payment will also be canceled. As a result of these actions, the company does not expect to provide any further shareholder loans or equity contributions to Sadara. 
Let's now turn to our modeling guidance for first quarter on Slide 7. We exited the fourth quarter with increasing strength, which is carried over into the first quarter. The ISM manufacturing new orders index is trending at its highest level in 10 years. In addition, low interest rates are supporting a resilient housing market and deurbanization trends are driving U.S. housing starts to their highest point since 2006. We expect sequentially higher business results in the first quarter with total sales in the range of $10.7 billion to $11.2 billion, driven by ongoing strength in our polyethylene and polyurethane value chains, improvement in our silicones franchise and supported by our U.S. Gulf Coast ethane advantage. We will see some headwinds sequentially with higher turnaround costs and the reversal of approximately $50 million in onetime benefits from the prior quarter. 
In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we entered the year with good pricing momentum, continued solid demand and elevated breakeven points for high cost naphtha producers as a result of increasing oil prices. We expect these dynamics to be sustained through the quarter. 
The Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment will continue to benefit from strong consumer durables demand, supported by automotive and housing sectors and improvement in industrial end markets. These trends, combined with industry supply limitations and low inventories, should support pricing uplift, although we do see some cost increases from rising propylene pricing as well. 
And finally, for Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect silicones to benefit from ongoing demand expansion in consumer end markets, particularly in electronics, home care and mobility, where our innovation advantages will continue to allow us to capture additional growth opportunities. In Coatings, we expect DIY demand to remain elevated through the first quarter as consumer home improvement trends continue. There will be some turnaround headwinds in the quarter, including completion of a turnaround at our siloxane plant in China that we shortened in the first half of 2020 due to COVID-related labor and supply issues. 
Turning to Slide 8. Looking at the full year, we see strong market fundamentals in many of our key value chains continuing to drive improved operating performance year-over-year. And although we expect the pace of recovery to moderate, it is still likely to be uneven quarter-to-quarter as the vaccine distribution and new strains evolve. As usual, we're providing you with our best full year estimates of several income statement and cash flow items, which are noted on the slide. 
Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, and based on our improved forward outlook versus 2020, we're increasing our capital expenditure target year-over-year to $1.6 billion, and we're targeting an additional $1 billion in deleveraging. Sadara, as previously mentioned, will be a $350 million tailwind for the year with no planned cash contributions. We expect equity earnings to be flat year-over-year as the margin resiliency we see across the portfolio is offset by higher planned JV turnaround expenses. Total turnaround spending will be up versus the prior year as we continue to ensure the reliability of our facilities. And as mentioned last year, we expect our $300 million EBITDA restructuring program to be substantially complete by year-end. We're also providing a share count estimate for the year. However, assuming a sustained EBITDA improvement, we will look at reinstituting our share buyback program later in the year for the purpose of covering dilution. And finally, we expect a full year tax rate in the 23% to 27% range. 
Moving to Slide 9. The events of 2020 provided an opportunity for us to rapidly accelerate our focus on the value of digitalization. Through our digital advances and capabilities, we were able to continue innovating, improving the customer experience, and optimizing our operations. It has become clear that the escalation of digital interactions and transactions driven by COVID-19 will only help us accelerate the delivery of our ambition and be an important part of our customer experience in the future. 
So building on this solid foundation, today, we're announcing plans to further advance our digitalization efforts by investing in 3 key areas: First, expanding digital tools like machine learning and advanced digital modeling to accelerate material science innovation and put innovation capabilities directly in the hands of our customers; second, further enhancing our e-commerce buying and fulfillment experience for our customers; and third, adopting additional real-time digital manufacturing insights, operational data intelligence and demand sensing, all to enhance the productivity and reliability of our operations. 
We expect these actions to deliver more than $300 million in incremental annual run rate EBITDA generation by year-end 2025 with an additional onetime $100 million improvement in structural working capital efficiencies. To realize these gains, we will spend approximately $400 million over the next 2 years with an attractive risk-adjusted return on investment exceeding our internal hurdle rate and an expected payback of less than 3 years. 
Our goal is clear, our digital acceleration will help us continue to transform how we work, and importantly, how we engage with our customers. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

For more than 3 decades, sustainability has been an imperative to our business.

For more than 3 decades, sustainability has been an imperative to our business. And last year, we announced new breakthrough targets focused on reducing our carbon footprint and addressing plastic waste. We see these targets as a catalyst for growth and innovation. We've discussed with you our progress on key initiatives to advance the circular economy for plastics. And today, we want to provide visibility on our comprehensive approach to reducing carbon emissions. 
Over the past 15 years, Dow has reduced our overall emissions by 15%, while growing our business. And we see a viable pathway to reduce our net annual carbon emissions by another 15% by 2030. This pathway begins with targeting further efficiencies and optimization at our sites, sourcing renewable energy and clean power, and implementing new emission management technologies. We're working with utilities and regulators to supply clean purchase power to a majority of Dow sites by 2030. We're making good progress. 
Last year, we increased our agreements to purchase cost competitive renewable energy in Kentucky, Texas, Brazil and Spain, and we're preparing for the full transition of our Terneuzen operations. We're also working to optimize the energy efficiency of our sites by lowering our energy use and developing breakthrough technologies, such as electric, ethylene steam crackers, carbon capture and sequestration, and the potential use of blue hydrogen. Dow could be among the first in the industry to do so by 2030. We recognize that achieving these goals will also require partnerships with governments, regulatory agencies and other external groups to support the economics of these technologies and evolve regulatory frameworks to focus on emissions reduction. 
Widespread support for decarbonizing emissions is driving demand across the value chain, and Dow is well placed to continue to lead and benefit from this evolution. Many Dow products lower our customers' emissions more than the carbon emissions used to produce them, like enabling lighter, safer and more fuel-efficient automobiles; more energy-efficient buildings; and food that stays safe and fresh longer, all critical for a world set to add 2 billion people by 2050. 
Ultimately, Dow wins by making our cost to implement this transition lower than our competitors and the value of our products higher. Our objective is to establish a resilient portfolio of lower carbon footprint products to meet rising demand, capture market share and grow value, while reducing emissions for Dow, our customers, and the planet. 
Moving to Slide 11. As we look to 2021 and beyond, we are well positioned to capture additional value growth. Throughout the pandemic, new consumer behaviors emerge that have driven strong demand for our products, and we expect these trends to continue benefiting Dow's consumer-led portfolio even as the pandemic diminishes. Consumers have become accustomed to new ways of purchasing and interacting. Increased in-home delivery and takeout dining, paired with heightened awareness of food hygiene and security will sustain demand strength for food and consumer packaging. 
The resilient housing market is creating higher demand for durable goods, such as furniture and appliances, and more time at home also leads to consumer spending on home improvement, including do-it-yourself coatings. Ongoing public caution about COVID-19, even after widespread vaccine distribution, will support continued demand for health and hygiene applications. We also believe that as vaccination rates increase and we turn the corner on the pandemic, there will be improving demand as travel, entertainment, sports and construction industries and other social activities return to normal. 
Market indicators are showing above-GDP growth across several sectors, and as a result, we're beginning to see economic recovery broaden across our portfolio and in many of the end markets that we serve, which is benefiting our higher-margin Consumer Solutions business. Similarly, this increased confidence is also improving demand in our functional polymers portfolio, which serves mobility, infrastructure, and construction sectors. 
Finally, as we look ahead, Dow's unmatched materials science portfolio is uniquely positioned to address global megatrends and shifting post-COVID trends, providing additional higher-margin growth opportunities for Dow. 
Dow solutions meet increasing consumer needs for new sustainable innovations, such as post-consumer recycled plastics and renewable energy-made polyethylene. In 2020, we tripled sales of product made with renewable bio-based feedstocks. As the need for renewable energy increases globally, so will demand for Dow solutions that enable wind power and solar production facilities. Our heat transfer fluids are used in more than 40 large-scale concentrated solar power plants around the world. And through our DowAksa joint venture, we provide polyurethane, carbon fiber systems that deliver a stronger and lighter composite material for wind blades. 
Electric vehicle sales are on the rise with 2021 growth projections exceeding 2020 records. And our MobilityScience platform focuses on delivering innovative products to enhance automobile connectivity, light-weighting, comfort, safety and sustainability. 
Lastly, we see meaningful opportunities to support the rollout of 5G broadband networks. For example, last year, we launched new high-performance thermal gel that promotes both environmental sustainability and efficient assembly of essential 5G infrastructure. 
Underpinning these tailwinds are the global foundational advantages and discipline that set Dow apart. Our unmatched portfolio, global scale, low-cost structure and industry-leading feedstock flexibility give us a competitive edge. Further, the actions that we took in 2020 to bolster our financial position, including the execution of our restructuring program and our disciplined focus on cash generation provides the financial strength and flexibility to support our growth trajectory in line with our financial and operating playbook. 
To close, 2020 was a challenging year for our world. But I could not be more proud of team Dow's performance nor could I be more confident in our future. Dow's competitive advantages are clear, we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us and the actions that we've taken position us to outperform our peers. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Colleen to open up the Q&A."

And toward the end of the year, we saw ethylene start to tighten up and ethylene margins improve. And so that led to some pretty sharp increases in the fourth quarter. You saw PE margins were up in the fourth quarter, about $0.07 a pound in the U.S., about $0.13 in Europe, and up about $0.10 in Asia. 
I think the other thing that happened was as those ethylene margins increased here, you had some wintertime activities that drove some of the cost to manufacture up in China. So you saw competing technologies like cold olefins, where coal prices were up $200 -- to $200 a ton, mainly because of a polar vortex and the fact that they were having some squabbles with the Australians about coal imports. So they weren't able to get it. We also saw LNG exports and LNG demand up sharply throughout Europe and also into Asia. And so that helped. Demand strength on top of the fact that you had these rising prices and inventory levels were low, really all came together to drive that. 
And by the way, demand still continues to look good in the first quarter, inventory levels are still low, operating rates are good. In the U.S. Gulf Coast, our operating rates were in the mid-90s in the fourth quarter. So we're going to continue to see, I think, good margins in the PE business."

We have a lot of electricity uses that are not for the crackers. And obviously, there, we're looking to alternatives, wind and solar, to replace current capacity. And those are cost competitive today. And so we've made a big move in that direction. We have about 580 megawatts of alternative energy under a contract. And we're increasing every year. Our goal is to have 750 megawatts or more by 2025. And I mentioned some of the sites on the script that will go through that. 
The second thing I would say is in the crackers, we're looking at a combination of things, not just electrification. We have a partnership with Shell going on right now to try to prove out electric cracking. That is a longer-term development. In the near term, we're also working on a form of fluidized catalytic cracking to go from ethane to ethylene. I've talked about our FCDH process to make propylene out of propane. We're piloting that in Louisiana. That will be built this year and up and running next year. And we believe that can give us a 20% reduction at least in CO2 emissions and a very good scale technology. We can achieve economies of scale at maybe 150,000 tons per year kind of CapEx. 
If you look at what we're doing in parallel, we're looking at EDH. And that could have the potential to reduce our emissions by 40% or more, still using gas as a feedstock in the crackers or gas as a fuel in the crackers. So we've got several technologies that we're looking at, and we're also looking at blue hydrogen also as a way to try to get a more concentrated CO2 stream so that we can combine that with carbon capture and sequestration to be able to reduce carbon emissions."

Spot prices have increased. And it's a combination of reduced supply because ethane has been the preferred crack in the crackers and propane has been much more expensive, again due to that polar vortex I was talking about in Europe and Asia, driving these prices up. That means ethane has been the crack, and so you don't have as many byproducts. And that's shortest bit on propylene. And then on purpose propylene, you've had a raft of issues on -- through -- on purpose propylene production, which has meant there hasn't been as much there. And so that has tightened things up. I think acrylates are holding up well because demand has been good -- downstream demand has been good. So there has been some price improvements. Do-it-yourself, architectural coatings are growing. In fact, they were the big winner last year in terms of market share. I expect the contractor side will come back this year.

We are seeing the automotive sector come back. Obviously, we saw it big in electric vehicles, we've set records in 2020, and I think we're going to crush those in 2021. But internal combustion engine vehicle is coming back as well. And that is good demand and strong order patterns, even without some of the bigger capital-intensive markets being back on stream.

Normal seasonality that we would typically see a strong second quarter but having said that, we go into first quarter this year with supply chains being relatively lean, very little inventories in almost all of them. And we've got strong demand going into the first quarter. So it feels like you have a first quarter, second quarter pretty strong season, and we typically see second quarter and into third quarter being the strongest part of the year. I think because of tightness, you're going to continue to see that. 
Secondly, last year, there was a lot of unplanned activities in things like polyethylene that took a lot of capacity off-line. This year, there's a lot of planned activity for turnarounds because of activity that didn't happen last year due to COVID. So you're going to have, on a planned basis, almost the same amount of capacity off-line as we did last year, before you ever get into any unplanned events. And those things, to me, mean a pretty strong start to 2021. And I'm optimistic that as the vaccination rates improve, we're going to start to see people return more to normal. And we certainly are making progress on getting people vaccinated.

We are taking advantage of -- we had some scheduled turnaround time in first quarter last year when the pandemic hit in China. We're actually completing that work right now in China. So that's got some siloxanes capacity offline. But because building and because the high-end personal care demand haven't been there, that's been okay. So we'll get those things done in this quarter. 
The other thing we've been doing is debottlenecking a lot of our downstream capacity. So we've done a lot of projects downstream to get our what we call our specialties business ready. And I think we're getting ahead of what will be some pent-up demand once we hit an inflection point on these vaccinations. Certainly, people are tired of being at home. They want to travel. They want to get back to life as normal, and that will open things up. And we're gearing up that we should see some of that in the second half of the year."

But actually, we saw good performance around the globe, and it continues to tighten up. And we -- you noticed that MEG prices are also starting to rise. So that's really making things move there. We also saw a big step-up in Industrial Solutions. So they're running strong, and we've got new capacity coming to support their growth this year. We had less performance in siloxanes, and that's the one that has the big upside, which I talked about with Vincent's question in the second half. And then polyurethanes and construction chemicals got back to the 80-plus percent operating rate in the fourth quarter, and that continues into this year. 
So we still have upside to deliver. We are going to continue to run the assets hard. We have been spending on reliability to make sure that we can deliver more out of those assets.

And then I would say, look, we had a number of nonoperating cash flows in 2020, and we're probably not going to be able to deliver the same number because that was a big number. We delivered $5 million of free cash flow out of this machine, which was the best performance since 2013 on an apples-to-apples basis as best you can construct it, but we will have additional tailwinds. So we are working on additional structural improvements in working capital. 
In the fourth quarter, you saw some of that shine through. We had working capital be a source of cash, even though sales was up, which is hard to do. So we'll look to get another $250 million or $300 million of structural improvement in working capital. We still have the top-up payment from the second Nova litigation. That's still going through the court. So we'll see if that's a 2021 event, but that should still be several hundred million dollars. And then we're still working on best owner lens that don't sail. So I don't have a number for you. But if we're able to deliver on those projects, that should also be several hundred million dollars, probably in the back half of the year."

Still, first and foremost, is safely and reliably operate the plants. That costs us about $1 billion a year. Continues to support that dividend, that's about $2 billion to $2.1 billion a year. We've got some further incremental deleveraging that we need to do in 2021, keep us on trajectory with what we've committed to the ratings agencies. We've got additional priorities to make sure that we're ready for the, I think, the pent-up demand that's coming as we reach these vaccination rates. So we've bumped up incremental growth CapEx. And as Howard said, we will have some cash to buy back shares toward the end of the year to cover dilution. Although if you look at our share count, we've been very steady since the spin. 
And now on top of that, to your point, most of the divestitures and the cash generation have been taking assets that are nonrevenue generating, where there are infrastructure companies out there today that value those and can use those as a growth platform and liberating those from our balance sheet, we'll continue to do that. On the other side, we will look at bolt-on M&A. We've talked about that being not in the billions, but smaller. And that's where we can bring in a technology or a gap in our platform and take advantage of our global footprint to really rapidly grow that as well as get that into our machine and get some economies of scale out of it. So those are some of the things we're looking at, and there are areas that are driven by the market trends that we're seeing on building and construction, mobility space, 5G, these are some of the areas where we want to continue to try to build in the areas of adhesives, sealants, coatings types applications."

And of course, we saw such huge volatility in oil last year. Most of our feedstock is natural gas liquids. And gas production has been very resilient. And I think gas production is going to continue to be strong next year. We didn't see much of a decrease last year, maybe 10%, and we're already getting back to the levels that we had prior to the COVID pandemic. 
The other thing that people aren't forecasting in some of the natural gas outlooks is the fact that there are so many drilled and uncompleted wells out there, and companies are moving up the learning curve on being able to get those wells completed. And so I think that's going to bring back a lot of supply in the back half of the year. Even with that ethylene tightness I talked about, even with propane going up because of wintertime and even with naphtha going up because you didn't have as much refining capacity, the reality was ethane was still in supply, even at 75%, 1 million BTU crack spread. And I think it's going to continue to stay that way, that natural gas production is going to bring back more ethane to get split out here. 
So I feel good about our position. We have the capability to capture that better than anybody in the industry. And I think we're in for a year ahead where our view, natural gas is kind of range bound and $3 1 million BTU is probably the high end."

Starting on Slide 3. Our results for the first quarter once again demonstrated the focus and agility of Team Dow which enabled us to quickly recover from the impact of winter storm Uri on the U.S. Gulf Coast. This event had a far-reaching impact across our industry and broader market. Our colleagues quickly and safely got our units back online some of which began coming up within a week of the storm. All impacted Dow units are back online, and we reached pre-storm operating rates by the end of March ahead of plan. 
Our team's efforts, combined with improving demand and tight industry supply conditions, drove results higher than the updated guidance we shared last month at the JPMorgan investor conference. At the company level, Dow achieved double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines, both year-over-year and sequentially. A few highlights in particular: 
Sales were up 22% year-over-year, with gains in all operating segments and in every region. We continue to benefit from strong price momentum with improvements in all segments, businesses and regions. Volume was in line with the year ago period as gains in construction, mobility, electronics and consumer durables end markets, as well as higher energy demand, were offset by supply constraints from the storm, and we continue to improve our working capital efficiency with a net improvement of 3 days. Sales were also up sequentially with growth in all segments and regions. This top line growth and our continued focus on cost discipline led to bottom line growth and our highest EBIT quarter since spin. We achieved more than $700 million of EBIT growth from the year ago period and $500 million sequentially. 
We delivered equity earnings improvements of more than $300 million led by Sadara. Earlier this month, Sadara with help from Dow and Saudi Aramco worked to bring its mixed feed cracker back online faster than anticipated and downstream production units are also back at expected rates. 
We also completed key structural changes to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans in the quarter, which reduced the company's pension liability. Cash flow from operations was more than $750 million, excluding a $1 billion elective pension contribution. And Dow, Saudi Aramco and Sadara completed the joint venture's debt reprofiling, which will provide approximately $350 million cash tailwind to Dow in 2021. Sadara is now expected to be cash flow self-sufficient. 
In summary, Team Dow remained agile in an extremely dynamic business environment to deliver strong top and bottom line growth, positioning Dow for greater value creation going forward. 
Moving to our segment performance on Slide 4, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $1.2 billion, up nearly $650 million versus the same quarter last year and $448 million sequentially. Resilient demand, tight market supply, disciplined price volume management and polyethylene inventory levels at 5-year lows enabled momentum in polyethylene earnings. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business achieved double-digit sales gains year-over-year and sequentially, driven by local price momentum in all regions. Versus the year ago period, local price gains were led by improvement in industrial and consumer packaging and flexible food and beverage packaging applications. 
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $326 million, up $151 million year-over-year due to strong supply and demand fundamentals in polyurethanes and construction chemicals. PAUSE And higher equity earnings led by continued improvement from Sadara. Sequentially, operating EBIT improved $30 million despite significant impact from winter storm Uri. The polyurethanes and construction and chemicals business achieved a double-digit net sales increase compared to the year ago period, led by local price momentum in polyurethanes. Demand growth in consumer durables  and appliances and industrial end markets was more than offset by volume limitations on the U.S. Gulf Coast and other third-party supply constraints related to the storm. These pricing and volume dynamics also drove sequential sales growth. 
The Industrial Solutions business delivered net sales in line with the year ago period as higher prices in all regions were offset by volume constraints primarily due to winter storm Uri. Improved demand in textiles and electronics applications was more than offset by supply limitations. Net sales were also in line sequentially due to the same drivers. 
And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $62 million down year-over-year as local price gains across the portfolio and strong demand for architectural coatings and silicones applications were more than offset by the impact of the winter storm as well as planned maintenance. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $12 million.
 The Consumer Solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year on local price increases for siloxane and robust demand for consumer, electronics and mobility applications. These gains more than offset the impact from planned maintenance. Sequentially, the business delivered local price gains across all regions and achieved sequential volume gains in all regions except Asia Pacific, where strong gains in performance silicones were more than offset by planned maintenance downtime at our Sandakan Siloxanes asset. PAUSE The Coatings and Performance Monomers business delivered higher net sales year-over-year, driven by price gains in all regions, notably in acryling monomers due to strong supply and demand fundamentals. Supply constraints from winter storm Uri and planned maintenance at our Deer Park asset more than offset continued demand strength for architectural coatings. Sequentially, the business achieved price gains, particularly in accruing monomers due to increases in raw material costs. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to review modeling guidance and the results of our annual benchmarking."

Moving to Slide 5, as we turn to the second quarter, market demand remains robust in packaging, electronics, mobility, architectural coatings as well as consumer durable end markets.

Moving to Slide 5, as we turn to the second quarter, market demand remains robust in packaging, electronics, mobility, architectural coatings as well as consumer durable end markets. While sectors like home care have begun to normalize, we do expect additional upside on continuing economic recovery in the industrial sector. And as travel, workplace and social activities resume, they will also provide a boost in demand for higher-margin personal care applications, as well as across the service sectors of the global economy. These constructive market trends will continue to support top and bottom line growth across all Dow operating segments in the second quarter. 
We are entering turnaround season in the Northern Hemisphere, and we expect increased spending of approximately $125 million sequentially, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast, including a turnaround at one of our crackers in Louisiana. We also expect an additional $100 million from outages, including a third-party supply disruption on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Collectively, robust demand, tight supply, low inventories and increased raw material costs are providing support for prices across many of our value chains. We expect the constrained industry inventory levels to continue in the second quarter, preventing inventory builds until later this year as we focus on clearing the growing backlog of customer orders. All combined for the second quarter, we expect approximately $750 million to $800 million in higher earnings versus the prior quarter from a combination of earnings momentum in our key chains and lower sequential costs from winter storm Uri. This earnings growth will be partially offset by approximately $200 million to $250 million in higher costs from turnarounds and the third-party outage I mentioned. Altogether, we expect second quarter to be our strongest performance since spin. 
Moving to Slide 6, we're also updating a few key items in our full year modeling guidance. The positive momentum I just mentioned will also benefit our joint ventures, particularly Sadara. We also expect to see slightly higher turnaround spending than previously anticipated as winter storm Uri has put some upward pressure on the cost of materials and labor in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Finally, our decision to freeze our U.S. pension plan accruals and contribute $1 billion to the U.S. pension plan, along with the subsequent remeasurement, provides an approximately $200 million tailwind to pension expense year-over-year. Overall, for the remainder of the year, we continue to see broad-based economic momentum, recovery from winter Storm Uri and elevated consumer demand. 
Moving to Slide 7, today, we also released our annual benchmarking update, which is available on our investor website and in this earnings presentation.PAUSE I continue to be very proud of our team's efforts to achieve top quartile results across most of our peer comparison performance metrics. To summarize our results, at the enterprise level, our focus on cash extended Dow's advantage on EBITDA to cash flow conversion and enabled free cash flow performance above peers, above the industry as well as above the broader market. This supported our continued leading dividend yield and further strengthened our balance sheet even through the pandemic. We also maintained our top quartile cost management and margin performance. 
At a segment level, Packaging & Specialty plastics outperformed the peer median across adjusted operating EBITDA margin, free cash conversion and SG&A and R&D spend. And Dow's operating EBITDA per pound of polyolefins capacity continues to outperform peers, expanding further in 2020. Both industrial intermediates and infrastructure as well as Performance Materials and coatings, outperformed the pure median on cash conversion as well as on SG&A and R&D spend. We do see near-term opportunities to improve adjusted operating EBITDA growth by continuing to implement our faster payback, higher ROIC expansions. This includes our ethylene cracker expansion in Canada, our FCDh retrofit, our polyglycols expansion and our downstream silicones expansions as well. And projects like the South China Specialties Hub will enable us to capture higher value polyurethane systems and alkoxylates demand in the fast-growing Asia Pacific market. 
Looking ahead, we are well positioned to grow earnings and maintain our track record of cash generation. Our differentiated consumer-led portfolio with leading positions across most of the markets we serve enables us to capture growth in our key value chains and ongoing market recovery in automotive and personal care. For example, in the mobility global megatrend alone, electric vehicles use 3 to 4x more Dow silicone products than traditional vehicles. 
Together, our strong operational, financial and commercial playbook, supported by the broadening economic recovery, positions Dow well for future earnings and cash flow growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."
9830660,710053033,2255270,"Dow Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Dow Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Howard. Moving to Slide 8, before discussing the market outlook, I want to reinforce how sustainability continues to be another growth driver for Dow. Last quarter, we shared our road map to achieving our 2030 carbon reduction targets. And this",906,"Thank you, Howard. Moving to Slide 8, before discussing the market outlook, I want to reinforce how sustainability continues to be another growth driver for Dow. Last quarter, we shared our road map to achieving our 2030 carbon reduction targets. And this past week, Columbia University and the Nature Conservancy announced our partnership to better account for the role of the materials and sustainable applications play in achieving emissions reduction, including plastics. 
Plastics have a lower carbon footprint than traditional materials, and we are leading the way to a circular economy for plastics. Through our stop the waste and close the loop targets, we're enabling 1 million metric tons of plastics to be collected, reused or recycled by 2030 and targeting 100% of our products sold into packaging applications to be reusable or recyclable by 2035. These targets require innovation and collaboration in mechanical and advanced recycling, as well as in designing for recyclability. To that end, through collaboration across the value chain with Dallas Pack studios, we're working to accelerate sustainable packaging solutions, tailor-made for those customers and consumer brand owners, many of which have set targets to incorporate 25% or more post-consumer recycled material in their products. 
We're helping consumer brands design their packaging to be fully recyclable. Our collaborations to develop fully formulated recyclable packaging solutions include developments with Kellogg's bare naked granola, Reckitt Ben Kaiser's finished Dishwashing Detergent and China's leading laundry brand, Lei, each enable a larger addressable market and sales of higher value Dow materials. 
We sell products containing mechanically recycled materials in every geography, and now we're beginning to scale a family of products that can be used in either flexible or rigid packaging applications. Dow is also developing advanced recycling technologies that convert used plastics into their feedstocks. We continue to scale up these capabilities with our partner, Phoenix Ecog group. And today, we announced a partnership with MIRA technology to convert plastics back into the oils and chemicals from which they were made for use in new virgin equivalent plastic products. This revolutionary advanced recycling technology can convert all forms of plastic into feedstock, including many considered to be unrecyclable. We're also actively engaged as a founder of the alliance to end plastic waste and with key stakeholders around the world to help solve critical challenges to plastics recycling. For example, through our collaboration with circulate capital, Dow is bringing material science capabilities to loop CRO plastic CLE and Marico Limited, one of India's leading consumer brands to enable sustainable, flexible film packaging with recycled content. 
Our actions to advance plastic circularity are value-accretive to Dow, and our differentiated product slate, downstream knowledge, intimacy with consumer brands and strategic partnerships give us a leading-edge to capture this growth. 
Turning to Slide 9, as Howard mentioned, Dow remains well positioned to benefit from improving industry and market conditions. We see several positive leading indicators, including momentum and job growth, consumer spending, a return to air travel and expanding manufacturing and industrial activity for global manufacturing PMIs at a 15-year high in March. These trends are further supported by government stimulus measures and accelerating vaccine rollouts globally. The spending elements of the U.S. infrastructure plan, if passed, will further support growth in our downstream markets. Similarly, incentives aligned to more sustainable energy solutions should be beneficial to our business and to attaining our own sustainability targets. These programs are not currently included in our assumptions, but could drive additional growth if enacted in a manner that supports manufacturing competitiveness. 
These macro trends translate into a 1 to 2x GDP growth across key end markets PAUSE including packaging, infrastructure, mobility, consumer durables and industrials and Home & Personal Care. Given this backdrop, we see demand in our key value chains continuing to outpace supply throughout 2021 and staying balanced in the near-term across ethylene, polyethylene, polyurethanes, acrylics and silicones chains. 
Some industry views call for softening conditions in the near term, largely based on their view of planned capacity additions. However, these views do not account for industry project delays or cancellations nor do they account for the maintenance activity or reliability impact from weather-related events like the winter storm. Industry delays and cancellations of planned capacity additions, along with elevated demand growth as the global economy continues to reopen, will likely lead to tighter than predicted market conditions, all of which will result in continued earnings, margin and cash flow growth for our core businesses and joint ventures in the near term. And while we capture these improved earnings over the next several years in our core businesses, PAUSE our current slate of lower capital, faster payback and higher return capacity expansions will add nearly $1 billion of accretive earnings to our bottom line. Dallas points of distinction continue to raise our earnings and cash flow potential relative to peers. The market growth we expect in our business, combined with our industry-leading feedstock flexibility, global scale and advantaged cost positions, our top quartile cash generation and our innovation and leadership in high-growth end markets enable Dow to continue to deliver value for our owners through 2021 and over the foreseeable future.

We do have some turnarounds, as Howard mentioned, so we have a Louisiana cracker that's down. But having said that, it looks like supply is going to be greater than demand for the foreseeable future. I don't anticipate we'll be looking at any kind of an inventory build until probably the fourth quarter. And so with that, kind of a year that feels like 13 months of demand and 11 months of supply, and it looks like raw material costs are going to continue to remain low."

And I feel good, given that we had about a $400 million impact from winter storm Uri in the quarter, we delivered $750 million of cash from operations. Obviously, we took an elective pension contribution in the quarter, but our cash flow generation continues to remain strong. 
We stepped up CapEx this year to a little over $1.6 billion to get our growth CapEx coming back up. And all of that is on faster payback types of projects. So for example, we started up a polyethylene glycol facility in the first quarter down in the Gulf Coast, which will be accretive this year. We also PAUSE just brought on another furnace in Fort Saskatchewan. The furnace part is active. So about half of the benefits of that start now, and we'll do some work on the back end of the cracker toward the end of the year and bring on the other half of that capacity. 
So if you think about the incremental projects that we have to deliver that $1 billion, I feel like we can be increasing capital towards depreciation and PAUSE and still be able to deliver that $1 billion of EBITDA growth. 
And then obviously, we want to continue to support the dividend. And if you think about our capital allocation priorities, they are in order safely and reliably operate the plants, continue to support that industry leading dividend, the growth CapEx, I mentioned, some incremental gross deleveraging. So we've got another $1 billion of targeted gross deleveraging to get our net debt-to-EBITDA ratios where we targeted them. And then share buyback to cover dilution. And right now, that's where we'll stop on share buyback.

We had the siloxanes plant in China down, and we had the Deer Park facility down for maintenance. And then, of course, the winter storm really lengthened that maintenance. 
The demand for both of the products is improving and the pricing for siloxanes, which has been one of the bigger drags on consumer solutions, is starting to move in the right direction. And a lot of that is because PAUSE automotive demand is coming back and construction is coming back. And we have yet to see Personal care, which I think is going to come back through the year. And on top of coatings and monomers, monomers were strong in the quarter. Architectural coatings and specialty do-it-yourself continues to be strong.

And that's raised, obviously, the naphtha pricing and that's raised the floor around the world. 
The other thing that's happened though is we had growth in plastics and packaging, even through COVID. And so most people were expecting businesses to be down during that time. And I think they underestimated how much growth is there. We're seeing growth over 2020 in plastics. We would have seen in the first quarter without the winter storm. And so we're going to see that continue to grow. So I think we've got continued outlook for high earnings through the year on plastics. 
On bioplastics, we're doing some work right now on biomaterials to make plastics, really looking at wood byproduct derivatives that we can use to blend in with NAFTA. PAUSE We're doing some work with Phoenix Equity group to bring recycled materials back in. 
One of the challenges with bioplastics is not so much the degradability that everybody in the market likes, but it's their thermal stability in terms of being able to form them and do what you need to do with them, and then have them have the kind of durability you need for food packaging. But we're open to collaborations in those areas, and we're always looking for new things that we can do in that space."

Same is true for polyurethanes and isocyanates. You see the downstream demand pull is very strong. And siloxanes pricing improvements is all driven by downstream demand improvements. So my sense is that we're going to be in strong operating rate territory for the entire year. I don't think we'll be building inventory until maybe possibly the end of fourth quarter, which -- and that all depends on whether we have a slow fourth quarter or not.

I would say that the demand pull is there from the brand owners and from the marketplace for more recycled content, and that's what's driving the investments. 
To date, most of the investments have been around mechanical recycling because it's very low cost, and it's also low energy intensity. And so the growth in those applications is great. But there's a limit to what that can do. So when you get into flexible packaging and a few other areas, you need advanced recycling. And there you get into technologies like pyrolysis and gasification to make that happen. PAUSE And that's a little bit more expensive. 
So as we move forward, I would think we're going to need to see a market-related price on carbon, which has been discussed in the EU and is also going to start being discussed here in the United States to help create that gap and that value will drive that return. And it's a little bit early to get into huge capital numbers or return numbers.

If you looked at coatings, I expect monomers to be tight through the year given the improvements in downstream coatings. And obviously, architectural has been strong. If we see a boost up in the do-it-yourself or the contract side of coatings market, then we could see another leg up and some more tightness in that sector. 
Yes. And I would just say on, John, on the equity earnings line, your math is right. There is some seasonality to think about Meg out of equate, but also there is higher turnaround expenses. So you got a higher turnaround expenses in Sadara this year, as well as Thailand, as well as the Kuwait. So you've got to subtract that extra $100-plus million from the turnaround as well."

Mostly it's been residential construction, but it's moving back into high rise buildings. Again, consumer electronics is driving it. Industrial manufacturing is driving it, and mobility, as Howard mentioned. EVs is really positive for us on a Dow overall standpoint. We get about twice -- 50% more content on an EV than an internal combustion engine. On a silicon standpoint, we've got about 3 to 4x more than an internal combustion engine. So we're seeing surges there. 
So I think you're going to see PM&C improve as the year goes through.

Starting on Slide 3. Our results for the first quarter once again demonstrated the focus and agility of Team Dow which enabled us to quickly recover from the impact of winter storm Uri on the U.S. Gulf Coast. This event had a far-reaching impact across our industry and broader market. Our colleagues quickly and safely got our units back online some of which began coming up within a week of the storm. All impacted Dow units are back online, and we reached pre-storm operating rates by the end of March ahead of plan. 
Our team's efforts, combined with improving demand and tight industry supply conditions, drove results higher than the updated guidance we shared last month at the JPMorgan investor conference. At the company level, Dow achieved double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines, both year-over-year and sequentially. A few highlights in particular: 
Sales were up 22% year-over-year, with gains in all operating segments and in every region. We continue to benefit from strong price momentum with improvements in all segments, businesses and regions. Volume was in line with the year ago period as gains in construction, mobility, electronics and consumer durables end markets, as well as higher energy demand, were offset by supply constraints from the storm, and we continue to improve our working capital efficiency with a net improvement of 3 days. Sales were also up sequentially with growth in all segments and regions. This top line growth and our continued focus on cost discipline led to bottom line growth and our highest EBIT quarter since spin. We achieved more than $700 million of EBIT growth from the year ago period and $500 million sequentially. 
We delivered equity earnings improvements of more than $300 million led by Sadara. Earlier this month, Sadara with help from Dow and Saudi Aramco worked to bring its mixed feed cracker back online faster than anticipated and downstream production units are also back at expected rates. 
We also completed key structural changes to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans in the quarter, which reduced the company's pension liability. Cash flow from operations was more than $750 million, excluding a $1 billion elective pension contribution. And Dow, Saudi Aramco and Sadara completed the joint venture's debt reprofiling, which will provide approximately $350 million cash tailwind to Dow in 2021. Sadara is now expected to be cash flow self-sufficient. 
In summary, Team Dow remained agile in an extremely dynamic business environment to deliver strong top and bottom line growth, positioning Dow for greater value creation going forward. 
Moving to our segment performance on Slide 4, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $1.2 billion, up nearly $650 million versus the same quarter last year and $448 million sequentially. Resilient demand, tight market supply, disciplined price volume management and polyethylene inventory levels at 5-year lows enabled momentum in polyethylene earnings. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business achieved double-digit sales gains year-over-year and sequentially, driven by local price momentum in all regions. Versus the year ago period, local price gains were led by improvement in industrial and consumer packaging and flexible food and beverage packaging applications. 
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $326 million, up $151 million year-over-year due to strong supply and demand fundamentals in polyurethanes and construction chemicals. PAUSE And higher equity earnings led by continued improvement from Sadara. Sequentially, operating EBIT improved $30 million despite significant impact from winter storm Uri. The polyurethanes and construction and chemicals business achieved a double-digit net sales increase compared to the year ago period, led by local price momentum in polyurethanes. Demand growth in consumer durables  and appliances and industrial end markets was more than offset by volume limitations on the U.S. Gulf Coast and other third-party supply constraints related to the storm. These pricing and volume dynamics also drove sequential sales growth. 
The Industrial Solutions business delivered net sales in line with the year ago period as higher prices in all regions were offset by volume constraints primarily due to winter storm Uri. Improved demand in textiles and electronics applications was more than offset by supply limitations. Net sales were also in line sequentially due to the same drivers. 
And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $62 million down year-over-year as local price gains across the portfolio and strong demand for architectural coatings and silicones applications were more than offset by the impact of the winter storm as well as planned maintenance. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $12 million.
 The Consumer Solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year on local price increases for siloxane and robust demand for consumer, electronics and mobility applications. These gains more than offset the impact from planned maintenance. Sequentially, the business delivered local price gains across all regions and achieved sequential volume gains in all regions except Asia Pacific, where strong gains in performance silicones were more than offset by planned maintenance downtime at our Sandakan Siloxanes asset. PAUSE The Coatings and Performance Monomers business delivered higher net sales year-over-year, driven by price gains in all regions, notably in acryling monomers due to strong supply and demand fundamentals. Supply constraints from winter storm Uri and planned maintenance at our Deer Park asset more than offset continued demand strength for architectural coatings. Sequentially, the business achieved price gains, particularly in accruing monomers due to increases in raw material costs. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to review modeling guidance and the results of our annual benchmarking."

Moving to Slide 5, as we turn to the second quarter, market demand remains robust in packaging, electronics, mobility, architectural coatings as well as consumer durable end markets. While sectors like home care have begun to normalize, we",766,"Thank you, Jim. Moving to Slide 5, as we turn to the second quarter, market demand remains robust in packaging, electronics, mobility, architectural coatings as well as consumer durable end markets. While sectors like home care have begun to normalize, we do expect additional upside on continuing economic recovery in the industrial sector. And as travel, workplace and social activities resume, they will also provide a boost in demand for higher-margin personal care applications, as well as across the service sectors of the global economy. These constructive market trends will continue to support top and bottom line growth across all Dow operating segments in the second quarter. 
We are entering turnaround season in the Northern Hemisphere, and we expect increased spending of approximately $125 million sequentially, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast, including a turnaround at one of our crackers in Louisiana. We also expect an additional $100 million from outages, including a third-party supply disruption on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Collectively, robust demand, tight supply, low inventories and increased raw material costs are providing support for prices across many of our value chains. We expect the constrained industry inventory levels to continue in the second quarter, preventing inventory builds until later this year as we focus on clearing the growing backlog of customer orders. All combined for the second quarter, we expect approximately $750 million to $800 million in higher earnings versus the prior quarter from a combination of earnings momentum in our key chains and lower sequential costs from winter storm Uri. This earnings growth will be partially offset by approximately $200 million to $250 million in higher costs from turnarounds and the third-party outage I mentioned. Altogether, we expect second quarter to be our strongest performance since spin. 
Moving to Slide 6, we're also updating a few key items in our full year modeling guidance. The positive momentum I just mentioned will also benefit our joint ventures, particularly Sadara. We also expect to see slightly higher turnaround spending than previously anticipated as winter storm Uri has put some upward pressure on the cost of materials and labor in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Finally, our decision to freeze our U.S. pension plan accruals and contribute $1 billion to the U.S. pension plan, along with the subsequent remeasurement, provides an approximately $200 million tailwind to pension expense year-over-year. Overall, for the remainder of the year, we continue to see broad-based economic momentum, recovery from winter Storm Uri and elevated consumer demand. 
Moving to Slide 7, today, we also released our annual benchmarking update, which is available on our investor website and in this earnings presentation.PAUSE I continue to be very proud of our team's efforts to achieve top quartile results across most of our peer comparison performance metrics. To summarize our results, at the enterprise level, our focus on cash extended Dow's advantage on EBITDA to cash flow conversion and enabled free cash flow performance above peers, above the industry as well as above the broader market. This supported our continued leading dividend yield and further strengthened our balance sheet even through the pandemic. We also maintained our top quartile cost management and margin performance. 
At a segment level, Packaging & Specialty plastics outperformed the peer median across adjusted operating EBITDA margin, free cash conversion and SG&A and R&D spend. And Dow's operating EBITDA per pound of polyolefins capacity continues to outperform peers, expanding further in 2020. Both industrial intermediates and infrastructure as well as Performance Materials and coatings, outperformed the pure median on cash conversion as well as on SG&A and R&D spend. We do see near-term opportunities to improve adjusted operating EBITDA growth by continuing to implement our faster payback, higher ROIC expansions. This includes our ethylene cracker expansion in Canada, our FCDh retrofit, our polyglycols expansion and our downstream silicones expansions as well. And projects like the South China Specialties Hub will enable us to capture higher value polyurethane systems and alkoxylates demand in the fast-growing Asia Pacific market. 
Looking ahead, we are well positioned to grow earnings and maintain our track record of cash generation. Our differentiated consumer-led portfolio with leading positions across most of the markets we serve enables us to capture growth in our key value chains and ongoing market recovery in automotive and personal care. For example, in the mobility global megatrend alone, electric vehicles use 3 to 4x more Dow silicone products than traditional vehicles. 
Together, our strong operational, financial and commercial playbook, supported by the broadening economic recovery, positions Dow well for future earnings and cash flow growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

Moving to Slide 8, before discussing the market outlook, I want to reinforce how sustainability continues to be another growth driver for Dow. Last quarter, we shared our road map to achieving our 2030 carbon reduction targets. And this",906,"Thank you, Howard. Moving to Slide 8, before discussing the market outlook, I want to reinforce how sustainability continues to be another growth driver for Dow. Last quarter, we shared our road map to achieving our 2030 carbon reduction targets. And this past week, Columbia University and the Nature Conservancy announced our partnership to better account for the role of the materials and sustainable applications play in achieving emissions reduction, including plastics. 
Plastics have a lower carbon footprint than traditional materials, and we are leading the way to a circular economy for plastics. Through our stop the waste and close the loop targets, we're enabling 1 million metric tons of plastics to be collected, reused or recycled by 2030 and targeting 100% of our products sold into packaging applications to be reusable or recyclable by 2035. These targets require innovation and collaboration in mechanical and advanced recycling, as well as in designing for recyclability. To that end, through collaboration across the value chain with Dallas Pack studios, we're working to accelerate sustainable packaging solutions, tailor-made for those customers and consumer brand owners, many of which have set targets to incorporate 25% or more post-consumer recycled material in their products. 
We're helping consumer brands design their packaging to be fully recyclable. Our collaborations to develop fully formulated recyclable packaging solutions include developments with Kellogg's bare naked granola, Reckitt Ben Kaiser's finished Dishwashing Detergent and China's leading laundry brand, Lei, each enable a larger addressable market and sales of higher value Dow materials. 
We sell products containing mechanically recycled materials in every geography, and now we're beginning to scale a family of products that can be used in either flexible or rigid packaging applications. Dow is also developing advanced recycling technologies that convert used plastics into their feedstocks. We continue to scale up these capabilities with our partner, Phoenix Ecog group. And today, we announced a partnership with MIRA technology to convert plastics back into the oils and chemicals from which they were made for use in new virgin equivalent plastic products. This revolutionary advanced recycling technology can convert all forms of plastic into feedstock, including many considered to be unrecyclable. We're also actively engaged as a founder of the alliance to end plastic waste and with key stakeholders around the world to help solve critical challenges to plastics recycling. For example, through our collaboration with circulate capital, Dow is bringing material science capabilities to loop CRO plastic CLE and Marico Limited, one of India's leading consumer brands to enable sustainable, flexible film packaging with recycled content. 
Our actions to advance plastic circularity are value-accretive to Dow, and our differentiated product slate, downstream knowledge, intimacy with consumer brands and strategic partnerships give us a leading-edge to capture this growth. 
Turning to Slide 9, as Howard mentioned, Dow remains well positioned to benefit from improving industry and market conditions. We see several positive leading indicators, including momentum and job growth, consumer spending, a return to air travel and expanding manufacturing and industrial activity for global manufacturing PMIs at a 15-year high in March. These trends are further supported by government stimulus measures and accelerating vaccine rollouts globally. The spending elements of the U.S. infrastructure plan, if passed, will further support growth in our downstream markets. Similarly, incentives aligned to more sustainable energy solutions should be beneficial to our business and to attaining our own sustainability targets. These programs are not currently included in our assumptions, but could drive additional growth if enacted in a manner that supports manufacturing competitiveness. 
These macro trends translate into a 1 to 2x GDP growth across key end markets PAUSE including packaging, infrastructure, mobility, consumer durables and industrials and Home & Personal Care. Given this backdrop, we see demand in our key value chains continuing to outpace supply throughout 2021 and staying balanced in the near-term across ethylene, polyethylene, polyurethanes, acrylics and silicones chains. 
Some industry views call for softening conditions in the near term, largely based on their view of planned capacity additions. However, these views do not account for industry project delays or cancellations nor do they account for the maintenance activity or reliability impact from weather-related events like the winter storm. Industry delays and cancellations of planned capacity additions, along with elevated demand growth as the global economy continues to reopen, will likely lead to tighter than predicted market conditions, all of which will result in continued earnings, margin and cash flow growth for our core businesses and joint ventures in the near term. And while we capture these improved earnings over the next several years in our core businesses, PAUSE our current slate of lower capital, faster payback and higher return capacity expansions will add nearly $1 billion of accretive earnings to our bottom line. Dallas points of distinction continue to raise our earnings and cash flow potential relative to peers. The market growth we expect in our business, combined with our industry-leading feedstock flexibility, global scale and advantaged cost positions, our top quartile cash generation and our innovation and leadership in high-growth end markets enable Dow to continue to deliver value for our owners through 2021 and over the foreseeable future.

I don't anticipate we'll be looking at any kind of an inventory build until probably the fourth quarter.

And I feel good, given that we had about a $400 million impact from winter storm Uri in the quarter, we delivered $750 million of cash from operations. Obviously, we took an elective pension contribution in the quarter, but our cash flow generation continues to remain strong. 
We stepped up CapEx this year to a little over $1.6 billion to get our growth CapEx coming back up. And all of that is on faster payback types of projects. So for example, we started up a polyethylene glycol facility in the first quarter down in the Gulf Coast, which will be accretive this year. We also PAUSE just brought on another furnace in Fort Saskatchewan. The furnace part is active. So about half of the benefits of that start now, and we'll do some work on the back end of the cracker toward the end of the year and bring on the other half of that capacity. 
So if you think about the incremental projects that we have to deliver that $1 billion, I feel like we can be increasing capital towards depreciation and PAUSE and still be able to deliver that $1 billion of EBITDA growth. 
And then obviously, we want to continue to support the dividend. And if you think about our capital allocation priorities, they are in order safely and reliably operate the plants, continue to support that industry leading dividend, the growth CapEx, I mentioned, some incremental gross deleveraging. So we've got another $1 billion of targeted gross deleveraging to get our net debt-to-EBITDA ratios where we targeted them. And then share buyback to cover dilution.

The demand for both of the products is improving and the pricing for siloxanes, which has been one of the bigger drags on consumer solutions, is starting to move in the right direction.

And that's raised, obviously, the naphtha pricing and that's raised the floor around the world. 
The other thing that's happened though is we had growth in plastics and packaging, even through COVID. And so most people were expecting businesses to be down during that time. And I think they underestimated how much growth is there. We're seeing growth over 2020 in plastics. We would have seen in the first quarter without the winter storm. And so we're going to see that continue to grow. So I think we've got continued outlook for high earnings through the year on plastics. 
On bioplastics, we're doing some work right now on biomaterials to make plastics, really looking at wood byproduct derivatives that we can use to blend in with NAFTA. PAUSE We're doing some work with Phoenix Equity group to bring recycled materials back in. 
One of the challenges with bioplastics is not so much the degradability that everybody in the market likes, but it's their thermal stability in terms of being able to form them and do what you need to do with them, and then have them have the kind of durability you need for food packaging.

My sense is that the U.S. margins are going to see that and I think we're going to continue to see demand strong in China. We've seen a good rebound there. And then in Europe, we've seen good demand. It hasn't been as strong as the rest of the world. Obviously, the virus, it's had a little bit more impact. And Latin America has been similarly hit a little bit hard with the virus.

When you look at Sadara's operating performance, it really was a standout. I mean, all of our joint ventures did well in line with our core earnings growth that we reported. But when you look at the 3 joint ventures, Sadara actually had the best earnings growth, both year-on-year as well as sequentially.

This is 1 of the things I think that everybody is trying to wrestle with, and it's a very local issue because it gets into a variety of moving parts, including what's the cost to landfill materials. I would say that the demand pull is there from the brand owners and from the marketplace for more recycled content, and that's what's driving the investments. 
To date, most of the investments have been around mechanical recycling because it's very low cost, and it's also low energy intensity. And so the growth in those applications is great. But there's a limit to what that can do. So when you get into flexible packaging and a few other areas, you need advanced recycling. And there you get into technologies like pyrolysis and gasification to make that happen. PAUSE And that's a little bit more expensive. 
So as we move forward, I would think we're going to need to see a market-related price on carbon, which has been discussed in the EU and is also going to start being discussed here in the United States to help create that gap and that value will drive that return. And it's a little bit early to get into huge capital numbers or return numbers.

And so it doesn't take much from an interest rate perspective and maybe 1 year of additional ERA to really get that plan close to fully funded. So with that said, we'll be opportunistic. And if it makes sense economically, I mean that $1 billion voluntary pension payment was a very good economic decision for the company. And so we'll continue to look at that year-by-year from an economic perspective. And if it's value creating, we might do it, but we'll compare that to the other capital allocation priorities that Jim laid out earlier on the call."

Before we begin, I'd like to recognize and thank Colleen Kay, who announced her retirement from Dow after over 31 years of outstanding service, and also to welcome back Pankaj Gupta, who many of you already know. 
Starting on Slide 3. Our results for the first quarter once again demonstrated the focus and agility of Team Dow which enabled us to quickly recover from the impact of winter storm Uri on the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
This event had a far-reaching impact across our industry and broader market. Our colleagues quickly and safely got our units back online some of which began coming up within a week of the storm. All impacted Dow units are back online, and we reached pre-storm operating rates by the end of March, ahead of plan. 
Our team's efforts, combined with improving demand and tight industry supply conditions, drove results higher than the updated guidance we shared last month at the JPMorgan investor conference. At the company level, Dow achieved double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines, both year-over-year and sequentially. 
A few highlights in particular: Sales were up 22% year-over-year, with gains in all operating segments and in every region. We continued to benefit from strong price momentum, with improvements in all segments, businesses and regions. Volume was in line with the year ago period as gains in construction, mobility, electronics and consumer durables end markets, as well as higher energy demand, were offset by supply constraints from the storm, and we continue to improve our working capital efficiency with a net improvement of 3 days. 
Sales were also up sequentially with growth in all segments and regions. This top line growth and our continued focus on cost discipline led to bottom line growth and our highest EBIT quarter since spin. We achieved more than $700 million of EBIT growth from the year ago period and $500 million sequentially. 
We delivered equity earnings improvements of more than $300 million led by Sadara. Earlier this month, Sadara, with help from Dow and Saudi Aramco, worked to bring its mixed feed cracker back online faster than anticipated and downstream production units are also back at expected rates. 
We also completed key structural changes to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans in the quarter, which reduced the company's pension liability. Cash flow from operations was more than $750 million, excluding a $1 billion elective pension contribution. And Dow, Saudi Aramco and Sadara completed the joint venture's debt reprofiling, which will provide approximately $350 million cash tailwind to Dow in 2021. Sadara is now expected to be cash flow self-sufficient. In summary, Team Dow remained agile in an extremely dynamic business environment to deliver strong top and bottom line growth, positioning Dow for greater value creation going forward. 
Moving to our segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $1.2 billion, up nearly $650 million versus the same quarter last year and $448 million sequentially. Resilient demand, tight market supply, disciplined price volume management and polyethylene inventory levels at 5-year lows enabled momentum in polyethylene earnings. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business achieved double-digit sales gains year-over-year and sequentially, driven by local price momentum in all regions. Versus the year ago period, local price gains were led by improvement in industrial and consumer packaging and flexible food and beverage packaging applications. 
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $326 million, up $151 million year-over-year due to strong supply and demand fundamentals in polyurethanes and construction chemicals and higher equity earnings led by continued improvement from Sadara. Sequentially, operating EBIT improved $30 million despite significant impact from winter storm Uri. 
The Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business achieved a double-digit net sales increase compared to the year ago period, led by local price momentum in polyurethanes. Demand growth in consumer durables and appliances and industrial end markets was more than offset by volume limitations on the U.S. Gulf Coast and other third-party supply constraints related to the storm. These pricing and volume dynamics also drove sequential sales growth. 
The Industrial Solutions business delivered net sales in line with the year ago period as higher prices in all regions were offset by volume constraints primarily due to winter storm Uri. Improved demand in textiles and electronics applications was more than offset by supply limitations. Net sales were also in line sequentially due to the same drivers. 
And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $62 million, down year-over-year as local price gains across the portfolio and strong demand for architectural coatings and silicones applications were more than offset by the impact of the winter storm as well as planned maintenance. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $12 million.
The Consumer Solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year on local price increases for siloxane and robust demand for consumer, electronics and mobility applications. These gains more than offset the impact from planned maintenance. Sequentially, the business delivered local price gains across all regions and achieved sequential volume gains in all regions except Asia Pacific, where strong gains in performance silicones were more than offset by planned maintenance downtime at our Zhangjiagang siloxanes asset. 
The Coatings & Performance Monomers business delivered higher net sales year-over-year, driven by price gains in all regions, notably in acrylic monomers due to strong supply and demand fundamentals. Supply constraints from winter storm Uri and planned maintenance at our Deer Park asset more than offset continued demand strength for architectural coatings. Sequentially, the business achieved price gains, particularly in acrylic monomers due to increases in raw material costs. 
I'll now turn it over to Howard to review modeling guidance and the results of our annual benchmarking."

Moving to Slide 5, as we turn to the second quarter, market demand remains robust in packaging, electronics, mobility, architectural coatings as well as consumer durable end markets.

Moving to Slide 5, as we turn to the second quarter, market demand remains robust in packaging, electronics, mobility, architectural coatings as well as consumer durable end markets. While sectors like home care have begun to normalize, we do expect additional upside on continuing economic recovery in the industrial sector. And as travel, workplace and social activities resume, they will also provide a boost in demand for higher-margin personal care applications, as well as across the service sectors of the global economy. These constructive market trends will continue to support top and bottom line growth across all Dow operating segments in the second quarter. 
We are entering turnaround season in the Northern Hemisphere, and we expect increased spending of approximately $125 million sequentially, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast, including a turnaround at one of our crackers in Louisiana. We also expect an additional $100 million from outages, including a third-party supply disruption on the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
Collectively, robust demand, tight supply, low inventories and increased raw material costs are providing support for prices across many of our value chains. We expect the constrained industry inventory levels to continue in the second quarter, preventing inventory builds until later this year as we focus on clearing the growing backlog of customer orders. 
All combined for the second quarter, we expect approximately $750 million to $800 million in higher earnings versus the prior quarter from a combination of earnings momentum in our key chains and lower sequential costs from winter storm Uri. This earnings growth will be partially offset by approximately $200 million to $250 million in higher costs from turnarounds and the third-party outage I mentioned. Altogether, we expect second quarter to be our strongest performance since spin. 
Moving to Slide 6, we're also updating a few key items in our full year modeling guidance. The positive momentum I just mentioned will also benefit our joint ventures, particularly Sadara. We also expect to see slightly higher turnaround spending than previously anticipated as winter storm Uri has put some upward pressure on the cost of materials and labor in the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
Finally, our decision to freeze our U.S. pension plan accruals and contribute $1 billion to the U.S. pension plan, along with the subsequent remeasurement, provides an approximately $200 million tailwind to pension expense year-over-year. Overall, for the remainder of the year, we continue to see broad-based economic momentum, recovery from winter Storm Uri and elevated consumer demand. 
Moving to Slide 7. Today, we also released our annual benchmarking update, which is available on our investor website and in this earnings presentation. I continue to be very proud of our team's efforts to achieve top quartile results across most of our peer comparison performance metrics. 
To summarize our results, at the enterprise level, our focus on cash extended Dow's advantage on EBITDA to cash flow conversion and enabled free cash flow performance above peers, above the industry as well as above the broader market. This supported our continued leading dividend yield and further strengthened our balance sheet even through the pandemic. We also maintained our top quartile cost management and margin performance. 
At a segment level, Packaging & Specialty Plastics outperformed the peer median across adjusted operating EBITDA margin, free cash conversion and SG&A and R&D spend. And Dow's operating EBITDA per pound of polyolefins capacity continues to outperform peers, expanding further in 2020. 
Both Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure as well as Performance Materials & Coatings, outperformed the pure median on cash conversion as well as on SG&A and R&D spend. We do see near-term opportunities to improve adjusted operating EBITDA growth by continuing to implement our faster payback, higher ROIC expansions. This includes our ethylene cracker expansion in Canada, our FCDh retrofit, our polyglycols expansion and our downstream silicones expansions as well. And projects like the South China Specialties Hub will enable us to capture higher value polyurethane systems and alkoxylates demand in the fast-growing Asia Pacific market. 
Looking ahead, we are well positioned to grow earnings and maintain our track record of cash generation. Our differentiated consumer-led portfolio, with leading positions across most of the markets we serve, enables us to capture growth in our key value chains and ongoing market recovery in automotive and personal care. For example, in the mobility global megatrend alone, electric vehicles use 3 to 4x more Dow silicone products than traditional vehicles. 
Together, our strong operational, financial and commercial playbook, supported by the broadening economic recovery, positions Dow well for future earnings and cash flow growth. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."
9830660,710053033,2255502,"Dow Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Dow Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Howard. Moving to Slide 8, before discussing the market outlook, I want to reinforce how sustainability continues to be another growth driver for Dow. Last quarter, we shared our road map to achieving our 2030 carbon reduction targets. And this",866,"Thank you, Howard. Moving to Slide 8, before discussing the market outlook, I want to reinforce how sustainability continues to be another growth driver for Dow. Last quarter, we shared our road map to achieving our 2030 carbon reduction targets. And this past week, Columbia University and the Nature Conservancy announced our partnership to better account for the role of that materials and sustainable applications play in achieving emissions reduction, including plastics. 
Plastics have a lower carbon footprint than traditional materials, and we are leading the way to a circular economy for plastics. Through our ""stop the waste"" and ""close the loop"" targets, we're enabling 1 million metric tons of plastics to be collected, reused or recycled by 2030 and targeting 100% of our products sold into packaging applications to be reusable or recyclable by 2035. These targets require innovation and collaboration in mechanical and advanced recycling, as well as in designing for recyclability. 
To that end, through collaboration across the value chain with Dallas Pack Studios, we're working to accelerate sustainable packaging solutions, tailor-made for those customers and consumer brand owners, many of which have set targets to incorporate 25% or more post-consumer recycled material in their products. We're helping consumer brands design their packaging to be fully recyclable. 
Our collaborations to develop fully formulated recyclable packaging solutions include developments with Kellogg's Kashi Bear Naked Granola, Reckitt Benckiser's Finish Dishwashing Detergent and China's leading laundry brand, Liby. Each enable a larger addressable market and sales of higher value Dow materials. We sell products containing mechanically recycled materials in every geography, and now we're beginning to scale a family of products that can be used in either flexible or rigid packaging applications. 
Dow is also developing advanced recycling technologies that convert used plastics into their feedstocks. We continue to scale up these capabilities with our partner, Fuenix Ecogy Group. And today, we announced a partnership with Mura Technology, to convert plastics back into the oils and chemicals from which they were made for use in new virgin equivalent plastic products. This revolutionary advanced recycling technology can convert all forms of plastic into feedstock, including many considered to be unrecyclable. 
We're also actively engaged as a founder of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste and with key stakeholders around the world to help solve critical challenges to plastics recycling. For example, through our collaboration with Circulate Capital, Dow is bringing material science capabilities to Lucro Plastecycle and Marico Limited, one of India's leading consumer brands, to enable sustainable, flexible film packaging with recycled content. 
Our actions to advance plastic circularity are value-accretive to Dow. And our differentiated product slate, downstream knowledge, intimacy with consumer brands and strategic partnerships give us a leading-edge to capture this growth. 
Turning to Slide 9. As Howard mentioned, Dow remains well positioned to benefit from improving industry and market conditions. We see several positive leading indicators, including momentum and job growth, consumer spending, a return to air travel and expanding manufacturing and industrial activity for global manufacturing PMIs at a 15-year high in March. These trends are further supported by government stimulus measures and accelerating vaccine rollouts globally. 
The spending elements of the U.S. infrastructure plan, if passed, will further support growth in our downstream markets. Similarly, incentives aligned to more sustainable energy solutions should be beneficial to our business and to attaining our own sustainability targets. These programs are not currently included in our assumptions, but could drive additional growth if enacted in a manner that supports manufacturing competitiveness. 
These macro trends translate into a 1 to 2x GDP growth across key end markets, including packaging, infrastructure, mobility, consumer durables and industrials and home and personal care. Given this backdrop, we see demand in our key value chains continuing to outpace supply throughout 2021 and staying balanced in the near-term across ethylene, polyethylene, polyurethanes, acrylics and silicones chains. 
Some industry views call for softening conditions in the near term, largely based on their view of planned capacity additions. However, these views do not account for industry project delays or cancellations nor do they account for the maintenance activity or reliability impact from weather-related events like the winter storm. 
Industry delays and cancellations of planned capacity additions, along with elevated demand growth as the global economy continues to reopen will likely lead to tighter than predicted market conditions, all of which will result in continued earnings, margin and cash flow growth for our core businesses and joint ventures in the near term. And while we capture these improved earnings over the next several years in our core businesses, our current slate of lower capital, faster payback and higher return capacity expansions will add nearly $1 billion of accretive earnings to our bottom line. 
Dow's points of distinction continue to raise our earnings and cash flow potential relative to peers. The market growth we expect in our business, combined with our industry-leading feedstock flexibility, global scale and advantaged cost positions, our top quartile cash generation and our innovation and leadership in high-growth end markets enable Dow to continue to deliver value for our owners through 2021 and over the foreseeable future. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open the Q&A."

And I feel good, given that we had about a $400 million impact from winter storm Uri in the quarter, we delivered $750 million of cash from operations. Obviously, we took an elective pension contribution in the quarter, but our cash flow generation continues to remain strong. 
We stepped up CapEx this year to a little over $1.6 billion to get our growth CapEx coming back up. And all of that is on faster payback types of projects. So for example, we started up a polyethylene glycol facility in the first quarter down in the Gulf Coast, which will be accretive this year. We also just brought on another furnace in Fort Saskatchewan. The furnace part is active. So about half of the benefits of that start now, and we'll do some work on the back end of the cracker toward the end of the year and bring on the other half of that capacity. So if you think about the incremental projects that we have to deliver that $1 billion, I feel like we can be increasing capital towards depreciation and still be able to deliver that $1 billion of EBITDA growth. 
And then obviously, we want to continue to support the dividend. And if you think about our capital allocation priorities, they are in order: safely and reliably operate the plants, continue to support that industry leading dividend, the growth CapEx, I mentioned, some incremental gross deleveraging. So we've got another $1 billion of targeted gross deleveraging to get our net debt-to-EBITDA ratios where we targeted them. And then share buyback to cover dilution. And right now, that's where we'll stop on share buyback.

We had the siloxanes plant in China down, and we had the Deer Park facility down for maintenance. And then, of course, the winter storm really lengthened that maintenance. 
The demand for both of the products is improving and the pricing for siloxanes, which has been one of the bigger drags on consumer solutions, is starting to move in the right direction. And a lot of that is because automotive demand is coming back and construction is coming back. And we have yet to see Personal care, which I think is going to come back through the year. 
And on top of coatings and monomers, monomers were strong in the quarter. Architectural coatings and specialty do-it-yourself continues to be strong.

And that's raised, obviously, the naphtha pricing and that's raised the floor around the world. 
The other thing that's happened though is we had growth in plastics and packaging, even through COVID. And so most people were expecting businesses to be down during that time. And I think they underestimated how much growth is there. We're seeing growth over 2020 in plastics. We would have seen in the first quarter without the winter storm. And so we're going to see that continue to grow. So I think we've got continued outlook for high earnings through the year on plastics. 
On bioplastics, we're doing some work right now on biomaterials to make plastics, really looking at wood byproduct derivatives that we can use to blend in with naphtha. We're doing some work with Fuenix Ecogy Group to bring recycled materials back in. 
One of the challenges with bioplastics is not so much the degradability that everybody in the market likes, but it's their thermal stability in terms of being able to form them and do what you need to do with them, and then have them have the kind of durability you need for food packaging. But we're open to collaborations in those areas, and we're always looking for new things that we can do in that space."

Same is true for polyurethanes and isocyanates. You see the downstream demand pull is very strong. And siloxanes pricing improvements is all driven by downstream demand improvements. So my sense is that we're going to be in strong operating rate territory for the entire year. I don't think we'll be building inventory until maybe possibly the end of fourth quarter, which -- and that all depends on whether we have a slow fourth quarter or not.

This is one of the things I think that everybody is trying to wrestle with, and it's a very local issue because it gets into a variety of moving parts, including what's the cost to landfill materials. I would say that the demand pull is there from the brand owners and from the marketplace for more recycled content, and that's what's driving the investments. 
To date, most of the investments have been around mechanical recycling because it's very low cost, and it's also low energy intensity. And so the growth in those applications is great. But there's a limit to what that can do. So when you get into flexible packaging and a few other areas, you need advanced recycling. And there you get into technologies like pyrolysis and gasification to make that happen. And that's a little bit more expensive. 
So as we move forward, I would think we're going to need to see a market-related price on carbon, which has been discussed in the EU and is also going to start being discussed here in the United States to help create that gap and that value that will drive that return. And it's a little bit early to get into huge capital numbers or return numbers.

So I don't think the first quarter is reflective of the market for PM&C. And I don't think the business continues to struggle. Downstream silicon, the high-margin part of silicones downstream got hit pretty hard during COVID, obviously, personal care applications. But also we saw construction down really last year, and it's starting to come back. So right now, you're starting to see strength in siloxane, you're starting to see strength in construction. Mostly it's been residential construction, but it's moving back into high rise buildings. Again, consumer electronics is driving it. industrial manufacturing is driving it, and mobility, as Howard mentioned. 
EVs is really positive for us on a Dow overall standpoint. We get about twice -- 50% more content on an EV than an internal combustion engine. On a silicon standpoint, we've got about 3 to 4x more than an internal combustion engine. So we're seeing surges there. 
So I think you're going to see PM&C improve as the year goes through. And obviously, we'd have had a much better quarter without the Deer Park downtime and the extension of that due to the winter storm Uri. So I would say, let's look at PM&C as the year progresses. I think you're going to see a good story coming out of that business."

Dow continued to capture strong demand across our value chains during the second quarter. Team Dow's focus on execution, cost discipline and balanced capital allocation enabled us to deliver our strongest quarterly earnings performance in the company's history, both pre and post spin, with substantial growth in net sales and earnings year-over-year and sequentially. 
We achieved double-digit sales gains in all operating segments and businesses. A 66% increase in sales relative to the year ago period was led by local price improvement of 53% combined with a 9% volume increase. Robust demand and the recovery of the global economy continues from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales increased 17% sequentially, underpinned by tight supply and demand fundamentals across all of our value chains. 
We delivered higher operating EBIT of $2.8 billion year-over-year and $1.3 billion sequentially, with improvements in all segments and businesses. These gains were fueled by strong top line growth and margin expansion. 
We also benefited from increased equity earnings, up more than $370 million year-over-year, led by higher margins at Sadara and the Kuwait joint ventures. Sequentially, equity earnings were up $54 million, primarily from the Thai joint ventures. 
Cash flow from operations was $2 billion and free cash flow was $1.7 billion, up significantly both year-over-year and sequentially. This enabled a balanced execution of our capital allocation priorities. 
We continued our proactive liability management actions by reducing gross debt by more than $1 billion in the quarter, and reducing our annual interest expense by $35 million. Today, Dow has no substantial long-term debt maturities due until the end of 2025. 
We also returned more than $700 million to shareholders in the quarter through our industry-leading dividend and we resumed our share buyback program to cover dilution. 
Finally, we continue to advance Dow's ESG priorities by releasing our consolidated ESG report, INtersections, which provides enhanced transparency on our environmental, social and governance priorities. The interactive, digital report can be found at the top of our corporate website. 
In summary, Team Dow maintained a relentless focus on meeting increasing customer demand despite lingering supply impacts across many value chains and marking a strong rebound from Winter Storm Uri. We continue to execute on our operational and financial playbook, delivering another strong quarter and a solid first half performance. 
Turning to our segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $2 billion, up nearly $1.7 billion year-over-year and more than $780 million sequentially. Price gains in both businesses and in all regions led to integrated margin improvement and increased equity earnings. On a sequential basis, the segment expanded operating EBIT margins by 810 basis points on continued local price gains in olefins and in packaging applications. 
The Packaging and Specialty Plastics business reported sales gains year-over-year driven by improvement in packaging applications for industrial & consumer packaging and flexible food and beverage packaging end markets. Volumes declined year-over-year and sequentially due to lower polyethylene supply from the lingering effects of Winter Storm Uri and our own planned maintenance turnarounds. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered local price gains in all regions. 
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was nearly $650 million, up more than $860 million year-over-year, primarily due to the pandemic recovery, combined with tight supply and strong demand in both businesses. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $320 million and operating EBIT margins expanded by 640 basis points driven by margin improvement and offset somewhat by continued supply constraints from Winter Storm Uri. 
The Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year ago period on strong local price in all value chains, demand recovery in durable goods and appliances and construction end markets and currency tailwinds. 
Despite industry supply chain challenges across a number of end markets, including mobility, the business delivered sequential sales growth on increased local price and volumes. 
The Industrial Solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year ago period as a result of local price gains and offerings for coatings, industrial and electronics end markets across all regions. Improved demand for materials used in industrial manufacturing, coatings and infrastructure were more than offset by planned maintenance turnarounds and some third-party supply limitations. Net sales also increased sequentially on local price gains in all regions. 
And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $225 million, up nearly $200 million from the year ago period. Operating EBIT margins increased 760 basis points on price gains and strong consumer and industrial demand recovery. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up more than $160 million due to price momentum and lower planned maintenance costs. 
The Consumer Solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year as demand recovery for silicones products led to local price and volume gains in all regions. Sequentially, the business achieved broad-based volume growth due to lower planned maintenance activity and strong demand in silicones applications, including personal care, as certain geographies began to experience an increase in travel and a return to workplace and social activities, with notable improvements in China. 
The Coatings and Performance Monomers business delivered higher net sales year-over-year, driven by price gains in all regions. Increased demand for coatings applications was offset by lingering raw material and logistical constraints from Winter Storm Uri. Sequentially, the business achieved local price gains on tight supply and strong demand fundamentals and increased raw material costs as well as increased volume from strong seasonal demand for industrial and architectural coatings. 
Now I'll turn it over to Howard to review our outlook."
9830660,717750025,2349218,"Dow Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2021",2021-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Dow Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Moving to our third quarter modeling guidance on Slide 5. Strong consumer demand trends continue in retail, housing and the manufacturing sectors and inventory levels remain low across most of our value chains",834,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Moving to our third quarter modeling guidance on Slide 5. 
Strong consumer demand trends continue in retail, housing and the manufacturing sectors and inventory levels remain low across most of our value chains. We expect these dynamics to continue to support price strength in the third quarter as the industry continues to work to fulfill pent-up demand. 
In our Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, downstream converter and brand owner inventories remain at all-time lows with balances very tight. Recent small increases in producer inventories are due to a heavy turnaround season for the industry, and yet industry days demand and inventory actually declined nearly 8% month-over-month on tight supply, coupled with increased domestic and export demand. This data includes Dow, where we expect an approximately $150 million increase in the third quarter turnaround spending sequentially for planned maintenance at our crackers in Canada and in Spain, as well as $100 million lower earnings from nonrecurring license activity which occurred in the second quarter. ACC data indicates domestic demand for packaging applications reached its strongest level in history in June, and we expect a continuation of these positive demand trends as customers are reporting 45- to 60-day backlogs. 
Moving to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. Strong consumer demand for durable goods continues, underpinned by order strength throughout the value chain. Housing and construction markets, particularly in the U.S., continue to support robust demand for polyurethane applications. Industrial and oil-related end markets are expected to continue to see gradual recovery sequentially, providing additional support for solvents and other industrial solutions. We also expect $30 million of additional planned maintenance turnaround spending at our joint ventures in the quarter. 
And in Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect a continuation of strong demand for electronics, mobility and infrastructure silicone solutions. We expect to benefit as social activity increases on easing pandemic-related restrictions, including sequential improvement for personal care applications. These trends are supporting price momentum across the silicones value chain, and we anticipate increased turnaround spending of approximately $30 million in our Consumer Solutions business in the quarter, including a turnaround at our siloxane pillar plant in Barry. Demand for do-it-yourself architectural coatings remains robust, and we expect to see an increase in contractor-related demand as new home builds increase and consumer and home social engagements begin to resume. 
All together, with robust demand expected to continue, our advantaged portfolio is positioned to capture significant value moving forward. We've updated a few full year items which can be found in the appendix of the slide presentation. Notably, we are expecting higher equity earnings, and with the improved earnings profile at Sadara, we now anticipate approximately $50 million of cash inflow to Dow in 2021.  
Turning to Slide 6. Around the world, increasingly positive trends indicate we remain in the early stages of economic recovery with an extended runway for growth. While industrial production is up nearly 20% over the year-ago low, it still has not reached pre-pandemic levels. Retail inventory to sales is at its lowest levels in more than 3 decades, and strong demand continues to counter near-term potential restocking efforts. U.S. housing starts increased again in May and are projected to continue rising, supported by limited supply of single-family homes due to a decade of underbuilding. And the proposed U.S. infrastructure bill has the potential to further elevate the already strong GDP estimates projected around the world. 
As vaccination rates increase around the world and economies continue to reopen, pent-up consumer demand and increased personal savings built over the past year should also provide an additional boost to the global economy. Consumer confidence continues to climb on conviction that economic conditions will continue to improve, supporting continued purchases of homes, automobiles and other durable goods. Business travel sentiment continued to improve in May with more than half of U.S. companies planning to resume domestic business travel within the next 3 months. 
The personal care market, which has been one of the slowest to recover, began to see a rebound in the second quarter, with increases in U.S. cosmetics and beauty product sales on rising consumer demand. And as borders reopen, recreational activities and international travel should also boost economic activity, while we're mindful that there will absolutely be some regional variations in the timing and the pace of the recovery. 
Along with these trends, we anticipate the strong demand we experienced in the second quarter across our polyethylene, polyurethane, acrylic and silicone chains to extend through the second half of 2021. Polyethylene demand growth, for example, is projected to outpace supply additions in the near term, with pricing strength and resilient margins on a sustained and favorable oil-to-gas ratio, with the majority of industry capacity adds coming in the higher end of the cost curve. 
Altogether, we expect these strong market dynamics, tight supply-demand fundamentals and ongoing economic expansion across our key chains to continue to drive earnings and cash flow growth. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

Turning to Slide 7. Dow's consumer-driven portfolio is uniquely positioned to benefit from the demand trends that Howard outlined a moment ago which continued to translate into an attractive $650 billion addressable market with approximately 1.3 to 1.5x GDP growth across our packaging, infrastructure, mobility and consumer care end markets. These demand trends in our fast-growing markets are underpinned by an accelerated transition towards more sustainable materials, providing ample opportunities for Dow to continue to innovate with our customers and brand owners to enhance the sustainability of our products and value chain while advancing our net 0 carbon and circular economy targets. 
For example, as the mobility sector continues its transition to more sustainable solutions, electric and autonomous vehicles offer upside of approximately 50% more revenue across multiple Dow chemistries versus traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, including high-value polyurethanes, silicones and silicone hybrid-based adhesives and engineering sealants widely used in battery assembly, noise and vibration reduction, drivetrain, comfort and heat management applications. 
Our new Dow [ fuel ] silicone technologies for electric and hybrid vehicle applications help OEMs to meet the evolving needs of automotive electrification while advancing vehicle performance, reliability and sustainability. 
And we recently introduced SPECFLEX C, a new polyurethane solutions sourced from recycled raw materials to help automotive OEMs meet demand for more circular products and their sustainability goals. 
We also continue to align our growth CapEx to address this growing market demand for sustainable materials. This quarter, we outlined our road map to reduce CO2 emissions by more than 40% by 2030 from our manufacturing operations in Terneuzen, The Netherlands. And Dow and Shell demonstrated progress on our joint technology to electrically heat steam cracker furnaces, receiving partial funding from the Dutch government. And together, we are evaluating construction of a multi-megawatt pilot plant with start-up in 2025. We plan to share more detail on our strategic and financial priorities to continue creating long-term value for all our stakeholders at our upcoming 2021 Investor Day on October 6 which will be hosted both virtually and in person in New York City. Stay tuned for more details. We look forward to engaging with you. 
On Slide 8, as we shared last quarter, we continue to see demand across our ethylene, polyethylene, polyurethanes, acrylics and silicones value chains outpacing supply through 2021 and staying balanced in the near term. These market dynamics will be further supported through 2022 and beyond by the GDP [ fuel ] market growth trends we just discussed. 
Some industry views call for softening conditions largely based on their view of announced capacity additions. However, they do not account for industry delays and cancellations, and when coupled with elevated demand growth from continued reopening of the global economy, will likely lead to tighter-than-forecasted market conditions, all of which will result in continued earnings, margin and cash flow growth for Dow in the near term. 
And while we capture these improved earnings in our core businesses, our current slate of lower capital, faster payback and higher return capacity expansions will generate an additional $1 billion of accretive earnings over the next several years, with many projects delivering earnings already this year, such as our ethylene derivatives at the Thai joint ventures, polyethylene for high-performance packaging applications at our Alberta operations and surfactants for leading brand owners laundry and home care end markets. 
And notably, in the second quarter, we progressed our polyethylene glycol incremental expansion, completing customer qualification ahead of schedule and beginning shipments of our industry-leading CARBOWAx-centri polyethylene glycol active pharmaceutical ingredients. 
Combined with favorable supply and demand fundamentals, these projects further enable Dow to continue to deliver significant value for our owners over this foreseeable future. 
We'll close on Slide 9. Our steadfast execution of the operational and financial playbook that we outlined at spin, combined with our agile response to market conditions over the past year, have enabled us to deliver strong performance and enhanced value to our shareholders. We are uniquely positioned to continue building on that strong foundation today. 
Our value proposition starts with our differentiated portfolio and an asset base that is characterized by, first, our feedstock flexibility and position, which supports our low-cost position and enables us to drive higher asset utilization and maximize cash margins as we quickly balance our feedstock and product mix to supply end demand dynamics. 
And second, our leading scale, global footprint and differentiated portfolio provide us with access to high-growth end markets in all major regions. We have achieved strong performance in this early part of the economic recovery and remain advantaged through our participation in higher-margin functional polymers, silicones and formulated systems. We continue to develop innovative solutions to address our customers' needs and capture the opportunities arising from critical market trends. Our high-value adhesives and innovative packaging solutions support the rapidly growing e-commerce sector. 
Through our mobility science platform, we are targeting low-carbon enabling, mobility, electric and autonomous vehicle opportunities. 
More broadly, across our portfolio, we are enhancing the sustainability of our solutions and the value chains they serve. For example, deploying lower carbon energy solutions in gas trading, carbon capture and concentrated solar power at our operations. 
And through value chain collaboration, we are increasing post-consumer recycled content in our products and enabling the design of fully recyclable packaging. Today, more than 80% of Dow products for packaging applications are reusable or recyclable, and our research and technical teams are working actively on the remainder to achieve that same goal. 
Beyond the strength of our portfolio and our innovation investments, our deliberate focus on operating discipline and balanced capital allocation approach are critical elements of our value creation playbook. We have achieved top quartile cost structure and cash conversion and our restructuring efforts will yield an additional $300 million in earnings, all while maintaining a best owner mindset. 
We also delivered a return on invested capital of greater than 14% on a trailing 12-month basis. At the same time, we have prioritized investments in our downstream, higher margin, faster payback opportunities and upstream investments that expand our leading ESG profile while increasing our capital expenditures by $350 million this year. 
We reduced net debt by approximately $5 million since the end of 2018. Dow's strong operational and financial performance this year resulted in a credit rating upgrade by S&P and an upgraded outlook by Fitch, supporting our strong investment-grade balance sheet. 
And we continue to return significant cash to shareholders through our industry-leading dividend. 
In closing, Dow is uniquely advantaged to continue delivering value through our best-in-class, consumer-led portfolio, our leadership in innovation and sustainability and our strong operating and financial discipline. With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open the Q&A."

I do expect we'll see some of that soften as we move forward. I think long term, we expect natural gas prices to be between $2.75 and $3 a million BTU. So that's positive. And with these oil-to-gas ratios, I think we're going to see that continue. 
One of the things that happened with oil, obviously, is everybody looked at the oil supply coming on, but I think they failed to look at demand for oil. And as the economy reopens, there's going to be another step-up in demand. So I think some of that supply is just necessary to get ready for the increase in demand that's coming."

Uri was a little bit different in that it was so widespread. And it was not just us, but it was everything upstream and downstream [ above ] gas production, electricity, water. The biggest damage, obviously, was [indiscernible]. And so you can't winterize everything to prepare for that, but you can winterize some things. And if you have some advanced notice, you can actually take some things down and protect them. And so the team has gone through that. And we've got an updated game plan on what we would do in the face of a situation like that again. 
I think the whole industry is going through it. I know ERCOT is going through that on the power side. Winterization is a big part of what they're doing and what they're requesting us to do as well because we are a supplier into ERCOT. 
So I do think there's some positive developments since Winter Storm Uri. And the widespread nature of it is what caught everybody and has taken so long to work through."

For most companies, the shipping costs and the CO2 footprint and the shipping cost will drive that. 
And so I just use a paper versus plastic scenario in a grocery store. One truckload of plastic shopping bags would take 4 to 5 truckloads of paper bags to replace it.

There are some functional polymers that are made out of ethylene and polyethylene derivatives that are continuing to grow, materials for construction that are positive. You're going to see growth in some other applications like products that go into alternative energy, both solar panels for encapsulation, wind blades and other types of applications. So I think we can sustain that over a long period of time, which is positive."

Good question, Bob. We're seeing a real demand pull from consumers and brand owners that want more post-consumer recycled material in there or they want more material that's made from either a biosource to ethylene or something that is made from advanced recycling to get back to feedstock and back to a product. 
I think the drivers that are going to help on the virgin side of things are obviously redesign of packaging types on flexible packaging, many packages are complicated and hard to recycle. I think one of the positives of our portfolio right now is the greater than 80% of our portfolio is fully recyclable or reusable today, and the research team and the tech service team are working hard to get the rest of that to 100%. 
All the brand owners are working on redesigns right now of different packages to move away from complex structures into simpler structures. We use that [indiscernible] granola example with Kellogg's, where that package has been redesigned. This is going on across the value chain. We're seeing the investments in mechanical recycling and advanced recycling pick up. We're seeing the number of states that are approving advanced recycling projects pick up. And I think our next big impact is going to be on infrastructure at the state and local level to allow more collection of curbside recycling of more products. And that will be the next drive north. We still have a long way to go even to catch up with Europe. In the United States, we have a long way to go to get to that 35% of recycling. 
We set a target by 2030 to collect or reuse or recycle 1 million metric tons of plastic through our own actions and partnerships. And I can tell you, I'm pushing the team to always pull that number forward and get that done faster. And I think we're seeing real demand in taking recycled packaging products into some things that are more durable and longer lived, building materials, using recycled plastics in aggregate for roadways, architectural decking, all kinds of things that are upgrading the use of end-of-life plastics. So I think over time, it's going to be a real positive."

I mean, that's what we see today in the EU on the market and translate that back into dollars as well. 
I would say that is not a high enough price of carbon to drive the change that needs to be made because the lower carbon technologies are much more expensive than that. But it is enough to put pressure on us to make sure that all of our projects have lower carbon approaches to them. And one of the things we'll talk about at Investor Day is the work we did to kind of outline the next 20, 30 years of how we would get there. 
I think carbon capture, as we talk about, as we get beyond this infrastructure build that's in front of Congress right now and we get to the next step, you've got to look at advanced technologies. And carbon capture and blue hydrogen are 2 that we have to keep an eye on. Those are the lowest cost next step for us to get our industry to low CO2. But they're a lot more than EUR 55 a tonne to deliver that. And so without the right tax incentive or support from government in terms of investment in those technologies, you would need a market price on carbon that is much higher than that. We're -- we're right on top of that and we're very attuned with that. And that's one of the things that we're piloting in Terneuzen. That's the 40% reduction that I talked about by 2030, is we're looking at blue hydrogen and carbon capture to try to make an improvement at that site."

About 50% of the global polyethylene adds through 2025 are higher-cost naphtha or coal to olefins or methanol to olefins. About 35% are naphtha, about 15% are coal to olefins, methanol to olefins. 
60% of the capacity adds through 2025 are in Northeast Asia. And when you think about the Chinese projects that are in construction or in start-up phase, about 50% of those will come to market around the announced dates. And so that's -- in 2021 to 2023, that's about 12 million [ metric tons ] out of 24 total. 
Capacity increases are going to obviously reduce some imports into China. And so that will be domestic. And we don't see China as being an exporter at those levels. 
I would also say that you've got some existing crackers that are considered unreliable due to some trade risk, but it's only in the neighborhood of 2 million to 3 million metric tons. 
Long term, right now, there are supply demand -- there are supply additions that are about 31 million metric tons on the books. In our view, on delays or cancellations, are in the 6 million to 15 million metric tons on delays or cancellations. Demand growth is going to be 25 million metric tons. So we're going to be balanced to short by about 9 million metric tons during that time frame. And in the near term, with these GDP growth rates, things are going to be tight. 
So we're looking at growth. I mentioned to Jeff's question earlier a 600 kt expansion on polyethylene, that's in the cards. Incremental expansions on ethylene, those are in the cards. We're doing work on our own FCDh technology and our EDH technology in the Gulf to try to have low carbon moves forward. 
I think one of the things that has to be resolved before you see a next wave of announcements is what are the policies going to be in the United States around carbon, carbon border adjustment mechanisms, carbon tax, perhaps a voluntary emissions trading scheme. And we have to know what those are. We have to know how China is going to play on the global footprint. And we have to see how Europe is moving forward. All of those have to be resolved before we can see what the right place is to make that next step. But we're working on projects, and we're looking for the right opportunity."

And I've said before and I'll continue to say it, we need to have a real constructive and open dialogue about how much it costs to do this. I think, idealistically, 
everybody is in agreement that we want to make improvements and we want to reduce carbon emissions and we want to get to net 0. But nobody's yet, at a government level or any level, having the educated discussion that we need to have about the cost of doing this. 
What will happen in Europe is Europe has -- the way the emissions trading game works in Europe is they have price for carbon, but they also have allowances for energy -- for emissions emitters. And if you're under your allowances, you can trade those carbon credits. What they will do over time is they will ratchet back the allowances and they'll start to put everybody over their allowances and that will start to drive the prices up and that will drive the incentives to make the conversion. 
So Europe is less concerned right now with what the cost is to everybody and more concerned with trying to drive that number up and drive the conversion. And we're in the middle there trying to talk to them realistically about what the price is to do this, what the technologies are today and scale up the ones that we think are the most cost effective going forward, blue hydrogen, carbon capture to be able to do that. 
So I think as we work through that over the next 2 or 3 years, we'll start to make some progress to that. And I would say all heavy industry and the power and utility sector are taking a look at this, but with eyes wide open that it's not free. 
And the other thing to remember on hydrogen, is as you move to a hydrogen economy, the most effective way to make most of that hydrogen is through steam methane reforming which uses natural gas, which means you're going to need a lot more natural gas production to make that hydrogen. And that's one of the other discussions that is difficult to get on the table right now."

We are starting to see consumer preference drive the brand owners for lower carbon and more recyclable products.

So as you say, the policies are not there right now. And what we're trying to work through are the right set of policies that we need to make value-creating investments going forward. 
I would say the consumer drive and the consumer preference on this is going to be the thing that makes it happen. 
The other reality is, I believe that the market premiums are starting to show up in some of the plastics today. When it comes to post-consumer recycled materials into packaging, we're seeing a strong pull from the brand owners and we're starting to see premiums. If you go back a decade, we had not seen that. And so you've got brand owners who are announcing that they're allocating premiums for recycled materials to address circularity, I think that's a sign that their customers want it. And when you get it down to a per package basis, it's very small. The problem comes through the value chain and the cost to manufacture the materials. But if you take it down to a per package basis on the shelf at a supermarket, it might add $0.01 to the cost of a product that you buy. It isn't significant at the consumer level. It's significant through the value chain."

for chemicals that are made from those raw materials going into not only single-family homes, but also larger construction like commercial construction. I think those demands are going to continue to stay strong and the supply demand will continue to be tight. You saw strong pricing in both PO as well as isocyanates. There's not a lot of new capacity coming on in that space. 
And then additionally, in ethylene oxide and ethylene oxide derivatives in the Industrial Solutions business, those end markets are continuing to grow. And on top of that, we have several new capacity adds that are coming for things like pharmaceutical incipient, a product called polyethylene glycol that we just made an expansion on, we've got some other materials coming through there. And we have a host of low VOC solvents in that portfolio that go into the coatings sector. So around the world, as coatings move away from traditional organic solvents into waterborne or lower VOC solvents, that benefits our portfolio.

Dow continued to capture strong demand across our value chains during the second quarter. Team Dow's focus on execution, cost discipline and balanced capital allocation enabled us to deliver our strongest quarterly earnings performance in the company's history, both pre and post spin, with substantial growth in net sales and earnings year-over-year and sequentially.  
We achieved double-digit sales gains in all operating segments and businesses. A 66% increase in sales relative to the year ago period was led by local price improvement of 53% combined with a 9% volume increase. Robust demand and the recovery of the global economy continues from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales increased 17% sequentially, underpinned by tight supply and demand fundamentals across all of our value chains.  
We delivered higher operating EBIT of $2.8 billion year-over-year and $1.3 billion sequentially, with improvements in all segments and businesses. These gains were fueled by strong top line growth and margin expansion.  
We also benefited from increased equity earnings, up more than $370 million year-over-year, led by higher margins at Sadara and the Kuwait joint ventures. Sequentially, equity earnings were up $54 million, primarily from the Thai joint ventures.  
Cash flow from operations was $2 billion and free cash flow was $1.7 billion, up significantly both year-over-year and sequentially. This enabled a balanced execution of our capital allocation priorities.  
We continued our proactive liability management actions by reducing gross debt by more than $1 billion in the quarter and reducing our annual interest expense by $35 million. Today, Dow has no substantial long-term debt maturities due until the end of 2025.  
We  also returned more than $700 million to shareholders in the quarter through our industry-leading dividend, and we resumed our share buyback program to cover dilution.  
Finally, we continued to advance Dow's ESG priorities by releasing our consolidated ESG report, INtersections, which provides enhanced transparency on our environmental, social and governance priorities. The interactive digital report can be found at the top of our corporate website.  
In summary, Team Dow maintained a relentless focus on meeting increasing customer demand despite lingering supply impacts across many value chains and marking a strong rebound from Winter Storm Uri. We continued to execute on our operational and financial playbook, delivering another strong quarter and a solid first half performance.  
Turning to our segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $2 billion, up nearly $1.7 billion year-over-year and more than $780 million sequentially. Price gains in both businesses and in all regions led to integrated margin improvement and increased equity earnings. On a sequential basis, the segment expanded operating EBIT margins by 810 basis points on continued local price gains in olefins and in packaging applications.  
The Packaging and Specialty Plastics business reported sales gains year-over-year driven by improvement in packaging applications for industrial & consumer packaging and flexible food & beverage packaging end markets. Volumes declined year-over-year and sequentially due to lower polyethylene supply from the lingering effects of Winter Storm Uri and our own planned maintenance turnarounds. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered local price gains in all regions.  
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT was nearly $650 million, up more than $860 million year-over-year, primarily due to the pandemic recovery, combined with tight supply and strong demand in both businesses. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $320 million and operating EBIT margins expanded by 640 basis points, driven by margin improvement and offset somewhat by continued supply constraints from Winter Storm Uri.  
The Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year ago period on strong local price in all value chains, demand recovery in durable goods & appliances and construction end markets and currency tailwinds.  
Despite industry supply chain challenges across a number of end markets, including mobility, the business delivered sequential sales growth on increased local price and volumes.  
The Industrial Solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year ago period as a result of local price gains in offerings for coatings, industrial and electronics end markets across all regions. Improved demand for materials used in industrial manufacturing, coatings and infrastructure were more than offset by planned maintenance turnarounds and some third-party supply limitations. Net sales also increased sequentially on local price gains in all regions.  
And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $225 million, up nearly $200 million from the year ago period. Operating EBIT margins increased 760 basis points on price gains and strong consumer and industrial demand recovery. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up more than $160 million due to price momentum and lower planned maintenance costs.  
The Consumer Solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year as demand recovery for silicones products led to local price and volume gains in all regions. Sequentially, the business achieved broad-based volume growth due to lower planned maintenance activity and strong demand in silicones applications, including personal care, as certain geographies began to experience an increase in travel and a return to workplace and social activities, with notable improvements in China.  
The Coatings & Performance Monomers business delivered higher net sales year-over-year driven by price gains in all regions. Increased demand for coatings applications was offset by lingering raw material and logistical constraints from Winter Storm Uri. Sequentially, the business achieved local price gains on tight supply and strong demand fundamentals and increased raw material costs as well as increased volume from strong seasonal demand for industrial and architectural coatings.  
Now I'll turn it over to Howard to review our outlook."

Moving to our third quarter modeling guidance on Slide 5.  Strong consumer demand trends continue in retail, housing and the manufacturing sectors and inventory levels remain low across most of our value chain",831,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Moving to our third quarter modeling guidance on Slide 5.  
Strong consumer demand trends continue in retail, housing and the manufacturing sectors and inventory levels remain low across most of our value chains. We expect these dynamics to continue to support price strength in the third quarter as the industry continues to work to fulfill pent-up demand.  
In our Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, downstream converter and brand-owner inventories remain at all-time lows with balances very tight. Recent small increases in producer inventories are due to a heavy turnaround season for the industry, and yet industry days demand and inventory actually declined nearly 8% month-over-month on tight supply, coupled with increased domestic and export demand. This data includes Dow, where we expect an approximately $150 million increase in the third quarter turnaround spending sequentially for planned maintenance at our crackers in Canada and in Spain as well as $100 million lower earnings from nonrecurring licensing activity which occurred in the second quarter. ACC data indicates domestic demand for packaging applications reached its strongest level in history in June, and we expect a continuation of these positive demand trends as customers are reporting 45- to 60-day backlogs.  
Moving to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. Strong consumer demand for durable goods continues, underpinned by order strength throughout the value chain. Housing and construction markets, particularly in the U.S., continue to support robust demand for polyurethane applications. Industrial- and oil-related end markets are expected to continue to see gradual recovery sequentially, providing additional support for solvents and other industrial solutions. We also expect $30 million of additional planned maintenance turnaround spending at our joint ventures in the quarter.  
And in Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect a continuation of strong demand for electronics, mobility and infrastructure silicones solutions. We expect to benefit as social activity increases on easing pandemic-related restrictions, including sequential improvement for personal care applications. These trends are supporting price momentum across the silicones value chain, and we anticipate increased turnaround spending of approximately $30 million in our Consumer Solutions business in the quarter, including a turnaround at our siloxane pillar plant in Barry. Demand for do-it-yourself architectural coatings remains robust, and we expect to see an increase in contractor-related demand as new home builds increase and consumer in-home social engagements begin to resume.  
Altogether with robust demand expected to continue, our advantaged portfolio is positioned to capture significant value moving forward. We've updated a few full year items which can be found in the appendix of this slide presentation. Notably, we are expecting higher equity earnings, and with the improved earnings profile at Sadara, we now anticipate approximately $50 million of cash inflow to Dow in 2021.   
Turning to Slide 6. Around the world, increasingly positive trends indicate we remain in the early stages of economic recovery with an extended runway for growth. While industrial production is up nearly 20% over the year-ago low, it still has not reached pre-pandemic levels. Retail inventory to sales is at its lowest levels in more than 3 decades, and strong demand continues to counter near-term potential restocking efforts. U.S. housing starts increased again in May and are projected to continue rising, supported by limited supply of single-family homes due to a decade of underbuilding. And the proposed U.S. infrastructure bill has the potential to further elevate the already strong GDP estimates projected around the world.  
As vaccination rates increase around the world and economies continue to reopen, pent-up consumer demand and increased personal savings built over the past year should also provide an additional boost to the global economy. Consumer confidence continues to climb on conviction that economic conditions will continue to improve, supporting continued purchases of homes, automobiles and other durable goods. Business travel sentiment continued to improve in May with more than half of U.S. companies planning to resume domestic business travel within the next 3 months.  
The personal care market, which has been one of the slowest to recover, began to see a rebound in the second quarter, with increases in U.S. cosmetics and beauty product sales on rising consumer demand. And as borders reopen, recreational activities and international travel should also boost economic activity, while we're mindful that there will absolutely be some regional variations in the timing and the pace of the recovery.  
Along with these trends, we anticipate the strong demand we experienced in the second quarter across our polyethylene, polyurethane, acrylic and silicone chains to extend through the second half of 2021. Polyethylene demand growth, for example, is projected to outpace supply additions in the near term, with pricing strength and resilient margins on a sustained and favorable oil-to-gas ratio, with the majority of industry capacity adds coming in the higher end of the cost curve.  
Altogether, we expect these strong market dynamics, tight supply/demand fundamentals and ongoing economic expansion across our key chains to continue to drive earnings and cash flow growth.  
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

Turning to Slide 7. Dow's consumer-driven portfolio is uniquely positioned to benefit from the demand trends that Howard outlined a moment ago, which continued to translate into an attractive $650 billion addressable market with approximately 1.3 to 1.5x GDP growth across our packaging, infrastructure, mobility and consumer care end markets. These demand trends in our fast-growing markets are underpinned by an accelerated transition toward more sustainable materials, providing ample opportunities for Dow to continue to innovate with our customers and brand owners to enhance the sustainability of our products and value chains while advancing our net-zero carbon and circular economy targets.  
For example, as the mobility sector continues its transition to more sustainable solutions, electric and autonomous vehicles offer upside of approximately 50% more revenue across multiple Dow chemistries versus traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, including high-value polyurethanes, silicones and silicone hybrid-based adhesives and engineering sealants widely used in battery assembly, noise and vibration reduction, drivetrain, comfort and heat management applications.  
Our new DOWSIL silicone technologies for electric and hybrid vehicle applications help OEMs to meet the evolving needs of automotive electrification while advancing vehicle performance, reliability and sustainability.  
And we recently introduced SPECFLEX C, a new polyurethane solution sourced from recycled raw materials to help automotive OEMs meet demand for more circular products and their sustainability goals.  
We also continue to align our growth CapEx to address this growing market demand for sustainable materials. This quarter, we outlined our road map to reduce CO2 emissions by more than 40% by 2030 from our manufacturing operations in Terneuzen, The Netherlands.  
And Dow and Shell demonstrated progress on our joint technology to electrically heat steam cracker furnaces, receiving partial funding from the Dutch government. And together, we are evaluating construction of a multi-megawatt pilot plant with start-up in 2025. We plan to share more detail on our strategic and financial priorities to continue creating long-term value for all our stakeholders at our upcoming 2021 Investor Day on October 6, which will be hosted both virtually and in person in New York City. Stay tuned for more details. We look forward to engaging with you.  
On Slide 8, as we shared last quarter, we continue to see demand across our ethylene, polyethylene, polyurethanes, acrylics and silicones value chains outpacing supply through 2021 and staying balanced in the near term. These market dynamics will be further supported through 2022 and beyond by the GDP-fueled market growth trends we just discussed. 
Some industry views call for softening conditions, largely based on their view of announced capacity additions. However, they do not account for industry delays and cancellations, and when coupled with elevated demand growth from continued reopening of the global economy, will likely lead to tighter-than-forecasted market conditions, all of which will result in continued earnings, margin and cash flow growth for Dow in the near term.  
And while we capture these improved earnings in our core businesses, our current slate of lower-capital, faster-payback and higher-return capacity expansions will generate an additional $1 billion of accretive earnings over the next several years, with many projects delivering earnings already this year, such as our ethylene derivatives at the Thai joint ventures; polyethylene for high-performance packaging applications at our Alberta operations; and surfactants for leading brand-owners laundry and home care end markets.
And notably, in the second quarter, we progressed our polyethylene glycol incremental expansion, completing customer qualification ahead of schedule and beginning shipments of our industry-leading CARBOWAX SENTRY polyethylene glycol active pharmaceutical ingredients.  
Combined with favorable supply and demand fundamentals, these projects further enable Dow to continue to deliver significant value for our owners over this foreseeable future.  
We'll close on Slide 9. Our steadfast execution of the operational and financial playbook that we outlined at spin, combined with our agile response to market conditions over the past year, have enabled us to deliver strong performance and enhanced value to our shareholders. We are uniquely positioned to continue building on that strong foundation today.  
Our value proposition starts with our differentiated portfolio and an asset base that is characterized by, first, our feedstock flexibility and position, which supports our low-cost position and enables us to drive higher asset utilization and maximize cash margins as we quickly balance our feedstock and product mix to supply and demand dynamics.  And second, our leading scale, global footprint and differentiated portfolio provide us with access to high-growth end markets in all major regions. 
We have achieved strong performance in this early part of the economic recovery and remain advantaged through our participation in higher-margin functional polymers, silicones and formulated systems. We continue to develop innovative solutions to address our customers' needs and capture the opportunities arising from critical market trends. Our high-value adhesives and innovative packaging solutions support the rapidly growing e-commerce sector.  
Through our MobilityScience platform, we are targeting low-carbon-enabling mobility, electric and autonomous vehicle opportunities.  
More broadly, across our portfolio, we are enhancing the sustainability of our solutions and the value chains they serve. For example, deploying lower carbon energy solutions in gas treating, carbon capture and concentrated solar power at our operations.  
And through value chain collaboration, we are increasing post-consumer recycled content in our products and enabling the design of fully recyclable packaging. Today, more than 80% of Dow products for packaging applications are reusable or recyclable, and our research and technical teams are working actively on the remainder to achieve that same goal.  
Beyond the strength of our portfolio and our innovation investments, our deliberate focus on operating discipline and balanced capital allocation approach are critical elements of our value-creation playbook. We have achieved top-quartile cost structure and cash conversion and our restructuring efforts will yield an additional $300 million in earnings, all while maintaining a best-owner mindset.  
We also delivered a return on invested capital of greater than 14% on a trailing 12-month basis. At the same time, we have prioritized investments in our downstream, higher-margin, faster-payback opportunities and upstream investments that expand our leading ESG profile while increasing our capital expenditures by $350 million this year.  
We reduced net debt by approximately $5 billion since the end of 2018. Dow's strong operational and financial performance this year resulted in a credit rating upgrade by S&P and an upgraded outlook by Fitch, supporting our strong investment-grade balance sheet.  And we continue to return significant cash to shareholders through our industry-leading dividend.  
In closing, Dow is uniquely advantaged to continue delivering value through our best-in-class consumer-led portfolio, our leadership in innovation and sustainability and our strong operating and financial discipline. With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open the Q&A."

I expect it will continue to stay that way through the quarter. In some views, we probably had our highest raw material prices in the second quarter because the ethane frac spreads went up fairly dramatically. I do expect we'll see some of that soften as we move forward. I think long term, we expect natural gas prices to be between $2.75 and $3, 1 million BTU. So that's positive. And with these oil-to-gas ratios, I think we're going to see that continue. 
One of the things that happened with oil, obviously, is everybody looked at the oil supply coming on, but I think they failed to look at demand for oil. And as the economy reopens, there's going to be another step-up in demand. So I think some of that supply is just necessary to get ready for the increase in demand that's coming."

The only caveat to that, I would say, is that there are still a couple of lines where some raw material supply limitations, small raw materials are important in making those products, sometimes cause us a little bit of a backlog. I think most of that capacity was out during the month of April. And so as you think about it and go forward in Q3, I would say you'll have 3 solid months of production, where last quarter we had 2, and we pulled hard out of inventory. 
And so I don't think that we're going to have a chance to rebuild inventories until maybe the end of the year. And that would all depend on if the economy slows down. As Howard mentioned, we have customers and most of them in those chains that have 45- to 60-day backlog. So our view is we're going to be running hard through the end of the year and right into 2022."

And if you have some advanced notice, you can actually take some things down and protect them. And so the team has gone through that. And we've got an updated game plan on what we would do in the face of a situation like that again. 
I think the whole industry is going through it. I know ERCOT is going through that on the power side. Winterization is a big part of what they're doing and what they're requesting us to do as well because we are a supplier into ERCOT.

And so there are some areas that really drive a lot of packaging like e-commerce activity, which I don't think it is going to go backward. I also think that the fact that plastic packaging is so lightweight and so strong and it is the lowest carbon footprint package out there, you're going to continue to see a drive toward that. 
For most companies, the shipping costs and the CO2 footprint and the shipping cost will drive that. 
And so I just use a paper versus plastic scenario in a grocery store. One truckload of plastic shopping bags would take 4 to 5 truckloads of paper bags to replace it. So I think you're going to see as carbon comes into the equation that it advantages plastics greatly. I don't think there's something that's going to see it long term move above 1.5. For many, many decades, it's been in that 1.5 type of GDP growth rate. I think that will stay. 
There are some functional polymers that are made out of ethylene and polyethylene derivatives that are continuing to grow, materials for construction that are positive. You're going to see growth in some other applications like products that go into alternative energy, both solar panels for encapsulation, wind blades and other types of applications.

Good question, Bob. We're seeing a real demand pull from consumers and brand owners that want more post-consumer recycled material in there or they want more material that's made from either a biosource to ethylene or something that is made from advanced recycling to get back to feedstock and back to a product. 
I think the drivers that are going to help on the virgin side of things are obviously redesign of packaging types. On flexible packaging, many packages are complicated and hard to recycle. I think one of the positives of our portfolio right now is the greater than 80% of our portfolio is fully recyclable or reusable today, and the research team and the tech service team are working hard to get the rest of that to 100%. 
All the brand owners are working on redesigns right now of different packages to move away from complex structures into simpler structures. We used that Bear Naked Granola example with Kellogg's, where that package has been redesigned. This is going on across the value chain. We're seeing the investments in mechanical recycling and advanced recycling pick up. We're seeing the number of states that are approving advanced recycling projects pick up. And I think our next big impact is going to be on infrastructure at the state and local level to allow more collection of curbside recycling of more products. And that will be the next drive north. We still have a long way to go even to catch up with Europe. In the United States, we have a long way to go to get to that 35% of recycling. 
We set a target by 2030 to collect or reuse or recycle 1 million metric tons of plastic through our own actions and partnerships. And I can tell you, I'm pushing the team to always pull that number forward and get that done faster. And I think we're seeing real demand in taking recycled packaging products into some things that are more durable and longer life building materials, using recycled plastics in aggregate for roadways, architectural decking, all kinds of things that are upgrading the use of end-of-life plastics. So I think over time, it's going to be a real positive."

And one of the things we'll talk about at Investor Day is the work we did to kind of outline the next 20, 30 years of how we would get there. 
I think carbon capture, as we talk about, as we get beyond this infrastructure build that's in front of Congress right now and we get to the next step, you've got to look at advanced technologies. And carbon capture and blue hydrogen are 2 that we have to keep an eye on. Those are the lowest cost next step for us to get our industry to low CO2. But they're a lot more than EUR 55 a ton to deliver that. And so without the right tax incentive or support from government in terms of investment in those technologies, you would need a market price on carbon that is much higher than that. We're right on top of that and we're very attuned with that. And that's one of the things that we're piloting in Terneuzen.

About 50% of the global polyethylene adds through 2025 are higher-cost naphtha or coal to olefins or methanol to olefins. About 35% are naphtha, about 15% are coal to olefins, methanol to olefins. 
60% of the capacity adds through 2025 are in Northeast Asia. And when you think about the Chinese projects that are in construction or in start-up phase, about 50% of those will come to market around the announced dates. And so that's -- in 2021 to 2023, that's about 12 million metric tons out of 24 million total. 
Capacity increases are going to obviously reduce some imports into China. And so that will be domestic. And we don't see China as being an exporter at those levels. 
I would also say that you've got some existing crackers that are considered unreliable due to some trade risk, but it's only in the neighborhood of 2 million to 3 million metric tons. 
Long term, right now, there are supply demand -- there are supply additions that are about 31 million metric tons on the books. In our view, on delays or cancellations, are in the 6 million to 15 million metric tons on delays or cancellation. Demand growth is going to be 25 million metric tons. So we're going to be balanced to short by about 9 million metric tons during that time frame. And in the near term, with these GDP growth rates, things are going to be tight. 
So we're looking at growth. I mentioned to Jeff's question earlier a 600 kt expansion on polyethylene, that's in the cards. Incremental expansions on ethylene, those are in the cards. We're doing work on our own FCDh technology and our EDH technology in the Gulf to try to have low carbon moves forward. 
I think one of the things that has to be resolved before you see a next wave of announcements is what are the policies going to be in the United States around carbon, carbon border adjustment mechanisms, carbon tax, perhaps a voluntary emissions trading scheme. And we have to know what those are. We have to know how China is going to play on the global footprint. And we have to see how Europe is moving forward. All of those have to be resolved before we can see what the right place is to make that next bet. But we're working on projects, and we're looking for the right opportunity."

And I've said before and I'll continue to say it, we need to have a real constructive and open dialogue about how much it costs to do this. I think idealistically, everybody is in agreement that we want to make improvements and we want to reduce carbon emissions and we want to get to net zero. But nobody's yet, at a government level or any level, having the educated discussion that we need to have about the cost of doing this. 
What will happen in Europe is Europe has -- the way the emissions trading game works in Europe is they have price for carbon, but they also have allowances for energy -- for emissions emitters. And if you're under your allowances, you can trade those carbon credits. What they will do over time is they will ratchet back the allowances and they'll start to put everybody over their allowances and that will start to drive the prices up and that will drive the incentives to make the conversion. 
So Europe is less concerned right now with what the cost is to everybody and more concerned with trying to drive that number up and drive the conversion. And we're in the middle there trying to talk to them realistically about what the price is to do this, what the technologies are today and scale up the ones that we think are the most cost effective going forward, blue hydrogen, carbon capture to be able to do that. 
So I think as we work through that over the next 2 or 3 years, we'll start to make some progress to that. And I would say all heavy industry and the power and utility sector are taking a look at this, but with eyes wide open that it's not free. 
And the other thing to remember on hydrogen, is as you move to a hydrogen economy, the most effective way to make most of that hydrogen is through steam methane reforming which uses natural gas, which means you're going to need a lot more natural gas production to make that hydrogen. And that's one of the other discussions that is difficult to get on the table right now."

We are starting to see consumer preference drive the brand owners for lower carbon and more recyclable products. And clearly, both the brand owners and ourselves are in the space, that we want to make investments in that area, but we want those investments to be value-accretive. So as you say, the policies are not there right now. And what we're trying to work through are the right set of policies that we need to make value-creating investments going forward. 
I would say the consumer drive and the consumer preference on this is going to be the thing that makes it happen. 
The other reality is, I believe that the market premiums are starting to show up in some of the plastics today. When it comes to post-consumer recycled materials into packaging, we're seeing a strong pull from the brand owners and we're starting to see premiums. If you go back a decade, we had not seen that. And so you've got brand owners who are announcing that they're allocating premiums for recycled materials to address circularity. I think that's a sign that their customers want it. And when you get it down to a per package basis, it's very small. The problem comes through the value chain and the cost to manufacture the materials. But if you take it down to a per package basis on the shelf at a supermarket, it might add $0.01 to the cost of a product that you buy. It isn't significant at the consumer level. It's significant through the value chain."

In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure on the polyurethane side, we saw strong demand for both polyols and isocyanates in the polyurethane side and in construction chemicals for chemicals that are made from those raw materials going into not only single-family homes, but also larger construction like commercial construction. I think those demands are going to continue to stay strong and the supply/demand will continue to be tight. You saw strong pricing in both PO as well as isocyanates. There's not a lot of new capacity coming on in that space. 
And then additionally, in ethylene oxide and ethylene oxide derivatives in the Industrial Solutions business, those end markets are continuing to grow. And on top of that, we have several new capacity adds that are coming for things like pharmaceutical incipients, a product called polyethylene glycol that we just made an expansion on, we've got some other materials coming through there. And we have a host of low VOC solvents in that portfolio that go into the coatings sector. So around the world, as coatings move away from traditional organic solvents into waterborne or lower VOC solvents, that benefits our portfolio. That same trend, by the way, helps us in cleaning chemicals or cleaning products that you might use in your home, and we see that both from a brand owner and an industrial side as well. So I think those will continue. Our expectation on third quarter in those businesses are very similar to second quarter."

Starting on Slide 3. In the third quarter, Dow achieved top and bottom line growth both year-over-year and sequentially. I'm incredibly proud of the Dow team for delivering these results and doing so safely despite industry supply disruptions from hurricanes on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our proactive storm preparations enabled us to maintain the safety of our team and community and recover quickly. 
We delivered a 53% sales increase year-over-year with double-digit gains in every segment, business and region. We also recorded a 7% increase in sales over the prior quarter. We captured strong price momentum, driven by tight supply/demand balances across our key value chains, and we achieved volume growth of 2% both year-over-year and sequentially, supported by continued strong end-market demand despite supply and logistics constraints. 
We increased operating EBIT by more than $2.1 billion year-over-year with improvements in all segments and businesses and $58 million higher sequentially. Key contributors included year-over-year margin expansion of 1,170 basis points, driven by price momentum and demand growth, and increased equity earnings, up $189 million, for margin expansion at our Sadara and Kuwait joint ventures. 
Our continued focus on cash generation and our balanced disciplined capital allocation enabled us to deliver cash flow from operations of $2.7 billion, up $958 million year-over-year, driven by margin expansion from price momentum in key value chains. We returned a total of $918 million to shareholders through our industry-leading dividend of $518 million, plus $400 million in share repurchases. And we also reduced gross debt by more than $1.1 billion in the quarter. Our proactive liability management actions to tender existing notes have resulted in no long-term debt maturities due until 2026, and we've reduced annual interest expense by more than $60 million. 
Overall, Dow continues to deliver on its priorities, and we see further strength ahead as we benefit from a favorable macro backdrop and execute our disciplined strategy to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings, driving significant value for all stakeholders. 
Moving to our segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $2 billion, compared to $647 million in the year ago period. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $60 million. Price gains in both businesses and in all regions led to margin improvement in the core business and increased equity earnings. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT margins declined by 300 basis points on higher feedstock and energy costs. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business reported a net sales increase year-over-year, led by local price gains in industrial and consumer packaging and flexible food and beverage packaging applications. Volumes declined year-over-year due to lower polyethylene supply as a result of planned maintenance turnarounds and weather-related outages in the quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered price and volume gains on strong demand in industrial and consumer packaging applications, which were partly offset by hurricane-related outages. 
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT was $713 million, up $609 million year-over-year, primarily due to continued tight supply and demand in both businesses. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $65 million and operating EBIT margins expanded by 50 basis points on volume and price gains in both businesses. 
The Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year ago period, with price gains in all regions on tight supply-demand balances. Volume declines year-over-year primarily reflected the planned transition of a low-margin coproducer contract as well as weather-related outages and third-party supply constraints. Sequentially, the business delivered sales growth due to increased local price and volume from additional supply availability to meet resilient demand. The Industrial Solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year ago period, with local price gains in all regions. Volume increased year-over-year on strong demand for materials in industrial manufacturing and energy applications. Net sales also increased sequentially, driven by volume growth, primarily in coatings and industrial applications from increased supply and local price gains in all regions. 
And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $284 million, up $209 million versus the same quarter last year as margins increased 750 basis points due to strong price momentum and robust demand recovery for silicones and industrial coatings offerings. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $59 million on price gains, leading to margin expansion of 210 basis points. 
The Consumer Solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year with price gains in all regions. Volume increased over the prior year on stronger consumer demand for personal care, mobility and electronics offerings. Sequentially, sales were down as price increases in all regions were more than offset by volume declines as a result of planned maintenance and third-party supply and logistics constraints. 
The Coatings & Performance Monomers business delivered increased net sales year-over-year as higher raw material costs and tight supply/demand balances led to price gains in all regions. Volumes were down year-over-year as demand recovery for industrial coatings was more than offset by weather-related outages and third-party supply and logistics constraints. Sequentially, the business delivered local price gains in all regions, supported by increased volume due to continued strong demand for acrylic monomers and architectural coatings and increased supply availability. 
Now let me turn it over to Howard to review the modeling guidance."

And as a",1435,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, we see a continuation of robust demand growth across our packaging infrastructure, consumer and mobility end markets. Brand owner inventory levels remain low. And as a result, we anticipate higher seasonal demand continuing into the holiday season this year. 
In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we continue to see resilient demand for packaging applications and for our differentiated functional polymers. Global polyethylene supply remains constrained as the industry completes higher turnaround activity and supply chains recover from weather events on the U.S. Gulf Coast. We exited the third quarter experiencing higher raw material and energy costs, which we anticipate will likely persist through the fourth quarter. We expect these costs to be an approximately $350 million headwind sequentially. Dow will continue to utilize our broad geographic footprint and best-in-class feedstock flexibility to help mitigate these impacts. We also anticipate a $175 million tailwind from turnarounds in the quarter as we completed our planned maintenance at our cracker in Canada. 
In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, continued consumer demand for furniture and bedding, appliances, pharma and home care are expected to keep supply tight in our key value chains. Due to the weather-related outages in the third quarter, some of our planned turnaround activity was moved to the fourth quarter. Sadara will also start a turnaround at its isocyanate facility in the fourth quarter as well. Altogether, we anticipate $100 million in this segment from turnaround impacts. Short-term increased energy costs in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Europe are expected to be an additional $100 million headwind in the quarter. We continue to see sequential recovery in industrial activity, particularly for energy applications. We anticipate this recovery will continue at least through the fourth quarter as industrial production continues to ramp up from very low inventory levels to meet demand. 
In Performance Materials & Coatings, demand for electronics, mobility, building and construction continues to outpace supply. Demand for architectural coatings is also expected to remain elevated due to persistently low inventory levels across the value chain. Global production for silicones has been impacted by the recent dual control policy enforcement actions in China, with silicon metal prices almost 3x their previous highs. We intend to pull forward a scheduled turnaround at a siloxane facility in Zhangjiagang in China to coincide with government actions to curtail power usage. Our current estimate for the quarter includes $125 million from increased raw material costs and turnaround impacts. We'll continue to work on mitigating the impacts of rising raw material costs through our integrated position in both businesses. Despite higher raw material and energy costs in the fourth quarter, Dow will continue to leverage its advantaged global footprint, structural cost and feedstock advantages as well as our broad suite of differentiated products to meet growing demand. 
On Slide 6, as we look ahead, we expect robust economic growth to continue. With the Delta variant slowing the reopening of economies around the world, there remains significant pent-up demand globally, particularly across our industrial and consumer end markets. Many industries continue to see elevated order backlogs, coupled with low inventory levels, as supply chain struggled to keep up with robust demand. These supply chain disruptions are expected to persist, which will certainly prolong the ability to restock inventories across most value chains. As a result, we expect tighter-than-forecasted market conditions to continue, a view strengthened by China's recent dual control policy that has impacted both cold olefins and methanol to olefins-based capacity, which represent more than 30% of China's total polyethylene production. 
2022 GDP growth forecasts are well above historical averages in most areas of the world as industries ramp up to match the robust consumer demand with further upside as global chip shortages continue to extend the recovery in manufacturing. Collectively, G7 countries have not yet fully recovered to pre-pandemic GDP. This points to additional upside as economies return to more normalized consumption levels with degree of vaccination increasing, particularly in Asia, where levels remain low relative to the rest of the world. 
Moving to Slide 7. At our Investor Day earlier this month, we outlined how our differentiated portfolio and our focus on sustainability-driven innovation will enable more than $3 billion in underlying EBITDA improvement across the cycle. Our restructuring program and digital investments will yield $600 million in increased EBITDA. Both are in progress, and our restructuring program is on track to achieve its $300 million run rate by year-end. 
We also have a suite of higher return, lower risk and faster payback capital and operating investments that will enable an additional $2 billion in EBITDA in the near term. And our investments to decarbonize and grow at our Fort Saskatchewan site in Alberta, Canada are also expected to deliver approximately $1 billion in increased EBITDA. And as we've already shared, we're executing against a favorable macro backdrop that we expect will continue to support constructive market fundamentals for our key value chains. 
Turning to Slide 8. You'll see the detailed list of these low-risk growth investments. Our capital investments are expected to generate $1 billion in EBITDA through incremental capacity expansions, debottlenecking and enhanced feedstock flexibility across our operating segments. We're already making good progress. For example, in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, our Fort Saskatchewan expansion to add ethylene capacity of 65,000 metric tons per year to support growing polyethylene demand is now complete and will ramp by the end of the fourth quarter. Our FCDH pilot plant in Louisiana will start up in 2022, featuring 20% to 40% lower CapEx and 5% to 7% lower OpEx, while reducing CO2 emissions by up to 20% compared to other PDH technologies. 
In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, our debottlenecking project to add 60,000 metric tons per year of aniline will be fully online by year-end. And earlier this year, we signed an MOU for a new South China hub to advance local supply and formulating capabilities to serve the fast-growing Asia Pacific market. 
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we recently completed a capacity expansion at one of our silicone polymer plants. And by year-end, we will complete a new silicone sealant compounding unit to enable sustainable solutions for high-performance building and infrastructure applications. And we are progressing our 50 kt methacrylate investment on the U.S. Gulf Coast to support global end markets such as inks, resins and packaging materials, which is scheduled to come online in the first half of next year. In addition, our operating investments are also expected to generate another $1 billion in EBITDA as we improve our production capabilities and shift our product mix to higher growth and higher value markets. For example, in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, we're increasing capabilities and shifting our mix toward higher-margin polyurethane systems for mobility and consumer applications. Our Industrial Solutions business is increasing capabilities to supply differentiated materials into the textile market. 
Our ECOFAST collaboration with Ralph Lauren lowers energy usage by 40% and water usage by 50% in the fabric dying process. And by 2025, the brand aims to incorporate this technology in more than 80% of its solid cotton products. 
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we're expanding our ability to formulate differentiated silicones for a number of attractive markets, including silicone adhesives for foldable displays in consumer electronics, thermal conducted silicone solutions for electric vehicles and silicone solutions for 5G where the market is expected to more than double over the next 10 years. And we recently partnered with customers on high-value innovations like paper barrier coating applications that use our award-winning rebar polyolefin dispersion technology and Callaway's Supersoft golf balls, which feature a new hybrid cover made with Dow's paraloid-impact modifier. 
In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we're enhancing our extensive conversion and testing capabilities to commercialize residents through packaging design, speeding the innovation process and expanding the addressable market for higher margin and more sustainable products. For example, we're already benefiting from the 9-layer blown film extrusion line project completed this year. We're also making investments to improve asset reliability, which will increase output and expand margins. And we're using digital technology for customer trials and process automation to accelerate catalyst development for new resins and processes like FCDH where we can typically be 100x more efficient than conventional experimentation. 
Collectively, our slate of near-term investments will generate an increase of approximately $2 billion in underlying EBITDA, and we intend to deliver this growth with a disciplined and balanced approach, maintaining our top quartile performance in cash flow, cost structure, debt reduction and shareholder remuneration. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

The strategy we outlined at our Investor Day builds on our long history of industry leadership. Our plan enables us to capture demand from sustainability drivers, achieved 0 Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and deliver meaningful underlying earnings and cash flow growth for years to come. Our path to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings is a phased site-by-site approach that both retrofits and replaces end-of-life assets with low-carbon-emission facilities while also expanding our capacity. This plan will deliver a 30% reduction in our CO2 emissions between 2005 and 2030 through a disciplined approach that manages timing based on affordability, macro and regulatory drivers around the world. 
Our Texas-9 cracker proves that we can do this and do it well. Texas-9 is 60% lower-carbon intensity than any asset in our fleet, and that's without any specific design for carbon capture or hydrogen. The project was delivered with 20% better capital efficiency and 12 months faster than any other crackers built in that wave. Overall, the project has a 65% lower conversion cost, is running consistently at more than 110% of nameplate capacity and has delivered greater than 15% return on invested capital since start-up. We will leverage key learnings from Texas-9 as we plan to build the world's first-ever net zero carbon emissions ethylene cracker and derivatives complex in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, delivering approximately $1 billion in EBITDA, as Howard outlined earlier. This project will more than triple our ethylene and downstream derivative capacity at the site while decarbonizing emissions for 20% of our global ethylene capacity. We selected this site due to the availability of carbon capture, infrastructure, advantaged feedstocks and supportive government policies and incentives. 
On Slide 10, as we capture these attractive growth opportunities, we will maintain our balanced and disciplined financial approach since spin. We are committed to keeping CapEx at or below D&A, well below pre-spin levels, while targeting return on invested capital above 13% across the economic cycle. We will continue to align our capital spend to the macroeconomic environment, our affordability and return targets. 
Our investments align to 3 categories: First, we'll maintain our foundation and maximize the return of our existing assets while ensuring safe and reliable operations. Second, we'll execute our pipeline of faster payback, lower-risk incremental growth projects for downstream and sustainability-driven applications growing faster than GDP. And we'll invest approximately $1 billion per year to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings. These investments enable us to capture increasing demand for low carbon footprint products while derisking the enterprise with lower emissions assets. 
In closing, on Slide 11, Dow is well positioned to deliver significant long-term value for shareholders. We have actions in place to both decarbonize our footprint and grow the enterprise as we achieve an additional $3 billion in underlying EBITDA, maintain industry-leading cash flow generation and drive towards zero Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions. Our balanced capital allocation approach targets more than 13% return on invested capital, keeps CapEx within D&A and return 65% of net income to shareholders across the economic cycle. All of this is underpinned by our industry-leading portfolio, cost position and strong track record of innovation that enables us to deliver differentiated products and solutions for our customers and a more sustainable world.

P.J., good question. I'm going to walk through several things. I would say, in the near term, the impact on silicon metal has been in China due to the restrictions from dual control. And as you know, that was driven by the higher coal prices really pushing up the cost for the electricity producers. And the electricity producers are capped on their electricity prices. So some of them didn't run, and that forced the industry curtailment. Typically, as you're going into cold weather months, industry takes the hit versus homeowners and consumers. You try to keep your people warm. And so that hit silicon metals. For that reason, things became tight. We've moved some silicon metals from Brazil over to China to offset that, and we'll run through the fourth quarter, but we decided to pull a turnaround in Zhangjiagang into the fourth quarter. We had originally planned it for first quarter. We decided to do it now. That takes a little pressure off the dual control situation. That turnaround will cost us, I think, on Slide 5, it's in there, $75 million in the fourth quarter. I expect we're going to see about $50 million higher cost, but both downstream G3 silicones demand and siloxane demand are very strong. And siloxane prices have gone up significantly. And so I think we're going to be in that situation for all of the fourth quarter, and I would expect in the first quarter as well."

To your point on the 2 to 2.5 ratio, I would say some of our peers have a 1% swing between the low and the high, so we're already giving you a better-than-peer view with saying our range is only half a turn. But if you'd like me to narrow that further, I would say, use the midpoint. So our long-term average is 2 to 2.5. I would say, through the economic cycle, if you want to use 2.25, that's a reasonable proxy for where we want to be, but we have the corridor there to recognize that it's a long-term target. Punctually today, using the rating agency methodology through the end of the third quarter, we're probably around 2.4, 2.5.

We saw inventory declines in high density and linear low and a little bit of inventory build in low density, but it isn't a significant number. 
So when you look at the 5-year trends, and I think what we put in the slide deck to show you earlier, is that the order backlog is off about 30% above normal and the inventory-to-sales ratio was down about 10%. I think that's going to stay in that band for the most of the fourth quarter. And as the capacity comes back from the hurricanes, we have still supply and logistics issues, so there are bottlenecks everywhere, especially when it relates to marine pack cargo or export and as it relates to product being shipped by truck. It's a little hand-to-hand combat right now. And if a truck driver doesn't show up, shipment gets delayed.

What happens is typically, when those ports get backlogged, it spills over into other ports. We don't use Long Beach as much, but when traffic spills over in the other ports, that hits us. I would say that almost every value chain has some impact from that. And where we see the biggest impact is being able -- it's kind of blocking material getting out. And so we're starting to see some congestion and some competing demand. Product coming in. Sometimes it's faster to reload an empty container to get it back to China. And so that competes with other materials going out. We don't see that in every port, but certainly, on the West Coast, we're seeing that right now. I would say almost every value chain we have, every application we have is short product. And I don't think there's enough material tied up in all of that floating inventory or in the warehouses that, that is going to alleviate the demand or fill the demand that's out there right now.

We're going to bring more NGLs as we move out of the winter season. I believe what we're seeing short term here is a knock-on effect as coal really ratcheted much higher in China. The first fuel that you go to that could replace coal in the fuel grid is natural gas. And then LNG obviously went right up after coal. And then the next deal is oil, and oil came right up. And so that took us up to $80 a barrel. 
I think we're going to see things will stabilize a little bit. As we go into winter, inventories are a little light of the 5-year average going into winter. But you've seen prices unwind a little bit in the forward market by about $1 a million Btu because weather plays a significant factor. So we're going to have a warmer fall that's going to take a little bit of sting out of the natural gas prices. 
Even with that, the oil-to-gas ratio, but more importantly, the oil-to-gas spreads are good. And so I think that's going to continue. And if we get through winter without a really, really cold snap, then I think you're going to see prices to moderate. Long term or medium term, I would say, 2 50 to 4 50 for U.S. production.

Good question. On II&I and polyurethanes, I do believe that the demand and the operating rates for isocyanates will continue to stay strong into next year, maybe a little bit lower operating rates on polyols, but the key demand drivers and value drivers are going to be those systems and solutions that are going into things like mobility, like construction, like appliances and, some extent, furniture and bedding and things that are driven by consumer growth. And that will continue to remain strong. 
The only thing that we've got coming that would be a detractor from those earnings would be we've got a turnaround in this quarter on isocyanates and Sadara, but that's been planned. And they'll manage that. They've been running very well. I expect to see them in good shape next year. And as you know, their fixed costs are quite low. And so I think there will be a very good source for us to fulfill that demand."

There are some specialty grades where it's hard to shift the mix up because things are so tight right now, especially in some of our elastomeric products. 
On decarbonization, I think it's just going to depend on the situation in the geographies that we're looking at the investments. In Canada, we don't need to do the back investment into CO2 capture and sequestration. And I think there are a lot of players that are out there that have capabilities to do that. So if we can keep our investments focused on assets that generate revenue for us and generate growth for us and are zero carbon emitting, I think there's plenty of room for third parties and others to play to help us to handle the CO2."

So that is high GDP growth, and that's going to continue. In Industrial Solutions, not only highest-value return to ethylene, but also high-value downstream growth, driven primarily by consumer applications. To some extent, oil and gas, which we see recovering. I know we have many, many cases where our oil and gas products help people reduce CO2 emissions in the midstream production. And then things like ECOFAST Pure, which is a partnership with Ralph Lauren, where we just open sourced that technology to use that product, which would get textile mills that use cotton to switch over to a product that is -- uses 90% less chemicals, 50% less water, 50% less energy. I think that's a huge driving force towards more sustainability in an area that's a tough environmental aspect. 
And then if you go to PM&C, we've got continued growth in our downstream systems, which have been growing at greater than 11% per year for a long time. We'll continue those investments. We've got high-growth targets for our downstream coatings business to continue to keep up with the demand, specifically traffic demand. Howard mentioned paper demand for paper cups replacing others with our roll bar dispersions and also architectural demand, which is our growth leader in that space. And then you get back to Packaging & Specialty Plastics, which is continuing to grow above GDP, about 1.4x GDP in our forward forecast. 
It's very dispersed. So when we talk about $3 billion of of EBITDA growth over that time period, it's pretty evenly split between all 3 segments, and you're going to see about $200 million to $300 million of it come on next year, and that is projects that are already completed and will be finished by the end of the year."

Look, I would just say this, our feedstock flexibility is really a key enabler of our consistent outperformance versus our peers, as you've seen in the last several years of our annual benchmarking.

We can do minimum naphtha if we need to in Europe. We also have the ability to do max LPG. To your point, I mean, propane is not necessarily in the slate right now, so you're not doing that in Europe.

Starting on Slide 3. In the third quarter, Dow achieved top and bottom line growth both year-over-year and sequentially. I'm incredibly proud of the Dow team for delivering these results and doing so safely despite industry supply disruptions from hurricanes on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our proactive storm preparations enabled us to maintain the safety of our team and community and recover quickly.  
We delivered a 53% sales increase year-over-year with double-digit gains in every segment, business and region. We also recorded a 7% increase in sales over the prior quarter. We captured strong price momentum, driven by tight supply-demand balances across our key value chains, and we achieved volume growth of 2% both year-over-year and sequentially, supported by continued strong end-market demand despite supply and logistics constraints.  
We increased operating EBIT by more than $2.1 billion year-over-year with improvements in all segments and businesses and $58 million higher sequentially. Key contributors included year-over-year margin expansion of 1,170 basis points, driven by price momentum and demand growth, and increased equity earnings, up $189 million, for margin expansion at our Sadara and Kuwait joint ventures.  
Our continued focus on cash generation and our balanced disciplined capital allocation enabled us to deliver cash flow from operations of $2.7 billion, up $958 million year-over-year, driven by margin expansion from price momentum in key value chains. We returned a total of $918 million to shareholders through our industry-leading dividend of $518 million, plus $400 million in share repurchases. And we also reduced gross debt by more than $1.1 billion in the quarter. Our proactive liability management actions to tender existing notes have resulted in no long-term debt maturities due until 2026, and we've reduced annual interest expense by more than $60 million.  
Overall, Dow continues to deliver on its priorities, and we see further strength ahead as we benefit from a favorable macro backdrop and execute our disciplined strategy to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings, driving significant value for all stakeholders.  
Moving to our segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $2 billion, compared to $647 million in the year ago period. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $60 million. Price gains in both businesses and in all regions led to margin improvement in the core business and increased equity earnings. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT margins declined by 300 basis points on higher feedstock and energy costs. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business reported a net sales increase year-over-year, led by local price gains in industrial and consumer packaging and flexible food and beverage packaging applications. Volumes declined year-over-year due to lower polyethylene supply as a result of planned maintenance turnarounds and weather-related outages in the quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered price and volume gains on strong demand in industrial and consumer packaging applications, which were partly offset by hurricane-related outages.  
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT was $713 million, up $609 million year-over-year, primarily due to continued tight supply and demand in both businesses. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $65 million and operating EBIT margins expanded by 50 basis points on volume and price gains in both businesses.  
The Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year ago period, with price gains in all regions on tight supply-demand balances. Volume declines year-over-year primarily reflected the planned transition of a low-margin coproducer contract as well as weather-related outages and third-party supply constraints. Sequentially, the business delivered sales growth due to increased local price and volume from additional supply availability to meet resilient demand. The Industrial Solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year ago period, with local price gains in all regions. Volume increased year-over-year on strong demand for materials in industrial manufacturing and energy applications. Net sales also increased sequentially, driven by volume growth, primarily in coatings and industrial applications from increased supply and local price gains in all regions.  
And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $284 million, up $209 million versus the same quarter last year as margins increased 750 basis points due to strong price momentum and robust demand recovery for silicones and industrial coatings offerings. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $59 million on price gains, leading to margin expansion of 210 basis points.  
The Consumer Solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year with price gains in all regions. Volume increased over the prior year on stronger consumer demand for personal care, mobility and electronics offerings. Sequentially, sales were down as price increases in all regions were more than offset by volume declines as a result of planned maintenance and third-party supply and logistics constraints.  
The Coatings & Performance Monomers business delivered increased net sales year-over-year as higher raw material costs and tight supply/demand balances led to price gains in all regions. Volumes were down year-over-year as demand recovery for industrial coatings was more than offset by weather-related outages and third-party supply and logistics constraints. Sequentially, the business delivered local price gains in all regions, supported by increased volume due to continued strong demand for acrylic monomers and architectural coatings and increased supply availability.  
Now let me turn it over to Howard to review the modeling guidance."

We exited the third quarter experiencing higher raw material and energy costs, which we anticipate will likely persist through the fourth quarter. We expect these costs to be an approximately $350 million headwind sequentially. Dow will continue to utilize our broad geographic footprint and best-in-class feedstock flexibility to help mitigate these impacts.  
We also anticipate a $175 million tailwind from turnarounds in the quarter as we completed our planned maintenance at our cracker in Canada.  
In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, continued consumer demand for furniture and bedding, appliances, pharma and home care are expected to keep supply tight in our key value chains. Due to the weather-related outages in the third quarter, some of our planned turnaround activity was moved to the fourth quarter. Sadara will also start a turnaround at its isocyanate facility in the fourth quarter as well. Altogether, we anticipate $100 million in this segment from turnaround impacts. Short-term increased energy costs in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Europe are expected to be an additional $100 million headwind in the quarter. We continue to see sequential recovery in industrial activity, particularly for energy applications. We anticipate this recovery will continue at least through the fourth quarter as industrial production continues to ramp up from very low inventory levels to meet demand.  
In Performance Materials & Coatings, demand for electronics, mobility, building and construction continues to outpace supply. Demand for architectural coatings is also expected to remain elevated due to persistently low inventory levels across the value chain. Global production for silicones has been impacted by the recent dual control policy enforcement actions in China, with silicone metal prices almost 3x their previous highs. We intend to pull forward a scheduled turnaround at a siloxane facility in Zhangjiagang in China to coincide with government actions to curtail power usage. Our current estimate for the quarter includes $125 million from increased raw material costs and turnaround impacts. We'll continue to work on mitigating the impacts of rising raw material costs through our integrated position in both businesses.  
Despite higher raw material and energy costs in the fourth quarter, Dow will continue to leverage its advantaged global footprint, structural cost and feedstock advantages as well as our broad suite of differentiated products to meet growing demand.  
On Slide 6, as we look ahead, we expect robust economic growth to continue. With the Delta variant slowing the reopening of economies around the world, there remains significant pent-up demand globally, particularly across our industrial and consumer end markets. Many industries continue to see elevated order backlogs, coupled with low inventory levels, as supply chain struggled to keep up with robust demand. These supply chain disruptions are expected to persist, which will certainly prolong the ability to restock inventories across most value chains. As a result, we expect tighter-than-forecasted market conditions to continue, a view strengthened by China's recent dual control policy that has impacted both cold olefins and methanol to olefins-based capacity, which represent more than 30% of China's total polyethylene production.  
2022 GDP growth forecasts are well above historical averages in most areas of the world as industries ramp up to match the robust consumer demand with further upside as global chip shortages continue to extend the recovery in manufacturing. Collectively, G7 countries have not yet fully recovered to pre-pandemic GDP. This points to additional upside as economies return to more normalized consumption levels with degree of vaccination increasing, particularly in Asia, where levels remain low relative to the rest of the world.  
Moving to Slide 7. At our Investor Day earlier this month, we outlined how our differentiated portfolio and our focus on sustainability-driven innovation will enable more than $3 billion in underlying EBITDA improvement across the cycle. Our restructuring program and digital investments will yield $600 million in increased EBITDA. Both are in progress, and our restructuring program is on track to achieve its $300 million run rate by year-end.  
We also have a suite of higher return, lower risk and faster payback capital and operating investments that will enable an additional $2 billion in EBITDA in the near-term. And our investments to decarbonize and grow at our Fort Saskatchewan site in Alberta, Canada are also expected to deliver approximately $1 billion in increased EBITDA. And as we've already shared, we're executing against a favorable macro backdrop that we expect will continue to support constructive market fundamentals for our key value chains.  
Turning to Slide 8. You'll see the detailed list of these low-risk growth investments. Our capital investments are expected to generate $1 billion in EBITDA through incremental capacity expansions, debottlenecking and enhanced feedstock flexibility across our operating segments. We're already making good progress. For example, in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, our Fort Saskatchewan expansion to add ethylene capacity of 65,000 metric tons per year to support growing polyethylene demand is now complete and will ramp by the end of the fourth quarter. Our FCDH pilot plant in Louisiana will start up in 2022, featuring 20% to 40% lower CapEx and 5% to 7% lower OpEx, while reducing CO2 emissions by up to 20% compared to other PDH technologies.  
In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, our debottlenecking project to add 60,000 metric tons per year of aniline will be fully online by year-end. And earlier this year, we signed an MOU for a new South China hub to advance local supply and formulating capabilities to serve the fast-growing Asia Pacific market.  
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we recently completed a capacity expansion at one of our silicone polymer plants. And by year-end, we will complete a new silicone sealant compounding unit to enable sustainable solutions for high-performance building and infrastructure applications. And we are progressing our 50 kt methacrylate investment on the U.S. Gulf Coast to support global end markets such as inks, resins and packaging materials, which is scheduled to come online in the first half of next year. In addition, our operating investments are also expected to generate another $1 billion in EBITDA as we improve our production capabilities and shift our product mix to higher growth and higher value markets. For example, in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, we're increasing capabilities and shifting our mix toward higher-margin polyurethane systems for mobility and consumer applications. Our Industrial Solutions business is increasing capabilities to supply differentiated materials into the textile market.  
Our ECOFAST collaboration with Ralph Lauren lowers energy usage by 40% and water usage by 50% in the fabric dying process. And by 2025, the brand aims to incorporate this technology in more than 80% of its solid cotton products.  
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we're expanding our ability to formulate differentiated silicones for a number of attractive markets, including silicone adhesives for foldable displays in consumer electronics, thermal conducted silicone solutions for electric vehicles and silicone solutions for 5G where the market is expected to more than double over the next 10 years. And we recently partnered with customers on high-value innovations like paper barrier coating applications that use our award-winning Rhobarr polyolefin dispersion technology and Callaway's Supersoft golf balls, which feature a new hybrid cover made with Dow's paraloid-impact modifier.  
In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we're enhancing our extensive conversion and testing capabilities to commercialize residents through packaging design, speeding the innovation process and expanding the addressable market for higher margin and more sustainable products. For example, we're already benefiting from the 9-layer blown film extrusion line project completed this year. We're also making investments to improve asset reliability, which will increase output and expand margins. And we're using digital technology for customer trials and process automation to accelerate catalyst development for new resins and processes like FCDH where we can typically be 100x more efficient than conventional experimentation.  
Collectively, our slate of near-term investments will generate an increase of approximately $2 billion in underlying EBITDA, and we intend to deliver this growth with a disciplined and balanced approach, maintaining our top quartile performance in cash flow, cost structure, debt reduction and shareholder remuneration.  
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

The strategy we outlined at our Investor Day builds on our long history of industry leadership. Our plan enables us to capture demand from sustainability drivers, achieved 0 Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and deliver",561,"Thank you, Howard. Turning to Slide 9. The strategy we outlined at our Investor Day builds on our long history of industry leadership. Our plan enables us to capture demand from sustainability drivers, achieved 0 Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and deliver meaningful underlying earnings and cash flow growth for years to come. Our path to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings is a phased site-by-site approach that both retrofits and replaces end-of-life assets with low-carbon-emission facilities while also expanding our capacity. This plan will deliver a 30% reduction in our CO2 emissions between 2005 and 2030 through a disciplined approach that manages timing based on affordability, macro and regulatory drivers around the world.  
Our Texas 9 cracker proves that we can do this and do it well. Texas-9 is 60% lower-carbon intensity than any asset in our fleet, and that's without any specific design for carbon capture or hydrogen. The project was delivered with 20% better capital efficiency and 12 months faster than any other crackers built in that wave. Overall, the project has a 65% lower conversion cost, is running consistently at more than 110% of nameplate capacity and has delivered greater than 15% return on invested capital since start-up. We will leverage key learnings from Texas-9 as we plan to build the world's first-ever net zero carbon emissions ethylene cracker and derivatives complex in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, delivering approximately $1 billion in EBITDA, as Howard outlined earlier. This project will more than triple our ethylene and downstream derivative capacity at the site while decarbonizing emissions for 20% of our global ethylene capacity. We selected this site due to the availability of carbon capture, infrastructure, advantaged feedstocks and supportive government policies and incentives.  
On Slide 10, as we capture these attractive growth opportunities, we will maintain our balanced and disciplined financial approach since spin. We are committed to keeping CapEx at or below D&A, well below pre-spin levels, while targeting return on invested capital above 13% across the economic cycle. We will continue to align our capital spend to the macroeconomic environment, our affordability and return targets.  
Our investments align to 3 categories: First, we'll maintain our foundation and maximize the return of our existing assets while ensuring safe and reliable operations. Second, we'll execute our pipeline of faster payback, lower-risk incremental growth projects for downstream and sustainability-driven applications growing faster than GDP. And we'll invest approximately $1 billion per year to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings. These investments enable us to capture increasing demand for low carbon footprint products while derisking the enterprise with lower emissions assets.  
In closing, on Slide 11, Dow is well-positioned to deliver significant long-term value for shareholders. We have actions in place to both decarbonize our footprint and grow the enterprise as we achieve an additional $3 billion in underlying EBITDA, maintain industry-leading cash flow generation and drive towards zero Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions. Our balanced capital allocation approach targets more than 13% return on invested capital, keeps CapEx within D&A and return 65% of net income to shareholders across the economic cycle. All of this is underpinned by our industry-leading portfolio, cost position and strong track record of innovation that enables us to deliver differentiated products and solutions for our customers and a more sustainable world.  
With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open the Q&A."

P.J., good question. I'm going to walk through several things. I would say, in the near-term, the impact on silicon metal has been in China due to the restrictions from dual control. And as you know, that was driven by the higher coal prices really pushing up the cost for the electricity producers. And the electricity producers are capped on their electricity prices. 
So some of them didn't run, and that forced the industry curtailment. Typically, as you're going into cold weather months, industry takes the hit versus homeowners and consumers. You try to keep your people warm. And so that hit silicon metals. For that reason, things became tight. 
We've moved some silicon metals from Brazil over to China to offset that, and we'll run through the fourth quarter, but we decided to pull a turnaround in Zhangjiagang into the fourth quarter. We had originally planned it for first quarter. We decided to do it now. That takes a little pressure off the dual control situation. That turnaround will cost us, I think, on Slide 5, it's in there, $75 million in the fourth quarter. I expect we're going to see about $50 million higher cost, but both downstream G3 silicones demand and siloxane demand are very strong. And siloxane prices have gone up significantly. And so I think, we're going to be in that situation for all of the fourth quarter, and I would expect in the first quarter as well."

To your point on the 2 to 2.5 ratio, I would say some of our peers have a 1% swing between the low and the high, so we're already giving you a better-than-peer view with saying our range is only half a turn. But if you'd like me to narrow that further, I would say, use the midpoint. So our long-term average is 2 to 2.5. I would say, through the economic cycle, if you want to use 2.25, that's a reasonable proxy for where we want to be, but we have the corridor there to recognize that it's a long-term target.

We saw inventory declines in high density and linear low and a little bit of inventory build in low density, but it isn't a significant number. 
So when you look at the 5-year trends, and I think what we put in the slide deck to show you earlier, is that the order backlog is up about 30% above normal and the inventory-to-sales ratio was down about 10%. I think that's going to stay in that band for the most of the fourth quarter. And as the capacity comes back from the hurricanes, we have still supply and logistics issues, so there are bottlenecks everywhere, especially when it relates to marine pack cargo or export and as it relates to product being shipped by truck.

I do think that some of the moves that the government made recently to get the big ports 24/7 operation is going to help the backlog. What happens is typically, when those ports get backlogged, it spills over into other ports. We don't use Long Beach as much, but when traffic spills over in the other ports, that hits us. 
I would say that almost every value chain has some impact from that. And where we see the biggest impact is being able -- it's kind of blocking material getting out. And so we're starting to see some congestion and some competing demand. Product coming in. Sometimes it's faster to reload an empty container to get it back to China. And so that competes with other materials going out. We don't see that in every port, but certainly, on the West Coast, we're seeing that right now. I would say almost every value chain we have, every application we have is short product. And I don't think there's enough material tied up in all of that floating inventory or in the warehouses that, that is going to alleviate the demand or fill the demand that's out there right now. I still think the consumer is strong, and we've still got other economies that are coming back from COVID that are going to add to that demand."

We're going to bring more NGLs as we move out of the winter season. I believe what we're seeing short-term here is a knock-on effect as coal really ratcheted much higher in China. The first fuel that you go to that could replace coal in the fuel grid is natural gas. And then LNG obviously went right up after coal. And then the next fuel is oil, and oil came right up. And so that took us up to $80 a barrel. 
I think we're going to see things will stabilize a little bit. As we go into winter, inventories are a little light of the 5-year average going into winter. But you've seen prices unwind a little bit in the forward market by about $1 a million BTU because weather plays a significant factor. So we're going to have a warmer fall that's going to take a little bit of sting out of the natural gas prices. 
Even with that, the oil-to-gas ratio, but more importantly, the oil-to-gas spreads are good. And so I think that's going to continue. And if we get through winter without a really, really cold snap, then I think you're going to see prices to moderate. Long term or medium term, I would say, 250 to 450 for U.S. production. And long term, about 275 a million BTU for natural gas."

And second, if we stay in this, call it, $6 billion or so annualized operating cash flow range from the past, say, 24 months or so, we roughly know what CapEx will be next year. And it seems like there should still be a decent amount of excess cash. I know you stressed a balanced approach. But just how should we think about the priority of that excess cash?

The -- on the 2 to 2.5 debt-to-EBITDA ratio, that's a rating agency adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA target. So that's over a long term. Typically, the rating agencies will look at 2 years back, current year and then come up with a forward 2-year forecast. So when we think about that 2 to 2.5 range or as I target the midpoint, in answering to Jeff's questions of 2.25, that's over a 5- to a 10-year period. So as I mentioned, Jeff, we're slightly -- we're at the higher end of that range today. So you will -- you should expect over the next several years we'll continue to titrate that number down to the midpoint to 2.25. And depending on how things go, we might go to the lower end of that range, we'll see. 
In terms of the capital allocation priorities, it is -- we intend to continue what you've seen from us, which is disciplined and balanced approach. The #1 priority for us is to safely and reliably operate our plants. And then the next is organic investment. So where we have low-risk, high-return, fast-payback projects that helps us continue to get the through-the-cycle average return on capital of the enterprise of 13% or more, we will do that. Dividends would be next. So as the net income increases, that dividend should increase in line with the 45% of net income over the cycle. And then share repurchases. And we -- like I said earlier, we'll use share purchases to at least cover dilution, but then we will also be opportunistic in compares -- and the opportunistic share buyback to any other use of cash. And over the long run, our goal is to do the value-maximizing thing."

On decarbonization, I think it's just going to depend on the situation in the geographies that we're looking at the investments. In Canada, we don't need to do the back investment into CO2 capture and sequestration. And I think there are a lot of players that are out there that have capabilities to do that. So if we can keep our investments focused on assets that generate revenue for us and generate growth for us and are zero carbon emitting, I think there's plenty of room for third parties and others to play to help us to handle the CO2."

In Industrial Solutions, not only highest-value return to ethylene, but also high-value downstream growth, driven primarily by consumer applications. To some extent, oil and gas, which we see recovering. I know we have many, many cases where our oil and gas products help people reduce CO2 emissions in the midstream production.
And then things like ECOFAST Pure, which is a partnership with Ralph Lauren, where we just open sourced that technology to use that product, which would get textile mills that use cotton to switch over to a product that is -- uses 90% less chemicals, 50% less water, 50% less energy. I think that's a huge driving force towards more sustainability in an area that's a tough environmental aspect. 
And then, if you go to PM&C, we've got continued growth in our downstream systems, which have been growing at greater than 11% per year for a long time. We'll continue those investments. We've got high-growth targets for our downstream coatings business to continue to keep up with the demand, specifically traffic demand. Howard mentioned paper demand for paper cups replacing others with our roll bar dispersions and also architectural demand, which is our growth leader in that space.

And then also, if you have any thoughts on the recent widening of the ethane-to-natural gas spread, I think that's about $0.08 a gallon. Do you see that as kind of a short-term blip or perhaps something maybe a little bit more medium term?"

Look, I would just say this, our feedstock flexibility is really a key enabler of our consistent outperformance versus our peers, as you've seen in the last several years of our annual benchmarking. It includes what I would say is unmatched feedstock flexibility for most of our fleet. So we've got the ability to max ethane on the U.S. Gulf Coast. We also have propane. We can do minimum naphtha, if we need to in Europe. We also have the ability to do max LPG. To your point, I mean, propane is not necessarily in the slate right now, so you're not doing that in Europe. But then you also look at the point that Jim made earlier, which is we've got our Canadian advantage. We've got the feedstock flexibility in the U.S. Gulf Coast. We've got the Argentinian advantage, and we also have the Middle East. 
And I also think when you talk -- a lot of people talk about feedstock flexibility, but most of the time, what that means is they have 3 furnaces that can crack this speed, 2 furnaces that can crack this speed. When we talk feedstock flexibility in furnace flexibility. So we have the ability to switch within the furnace, and we can do it -- frankly, we can do it day by day. Typically, we do it every week. Do you have anything to add?"

Starting on Slide 3. In the third quarter, Dow achieved top and bottom line growth both year-over-year and sequentially. I'm incredibly proud of the Dow team for delivering these results and doing so safely despite industry supply disruptions from hurricanes on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our proactive storm preparations enabled us to maintain the safety of our team and community and recover quickly.  
We delivered a 53% sales increase year-over-year with double-digit gains in every segment, business and region. We also recorded a 7% increase in sales over the prior quarter. We captured strong price momentum, driven by tight supply-demand balances across our key value chains, and we achieved volume growth of 2% both year-over-year and sequentially, supported by continued strong end-market demand despite supply and logistics constraints.  
We increased operating EBIT by more than $2.1 billion year-over-year with improvements in all segments and businesses and $58 million higher sequentially. Key contributors included year-over-year margin expansion of 1,170 basis points, driven by price momentum and demand growth, and increased equity earnings, up $189 million, for margin expansion at our Sadara and Kuwait joint ventures.  
Our continued focus on cash generation and our balanced disciplined capital allocation enabled us to deliver cash flow from operations of $2.7 billion, up $958 million year-over-year, driven by margin expansion from price momentum in key value chains. We returned a total of $918 million to shareholders through our industry-leading dividend of $518 million, plus $400 million in share repurchases. And we also reduced gross debt by more than $1.1 billion in the quarter. Our proactive liability management actions to tender existing notes have resulted in no long-term debt maturities due until 2026, and we've reduced annual interest expense by more than $60 million.  
Overall, Dow continues to deliver on its priorities, and we see further strength ahead as we benefit from a favorable macro backdrop and execute our disciplined strategy to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings, driving significant value for all stakeholders.  
Moving to our segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $2 billion compared to $647 million in the year ago period. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $60 million. Price gains in both businesses and in all regions led to margin improvement in the core business and increased equity earnings. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT margins declined by 300 basis points on higher feedstock and energy costs. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business reported a net sales increase year-over-year, led by local price gains in industrial and consumer packaging and flexible food and beverage packaging applications. Volumes declined year-over-year due to lower polyethylene supply as a result of planned maintenance turnarounds and weather-related outages in the quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered price and volume gains on strong demand in industrial and consumer packaging applications, which were partly offset by hurricane-related outages.  
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT was $713 million, up $609 million year-over-year, primarily due to continued tight supply and demand in both businesses. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $65 million and operating EBIT margins expanded by 50 basis points on volume and price gains in both businesses. 
The Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year ago period, with price gains in all regions on tight supply-demand balances. Volume declines year-over-year primarily reflected the planned transition of a low-margin coproducer contract as well as weather-related outages and third-party supply constraints. Sequentially, the business delivered sales growth due to increased local price and volume from additional supply availability to meet resilient demand. The Industrial Solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year ago period, with local price gains in all regions. Volume increased year-over-year on strong demand for materials in industrial manufacturing and energy applications. Net sales also increased sequentially, driven by volume growth, primarily in coatings and industrial applications from increased supply and local price gains in all regions. 
And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $284 million, up $209 million versus the same quarter last year as margins increased 750 basis points due to strong price momentum and robust demand recovery for silicones and industrial coatings offerings. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $59 million on price gains, leading to margin expansion of 210 basis points.  
The Consumer Solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year with price gains in all regions. Volume increased over the prior year on stronger consumer demand for personal care, mobility and electronics offerings. Sequentially, sales were down as price increases in all regions were more than offset by volume declines as a result of planned maintenance and third-party supply and logistics constraints. 
The Coatings & Performance Monomers business delivered increased net sales year-over-year as higher raw material costs and tight supply/demand balances led to price gains in all regions. Volumes were down year-over-year as demand recovery for industrial coatings was more than offset by weather-related outages and third-party supply and logistics constraints. Sequentially, the business delivered local price gains in all regions, supported by increased volume due to continued strong demand for acrylic monomers and architectural coatings and increased supply availability.  
Now let me turn it over to Howard to review the modeling guidance."

And as a",1435,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, we see a continuation of robust demand growth across our packaging, infrastructure, consumer and mobility end markets. Brand owner inventory levels remain low. And as a result, we anticipate higher seasonal demand continuing into the holiday season this year.  
In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we continue to see resilient demand for packaging applications and for our differentiated functional polymers. Global polyethylene supply remains constrained as the industry completes higher turnaround activity and supply chains recover from weather events on the U.S. Gulf Coast. We exited the third quarter experiencing higher raw material and energy costs, which we anticipate will likely persist through the fourth quarter. We expect these costs to be an approximately $350 million headwind sequentially. Dow will continue to utilize our broad geographic footprint and best-in-class feedstock flexibility to help mitigate these impacts. 
We also anticipate a $175 million tailwind from turnarounds in the quarter as we completed our planned maintenance at our cracker in Canada.  
In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, continued consumer demand for furniture and bedding, appliances, pharma and home care are expected to keep supply tight in our key value chains. Due to the weather-related outages in the third quarter, some of our planned turnaround activity was moved to the fourth quarter. Sadara will also start a turnaround at its isocyanate facility in the fourth quarter as well. Altogether, we anticipate $100 million in this segment from turnaround impacts. Short-term increased energy costs in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Europe are expected to be an additional $100 million headwind in the quarter. We continue to see sequential recovery in industrial activity, particularly for energy applications. We anticipate this recovery will continue at least through the fourth quarter as industrial production continues to ramp up from very low inventory levels to meet demand.  
In Performance Materials & Coatings, demand for electronics, mobility, building and construction continues to outpace supply. Demand for architectural coatings is also expected to remain elevated due to persistently low inventory levels across the value chain. Global production for silicones has been impacted by the recent dual control policy enforcement actions in China, with silicon metal prices almost 3x their previous highs. We intend to pull forward a scheduled turnaround at a siloxane facility in Zhangjiagang, China to coincide with government actions to curtail power usage. Our current estimate for the quarter includes $125 million from increased raw material costs and turnaround impacts. We'll continue to work on mitigating the impacts of rising raw material costs through our integrated position in both businesses.  
Despite higher raw material and energy costs in the fourth quarter, Dow will continue to leverage its advantaged global footprint, structural cost and feedstock advantages as well as our broad suite of differentiated products to meet growing demand.  
On Slide 6, as we look ahead, we expect robust economic growth to continue. With the Delta variant slowing the reopening of economies around the world, there remains significant pent-up demand globally, particularly across our industrial and consumer end markets. Many industries continue to see elevated order backlogs, coupled with low inventory levels, as supply chains struggled to keep up with robust demand. These supply chain disruptions are expected to persist, which will certainly prolong the ability to restock inventories across most value chains. As a result, we expect tighter-than-forecasted market conditions to continue, a view strengthened by China's recent dual control policy that has impacted both coal to olefins and methanol to olefins-based capacity, which represent more than 30% of China's total polyethylene production.  
2022 GDP growth forecasts are well above historical averages in most areas of the world as industries ramp up to match the robust consumer demand with further upside as global chip shortages continue to extend the recovery in manufacturing. Collectively, G7 countries have not yet fully recovered to pre-pandemic GDP. This points to additional upside as economies return to more normalized consumption levels with degree of vaccination increasing, particularly in Asia, where levels remain low relative to the rest of the world. 
Moving to Slide 7. At our Investor Day earlier this month, we outlined how our differentiated portfolio and our focus on sustainability-driven innovation will enable more than $3 billion in underlying EBITDA improvement across the cycle. Our restructuring program and digital investments will yield $600 million in increased EBITDA. Both are in progress, and our restructuring program is on track to achieve its $300 million run rate by year-end.  
We also have a suite of higher return, lower risk and faster payback capital and operating investments that will enable an additional $2 billion in EBITDA in the near term. And our investments to decarbonize and grow at our Fort Saskatchewan site in Alberta, Canada are also expected to deliver approximately $1 billion in increased EBITDA. And as we've already shared, we're executing against a favorable macro backdrop that we expect will continue to support constructive market fundamentals for our key value chains.  
Turning to Slide 8. You'll see the detailed list of these low-risk growth investments. Our capital investments are expected to generate $1 billion in EBITDA through incremental capacity expansions, debottlenecking and enhanced feedstock flexibility across our operating segments. We're already making good progress. For example, in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, our Fort Saskatchewan expansion to add ethylene capacity of 65,000 metric tons per year to support growing polyethylene demand is now complete and will ramp by the end of the fourth quarter. Our FCDH pilot plant in Louisiana will start up in 2022, featuring 20% to 40% lower CapEx and 5% to 7% lower OpEx, while reducing CO2 emissions by up to 20% compared to other PDH technologies.  
In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, our debottlenecking project to add 60,000 metric tons per year of aniline will be fully online by year-end. And earlier this year, we signed an MOU for a new South China hub to advance local supply and formulating capabilities to serve the fast-growing Asia Pacific market.  
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we recently completed a capacity expansion at one of our silicone polymer plants. And by year-end, we will complete a new silicone sealant compounding unit to enable sustainable solutions for high-performance building and infrastructure applications. And we are progressing our 50 kt methacrylate investment on the U.S. Gulf Coast to support global end markets such as inks, resins and packaging materials, which is scheduled to come online in the first half of next year. In addition, our operating investments are also expected to generate another $1 billion in EBITDA as we improve our production capabilities and shift our product mix to higher growth and higher value markets. For example, in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, we're increasing capabilities and shifting our mix toward higher-margin polyurethane systems for mobility and consumer applications. Our Industrial Solutions business is increasing capabilities to supply differentiated materials into the textile market. 
Our ECOFAST collaboration with Ralph Lauren lowers energy usage by 40% and water usage by 50% in the fabric dying process. And by 2025, the brand aims to incorporate this technology in more than 80% of its solid cotton products. 
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we're expanding our ability to formulate differentiated silicones for a number of attractive markets, including silicone adhesives for foldable displays in consumer electronics, thermal conducted silicone solutions for electric vehicles and silicone solutions for 5G where the market is expected to more than double over the next 10 years. And we recently partnered with customers on high-value innovations like paper barrier coating applications that use our award-winning RHOBARR polyolefin dispersion technology and Callaway's Supersoft golf balls, which feature a new hybrid cover made with Dow's PARALOID-impact modifier.  
In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we're enhancing our extensive conversion and testing capabilities to commercialize resins through packaging design, speeding the innovation process and expanding the addressable market for higher margin and more sustainable products. For example, we're already benefiting from the 9-layer blown film extrusion line project completed this year. We're also making investments to improve asset reliability, which will increase output and expand margins. And we're using digital technology for customer trials and process automation to accelerate catalyst development for new resins and processes like FCDH where we can typically be 100x more efficient than conventional experimentation. 
Collectively, our slate of near-term investments will generate an increase of approximately $2 billion in underlying EBITDA, and we intend to deliver this growth with a disciplined and balanced approach, maintaining our top quartile performance in cash flow, cost structure, debt reduction and shareholder remuneration. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

The strategy we outlined at our Investor Day builds on our long history of industry leadership. Our plan enables us to capture demand from sustainability drivers, achieve 0 Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and deliver meaningful underlying earnings and cash flow growth for years to come. Our path to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings is a phased site-by-site approach that both retrofits and replaces end-of-life assets with low-carbon-emission facilities while also expanding our capacity. This plan will deliver a 30% reduction in our CO2 emissions between 2005 and 2030 through a disciplined approach that manages timing based on affordability, macro and regulatory drivers around the world.  
Our Texas-9 cracker proves that we can do this and do it well. Texas-9 is 60% lower carbon intensity than any asset in our fleet, and that's without any specific design for carbon capture or hydrogen. The project was delivered with 20% better capital efficiency and 12 months faster than any other crackers built in that wave. Overall, the project has a 65% lower conversion cost, is running consistently at more than 110% of nameplate capacity and has delivered greater than 15% return on invested capital since start-up. We will leverage key learnings from Texas-9 as we plan to build the world's first-ever net zero carbon emissions ethylene cracker and derivatives complex in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, delivering approximately $1 billion in EBITDA, as Howard outlined earlier. This project will more than triple our ethylene and downstream derivative capacity at the site while decarbonizing emissions for 20% of our global ethylene capacity. We selected this site due to the availability of carbon capture, infrastructure, advantaged feedstocks and supportive government policies and incentives. 
On Slide 10, as we capture these attractive growth opportunities, we will maintain our balanced and disciplined financial approach since spin. We are committed to keeping CapEx at or below D&A, well below pre-spin levels, while targeting return on invested capital above 13% across the economic cycle. We will continue to align our capital spend to the macroeconomic environment, our affordability and return targets. 
Our investments align to 3 categories: First, we'll maintain our foundation and maximize the return of our existing assets while ensuring safe and reliable operations. Second, we'll execute our pipeline of faster payback, lower-risk incremental growth projects for downstream and sustainability-driven applications growing faster than GDP. And we'll invest approximately $1 billion per year to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings. These investments enable us to capture increasing demand for low carbon footprint products while derisking the enterprise with lower emissions assets.  
In closing, on Slide 11, Dow is well-positioned to deliver significant long-term value for shareholders. We have actions in place to both decarbonize our footprint and grow the enterprise as we achieve an additional $3 billion in underlying EBITDA, maintain industry-leading cash flow generation and drive towards zero Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions. Our balanced capital allocation approach targets more than 13% return on invested capital, keeps CapEx within D&A and return 65% of net income to shareholders across the economic cycle. All of this is underpinned by our industry-leading portfolio, cost position and strong track record of innovation that enables us to deliver differentiated products and solutions for our customers and a more sustainable world. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open the Q&A."

P.J., good question. I'm going to walk through several things. I would say, in the near-term, the impact on silicon metal has been in China due to the restrictions from dual control. And as you know, that was driven by the higher coal prices really pushing up the cost for the electricity producers. And the electricity producers are capped on their electricity prices. 
So some of them didn't run, and that forced the industry curtailment. Typically, as you're going into cold weather months, industry takes the hit versus homeowners and consumers. You try to keep your people warm. And so that hit silicon metals. For that reason, things became tight. 
We've moved some silicon metals from Brazil over to China to offset that, and we'll run through the fourth quarter, but we decided to pull a turnaround in Zhangjiagang into the fourth quarter. We had originally planned it for first quarter. We decided to do it now. That takes a little pressure off the dual control situation. That turnaround will cost us, I think, on Slide 5, it's in there, $75 million in the fourth quarter. I expect we're going to see about $50 million higher cost, but both downstream G3 silicones demand and siloxanes demand are very strong. And siloxanes prices have gone up significantly. And so I think we're going to be in that situation for all of the fourth quarter, and I would expect into the first quarter as well."

To your point on the 2 to 2.5 ratio, I would say some of our peers have a 1% swing between the low and the high, so we're already giving you a better-than-peer view with saying our range is only half a turn. But if you'd like me to narrow that further, I would say, use the midpoint. So our long-term average is 2 to 2.5. I would say, through the economic cycle, if you want to use 2.25, that's a reasonable proxy for where we want to be, but we have the corridor there to recognize that it's a long-term target. Punctually today, using the rating agency methodology through the end of the third quarter, we're probably around 2.4, 2.5.

We saw inventory declines in high density and linear low and a little bit of inventory build in low density, but it isn't a significant number. 
So when you look at the 5-year trends, and I think what we put in the slide deck to show you earlier, is that the order backlog is up about 30% above normal and the inventory-to-sales ratio was down about 10%. I think that's going to stay in that band for most of the fourth quarter. And as the capacity comes back from the hurricanes, we have still supply and logistics issues, so there are bottlenecks everywhere, especially when it relates to marine pack cargo or export and as it relates to product being shipped by truck. It's a little hand-to-hand combat right now. And if a truck driver doesn't show up, shipment gets delayed.

What happens is typically, when those ports get backlog, it spills over into other ports. We don't use Long Beach as much, but when traffic spills over into the other ports, it hits us. 
I would say that almost every value chain has some impact from that. And where we see the biggest impact is being able -- it's kind of blocking material getting out. And so we're starting to see some congestion and some competing demand. Product coming in. Sometimes it's faster to reload an empty container to get it back to China. And so that competes with other materials going out. We don't see that in every port, but certainly, on the West Coast, we're seeing that right now. I would say almost every value chain we have, every application we have is short product. And I don't think there's enough material tied up in all of that floating inventory or in the warehouses that, that is going to alleviate the demand or fill the demand that's out there right now.

We're going to bring more NGLs as we move out of the winter season. I believe what we're seeing short term here is a knock-on effect as coal really ratcheted much higher in China. The first fuel that you go to that could replace coal in the fuel grid is natural gas. And then LNG obviously went right up after coal. And then the next fuel is oil, and oil came right up. And so that took us up to $80 a barrel. 
I think we're going to see things will stabilize a little bit. As we go into winter, inventories are a little light of the 5-year average going into winter. But you've seen prices unwind a little bit in the forward market by about $1 a million BTU because weather plays a significant factor. So if we've a warmer fall, that's going to take a little bit of sting out of the natural gas prices. 
Even with that, the oil-to-gas ratio, but more importantly, the oil-to-gas spreads are good. And so I think that's going to continue. And if we get through winter without a really, really cold snap, then I think you're going to see prices to moderate. Long term or medium term, I would say, $2.50 to $4.50 for U.S. production.

So you will -- you should expect over the next several years we'll continue to titrate that number down to the midpoint to 2.25.

In terms of the capital allocation priorities, it is -- we intend to continue what you've seen from us, which is disciplined and balanced approach. The #1 priority for us is to safely and reliably operate our plants. And then the next is organic investment. So where we have low-risk, high-return, fast-payback projects that helps us continue to get the through-the-cycle average return on capital of the enterprise to 13% or more, we will do that. Dividends would be next. So as the net income increases, that dividend should increase in line with the 45% of net income over the cycle. And then share repurchases. And we -- like I said earlier, we'll use share purchases to at least cover dilution, but then we will also be opportunistic and compare opportunistic share buyback to any other use of cash.

I would also say, though, that we've been trying -- customers are in close communication. And we're trying, obviously, to keep everybody running. There's a lot of juggling going on. There are some specialty grades where it's hard to shift the mix up because things are so tight right now, especially in some of our elastomeric products. 
On decarbonization, I think it's just going to depend on the situation in the geographies that we're looking at the investments. In Canada, we don't need to do the back investment into CO2 capture and sequestration. And I think there are a lot of players that are out there that have capabilities to do that. So if we can keep our investments focused on assets that generate revenue for us and generate growth for us and are zero carbon emitting, I think there's plenty of room for third parties and others to play to help us to handle the CO2."

And if you look at mobility and if you look at electronics and if you look at consumer applications, they're going to continue to grow as well as we've got expansions coming for silicones products into construction sealants for glass glazing for big skyscraper buildings. So that is high GDP growth, and that's going to continue. In Industrial Solutions, not only highest-value return to ethylene, but also high-value downstream growth, driven primarily by consumer applications. To some extent, oil and gas, which we see recovering. I know we have many, many cases where our oil and gas products help people reduce CO2 emissions in the midstream production.
And then things like ECOFAST Pure, which is a partnership with Ralph Lauren, where we just open sourced that technology to use that product, which would get textile mills that use cotton to switch over to a product that is -- uses 90% less chemicals, 50% less water, 50% less energy. I think that's a huge driving force towards more sustainability in an area that's a tough environmental aspect. 
And then, if you go to PM&C, we've got continued growth in our downstream systems, which have been growing at greater than 11% per year for a long time. We'll continue those investments. We've got high growth targets for our downstream coatings business to continue to keep up with the demand, specifically traffic demand. Howard mentioned paper demand for paper cups replacing others with our RHOBARR dispersions and also architectural demand, which is our growth leader in that space. And then you get back to Packaging & Specialty Plastics, which is continuing to grow above GDP, about 1.4x GDP in our forward forecast. 
It's very dispersed. So when we talk about $3 billion of EBITDA growth over that time period, it's pretty evenly split between all 3 segments, and you're going to see about $200 million to $300 million of it come on next year, and that is projects that are already completed and will be finished by the end of the year."

Our feedstock flexibility is really a key enabler of our consistent outperformance versus our peers, as you've seen in the last several years of our annual benchmarking.

We can do minimum naphtha, if we need to in Europe. We also have the ability to do max LPG. To your point, I mean, propane is not necessarily in the slate right now, so you're not doing that in Europe.

Starting on Slide 3. In the third quarter, Dow achieved top and bottom line growth both year-over-year and sequentially. I'm incredibly proud of the Dow team for delivering these results and doing so safely despite industry supply disruptions from hurricanes on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our proactive storm preparations enabled us to maintain the safety of our team and community and recover quickly.  
We delivered a 53% sales increase year-over-year with double-digit gains in every segment, business and region. We also recorded a 7% increase in sales over the prior quarter. We captured strong price momentum, driven by tight supply-demand balances across our key value chains, and we achieved volume growth of 2% both year-over-year and sequentially, supported by continued strong end-market demand despite supply and logistics constraints.  
We increased operating EBIT by more than $2.1 billion year-over-year with improvements in all segments and businesses and $58 million higher sequentially. Key contributors included year-over-year margin expansion of 1,170 basis points, driven by price momentum and demand growth, and increased equity earnings, up $189 million, for margin expansion at our Sadara and Kuwait joint ventures.  
Our continued focus on cash generation and our balanced disciplined capital allocation enabled us to deliver cash flow from operations of $2.7 billion, up $958 million year-over-year, driven by margin expansion from price momentum in key value chains. We returned a total of $918 million to shareholders through our industry-leading dividend of $518 million, plus $400 million in share repurchases. And we also reduced gross debt by more than $1.1 billion in the quarter. Our proactive liability management actions to tender existing notes have resulted in no long-term debt maturities due until 2026, and we've reduced annual interest expense by more than $60 million.  
Overall, Dow continues to deliver on its priorities, and we see further strength ahead as we benefit from a favorable macro backdrop and execute our disciplined strategy to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings, driving significant value for all stakeholders.  
Moving to our segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $2 billion compared to $647 million in the year ago period. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $60 million. Price gains in both businesses and in all regions led to margin improvement in the core business and increased equity earnings. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT margins declined by 300 basis points on higher feedstock and energy costs. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business reported a net sales increase year-over-year, led by local price gains in industrial and consumer packaging and flexible food and beverage packaging applications. Volumes declined year-over-year due to lower polyethylene supply as a result of planned maintenance turnarounds and weather-related outages in the quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered price and volume gains on strong demand in industrial and consumer packaging applications, which were partly offset by hurricane-related outages.  
Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT was $713 million, up $609 million year-over-year, primarily due to continued tight supply and demand in both businesses. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $65 million and operating EBIT margins expanded by 50 basis points on volume and price gains in both businesses. 
The Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year ago period, with price gains in all regions on tight supply-demand balances. Volume declines year-over-year primarily reflected the planned transition of a low-margin coproducer contract as well as weather-related outages and third-party supply constraints. Sequentially, the business delivered sales growth due to increased local price and volume from additional supply availability to meet resilient demand. The Industrial Solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year ago period, with local price gains in all regions. Volume increased year-over-year on strong demand for materials in industrial manufacturing and energy applications. Net sales also increased sequentially, driven by volume growth, primarily in coatings and industrial applications from increased supply and local price gains in all regions. 
And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $284 million, up $209 million versus the same quarter last year as margins increased 750 basis points due to strong price momentum and robust demand recovery for silicones and industrial coatings offerings. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $59 million on price gains, leading to margin expansion of 210 basis points.  
The Consumer Solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year with price gains in all regions. Volume increased over the prior year on stronger consumer demand for personal care, mobility and electronics offerings. Sequentially, sales were down as price increases in all regions were more than offset by volume declines as a result of planned maintenance and third-party supply and logistics constraints. 
The Coatings & Performance Monomers business delivered increased net sales year-over-year as higher raw material costs and tight supply/demand balances led to price gains in all regions. Volumes were down year-over-year as demand recovery for industrial coatings was more than offset by weather-related outages and third-party supply and logistics constraints. Sequentially, the business delivered local price gains in all regions, supported by increased volume due to continued strong demand for acrylic monomers and architectural coatings and increased supply availability.  
Now let me turn it over to Howard to review the modeling guidance."

And as a",1435,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, we see a continuation of robust demand growth across our packaging, infrastructure, consumer and mobility end markets. Brand owner inventory levels remain low. And as a result, we anticipate higher seasonal demand continuing into the holiday season this year.  
In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we continue to see resilient demand for packaging applications and for our differentiated functional polymers. Global polyethylene supply remains constrained as the industry completes higher turnaround activity and supply chains recover from weather events on the U.S. Gulf Coast. We exited the third quarter experiencing higher raw material and energy costs, which we anticipate will likely persist through the fourth quarter. We expect these costs to be an approximately $350 million headwind sequentially. Dow will continue to utilize our broad geographic footprint and best-in-class feedstock flexibility to help mitigate these impacts. 
We also anticipate a $175 million tailwind from turnarounds in the quarter as we completed our planned maintenance at our cracker in Canada.  
In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, continued consumer demand for furniture and bedding, appliances, pharma and home care are expected to keep supply tight in our key value chains. Due to the weather-related outages in the third quarter, some of our planned turnaround activity was moved to the fourth quarter. Sadara will also start a turnaround at its isocyanate facility in the fourth quarter as well. Altogether, we anticipate $100 million in this segment from turnaround impacts. Short-term increased energy costs in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Europe are expected to be an additional $100 million headwind in the quarter. We continue to see sequential recovery in industrial activity, particularly for energy applications. We anticipate this recovery will continue at least through the fourth quarter as industrial production continues to ramp up from very low inventory levels to meet demand.  
In Performance Materials & Coatings, demand for electronics, mobility, building and construction continues to outpace supply. Demand for architectural coatings is also expected to remain elevated due to persistently low inventory levels across the value chain. Global production for silicones has been impacted by the recent dual control policy enforcement actions in China, with silicon metal prices almost 3x their previous highs. We intend to pull forward a scheduled turnaround at a siloxane facility in Zhangjiagang, China to coincide with government actions to curtail power usage. Our current estimate for the quarter includes $125 million from increased raw material costs and turnaround impacts. We'll continue to work on mitigating the impacts of rising raw material costs through our integrated position in both businesses.  
Despite higher raw material and energy costs in the fourth quarter, Dow will continue to leverage its advantaged global footprint, structural cost and feedstock advantages as well as our broad suite of differentiated products to meet growing demand.  
On Slide 6, as we look ahead, we expect robust economic growth to continue. With the Delta variant slowing the reopening of economies around the world, there remains significant pent-up demand globally, particularly across our industrial and consumer end markets. Many industries continue to see elevated order backlogs, coupled with low inventory levels, as supply chains struggled to keep up with robust demand. These supply chain disruptions are expected to persist, which will certainly prolong the ability to restock inventories across most value chains. As a result, we expect tighter-than-forecasted market conditions to continue, a view strengthened by China's recent dual control policy that has impacted both coal to olefins and methanol to olefins-based capacity, which represent more than 30% of China's total polyethylene production.  
2022 GDP growth forecasts are well above historical averages in most areas of the world as industries ramp up to match the robust consumer demand with further upside as global chip shortages continue to extend the recovery in manufacturing. Collectively, G7 countries have not yet fully recovered to pre-pandemic GDP. This points to additional upside as economies return to more normalized consumption levels with degree of vaccination increasing, particularly in Asia, where levels remain low relative to the rest of the world. 
Moving to Slide 7. At our Investor Day earlier this month, we outlined how our differentiated portfolio and our focus on sustainability-driven innovation will enable more than $3 billion in underlying EBITDA improvement across the cycle. Our restructuring program and digital investments will yield $600 million in increased EBITDA. Both are in progress, and our restructuring program is on track to achieve its $300 million run rate by year-end.  
We also have a suite of higher return, lower risk and faster payback capital and operating investments that will enable an additional $2 billion in EBITDA in the near term. And our investments to decarbonize and grow at our Fort Saskatchewan site in Alberta, Canada are also expected to deliver approximately $1 billion in increased EBITDA. And as we've already shared, we're executing against a favorable macro backdrop that we expect will continue to support constructive market fundamentals for our key value chains.  
Turning to Slide 8. You'll see the detailed list of these low-risk growth investments. Our capital investments are expected to generate $1 billion in EBITDA through incremental capacity expansions, debottlenecking and enhanced feedstock flexibility across our operating segments. We're already making good progress. For example, in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, our Fort Saskatchewan expansion to add ethylene capacity of 65,000 metric tons per year to support growing polyethylene demand is now complete and will ramp by the end of the fourth quarter. Our FCDH pilot plant in Louisiana will start up in 2022, featuring 20% to 40% lower CapEx and 5% to 7% lower OpEx, while reducing CO2 emissions by up to 20% compared to other PDH technologies.  
In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, our debottlenecking project to add 60,000 metric tons per year of aniline will be fully online by year-end. And earlier this year, we signed an MOU for a new South China hub to advance local supply and formulating capabilities to serve the fast-growing Asia Pacific market.  
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we recently completed a capacity expansion at one of our silicone polymer plants. And by year-end, we will complete a new silicone sealant compounding unit to enable sustainable solutions for high-performance building and infrastructure applications. And we are progressing our 50 kt methacrylate investment on the U.S. Gulf Coast to support global end markets such as inks, resins and packaging materials, which is scheduled to come online in the first half of next year. In addition, our operating investments are also expected to generate another $1 billion in EBITDA as we improve our production capabilities and shift our product mix to higher growth and higher value markets. For example, in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, we're increasing capabilities and shifting our mix toward higher-margin polyurethane systems for mobility and consumer applications. Our Industrial Solutions business is increasing capabilities to supply differentiated materials into the textile market. 
Our ECOFAST collaboration with Ralph Lauren lowers energy usage by 40% and water usage by 50% in the fabric dying process. And by 2025, the brand aims to incorporate this technology in more than 80% of its solid cotton products. 
In Performance Materials & Coatings, we're expanding our ability to formulate differentiated silicones for a number of attractive markets, including silicone adhesives for foldable displays in consumer electronics, thermal conducted silicone solutions for electric vehicles and silicone solutions for 5G where the market is expected to more than double over the next 10 years. And we recently partnered with customers on high-value innovations like paper barrier coating applications that use our award-winning RHOBARR polyolefin dispersion technology and Callaway's Supersoft golf balls, which feature a new hybrid cover made with Dow's PARALOID-impact modifier.  
In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we're enhancing our extensive conversion and testing capabilities to commercialize resins through packaging design, speeding the innovation process and expanding the addressable market for higher margin and more sustainable products. For example, we're already benefiting from the 9-layer blown film extrusion line project completed this year. We're also making investments to improve asset reliability, which will increase output and expand margins. And we're using digital technology for customer trials and process automation to accelerate catalyst development for new resins and processes like FCDH where we can typically be 100x more efficient than conventional experimentation. 
Collectively, our slate of near-term investments will generate an increase of approximately $2 billion in underlying EBITDA, and we intend to deliver this growth with a disciplined and balanced approach, maintaining our top quartile performance in cash flow, cost structure, debt reduction and shareholder remuneration. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

The strategy we outlined at our Investor Day builds on our long history of industry leadership. Our plan enables us to capture demand from sustainability drivers, achieve 0 Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and deliver",561,"Thank you, Howard. Turning to Slide 9. The strategy we outlined at our Investor Day builds on our long history of industry leadership. Our plan enables us to capture demand from sustainability drivers, achieve 0 Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and deliver meaningful underlying earnings and cash flow growth for years to come. Our path to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings is a phased site-by-site approach that both retrofits and replaces end-of-life assets with low-carbon-emission facilities while also expanding our capacity. This plan will deliver a 30% reduction in our CO2 emissions between 2005 and 2030 through a disciplined approach that manages timing based on affordability, macro and regulatory drivers around the world.  
Our Texas-9 cracker proves that we can do this and do it well. Texas-9 is 60% lower carbon intensity than any asset in our fleet, and that's without any specific design for carbon capture or hydrogen. The project was delivered with 20% better capital efficiency and 12 months faster than any other crackers built in that wave. Overall, the project has a 65% lower conversion cost, is running consistently at more than 110% of nameplate capacity and has delivered greater than 15% return on invested capital since start-up. We will leverage key learnings from Texas-9 as we plan to build the world's first-ever net zero carbon emissions ethylene cracker and derivatives complex in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, delivering approximately $1 billion in EBITDA, as Howard outlined earlier. This project will more than triple our ethylene and downstream derivative capacity at the site while decarbonizing emissions for 20% of our global ethylene capacity. We selected this site due to the availability of carbon capture, infrastructure, advantaged feedstocks and supportive government policies and incentives. 
On Slide 10, as we capture these attractive growth opportunities, we will maintain our balanced and disciplined financial approach since spin. We are committed to keeping CapEx at or below D&A, well below pre-spin levels, while targeting return on invested capital above 13% across the economic cycle. We will continue to align our capital spend to the macroeconomic environment, our affordability and return targets. 
Our investments align to 3 categories: First, we'll maintain our foundation and maximize the return of our existing assets while ensuring safe and reliable operations. Second, we'll execute our pipeline of faster payback, lower-risk incremental growth projects for downstream and sustainability-driven applications growing faster than GDP. And we'll invest approximately $1 billion per year to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings. These investments enable us to capture increasing demand for low carbon footprint products while derisking the enterprise with lower emissions assets.  
In closing, on Slide 11, Dow is well-positioned to deliver significant long-term value for shareholders. We have actions in place to both decarbonize our footprint and grow the enterprise as we achieve an additional $3 billion in underlying EBITDA, maintain industry-leading cash flow generation and drive towards zero Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions. Our balanced capital allocation approach targets more than 13% return on invested capital, keeps CapEx within D&A and return 65% of net income to shareholders across the economic cycle. All of this is underpinned by our industry-leading portfolio, cost position and strong track record of innovation that enables us to deliver differentiated products and solutions for our customers and a more sustainable world. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open the Q&A."

P.J., good question. I'm going to walk through several things. I would say, in the near-term, the impact on silicon metal has been in China due to the restrictions from dual control. And as you know, that was driven by the higher coal prices really pushing up the cost for the electricity producers. And the electricity producers are capped on their electricity prices. 
So some of them didn't run, and that forced the industry curtailment. Typically, as you're going into cold weather months, industry takes the hit versus homeowners and consumers. You try to keep your people warm. And so that hit silicon metals. For that reason, things became tight. 
We've moved some silicon metals from Brazil over to China to offset that, and we'll run through the fourth quarter, but we decided to pull a turnaround in Zhangjiagang into the fourth quarter. We had originally planned it for first quarter. We decided to do it now. That takes a little pressure off the dual control situation. That turnaround will cost us, I think, on Slide 5, it's in there, $75 million in the fourth quarter. I expect we're going to see about $50 million higher cost, but both downstream G3 silicones demand and siloxanes demand are very strong. And siloxanes prices have gone up significantly. And so I think we're going to be in that situation for all of the fourth quarter, and I would expect into the first quarter as well."

To your point on the 2 to 2.5 ratio, I would say some of our peers have a 1% swing between the low and the high, so we're already giving you a better-than-peer view with saying our range is only half a turn. But if you'd like me to narrow that further, I would say, use the midpoint. So our long-term average is 2 to 2.5. I would say, through the economic cycle, if you want to use 2.25, that's a reasonable proxy for where we want to be, but we have the corridor there to recognize that it's a long-term target. Punctually today, using the rating agency methodology through the end of the third quarter, we're probably around 2.4, 2.5.

We saw inventory declines in high density and linear low and a little bit of inventory build in low density, but it isn't a significant number. 
So when you look at the 5-year trends, and I think what we put in the slide deck to show you earlier, is that the order backlog is up about 30% above normal and the inventory-to-sales ratio was down about 10%. I think that's going to stay in that band for most of the fourth quarter. And as the capacity comes back from the hurricanes, we have still supply and logistics issues, so there are bottlenecks everywhere, especially when it relates to marine pack cargo or export and as it relates to product being shipped by truck.

I do think that some of the moves that the government made recently to get the big ports 24/7 operation is going to help the backlog. What happens is typically, when those ports get backlog, it spills over into other ports. We don't use Long Beach as much, but when traffic spills over into the other ports, it hits us. 
I would say that almost every value chain has some impact from that. And where we see the biggest impact is being able -- it's kind of blocking material getting out. And so we're starting to see some congestion and some competing demand. Product coming in. Sometimes it's faster to reload an empty container to get it back to China. And so that competes with other materials going out. We don't see that in every port, but certainly, on the West Coast, we're seeing that right now. I would say almost every value chain we have, every application we have is short product. And I don't think there's enough material tied up in all of that floating inventory or in the warehouses that, that is going to alleviate the demand or fill the demand that's out there right now. I still think the consumer is strong, and we've still got other economies that are coming back from COVID that are going to add to that demand."

We're going to bring more NGLs as we move out of the winter season. I believe what we're seeing short term here is a knock-on effect as coal really ratcheted much higher in China. The first fuel that you go to that could replace coal in the fuel grid is natural gas. And then LNG obviously went right up after coal. And then the next fuel is oil, and oil came right up. And so that took us up to $80 a barrel. 
I think we're going to see things will stabilize a little bit. As we go into winter, inventories are a little light of the 5-year average going into winter. But you've seen prices unwind a little bit in the forward market by about $1 a million BTU because weather plays a significant factor. So if we've a warmer fall, that's going to take a little bit of sting out of the natural gas prices. 
Even with that, the oil-to-gas ratio, but more importantly, the oil-to-gas spreads are good. And so I think that's going to continue. And if we get through winter without a really, really cold snap, then I think you're going to see prices to moderate. Long term or medium term, I would say, $2.50 to $4.50 for U.S. production. And long term, about $2.75 a million BTU for natural gas."

And second, if we stay in this, call it, $6 billion or so annualized operating cash flow range from the past, say, 24 months or so, we roughly know what CapEx will be next year. And it seems like there should still be a decent amount of excess cash. I know you stressed a balanced approach. But just how should we think about the priority of that excess cash?

Typically, the rating agencies will look at 2 years back, current year and then come up with a forward 2-year forecast. So when we think about that 2 to 2.5 range or as I target the midpoint, in answering to Jeff's questions, of 2.25, that's over a 5- to a 10-year period. So as I mentioned to Jeff, we're slightly -- we're at the higher end of that range today. So you will -- you should expect over the next several years we'll continue to titrate that number down to the midpoint to 2.25. And depending on how things go, we might go to the lower end of that range, we'll see. 
In terms of the capital allocation priorities, it is -- we intend to continue what you've seen from us, which is disciplined and balanced approach. The #1 priority for us is to safely and reliably operate our plants. And then the next is organic investment. So where we have low-risk, high-return, fast-payback projects that helps us continue to get the through-the-cycle average return on capital of the enterprise to 13% or more, we will do that. Dividends would be next. So as the net income increases, that dividend should increase in line with the 45% of net income over the cycle. And then share repurchases. And we -- like I said earlier, we'll use share purchases to at least cover dilution, but then we will also be opportunistic and compare opportunistic share buyback to any other use of cash.

On decarbonization, I think it's just going to depend on the situation in the geographies that we're looking at the investments. In Canada, we don't need to do the back investment into CO2 capture and sequestration. And I think there are a lot of players that are out there that have capabilities to do that. So if we can keep our investments focused on assets that generate revenue for us and generate growth for us and are zero carbon emitting, I think there's plenty of room for third parties and others to play to help us to handle the CO2."

So that is high GDP growth, and that's going to continue. In Industrial Solutions, not only highest-value return to ethylene, but also high-value downstream growth, driven primarily by consumer applications. To some extent, oil and gas, which we see recovering. I know we have many, many cases where our oil and gas products help people reduce CO2 emissions in the midstream production.
And then things like ECOFAST Pure, which is a partnership with Ralph Lauren, where we just open sourced that technology to use that product, which would get textile mills that use cotton to switch over to a product that is -- uses 90% less chemicals, 50% less water, 50% less energy. I think that's a huge driving force towards more sustainability in an area that's a tough environmental aspect. 
And then, if you go to PM&C, we've got continued growth in our downstream systems, which have been growing at greater than 11% per year for a long time. We'll continue those investments. We've got high growth targets for our downstream coatings business to continue to keep up with the demand, specifically traffic demand. Howard mentioned paper demand for paper cups replacing others with our RHOBARR dispersions and also architectural demand, which is our growth leader in that space. And then you get back to Packaging & Specialty Plastics, which is continuing to grow above GDP, about 1.4x GDP in our forward forecast.
