The first -- news of the -- if everybody can go mute on the teams. Here we go. So I'll start fresh. 
Thank you, Eric, and happy new year, and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q4 earnings call. We achieved a lot in 2020, solid financial results, proving the resiliency of our business model, greater levels of innovation across the company, higher employee satisfaction scores and finally, we announced a strategic merger with S&P Global, which will create the leading global information services provider. 
Overall, we finished the year ahead of expectations and are reiterating our 2021 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. We are updating our adjusted EPS by $0.03 due to our share repurchase restriction because of the pending merger. 
Now on to the financial highlights for the quarter and the year. When we speak to Q4 and fiscal year results, they are normalized to exclude the impact of the aerospace defense divestiture and the cancellation of Q2 events on growth rates for organic revenue and adjusted EPS. Organic revenue growth was 0% for the quarter and the year, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion was 160 basis points in the quarter and 250 basis points for the year and adjusted EPS growth was 11% in the quarter and 13% for the year. 
In terms of our core industry verticals I'll provide Q4 and full year 2020 highlights and our outlook for 2021. First, our Financial Services segment had organic revenue growth of 6% in Q4 and 5% for the full year. In 2020, within information, we continue to benefit from the innovation and demand for our pricing, reference data and valuations offerings. The successful launch of new regulatory solutions, notably our SFTR reporting platform, and we had strong growth from indices, led by our [indiscernible] and newly launched ESG indices. 
Within solutions, we continue to invest in our leading products and integration capabilities, launched a private debt investment life cycle solution and experienced robust growth from continued expansion of our managed corporate action solutions. 
Within processing, we invested in our core OTC and loan settlement platforms to help the industry facilitate the IBOR transition and regulatory requirements. We also successfully serviced the industry through one of the most volatile periods in recent history. 
In 2021, we expect organic growth within Financial Services in the 6% to 8% range. Within information, growth will be led by increasing customer demand and new products within our pricing, reference data and valuation services businesses we also expect continued strength for our regulatory reporting and compliance offerings. Within this business, we'll integrate our recent acquisition at Capitec, which will help solidify our leading industry position. 
Now within solutions, we expect high-growth across our diversified offerings and a rebound in managed services and implementation of projects. In particular, we are looking for a strong year from our onboarding and compliance management tools, expansion of our portfolio and data management solutions into new sectors and continued high-growth in private market offerings. We also expect normalized levels of equity and debt issuance that will drive solid performance in our syndication and book building businesses. 
Processing is expected to be slightly up year-over-year with mixed market conditions in both loans and derivative markets. 
Now let's move on to transportation, with organic revenue growth in the quarter of 2% and and a decline of 2% for the year. In 2020, the pandemic had a major impact on the automotive industry, and we responded proactively to the crisis by working with our customers and continue to see the rebound in our business with recurring organic growth of 6% in Q4. 
During the pandemic, we also increased our focus on driving adoption of newer products. Such as CARFAX for Life while accelerating product innovation across our portfolios in areas such as marketing audiences, enhance compliance simulation and mastermind now available for used cars. Our maritime and trade business had a solid year, excluding the impact of the cancellation of our TPM conference. 
In 2021, we expect organic growth within transportation in the 12% to 15% range. We expect our automotive business to revert to its longer-term growth rates. Although economic uncertainty remains, our dealer facing businesses have strong momentum going into 2021 and the strong retention rates we have maintained through 2020 attest to the critical nature of our products. 
Product support in our OEM and supplier customers will recover more gradually as the industry adjusts to lower long-term volumes coming out of COVID. 
In addition to the underlying growth in the business, we expect to see a onetime pickup in organic growth from pricing being at normal levels for the full year, specifically within CARFAX and mastermind businesses. 
And finally, maritime and trade will continue to see accelerating subscription growth driven by product innovation in our risk and compliance and commodities analytics businesses. 
Moving on to Resources, where organic decline was 11% in the quarter and negative 5% for the full year. In 2020, our upstream business was impacted by the industry undergoing severe CapEx reductions leading to cost pressure within our customer base and bankruptcies, particularly in North America. Our downstream organic revenue growth proved resilient when normalizing for our events. Growth within our gas, power and renewables businesses were driven by customer expansion into areas such as wind, batteries, solar and hydrogen services. This was somewhat offset by lower nonrecurring revenue within consulting. 
We also completed the integration of the agribusiness and acquired Truview, a small upstream analytics company. And in 2021, we expect organic revenue results within resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in the low single digits. Our downstream businesses are expected to return to mid single-digit organic growth driven by continued demand for our pricing, chemical information, the release of additional plastics circularity products, a new database of estimated energy chain emissions and from the realization of synergies from the agribusiness integrations. 
Within our upstream businesses, we expect customer CapEx spend to continue to be constrained for our annual contract value, which will bottom in Q1. In 2021, we are excited to launch our new predictive analytics tools that will marry our upstream and midstream global data sets with our proprietary insights and research and will drive additional forward growth. 
Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was 0% for the quarter and 1% normalized for the impact of BPPC for the full year. Product design proved its resilience with organic growth in the low single digits, normalized for BPVC while TMT and ECR performed as expected. In 2021, we expect our organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. 
Moving on to some of our recently announced strategic initiatives. We entered into a 50-50 joint venture with shared control with CME to combine our post-trade services including trade processing and risk mitigation operations. The venture is going to incorporate our market serve business and CME's optimization business. Through the combination, we'll achieve increased operating efficiencies and new revenue opportunities by being able to better service clients with enhanced platforms and services for OTC markets across interest rates, FX, equity and credit asset classes. We expect the deal to close in the summer and to be neutral to our adjusted earnings in the near term. 
And finally, we announced the strategic merger with S&P Global, which joins 2 world-class organizations with unique, highly complementary assets. This combination creates a pro forma company with increased scale, world-class products in core markets and strong joint offerings in the high-growth adjacencies, including ESG and energy transition, private assets and small and medium enterprises. Counterparty risk management, supply chain and trade and alternative data, our unique and complementary assets will leverage cutting-edge innovation and technology capability, including the IHS Markit data lake and S&P Global's Kensho to enhance the customer value proposition. For IHS Markit shareholders, employees and customers merging with S&P Global was the best strategic fit to create the most long-term value. 
Post the merger announcement, Doug Peterson, CEO of S&P Global, announced his executive team for the pro forma company, which includes the following members of my executive team. First, Adam Kansler will lead the combined S&P Global Market Intelligence business and the IHS Markit Financial Services segment. Edouard Tavernier will lead the Transportation segment. Sherri Granite will be the combined company's Chief Admin Officer and General Counsel; and Sally Moore will lead Strategic Alliances and will have responsibility for corporate development and strategy. Other members of my executive team and myself have also agreed to help with the integration for 12 to 18 months post the close. 
I believe Doug has assembled a great executive team, that will bring together members of both companies, including -- and give the leadership -- sorry, Doug has assembled a great initiative team that will bring together members of both companies' leadership and will be a great first step in merging the 2 companies. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Jonathan."

We had a strong finish to the year with results ahead of our expectations. Our Q4 financial performance included revenue of $1.107 billion with organic growth of 0% and all-in revenue of negative 1%, GAAP net income of $151 million and GAAP EPS of $0.38, adjusted EBITDA of $465 million, an increase of 3% with margins of 42.0% and adjusted EPS was $0.72, an increase of $0.07 or 11%. We were pleased with the finish of the year and a solid revenue and profit performance we delivered throughout 2020. 
Relative to revenue, our Q4 organic revenue growth of 0% included recurring organic growth of 2% and nonrecurring organic growth of negative 11%. 
Moving to segment performance. Financial Services revenue grow 7%, including 6% organic and 1% FX. Recurring organic was 6%, while nonrecurring organic growth was 9%. Our information business organic was 4%, led by strength in our pricing, indices and equities information products. 
Processing organic was 1% as we saw a return to growth in loan markets, offset by a slight decline in derivatives processing. Solutions organic was 10% due primarily to strong performance in our corporate actions, private markets and digital businesses. Transportation had revenue decline of negative 4%, including 2% organic, flat FX and divestiture of negative 6%. Organic growth was comprised of 6% recurring and negative 9% nonrecurring. Resources revenue declined 11%, including negative 11% organic and flat FX. Recurring organic was negative 8%, and nonrecurring organic was negative 32%. 
Our Q4 ACV decreased $22 million and our full year ACV decreased $74 million, down 9% versus prior year. We ended the year with ACV of $719 million, which now include agri of approximately $30 million. CMS revenue declined 2%, including 0% organic. Our benchmarking business divestiture impact of negative 1% and flat FX. Recurring organic was 2% and nonrecurring organic growth was negative 13%. 
Turning now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA was $465 million, up 3%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 42.0%, up 160 basis points. 
Moving to segment profitability. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.7%, up 260 basis points. Transportation's margin was 45.3%, up 350 basis points. Resources margin was 40.2%, down 200 basis points and CMS margin was 24.7%, up 20 basis points. 
GAAP net income was $151 million or $0.38 per share. Our adjusted EPS was $0.72 per diluted share, a $0.07 or 11% improvement over the prior year. Our full year adjusted tax rate was 18%. 
Q4 free cash flow was $275 million. Our full year free cash flow was $940 million and represented a conversion rate of 51%. As a reminder, our full year conversion rate was impacted by several nonrecurring items. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our year-end debt balance was $4.9 billion, which represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7x on a bank covenant basis. And we closed the quarter with $126 million of cash. At year-end, our undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1.2 billion. 
Our Q4 fully diluted weighted average share count was 400.5 million shares, and our full year was 401.5 million shares. We completed the $200 million ASR in November of 2020, our full year share repurchases were approximately $1.1 billion or 14.6 million shares. At an average price of $73.71. 
The merger agreement with S&P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares, and therefore, our share repurchase program is currently suspended other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share-based compensation. We paid a dividend of $67 million in Q4 for an FY fiscal year 2020 total of $270 million of dividends. The merger agreement allows for the continued paying of a regular quarterly cash dividend in the future and we are recommending to our Board for approval in our January 2021 meeting to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.20 per share, effective for the Q1 2021 dividend payment. 
Moving to full year financial results, let me speak to full year results that are normalized to exclude the impact of the aerospace and defense divestiture and the cancellation of Q2 events on growth rates for organic revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Total full year revenue was $4.288 billion, which represented a decline of negative 3%, 0% organic, negative 2% acquisitive, flat FX. 
Turning now to reported profits. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.837 billion, up 8% versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 42.8% with reported margin expansion of 250 basis points. GAAP net income was $871 million with GAAP EPS of $2.17. And adjusted EPS was $2.84, a 13% increase versus prior year. 
In terms of guidance, we are reiterating our 2021 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and updating our adjusted EPS from a $0.03 impact due to our inability to repurchase shares as a result of the pending merger. Our 2021 guidance is as follows: revenue of $4.535 billion to $4.635 billion, with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, including recurring organic growth of 6% to 7%. Adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.03 billion with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 100 basis points; and adjusted EPS of $3.11 to $3.16 per share. 
Finally, we do expect cash conversion in the mid-60s as we lap our 2021 time cash impacts. 
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance."

Why don't I start, and then I'll pass it to Adam, who did the transaction for us. But this was something that when we originally thought about selling MarkitSERV, we actually thought there would be an impetus of buyers that wanted to find ways to consolidate the assets but I think given that the assets are primarily held by strategics and consortia and a variety of industry owned relationships it -- I think it proved a tall order for any private equity firm to create that consolidation. 
And so post that, we looked at the strategic assets across the industry. And of course, between ourselves and CME, we have the majority of the OTC processing assets. And so therefore, the synergies for both on the cost side, but also in terms of the servicing the customer and creating incremental margin for investment stood out really strong. And we think that the consolidation of processing assets across the industry is something that is -- the CME-IHS Markit transaction as a JV is a first step. But why don't I pass it over to Adam, who can give you some incremental color. Adam?"

So this opportunity to bring it together, you'll have a much more complete data set across all of those workflows, certainly within the derivatives markets, giving you the opportunity to build additional analytical tools, workflow tools and things that allow our customer set to manage their risk and processes more efficiently. I think they've -- the customer set has found for many years that maintain these data sets and these workflows in multiple places is highly inefficient. It's expensive.

As you shift down through chemicals, agriculture, Opus, all the pricing, McCluskey coal indices, as you get into the pricing and indices, of course, all of those services, where we have synergies between them have the same opportunity set with the Platts teams. So we're quite excited about the mid and downstream synergies around the pricing and new services, ex where there's overlap, and we'll have to address that within the closing. Of the merger. But that's a small piece of the revenue. Brian, do you want to add to that?"

We are very focused on the health of our customers and dealer partners. 
In terms of the forward visibility, as you mentioned, Jeff, a lot of our transactional revenues are types of things like marketing spend by the industry as well as activity in the recall business. Now we're seeing some of those spend items come back. They were higher in Q4 than in Q3, and we're seeing a lot of good marketing activity come into in Q1. So we are confident they are on their way back. But as Lance mentioned in the introductory comments, it will take a bit longer for them to reverse to normalized trends, but we expect that in the second half of the next year."

So we have factored in all of those risks, and we can execute on our plan and our forecast within the current market environment. 
In terms of what we're seeing in the dealer market and sign post about their health. I would say a couple of things. Like in the end, many dealers had a very strong 2020 because even though volumes were down because they have to lower costs, and because inventories were very low, the margins, by and large, were high and dealers remain profitable throughout 2020. 
So in fact, most dealers are in pretty good shape coming in into 2021. And expects to remain in pretty good shape. We expect prices to remain pretty solid throughout the year.

And it means that there may be some ups and downs throughout the year. But by and large, that is the market environment we're seeing today, and that is the environment in which we can execute on our plan. 
George, that was the first question. Can you just remind me what the second question was?"

I think we mentioned on the Q3 call, that as we were removing the pricing concessions, we would be tracking the retention rate very, very closely through Q3 and Q4. Well, the great news is, it remains very, very strong, right? So our cancellation rates have remained low. Even as we took out the option to sustain service, and we're very happy about this. 
If you remember, back in Q2, when the crisis struck, we said the most important thing for our business is to make sure that when we come out of the crisis, we come out with customer relationships that are even stronger than they were coming into the crisis. That's why we made hard decisions. That's why we took the short-term kind of revenue hit because we believe that's what we have to do to get through the pandemic. I think we're coming out of it in the right place with very strong customer relationships with critical products and with high retention rates."

So there's a lot of product sales management overlaps in terms of the products and services that both companies offer. And we have a lot of opportunity for revenue synergies where we're going to have to apply new people to work on the new opportunity sets. So therefore, the synergies come across all of the shared services. And of course, in a merger like this, we put in retention in order to keep the team's well motivated intact with performance, successful performance related retention that ties into us executing the deal really well. And that goes across the executives, including myself, that we'll stay on post-closing to help make sure the deal's success and other people across the shared services that may not be having long-term roles but their short-term roles are very important, and therefore, restructure in compensation to help make that happen. 
I have to say, as we went into the end of the year post the merger announcement, we really had -- and the pandemic, we've really been operating that the absolute highest satisfaction levels in the firm that we've ever had. It's been a real pleasure motivating people through the pandemic, getting the teams working on, running the company in a tough time, doing the merger. And post the merger, we've announced our hub platform, the JV with CME, CAPITEC acquisition, there's no stopping, and this is a company that's going into a close of a merger in the second half. We're still doing the things that IHS Markit has been designed to do and does very well. And so no, I'm very pleased with how everybody's responded, the morale and how we're treating in base that may be without a long-term job post the close."

And both CEOs, looking at the forward use of new technologies to create efficiencies in the total cost of ownership of the solutions that they are needed. And so Hub's initial job is to build a foundation of client transactions and reference data, storage for the management of the activities of the middle and back office of an asset manager. So therefore, reducing inefficiencies that happen from using multiple different systems. 
And it's early stage. Microsoft as a partner, is, of course, a choice of Azure with respect to the build and advisory on the build. McKinsey, of course, great partner, who are working with asset managers who are trying to make their forward technology decisions. And State Street, a great partner because they manage the outsourced back office for PIMCO and ourselves who have a lot of experience at data management and the build-out of financial services technologies. So it's really a joint venture of Sensus, where we have many owners who are going to own a build of a foundation technology that will help bring asset management, total cost of ownership down across the middle and back office functional needs to better manage those data sets. And it will be a platform that connect -- will connect to all the industry administrators over time, various software assets, OMS, PMS, risk management, risk attribution, pricing, a real integrated hub, hence the name that looks to reduce the cost of management of data with respect to a big asset manager. And the 2 asset managers that are announced in the transaction, of course, they have a lot of knowledge and IP themselves and will be putting that expertise to work as we look at the forward plans hub.

Our revenues, as Doug and I mentioned in the combination are slightly larger. But they're a little bit different than what you'd call the pure bread ESG revenues because we don't have an ESG rating products per se. We have a whole bunch of products that really play into the E of ESG and will be naturally combined and will create synergies with the S&P products. 
So for example, we have a carbon registry, which is where we have voluntary emissions receipts that are used for carbon offsets. We also built carbon auction platforms, Costa Rica, California, Québec, to name a few. And those auction platforms for pricing a carbon locally in a state or a region or a country are increasingly important, and we'll continue to build those out. Then within our energy and transition business is, of course, we have a lot of geo location data around all the energy-related assets, which are important to the climate discussions going forward. We have a lot of data with respect to some of the land use around agriculture. We have, of course, knowledge of the tail pipe emissions of all the automotive fleet. So we have these, what you would call is, within all of our businesses, we have parts of the E of ESG and when we combine that with the ESG rating services, the true cost, the Robecosam, of S&P Global, we start to have a much more significant circa $125 million to $150 million of kind of base revenues that need to be brought together and then continued to grow at double digits.

So first off, our Financial Services business has proved even through this tough year of the pandemic to provide strong mid-single-digit recurring revenue growth.

And I think with the synergies as an opportunity to accelerate Ipreo as an acquisition and now hopefully, embedded part of our financial services business is accretive to our growth, and it's accretive to our growth because of the market activity that occurred this year through the pandemic, but equally, the alternatives business, which brings me to the second part of your question, which is I think we're 1 of 2 platforms that significantly plays in the alternative space, private equity, private debt and the provision of services that will help the GP LP relationship managed more effectively. And that strong double-digit growth for us, whether it's valuations, whether it's reporting, whether it's our new index JV. We've got some real exciting growth assets and ones that we can continue to build on. 
We don't have any plans at the moment. I don't know about S&P Global, but ourselves, with respect to Bitcoin, maybe Adam is going to correct me in a moment, but I'll leave them to do so, but not nothing big and significant. Of course, we have every millennial that works for us, thinks we should have a major pricing, data, services, software and participation around a marketplace that is really legitimizing itself. So we've got to take it seriously. 
And so I expect pricing and data services, et cetera, that we normally would provide any OTC pricing or contracts, those types of things will be looking to value and participate. 
The second part, which you mentioned was SPAC. Well, to me, SPAC just another form of a new issue. So therefore, the Ipreo teams through their activities, stay on top of all of the new issuance. And so as a SPAC participates into the marketplace. If there's any follow-on equity activity, et cetera, of course, they would be participating. But in terms of the setup or management that's not something that we do. But I imagine the data sets, et cetera, will be one, as they continue to grow that we've got to keep track of.

First, on the Ipreo acquisition, that really is fully integrated today. So we don't look at it separately, but each of those businesses has continued to perform really well. Really providing central market infrastructure in a couple of places in highly volatile and really complicated financial markets over this past year. And have performed incredibly well and brought transparency and enhanced capabilities. And that includes, you mentioned SPACs, the level of issuance in the SPAC market, many of those transactions, again, carried through our platforms. 
In the alternative segment of that Ipreo business, combination with our existing capabilities, like valuations, data management, the expansion into credit asset classes, has proven to be consistent with where the markets are going, the increased flow of capital into those spaces has positioned those businesses well to be market leaders in providing portfolio management tools, risk management tools, in particular, data management tools. As we go forward to both GP and LP community, those businesses have grown well up into the double digits over this past year. And we see that for the next several years ahead. 
And the last point I'd make is around crypto. On a singular focus for us. We obviously are responding to our customers' needs to be able to value those products. You'll see last November, we announced a partnership with a firm called Luca. We have several other tactical partnerships where we do collect a lot of different pricing and reference data and other valuation information around cryptocurrencies in order to help customers value portfolios that may include cryptocurrencies. So it's an area where we'll continue to focus not just on the valuation side, but probably even moving into the index side in the near future as well."

Thank you, Eric, and happy new year. And thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q4 earnings call. We achieved a lot in 2020, solid financial results proving the resiliency of our business model, greater levels of innovation across the company, higher employee satisfaction scores. And finally, we announced a strategic merger with S&P Global, which will create the leading global information services provider.  
Overall, we finished the year ahead of expectations and are reiterating our 2021 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. We are updating our adjusted EPS by $0.03 due to our share repurchase restriction because of the pending merger.  
Now on to the financial highlights for the quarter and the year. When we speak to Q4 and fiscal year results, they are normalized to exclude the impact of the Aerospace & Defense divestiture and the cancellation of Q2 events on growth rates for organic revenue and adjusted EPS. Organic revenue growth was 0% for the quarter and the year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion was 160 basis points in the quarter and 250 basis points for the year, and adjusted EPS growth was 11% in the quarter and 13% for the year.  
In terms of our core industry verticals, I'll provide Q4 and full year 2020 highlights and our outlook for 2021. First, our Financial Services segment had organic revenue growth of 6% in Q4 and 5% for the full year. In 2020, within Information, we continued to benefit from the innovation and demand for our pricing, reference data and valuations offerings; the successful launch of new regulatory solutions, notably our SFTR reporting platform. And we had strong growth from indices, led by our fixed income and newly launched ESG indices. 
Within Solutions, we continue to invest in our leading products and integration capabilities, launched a private debt investment life cycle solution and experienced robust growth from continued expansion of our Managed Corporate Action solutions. Within Processing, we invested in our core OTC and loan settlement platforms to help the industry facilitate the IBOR transition and regulatory requirements. We also successfully serviced the industry through one of the most volatile periods in recent history.  
In 2021, we expect organic growth within Financial Services in the 6% to 8% range. Within Information, growth will be led by increasing customer demand and new products within our pricing, reference data and valuation services businesses. We also expect continued strength for our regulatory reporting and compliance offerings. Within this business, we'll integrate our recent acquisition of Cappitech, which will help solidify our leading industry position.
Now within Solutions, we expect high growth across our diversified offerings and a rebound in managed services and implementation of projects. In particular, we are looking for a strong year from our onboarding and compliance management tools, expansion of our portfolio of data management solutions into new sectors and continued high growth in private market offerings. We also expect normalized levels of equity and debt issuance that will drive solid performance in our syndication and book building businesses. Processing is expected to be slightly up year-over-year with mixed market conditions in both loans and derivative markets.
Now let's move on to Transportation, with organic revenue growth in the quarter of 2% and a decline of 2% for the year. In 2020, the pandemic had a major impact on the automotive industry, and we responded proactively to the crisis by working with our customers and continue to see the rebound in our business with recurring organic growth of 6% in Q4. 
During the pandemic, we also increased our focus on driving adoption of newer products, such as CARFAX for Life, while accelerating product innovation across our portfolios in areas such as marketing audiences, enhanced compliance simulation and Mastermind now available for used cars. Our Maritime & Trade business had a solid year, excluding the impact of the cancellation of our TPM conference.  
In 2021, we expect organic growth within Transportation in the 12% to 15% range. We expect our Automotive business to revert to its longer-term growth rates. Although economic uncertainty remains, our dealer-facing businesses have strong momentum going into 2021, and the strong retention rates we have maintained through 2020 attest to the critical nature of our products. Product support in our OEM and supplier customers will recover more gradually as the industry adjusts to lower long-term volumes coming out of COVID.  
In addition to the underlying growth in the business, we expect to see a onetime pickup in organic growth from pricing being at normal levels for the full year, specifically within CARFAX and Mastermind businesses. And finally, Maritime & Trade will continue to see accelerating subscription growth driven by product innovation in our risk and compliance and commodities analytics businesses.  
Moving on to Resources, where organic decline was 11% in the quarter and negative 5% for the full year. In 2020, our Upstream business was impacted by the industry undergoing severe CapEx reductions leading to cost pressure within our customer base and bankruptcies, particularly in North America. Our Downstream organic revenue growth proved resilient when normalizing for our events. Growth within our gas, power and renewables businesses were driven by customer expansion into areas such as wind, batteries, solar and hydrogen services. This was somewhat offset by lower nonrecurring revenue within consulting.  
We also completed the integration of the Agribusiness and acquired [ Truview ], a small upstream analytics company. And in 2021, we expect organic revenue results within Resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in the low single digits. Our Downstream businesses are expected to return to mid-single-digit organic growth driven by continued demand for our pricing, chemical information, the release of additional plastics circularity products, a new database of estimated energy chain emissions and from the realization of synergies from the Agribusiness integrations.
Within our Upstream businesses, we expect customer CapEx spend to continue to be constrained for our annual contract value, which will bottom in Q1. In 2021, we are excited to launch our new predictive analytics tools that will marry our upstream and midstream global data sets with our proprietary insights and research and will drive additional forward growth. 
Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was 0% for the quarter and 1% normalized for the impact of BPVC for the full year. Product design proved its resilience with organic growth in the low single digits normalized for BPVC, while TMT and ECR performed as expected. In 2021, we expect our organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. 
Moving on to some of our recently announced strategic initiatives. We entered into a 50-50 joint venture with shared control with CME to combine our post-trade services, including trade processing and risk mitigation operations. The venture is going to incorporate our MarkitSERV business and CME's optimization business. Through the combination, we'll achieve increased operating efficiencies and new revenue opportunities by being able to better service clients with enhanced platforms and services for OTC markets across interest rates, FX, equity and credit asset classes. We expect the deal to close in the summer and to be neutral to our adjusted earnings in the near term. 
And finally, we announced the strategic merger with S&P Global, which joins 2 world-class organizations with unique, highly complementary assets. This combination creates a pro forma company with increased scale, world-class products in core markets and strong joint offerings in the high-growth adjacencies, including ESG and energy transition, private assets and small and medium enterprises. Counterparty risk management, supply chain and trade and alternative data, our unique and complementary assets, will leverage cutting-edge innovation and technology capability, including the IHS Markit Data Lake and S&P Global's Kensho to enhance the customer value proposition. For IHS Markit shareholders, employees and customers, merging with S&P Global was the best strategic fit to create the most long-term value.
Post the merger announcement, Doug Peterson, CEO of S&P Global, announced his executive team for the pro forma company, which includes the following members of my executive team: First, Adam Kansler will lead the combined S&P Global Market Intelligence business and the IHS Markit Financial Services segment. Edouard Tavernier will lead the Transportation segment. Sari Granat will be the combined company's Chief Admin Officer and General Counsel; and Sally Moore will lead Strategic Alliances and will have responsibility for corporate development and strategy. Other members of my executive team and myself have also agreed to help with the integration for 12 to 18 months post the close. 
I believe Doug has assembled a great executive team, that will bring together members of both companies, including -- and give the leadership -- sorry. Doug has assembled a great executive team that will bring together members of both companies' leadership and will be a great first step in merging the 2 companies. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Jonathan."

We had a strong finish to the year with results ahead of our expectations. Our Q4 financial performance included revenue of $1.107 billion with organic growth of 0% and all-in revenue of negative 1%; GAAP net income of $151 million and GAAP EPS of $0.38; adjusted EBITDA of $465 million, an increase of 3% with margins of 42.0%; and adjusted EPS was $0.72, an increase of $0.07 or 11%. We were pleased with the finish of the year and the solid revenue and profit performance we delivered throughout 2020. Relative to revenue, our Q4 organic revenue growth of 0% included recurring organic growth of 2% and nonrecurring organic growth of negative 11%. 
Moving to segment performance. Financial Services revenue growth was 7%, including 6% organic and 1% FX. Recurring organic was 6%, while nonrecurring organic growth was 9%. Our Information business organic was 4%, led by strength in our pricing, indices and equities information products. Processing organic was 1% as we saw a return to growth in loan markets, offset by a slight decline in derivatives processing. Solutions organic was 10% due primarily to strong performance in our corporate actions, private markets and digital businesses. 
Transportation had revenue decline of negative 4%, including 2% organic, flat FX and divestiture of negative 6%. Organic growth was comprised of 6% recurring and negative 9% nonrecurring. 
Resources revenue declined 11%, including negative 11% organic and flat FX. Recurring organic was negative 8%, and nonrecurring organic was negative 32%. 
Our Q4 ACV decreased $22 million and our full year ACV decreased $74 million, down 9% versus prior year. We ended the year with ACV of $719 million, which now includes agri of approximately $30 million. 
CMS revenue declined 2%, including 0% organic, our benchmarking business divestiture impact of negative 1% and flat FX. Recurring organic was 2% and nonrecurring organic growth was negative 13%. 
Turning now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA was $465 million, up 3%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 42.0%, up 160 basis points.
Moving to segment profitability. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.7%, up 260 basis points. Transportation's margin was 45.3%, up 350 basis points. Resources margin was 40.2%, down 200 basis points; and CMS margin was 24.7%, up 20 basis points.
GAAP net income was $151 million or $0.38 per share. Our adjusted EPS was $0.72 per diluted share, a $0.07 or 11% improvement over the prior year. Our full year adjusted tax rate was 18%. 
Q4 free cash flow was $275 million. Our full year free cash flow was $940 million and represented a conversion rate of 51%. As a reminder, our full year conversion rate was impacted by several nonrecurring items.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our year-end debt balance was $4.9 billion, which represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7x on a bank covenant basis. And we closed the quarter with $126 million of cash. At year-end, our undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1.2 billion. 
Our Q4 fully diluted weighted average share count was 400.5 million shares, and our full year was 401.5 million shares. We completed the $200 million ASR in November of 2020. Our full year share repurchases were approximately $1.1 billion or 14.6 million shares at an average price of $73.71.
The merger agreement with S&P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares and, therefore, our share repurchase program is currently suspended other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share-based compensation. We paid a dividend of $67 million in Q4 for an FY fiscal year 2020 total of $270 million of dividends. The merger agreement allows for the continued paying of a regular quarterly cash dividend in the future, and we are recommending to our Board for their approval in our January 2021 meeting to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.20 per share, effective for the Q1 2021 dividend payment.
Moving to full year financial results. Let me speak to full year results that are normalized to exclude the impact of the Aerospace & Defense divestiture and the cancellation of Q2 events on growth rates for organic revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Total full year revenue was $4.288 billion, which represent a decline of negative 3%, 0% organic, negative 2% acquisitive, flat FX.
Turning now to reported profits. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.837 billion, up 8% versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 42.8% with reported margin expansion of 250 basis points. GAAP net income was $871 million with GAAP EPS of $2.17. And adjusted EPS was $2.84, a 13% increase versus prior year. 
In terms of guidance, we are reiterating our 2021 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and updating our adjusted EPS from a $0.03 impact due to our inability to repurchase shares as a result of the pending merger. Our 2021 guidance is as follows: revenue of $4.535 billion to $4.635 billion with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, including recurring organic growth of 6% to 7%; adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.03 billion with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 100 basis points; and adjusted EPS of $3.11 to $3.16 per share. Finally, we do expect cash conversion in the mid-60s as we lap our 2021 time cash impacts. 
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance."

Now why don't I start, and then I'll pass it to Adam, who did the transaction for us. But this was something that when we originally thought about selling MarkitSERV, we actually thought there would be an impetus of buyers that wanted to find ways to consolidate the assets. But I think given that the assets are primarily held by strategics and consortia and a variety of industry-owned relationships, it -- I think it proved a tall order for any private equity firm to create that consolidation. 
And so post that, we looked at the strategic assets across the industry. And of course, between ourselves and CME, we have the majority of the OTC processing assets. And so therefore, the synergies for both on the cost side, but also in terms of the servicing the customer and creating incremental margin for investment stood out really strong. And we think that the consolidation of processing assets across the industry is something that the CME-IHS Markit transaction as a JV is a first step. 
But why don't I pass it over to Adam, who can give you some incremental color. Adam?"

So this opportunity to bring it together, you'll have a much more complete data set across all of those workflows, certainly within the derivatives markets, giving you the opportunity to build additional analytical tools, workflow tools and things that allow our customer set to manage their risk and processes more efficiently. 
I think they've -- the customer set has found for many years that maintaining these data sets and these workflows in multiple places is highly inefficient. It's expensive, and it causes breaks in some circumstances. So this is an opportunity to improve the risk management profile for our customer set, bring efficiency, bring their costs down and bring a better set of tools. So there will certainly be innovation and new applications and tools against those data sets and bringing those workflows together over time."

So we are confident they are on their way back. But as Lance mentioned in the introductory comments, it will take a bit longer for them to reverse to normalized trends. We expect that in the second half of the next year."

In terms of the 100 basis points margin performance, again, that's really just building, as you know, in the last fiscal year, a very usual fiscal year for us in many, many ways. But we did make some structural changes in our cost. And as we're seeing a flow-through there, that plus the normal growth rates that we're seeing on the 6% to 8% total helps drive that overall margin. 
I think you will see, in particular, as you flow through -- I would look at FY '21 as a relatively normal year. The comparison to '20 is where it gets a bit hairy at times from quarter-to-quarter. So Q2 in Transportation, for example, was a particularly challenging time for us. I think you'll see some odd seasonality on year-on-year comparisons there.

But just to go back over what happened last year. As a reminder, when COVID hit, we gave significant price concessions voluntarily, particularly in Transportation in Q2; a little bit, I would also add, Andrew, in Q3. So it leaked a little bit into Q3. 
As we look forward now right now, so first, the industry overall has seen a strong recovery in the second half of 2020. In fact, I just tried to -- my son turning 16, and I tried to buy him a used car. It's very hard to find a used car right now, and it speaks to the strength of the industry. But I did use CARFAX and managed to find a great car. I'd recommend it to you, Andrew. But if you look forward, the industry has recovered there. So as we see the performance in FY '21, we're seeing a pretty healthy industry, particularly at the dealership level. 
As Edouard mentioned, we do work closely and support the health of our dealer customers. So we're being careful as to how we look at value capture, capture the price increase and the timing around that. But right now, we're seeing our customers doing pretty well, and that's reflected in kind of our expectations. But Edouard anything else you want to comment on?"

We'll maybe focus this question around Market Intelligence and Financial Services because that is the area where we have substantive product-related synergies. And it really -- and I'll pass it to Adam to add on to this as well. 
But if we start with the data lake and Kensho, the data lake is where IHS Markit has spent 3 years organizing all of its alternative data sets into a common library with ease of access for both our internal use as well as now to commercialize to customers. So we've done the heavy lifting to organize those data sets. 
S&P Global acquired the Kensho assets, which are advanced analytics, data science experts, which have scale and size that are very excited to be able to begin working with the information, alternative data sets that we have to help provide new forms of decision-making schools, decision-making signals as well as trading signals, alerts. And just deeper decision-making tools and ways that without the organized data sets tied to an advanced analytics platform like Kensho, you don't have the same opportunity to do so. So that's the first thing. 
The second thing is Market Intelligence is a platform that has hundreds of thousands of users that are active on the platform, and that gives us an opportunity for direct distribution as well as the buildup of tools and services to be offered on the platform. And I'll let Adam add on to that because there are several other ways the 2 financial services groups that Adam will lead have revenue synergies mapped out and excited about going forward. Adam?"

A lot of this was discussed by both Doug and Lance at the time of the merger. And I think a lot of those themes remain true. And as we've continued to explore and get ready for integration, a lot of those original themes have played out. And that's really looking at the scale of data and insights available to the combined business. The ability to put the massive data sets and content available through the Market Intelligence platform into some of the technology solutions we offer to our customers in their reg and compliance, risk management workflows should be a real game changer in their ability to make decisions enough to give them a very efficient platform for consuming those wide-ranging data sets. 
If you look for -- look at a corporate customer group, automotive, oil and gas, engineering companies, we'll have the opportunity to give them both financial market and risk capabilities they need to run their business, but also data tools, capabilities, let them thrive in their core markets with deep industry-specific expertise, market insight. And including things like asset valuations, which we haven't been able to give before because of the really -- that's an expertise that we're now bringing to that core customer set that's a user of the Market Intelligence products.

So the data lake, we launched the commercialization in the first half of 2020. And we started off with several proof of concepts with bigger active large users, hedge funds, banks that have big decision-making strategies around the use of alternative data. And so far, we started to commercialize those relationships, turn them into longer-term contracts. Contracts are reasonably sized with term and give the customers the ability to be able to access parts or all of the library for defined decision-making purposes. So -- and then sometimes, the ability to create some form of redistribution if it's into their own products and services that wouldn't cannibalize our data sets.
So we're building out 2 things: one, the pipeline customers; two, we've now started to convert the customers. I don't want to say we've converted 100 customers, but we definitely have converted 10 customers in the year. So that's starting to pick up. We have a great pipeline, and we have numerous ways of creating the commercial set. 
Okay. So then the next bit that I'd like to say is that for us, the data lake gives us a speed of development and new products, but also this ability to attach our content with our customers' content and give them new, unique ways of leveraging and utilizing the data sets. So we see a bunch of efficiencies and a bunch of commercial activities, of which we've started to get a positive trend going on those already.

So when we look at our forecast, revenue forecast for the year, we've taken that -- we've anticipated no revenue from physical events. 
We are, however, holding virtual events in those 3 events. The revenue from those is significantly lower, Shlomo, so don't expect to see a significant pop there. But I think it's an important way for our team to continue to lead the industry and lean in with our customers and help connect the industry during these times.

Which means a market that in the U.S. is probably down roughly 10% year-on-year. It means continuing challenges with inventories. But it means, by and large, significant volumes of both used cars and new cars and most dealers remaining open, even if there are kind of local business restrictions. So we have factored in all of those risks, and we can execute on our plan and our forecast within the current market environment.
In terms of what we're seeing in the dealer market and signposts about their health, I would say a couple of things. Like in the end, many dealers had a very strong 2020 because even though volumes were down, because they had to lower costs, and because inventories were very low, the margins, by and large, were high and dealers remained profitable throughout 2020. 
So in fact, most dealers are in pretty good shape coming in into 2021 and expect to remain in pretty good shape. They expect prices to remain pretty solid throughout the year. 
What they do see is uncertainty, right? And that uncertainty means there is risk. It means they're not bringing in all of their costs back into the dealership. And it means that there may be some ups and downs throughout the year. But by and large, that is the market environment we're seeing today, and that is the environment in which we can execute on our plan.

So there's not a lot of product sales management overlaps in terms of the products and services that both companies offer. And we have a lot of opportunity for revenue synergies where we're going to have to apply new people to work on the new opportunity sets. So therefore, the synergies come across all of the shared services. And of course, in a merger like this, we put in retention in order to keep the teams well motivated, intact with performance, successful performance-related retention that ties into us executing the deal really well. And that goes across the executives, including myself, that will stay on post closing to help make sure the deal is a success and other people across the shared services that may not be having long-term roles, but their short-term roles are very important and, therefore, restructure in compensation to help make that happen.
I have to say, as we went into the end of the year post the merger announcement, we really had -- and the pandemic, we've really been operating at the absolute highest satisfaction levels in the firm that we've ever had. It's been a real pleasure motivating people through the pandemic, getting the teams working on running the company in a tough time, doing the merger. 
And post the merger, we've announced our HUB platform, the JV with CME, Cappitech acquisition. There's no stopping, and this is a company that's going into a close of a merger in the second half. We're still doing the things that IHS Markit has been designed to do and does very well. And so no, I'm very pleased with how everybody's responded, the morale and how we're treating employees that may be without a long-term job post the close."

Well, HUB initiates out of 2 very large customers that were looking at opportunities to create efficiencies with respect to technology going forward. And those were announced in the press release, PIMCO and Man Group. And they have a very close relation given the PIMCO CEO, who's formerly the Man Group CEO, so a close relationship. And both CEOs looking at the forward use of new technologies to create efficiencies in the total cost of ownership of the solutions that are needed. And so HUB's initial job is to build a foundation of client transactions and reference data storage for the management of the activities of the middle and back office of an asset manager so, therefore, reducing inefficiencies that happen from using multiple different systems.
And it's early stage. Microsoft as a partner, is, of course, a choice of Azure with respect to the build and advisory on the build; McKinsey, of course, a great partner who are working with asset managers, who are trying to make their forward technology decisions; and State Street, a great partner because they manage the outsourced back office for PIMCO; and ourselves who have a lot of experience at data management and the build-out of financial services technologies. So it's really a joint venture of senses, where we have many owners who are going to own a build of a foundation technology that will help bring asset management, total cost of ownership down across the middle and back-office functional needs to better manage those data sets. 
And it will be a platform that connect -- will connect to all the industry administrators over time, various software assets, OMS, PMS, risk management, risk attribution, pricing, a real integrated hub, hence the name, that looks to reduce the cost of management of data with respect to a big asset manager. And the 2 asset managers that are announced in the transaction, of course, they have a lot of knowledge and IP themselves and will be putting that expertise to work as we look at the forward plans of HUB. 
I don't know, Adam, if you want to add anything else or we can pause there and -- good. Okay."

Our revenues, as Doug and I mentioned in the combination are slightly larger. But they're a little bit different than what you'd call the purebred ESG revenues because we don't have an ESG rating product per se. We have a whole bunch of products that really play into the E of ESG and will be naturally combined and will create synergies with the S&P products. 
So for example, we have a carbon registry, which is where we have voluntary emissions receipts that are used for carbon offsets. We also built carbon auction platforms, Costa Rica, California, Québec, to name a few. And those auction platforms for pricing carbon locally in a state or a region or a country are increasingly important, and we'll continue to build those out. 
Then within our Energy and Transportation businesses, of course, we have a lot of geolocation data around all the energy-related assets, which are important to the climate discussions going forward. We have a lot of data with respect to some of the land use around agriculture. We have, of course, knowledge of the tail pipe emissions of all the automotive fleets. 
So we have these what you would call as -- within all of our businesses, we have parts of the E of ESG. And when we combine that with the ESG rating services, the Trucost, the RobecoSAMs of S&P Global, we start to have a much more significant, circa $125 million to $150 million of kind of base revenues that need to be brought together and then continued to grow at double digits. Doug has mentioned the 40% publicly. We've never really talked about our growth rate, but it's also strong double digits."

So first off, our Financial Services business has proved even through this tough year of the pandemic to provide strong mid-single-digit recurring revenue growth. And I don't see that waning going forward and I think with the synergies, has an opportunity to accelerate. 
Ipreo as an acquisition and now hopefully, embedded part of our Financial Services business, is accretive to our growth. And it's accretive to our growth because of the market activity that occurred this year through the pandemic, but equally, the alternatives business. 
Which brings me to that second part of your question, which is I think we're 1 of 2 platforms that significantly plays in the alternative space, private equity, private debt and the provision of services that will help the GP, LP relationship manage more effectively. And that strong double digit growth for us, whether it's valuations, whether it's reporting, whether it's our new index JV, we've got some real exciting growth assets and ones that we can continue to build on. 
We don't have any plans at the moment. I don't know about S&P Global, but ourselves, with respect to Bitcoin -- maybe Adam is going to correct me in a moment, but I'll leave him to do so. But not that -- nothing big and significant. Of course, we have every millennial that works for us thinks we should have a major pricing, data services, software and participation around a marketplace that is really legitimizing itself. So we've got to take it seriously. And so I expect pricing and data services, et cetera, that we normally would provide any OTC pricing or contracts. Those types of things, we'll be looking to value and participate.
The second part, which you mentioned was SPACs. Well, to me, SPACs are just another form of a new issue. So therefore, the Ipreo teams, through their activities, stay on top of all of the new issuance. And so as a SPAC participates into the marketplace, if there's any follow-on equity activity, et cetera, of course, they would be participating. But in terms of the setup or management that's not something that we do. But I imagine the data sets, et cetera, will be ones, as they continue to grow, that we've got to keep track of. 
Adam, do you want to add anything else to that?"

First, on the Ipreo acquisition, that really is fully integrated today, so we don't look at it separately. But each of those businesses has continued to perform really well, really providing central market infrastructure in a couple of places in highly volatile and really complicated financial markets over this past year, and have performed incredibly well and brought transparency and enhanced capabilities. And that includes, you mentioned SPACs, the level of issuance in the SPAC market, many of those transactions, again, carried through our platforms.
In the alternatives segment of that Ipreo business, combination with our existing capabilities, like valuations, data management, the expansion into credit asset classes, has proven to be consistent with where the markets are going. The increased flow of capital into those spaces has positioned those businesses well to be market leaders in providing portfolio management tools, risk management tools, in particular, data management tools. As we go forward to both GP and LP community, those businesses have grown well up into the double digits over this past year. And we see that for the next several years ahead.
And the last point I'd make is around crypto. Though not a singular focus for us, we obviously are responding to our customers' needs to be able to value those products. You'll see last November, we announced a partnership with a firm called Lukka. We have several other tactical partnerships where we do collect a lot of different pricing and reference data and other valuation information around cryptocurrencies in order to help customers value portfolios that may include cryptocurrencies. So it's an area where we'll continue to focus not just on the valuations side, but probably even moving into the index side in the near future as well."

So if we could just take a moment silence and then get started. 
Thank you, Eric, and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 earnings call. We started the year with a very strong set of Q1 results, which provides a great foundation for the full year. 
Q1 revenue was $1.12 billion, with organic growth of 3%; adjusted EBITDA of $467 million; and margin of 41.7%, up 180 basis points year-over-year; an adjusted EPS of $0.71, up 8% over the prior year. 
Overall, we are pleased with the start of our year and now expect to deliver results in the upper half of our 2021 guidance. 
In terms of our core industry verticals, let me first start with our Financial Services segment, which had record organic growth of 10% in Q1. 
Within Financial Services, Information had another quarter of solid organic growth of 6%. Main contributors included increased demand for our pricing, reference data and valuation services, as well as continued growth in our SFTR reporting platform and Indice businesses. 
Solutions had a very strong quarter with 15% organic growth, driven by solid performance across our Solutions businesses. Increased capital market issuance and greater adoption of our corporate actions, private markets, and reg and compliance offerings were all significant contributors. We continue to expect Solutions to be a large growth contributor for the full year. 
Finally, our Processing business grew 6% organically, with strength in loans and derivative performance as expected. 
For the full year, we now expect Financial Services to be in the higher end of our 6% to 8% targeted organic growth range. I just want to congratulate the team on that record 10% quarter. That's the first time since Markit went public and the IHS Markit together that we had a 10% quarter. So congratulations to everybody. 
Moving on to Transportation, which had organic revenue growth improved to 4% in Q1. 
As expected, we continue to see the rebound across our businesses at varying speeds. We're particularly pleased to see our recurring revenue growth improved to 8% in the quarter. Our dealer facing businesses experienced strong growth across CARFAX and automotiveMastermind, with revenue growth rates approaching pre-COVID levels. New business was strong across the portfolio in Q1, and we remain confident about the outlook for the rest of the year. 
Also in Transportation, our Maritime and Trade business had a very good start to the year, which was in line with our expectations. We also hosted a successful virtual TPM conference in March. We expect strong new business and retention performance will drive an acceleration of recurring revenue growth through the rest of the year. 
For the full year, we now expect Transportation's organic growth to be in the 13% to 15% range, which is up from our original 12% to 15%. 
Moving on to Resources, where organic decline was negative 10% in Q1. our Resources business is playing out as expected. In 2020, given the industry conditions, we put into place a number of drivers that should help us return to growth in 2022. As expected, our ACV has bottomed in Q1, and expect for it to slowly recover through the rest of the year, which bodes well for 2022 recurring revenue. Our downstream organic revenue growth performed as expected and should accelerate through the rest of the year. 
In the beginning of March, we held our CERAWeek conference, which had over 19,000 participants. Even with the virtual event, we were able to bring together leaders in the energy industry, world governments, finance and technology to discuss the future of energy. We also hosted a successful virtual world petrochemical conference. 
In 2021, we continue to expect organic revenue results within Resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in low single-digits, as upstream improves and downstream continues its growth trajectory. 
Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was in line with our expectations of negative 1% for the quarter. We expect improving results across Product Design, TMT and ECR to continue through the year. For the full year, we still expect CMS to deliver mid-single-digit organic growth. 
Now on March 11, the shareholders of both IHS Markit and S&P Global overwhelmingly voted to approve the merger. We are working with the relevant regulatory bodies and still expect a second half close. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Jonathan."

Our adjusted EBITDA of $467 million, an increase of 8%, with margins of 41.7%, this represents margin expansion of 180 basis points. And we also delivered adjusted EPS of $0.71, an increase of 8%. 
Regarding revenue, our Q1 organic growth of 3% included recurring organic growth of 4% and nonrecurring organic decline of 7%. This decline in nonrecurring was primarily driven by lower automotive OEM activities, lower energy consulting activities, and transactional content purchases for upstream and product design when compared to Q1 of last year. 
Moving on to segment performance. 
Our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 10% and including 9% recurring in the quarter. Solutions, in particular, had strong performance, delivering 15% organic growth, primarily from strength in equity capital markets, corporate actions, and reg and compliance offerings and strength in our core portfolio monitoring management tools, while Information and Processing each had a 6% organic increase, driven by pricing and valuations and loan market activities, respectively. 
Our Transportation segment delivered organic growth of 4% in the quarter. This included growth of 8% recurring, as Q1 had strong growth within our CARFAX and automotiveMastermind businesses. Nonrecurring revenue declined by 8%, primarily driven by continued lower activity in digital marketing and recall. 
Our Resources segment had 10% organic decline, which is comprised of a 9% recurring decline and 20% nonrecurring decline. Q1 organic ACV decreased by 7 million in the quarter and our trailing 12-month organic ACV is down 11%, as we have largely cycled through our subscription renewals since the North American energy market was severely impacted at the end of Q1 last year. 
Our CMS segment had 1% organic decline, including 2% increased recurring and a decline of 25% nonrecurring. 
Moving now to profits and margins. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $467 million, up $35 million versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8%, with a margin of 41.7%, up 180 basis points. 
Moving on to our segments. 
Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $233 million, with a margin of 48.1%, up 100 basis points. Financial Services margin was driven by strong revenue growth, while supporting continued investment. 
Transportation's adjusted EBITDA was $147 million, with a margin of 47.1%, up 740 basis points. We do expect margins to moderate to -- in forward quarters as we see more expense tied to revenue growth. 
Resources adjusted EBITDA was $74 million, with a margin of 36.6%, a decrease of 340 basis points as a result of lower revenue. 
CMS adjusted EBITDA was $26 million, with a margin of 21.5%, down 250 basis points. This quarter decrease was primarily driven by mix shift, which we expect to improve during the year. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.71 per diluted share, an increase of 8%. Our GAAP tax rate was 17%, and our adjusted tax rate was 20%. Q1 free cash flow was $172 million. As a reminder, Q1 is seasonally our lowest free cash flow quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet. 
Our Q1 ending debt balance was $5.1 billion, and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7x on a bank covenant basis and 2.6x net of cash. We closed the quarter with $172 million of cash, and our Q1 undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1.022 billion. 
Our Q1 weighted average diluted share count was 401 million shares. As we mentioned in Q4, the merger agreement with S&P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares. And therefore, our share repurchase program is currently suspended, other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share-based compensation. 
Moving to guidance. 
We had a great start to the year, and now expect to deliver results in the upper half of our 2021 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, which include the following: revenue of $4.535 billion to $4.635 billion, with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, including recurring organic growth of 6% to 7%; adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.03 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 100 basis points when adjusted for FX; an adjusted EPS of $3.11 to 3.16. Finally, we expect cash conversion in the mid-60s as we lap our 2020 one-time cash impacts. 
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance."

And similarly, in some of the loans markets, we've seen strength as well. So we feel pretty good about the core businesses. They continue to grow at the rates that we've targeted, in some cases, towards the higher ends of those targets. With the addition of strong capital markets, that gives us the opportunity to deliver a double-digit quarter like we did here.

Okay. No. That's a great question, Manav. 
So the first off, I guess when you look at the agenda for CERAWeek, you see a strong formation of discussion in plenaries around energy transition, which is a step away from the big discussion around climate change. And when you think about how the world is responding now with the new Biden administration, with the COP 26 coming up, real strong support for the 1.5 degree pathway. And I think that positions IHS Markit's energy team very, very well for the energy transition associated growth that's going to come as the industrial participants start to shift gears and look for how they might participate in their businesses with respect to energy transition. 
That being said, it was pretty clear from the CERAWeek discussions that 100 million barrels a day is still a level of demand post COVID that is in the crosshairs of what needs to be supplied. And therefore, our upstream business will need to continue to support and play an important role in the provision of the fossil fuels needed as the world is transitioning towards 2050. 
So I think we win both ways: thought leadership, a player in the upstream to support the required supply, and a team that's working very hard to transition itself through the solar, wind, hydrogen storage solutions and a variety of other activities that are expected to decarbonize our world. 
So I think we're doing a good job. I think CERAWeek, to me, really sung a story of energy transition stronger than it ever has. And I think we're well positioned to get the new growth and to maintain our contracts that we've managed through 2020 to longer-term and a bit lower price. And so we'll see the slightly negative impact through this year. And I'd expect a mid-single-digit growth as we go into '22.

And I really would refer you back to when Lance and Doug talked about it in the merger.

So all of the areas that were identified upfront, as we've gone through a more extended period of discovery, proven out to be quite significant opportunities for us forward. 
I think in the coming months, the teams will update publicly our views on synergies. It's still early to do that. We're still in a regulatory approval period and still in a discovery phase. But it's -- as we dug in more and more, all of the expectations that we had have proven out."

What's driving it? I think it's the -- our core products, right? So if you look at the CARFAX offerings, if you look at the mastermind offerings, or if you look at some of our core subscription products like supply chain and technology, all of these businesses are growing significantly and are showing kind of good resilience in the first quarter. 
On the digital marketing side, so what we're seeing is advertising spending is coming back relative to where it was 2 or 3 quarters ago. But it has not yet resumed to pre-COVID levels. Why is that? A couple of reasons, but one of the big ones is low inventories. The supply chain is still catching up and trying to rebuild inventory levels, in particular, in the North American market. And when inventories are low, advertising spend tends to be lower. And we're still seeing this in the industry today. And we will see subdued inventory levels for the next couple of quarters at least. And that's why advertising spend and digital marketing spend is still not quite where we would like it to be. 
We are seeing strength in the business. We are activities far higher than it was 2 quarters ago. So we expect digital marketing to be stronger as the year goes by."

What I can say is that -- and if Adam, Edward or Brian want to add anything after this, they can. 
What I've been impressed with is the pipeline, the growing pipeline and connectivity to the data lake, and the assessment of the data lake as a new way to consume data from us more efficiently, but also to reach some broader contracts, especially around the hedge fund community, where quantitative and qualitative decision-making from vast quantities of data, it's -- some of the bigger hedge funds that have those tools and have those capabilities. 
We're also seeing some midsized vendors and some corporates who have been grappling with their own construct of a data lake, where they can leverage us as a technology platform to be able to not just provide them our data, but to provide them connectivity for their own and even distribution for their own. So some very strong discussions that are starting to lead to revenue. There is paying customers for the data lake now, and that starts to grow. 
Edouard, do you want to add to that? How you're using it within automotive? And then maybe, Adam, you might want to do the same on FS. Edouard?"

I think that is the story, right, over the past 3 or 4 years. We measure internally, we use a metric recall with the Vitality Index, right? I don't think we publish it. But we measure the contribution of new products to our growth. And for division like Transportation, that contribution has increased year after year over the past 5 years. New products and high-growth products are an increasing part of our kind of overall revenue growth. 
To give you an example, right, in concrete terms. And if you look at our maritime and trade business, it's always owned a number of incredibly valuable kind of legacy data assets. But over the past 3 years, it has repositioned essentially a data business into a solutions business, targeting risk management workflows, trade compliance workflows, commodities analytics workflows. And through this transformation, has become essentially a high single-digit growth business. A lot of these innovations have been enabled by the data lake and -- which strongly reduces the product development life cycle. So it's certainly a good innovation story there.
Adam, I don't know if you want to add something."

As more and more clients adopt our catalog and ability to access the data lake, that seems to be proving out. 
We do have paying customers today, and we do see the pipeline forward.

But secondly, that would give us opportunities for distribution, combination of data with customers and third-parties, and give us a real competitive edge in our ability to sell and distribute our content. 
The piece that I think is additive to all that, that we're starting to learn about is more that there are significant numbers of larger customers who want to be able to interrogate large data sets to identify decision-making signals and decision points. And that's been leading us to some of the bigger quantitative hedge funds, but it also exists within the corporate world for analytics and analysis. So I think we're well on our way to gaining the efficiencies, and we're starting to see the revenue follow through as well. So a good story."

So the OEM customers last year had a slightly different cycle to the dealers in the sense that, in Q2, they were operating sort of more normally. But if you will, the COVID crisis really hit them in Q3, and they're still recovering from this. So today, they're doing much better. As you know, demand for vehicles is picking up significantly in the U.S. and globally in 2021, as is production. 
The one caveat I would bring is that the supply chain is still adjusting to this post-COVID world. So then -- some of those supply chain issues have been well documented, in particular the semiconductor shortages. And they have led us to revise our 2021 forecast down by 0.5 million vehicles. So that is a temporary kind of shock, but it is a shock nonetheless. And it's slowing down the recovery of inventories in western markets. 
There are some other challenges, right? So there was a bout of severe weather in the southern U.S. few weeks ago. That has actually created a shortfall of chemical feedstocks. That's also impacting the supply chain. There was a fire last week in Japan in a major semiconductor plant. So all of these are sort of impacting our customers. But in the end, it's delaying the recovery, but the recovery is coming back. We're in a good place in the sense that we are supporting OEMs and suppliers with some of these secular structural transformations in the industry, and those are multiyear transformations. And our data and our solutions are critical to helping them. So slower recovery, but recovering nonetheless, and the outlook for the industry is positive."

And also within Transportation, there seems to be a shift more towards technology long term. And I know you're providing companies with solutions to help them with these changes and shifting their strategies. 
I guess can you just talk about what this means within IHS? Is this -- does this mean selling different products to your existing customers as these changes take place? Do the traditional data sets become sort of less used, but new data sets receive more demand? And does this enable more upselling to existing customers, but also opportunities to get new customers, maybe technology players, et cetera, as these changes take place? So any color there would be helpful."
13651733,706133856,2241007,"IHS Markit Ltd., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 23, 2021",2021-03-23,"Earnings Calls","IHS Markit Ltd.","Executives","Okay.

No. That's a good question and one that definitely encompasses our strategic vision. And for all my team, they're very focused on the impact of the changing marketplaces around us that are being driven by either technology or a quest for decarbonization, and therefore, participating in a change in net 0 world as we look forward. So you have to take those and go, are we going to be able to participate and take revenue from that and adjust our business positively? Or are we going to find that we get disintermediated because some of the revenue streams will shrink? 
So our strategy is very, very clear. If you look in Transportation, you're seeing it right now in maritime and trade, and you see it in our strong automotive recovery. And that is, is that, when you look at those revenue streams and you dig into them, you start to see how they're shifting their customer base to new solutions, new platforms and new decision-making tools. And within automotive, we are an independent supplier of information that helps people make decisions. And the world -- the automotive world has got more complex. And it will continue to get more complex as we look forward given this drive towards net 0. So I feel like the information sets around automotive are very blunt and participating in forecasting in good or bad markets is a good thing. 
The second thing I'd say is that mastermind, when we acquired mastermind, I think it was around $80 million of revenue. It's now running towards $120 million this year. And that's getting driven because Edouard and his team have taken the mastermind platform, married it with Polk data, married it with CARFAX data, took full views for the OEMs. And the OEMs for the first time are saying, geez, why do I want to provide a incentive that blankets the U.S.? Why don't I target market right down to post codes, or even right down to individuals? And that's where the mastermind platform, which we called an enterprise mastermind, is adapting to this new digital world, and even a world where there's less dealerships in the car just lands in your driveway. So we want to participate in that, and the team is doing a great job shifting. 
There's some other ones in around automotive, but I'll shift for a second. Maritime, there, the shift is the new services. It's supply chain. It's decarbonization. It's -- you've got all the maritime fleet information. All of your suppliers that are trying to be ESG compliant need to know what's the carbon footprint of the delivery of my goods? And so we're now producing a full carbon fleet analysis for our customers, and that's a growth area. It's being driven from the data lake. It's new technology. It's just old products adapting to new worlds and making sure we're participating. 
If you go over to Energy, I think we covered that. Energy, we're going to have to make sure that we maintain the upstream, $250 million to $300 million of revenue. And the rest of the revenue, we're going to have to grow as the energy markets transition. And we're very well positioned. We do consulting around all those services. That's helpful. We know where the assets are. So that's helpful for global warming. We know where the pipelines are, the distribution. We have a lot of data that plays into the new world. And we're transitioning and growing our solar, wind, hydrogen, battery storage businesses. And this is a growth market. So it's going to be a top -- energy folks, this is going to be a year where it's tough because we gave discounts last year and they got to recover into next year. But I think that by the time they get to '22, they might be the darlings again in the company, and you'll see somebody else on their back on. 
And then Financial Services, I think we're in all the right growth markets. So there, I feel good about it. And I don't want to leave CMS out because, sometimes, we do, but Rootmetrics, which is small, I know, but they're into 5G, and 5G is important. And if you go over to the CMS product design folks, their pipeline is all about digital transformation and focusing on the vast amounts of specs and standards that need to be added together to in-house documentation engineers to make decisions. And we're playing that game with our digital platform. And we've got a great pipeline because we can save people money. So net-net, I think, for a great people, a great company. We're well positioned to get our share. 
The question always is, is IHS Markit, now S&P Global, will they get their share of the growth in TAMs that are substantive? And my bet is, yes, of course, they will. They're filled with great people and great customers. And therefore, there's lots to do."

So instead of 4,000 or 5,000 physical conference seats, you can have tens of thousands of virtual seats. 
People are willing to pay for top-quality content and access to the right audience. And we had all the right audience. We had top government officials, new U.S. Energy Minister, John Kerry, in his new climate envoy role. We had Bill Gates. We had heads of pharmaceutical companies. We had technology. Big sessions on hydrogen. It really was impressive, and we'll see that growth come into our next quarter. And it was -- all as I can say is the team was well ahead of their plan and pressed all of us in all 3 events, and we'll give you those numbers next quarter.

So that's an investing side. IHS Markit, and now S&p global, Adam's teams are investing with PIMCO, Men Group, McKinsey, Microsoft and others around a product called Hub, which they'll ultimately consolidate back into their solutions businesses. That's all about new technology and efficiencies for asset managers. So yes, continued investment. 
When you get over into the automotive world, I mentioned already the enterprise mastermind, which is the broader OEM platform. That's been an investment through COVID. CMS has been investing in the digitization of their business. And then all of these lead me to the upper half of our growth range if executed well. Hey, I was really pleased. I've never seen a 10% quarter probably since 2014 or somewhere before that. So to see a 10% quarter in FI, it's things coming back that -- it's your normal businesses performing at 5%, 6% growth range, but then your new investment areas, which are big into solutions, are performing at above their ranges.

They all kind of go hand-in-hand, land use in this new world that we head into. And I think the teams are investing. They're adding people. They're investing in their businesses.

Earlier this morning, we issued our Q1 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website.  
Our discussion on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers, which exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are not a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information.

And just before we start the call, we do have a moment of silence for all of those who have passed from COVID over the past year. This has taken place at the moment in our U.K. offices. And I'd just like to pause for a moment here to respect all those that have passed and people that we know and love, and friends and family that may have been -- passed away through the pandemic. So if we could just take a moment of silence and then get started.  
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Eric, and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 earnings call. We started the year with a very strong set of Q1 results, which provides a great foundation for the full year.  
Q1 revenue was $1.12 billion, with organic growth of 3%; adjusted EBITDA of $467 million; and margin of 41.7%, up 180 basis points year-over-year; an adjusted EPS of $0.71, up 8% over the prior year.  Overall, we are pleased with the start of our year and now expect to deliver results in the upper half of our 2021 guidance.  
In terms of our core industry verticals, let me first start with our Financial Services segment, which had record organic growth of 10% in Q1. Within Financial Services, Information had another quarter of solid organic growth of 6%. Main contributors included increased demand for our pricing, reference data and valuation services as well as continued growth in our SFTR reporting platform and indices businesses.  
Solutions had a very strong quarter with 15% organic growth, driven by solid performance across our Solutions businesses. Increased capital market issuance and greater adoption of our corporate actions, private markets, and reg and compliance offerings were all significant contributors. We continue to expect Solutions to be a large growth contributor for the full year.  
Finally, our Processing business grew 6% organically, with strength in loans and derivative performance as expected. For the full year, we now expect Financial Services to be in the higher end of our 6% to 8% targeted organic growth range. I just want to congratulate the team on that record 10% quarter. That's the first time since Markit went public and the IHS Markit together that we had a 10% quarter. So congratulations to everybody.  
Moving on to Transportation, which had organic revenue growth improved to 4% in Q1.  As expected, we continue to see the rebound across our businesses at varying speeds. We're particularly pleased to see our recurring revenue growth improved to 8% in the quarter. Our dealer-facing businesses experienced strong growth across CARFAX and automotiveMastermind, with revenue growth rates approaching pre-COVID levels. New business was strong across the portfolio in Q1, and we remain confident about the outlook for the rest of the year.  
Also in Transportation, our Maritime & Trade business had a very good start to the year, which was in line with our expectations. We also hosted a successful virtual TPM conference in March. We expect strong new business and retention performance will drive an acceleration of recurring revenue growth through the rest of the year.  For the full year, we now expect Transportation's organic growth to be in the 13% to 15% range, which is up from our original 12% to 15%.  
Moving on to Resources, where organic decline was negative 10% in Q1. Our Resources business is playing out as expected. In 2020, given the industry conditions, we put into place a number of drivers that should help us return to growth in 2022. As expected, our ACV has bottomed in Q1 and expect for it to slowly recover through the rest of the year, which bodes well for 2022 recurring revenue. Our downstream organic revenue growth performed as expected and should accelerate through the rest of the year. 
In the beginning of March, we held our CERAWeek conference, which had over 19,000 participants. Even with the virtual event, we were able to bring together leaders in the energy industry, world governments, finance and technology to discuss the future of energy. We also hosted a successful virtual World Petrochemical Conference.  
In 2021, we continue to expect organic revenue results within Resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in low single-digits, as upstream improves and downstream continues its growth trajectory.  
Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was in line with our expectations of negative 1% for the quarter. We expect improving results across Product Design, TMT and ECR to continue through the year. For the full year, we still expect CMS to deliver mid-single-digit organic growth.  
Now on March 11, the shareholders of both IHS Markit and S&P Global overwhelmingly voted to approve the merger. We are working with the relevant regulatory bodies and still expect a second half close.  
And now I'll turn the call over to Jonathan."

Q1 results included revenue of $1.12 billion, which represents organic growth of 3% and total revenue increase of 4%, with recurring growth of 4%; net income of $149 million and GAAP EPS of $0.37; our adjusted EBITDA of $467 milli",736,"Great. Thanks, Lance.  
Q1 results included revenue of $1.12 billion, which represents organic growth of 3% and total revenue increase of 4%, with recurring growth of 4%; net income of $149 million and GAAP EPS of $0.37; our adjusted EBITDA of $467 million, an increase of 8%, with margins of 41.7%, this represents margin expansion of 180 basis points; and we also delivered adjusted EPS of $0.71, an increase of 8%.  
Regarding revenue, our Q1 organic growth of 3% included recurring organic growth of 4% and nonrecurring organic decline of 7%. This decline in nonrecurring was primarily driven by lower Automotive OEM activities, lower Energy consulting activities, and transactional content purchases for Upstream and Product Design when compared to Q1 of last year.  
Moving on to segment performance.  Our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 10%, including 9% recurring in the quarter. Solutions, in particular, had strong performance, delivering 15% organic growth, primarily from strength in equity capital markets, corporate actions, and reg and compliance offerings and strength in our core portfolio monitoring management tools, while Information and Processing each had a 6% organic increase, driven by pricing and valuations and loan market activities, respectively.  
Our Transportation segment delivered organic growth of 4% in the quarter. This included growth of 8% recurring, as Q1 had strong growth within our CARFAX and automotiveMastermind businesses. Nonrecurring revenue declined by 8%, primarily driven by continued lower activity in digital marketing and recall.  
Our Resources segment had 10% organic decline, which is comprised of a 9% recurring decline and 20% nonrecurring decline. Q1 organic ACV decreased by $7 million in the quarter and our trailing 12-month organic ACV is down 11%, as we have largely cycled through our subscription renewals since the North American energy market was severely impacted at the end of Q1 last year.  
Our CMS segment had 1% organic decline, including 2% increased recurring and a decline of 25% nonrecurring.  
Moving now to profits and margins.  Adjusted EBITDA was $467 million, up $35 million versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8%, with a margin of 41.7%, up 180 basis points.  
Moving on to our segments. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $233 million, with a margin of 48.1%, up 100 basis points. Financial Services margin was driven by strong revenue growth, while supporting continued investment.  
Transportation's adjusted EBITDA was $147 million, with a margin of 47.1%, up 740 basis points. We do expect margins to moderate to -- in forward quarters as we see more expense tied to revenue growth.  
Resources adjusted EBITDA was $74 million, with a margin of 36.6%, a decrease of 340 basis points as a result of lower revenue.  
CMS adjusted EBITDA was $26 million, with a margin of 21.5%, down 250 basis points. This quarter decrease was primarily driven by mix shift, which we expect to improve during the year.  
Adjusted EPS was $0.71 per diluted share, an increase of 8%. Our GAAP tax rate was 17%, and our adjusted tax rate was 20%. Q1 free cash flow was $172 million. As a reminder, Q1 is seasonally our lowest free cash flow quarter.  
Turning to the balance sheet.  Our Q1 ending debt balance was $5.1 billion, and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7x on a bank covenant basis and 2.6x net of cash. We closed the quarter with $172 million of cash, and our Q1 undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1.022 billion. Our Q1 weighted average diluted share count was 401 million shares. As we mentioned in Q4, the merger agreement with S&P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares. And therefore, our share repurchase program is currently suspended, other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share-based compensation.  
Moving to guidance.  We had a great start to the year, and now expect to deliver results in the upper half of our 2021 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, which include the following: revenue of $4.535 billion to $4.635 billion, with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, including recurring organic growth of 6% to 7%; adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.03 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 100 basis points when adjusted for FX; an adjusted EPS of $3.11 to 3.16. Finally, we expect cash conversion in the mid-60s as we lap our 2020 one-time cash impacts.  
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance."

We've built strong platforms and strong capabilities in a few markets that have really seen strength through Q1. We do expect some of that strength to continue throughout the year. Particularly in equity capital markets, you saw a very strong first quarter. Second quarter continues to look strong. We'll see what the balance of the year brings. And similarly, in some of the loans markets, we've seen strength as well. So we feel pretty good about the core businesses. They continue to grow at the rates that we've targeted, in some cases, towards the higher ends of those targets. With the addition of strong capital markets, that gives us the opportunity to deliver a double-digit quarter like we did here.  
I'd love to say we'll continue that into the future. We'll see what the future brings. But it's about -- just really about positioning our product to take advantage of those opportunities when the markets are strong."

Okay. No. That's a great question, Manav.  
So the first off, I guess when you look at the agenda for CERAWeek, you see a strong formation of discussion in plenaries around energy transition, which is a step away from the big discussion around climate change. And when you think about how the world is responding now with the new Biden administration, with the COP26 coming up, real strong support for the 1.5 degree pathway. And I think that positions IHS Markit's Energy team very, very well for the energy transition associated growth that's going to come as the industrial participants start to shift gears and look for how they might participate in their businesses with respect to energy transition.  
That being said, it was pretty clear from the CERAWeek discussions that 100 million barrels a day is still a level of demand post COVID that is in the crosshairs of what needs to be supplied. And therefore, our Upstream business will need to continue to support and play an important role in the provision of the fossil fuels needed as the world is transitioning towards 2050.  
So I think we win both ways: thought leadership, a player in the upstream to support the required supply; and a team that's working very hard to transition itself through the solar, wind, hydrogen storage solutions and a variety of other activities that are expected to decarbonize our world.  
So I think we're doing a good job. I think CERAWeek, to me, really sung a story of energy transition stronger than it ever has. And I think we're well positioned to get the new growth and to maintain our contracts that we've managed through 2020 to longer term and a bit lower price. And so we'll see the slightly negative impact through this year. And I'd expect a mid-single-digit growth as we go into '22.

And I really would refer you back to when Lance and Doug talked about it in the merger. Those core areas that were identified upfront continue to be the core areas of opportunity, whether it's in bringing together multi-asset class benchmarks in our index franchise; the scale of data assets that we can make available to customers and more efficient delivery to those customers; the combined ESG capabilities and assets of the business; the strong ability to play a role in private markets, an area growing quite rapidly; and our deep knowledge of underlying company financials as well as the tools that are used by the private equity and private credit industry to manage their portfolios; and then, of course, a significant set of data and capabilities around credit and risk looking into the supply chain of customers. 
So all of the areas that were identified upfront, as we've gone through a more extended period of discovery, proven out to be quite significant opportunities for us forward.  I think in the coming months, the teams will update publicly our views on synergies. It's still early to do that. We're still in a regulatory approval period and still in a discovery phase. But it's -- as we dug in more and more, all of the expectations that we have proven out."

On the digital marketing side, so what we're seeing is advertising spending is coming back relative to where it was 2 or 3 quarters ago. But it has not yet resumed to pre-COVID levels. Why is that? A couple of reasons, but one of the big ones is low inventories. The supply chain is still catching up and trying to rebuild inventory levels, in particular, in the North American market. And when inventories are low, advertising spend tends to be lower. And we're still seeing this in the industry today. And we will see subdued inventory levels for the next couple of quarters at least. And that's why advertising spend and digital marketing spend is still not quite where we would like it to be. 
We are seeing strength in the business. We are -- activities far higher than it was 2 quarters ago, so we expect digital marketing to be stronger as the year goes by."

What I can say is that -- and if Adam, Edouard or Brian want to add anything after this, they can. 
What I've been impressed with is the pipeline, the growing pipeline and connectivity to the Data Lake, and the assessment of the Data Lake as a new way to consume data from us more efficiently, but also to reach some broader contracts, especially around the hedge fund community, where quantitative and qualitative decision-making from vast quantities of data, it's some of the bigger hedge funds that have those tools and have those capabilities. 
We're also seeing some midsized vendors and some corporates who have been grappling with their own construct of a Data Lake, where they can leverage us as a technology platform to be able to not just provide them our data, but to provide them connectivity for their own and even distribution for their own. So some very strong discussions that are starting to lead to revenue. There is paying customers for the Data Lake now, and that starts to grow.

And I'll address the broader point of that kind of innovation, product innovation. I think that is the story right over the past 3 or 4 years. We measure internally, we use a metric we call the vitality index, right? I don't think we publish it. But we measure the contribution of new products to our growth. And for a division like Transportation, that contribution has increased year after year over the past 5 years. New products and high-growth products are an increasing part of our kind of overall revenue growth. 
To give you an example, right, in concrete terms. And if you look at our Maritime & Trade business, it's always owned a number of incredibly valuable kind of legacy data assets. But over the past 3 years, it has repositioned essentially a data business into a solutions business targeting risk management workflows, trade compliance workflows, commodities analytics workflows. And through this transformation, has become essentially a high single-digit growth business. A lot of these innovations have been enabled by the Data Lake and -- which strongly reduces the product development life cycle. So it's certainly a good innovation story there.
Adam, I don't know if you want to add something."

But secondly, that would give us opportunities for distribution, combination of data with customers and third parties, and give us a real competitive edge in our ability to sell and distribute our content. 
The piece that I think is additive to all that, that we're starting to learn about is more that there are significant numbers of larger customers who want to be able to interrogate large data sets to identify decision-making signals and decision points. And that's been leading us to some of the bigger quantitative hedge funds, but it also exists within the corporate world for analytics and analysis.

So the OEM customers last year had a slightly different cycle to the dealers in the sense that, in Q2, they were operating sort of more normally. But if you will, the COVID crisis really hit them in Q3, and they're still recovering from this. So today, they're doing much better. As you know, demand for vehicles is picking up significantly in the U.S. and globally in 2021, as is production. 
The one caveat I would bring is that the supply chain is still adjusting to this post-COVID world. So then some of those supply chain issues have been well documented, in particular the semiconductor shortages. And they have led us to revise our 2021 forecast down by 0.5 million vehicles. So that is a temporary kind of shock, but it is a shock nonetheless and it's slowing down the recovery of inventories in western markets. 
There are some other challenges, right? So there was a bout of severe weather in the southern U.S. a few weeks ago. That has actually created a shortfall of chemical feedstocks. That's also impacting the supply chain. There was a fire last week in Japan in a major semiconductor plant. So all of these are sort of impacting our customers. But in the end, it's delaying the recovery, but the recovery is coming back. We're in a good place in the sense that we are supporting OEMs and suppliers with some of these secular structural transformations in the industry, and those are multiyear transformations. And our data and our solutions are critical to helping them. So slower recovery, but recovering nonetheless, and the outlook for the industry is positive."

And also within Transportation, there seems to be a shift more towards technology long term. And I know you're providing companies with solutions to help them with these changes and shifting their strategies. 
I guess can you just talk about what this means within IHS? Is this -- does this mean selling different products to your existing customers as these changes take place? Do the traditional data sets become sort of less used, but new data sets receive more demand? And does this enable more upselling to existing customers, but also opportunities to get new customers, maybe technology players, et cetera, as these changes take place? So any color there would be helpful."
13651733,706133856,2241096,"IHS Markit Ltd., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 23, 2021",2021-03-23,"Earnings Calls","IHS Markit Ltd.","Executives","Okay. No. That's a good question and one that definitely encompasses our strategic vision.

No. That's a good question and one that definitely encompasses our strategic vision. And for all my team, they're very focused on the impact of the changing marketplaces around us that are being driven by either technology or a quest for decarbonization and, therefore, participating in a change in net zero world as we look forward. So you have to take those and go, are we going to be able to participate and take revenue from that and adjust our business positively? Or are we going to find that we get disintermediated because some of the revenue streams will shrink? 
So our strategy is very, very clear. If you look in Transportation, you're seeing it right now in Maritime & Trade, and you see it in our strong Automotive recovery. And that is, is that, when you look at those revenue streams and you dig into them, you start to see how they're shifting their customer base to new solutions, new platforms and new decision-making tools. And within Automotive, we are an independent supplier of information that helps people make decisions. And the world -- the automotive world has gotten more complex. And it will continue to get more complex as we look forward given this drive towards net zero. So I feel like the information sets around automotive are very bouyant and participating in forecasting in good or bad markets is a good thing. 
The second thing I'd say is that Mastermind, when we acquired Mastermind, I think it was around $80 million of revenue. It's now running towards $120 million this year. And that's getting driven because Edouard and his team have taken the Mastermind platform, married it with Polk data, married it with CARFAX data, took full views for the OEMs. And the OEMs for the first time are saying, ""Geez, why do I want to provide a incentive that blankets the U.S.? Why don't I target market it right down the post codes, or even right down the individuals? And that's where the Mastermind platform, which we call an enterprise mastermind, is adapting to this new digital world, and even a world where there's less dealerships and the car just lands in your driveway. So we want to participate in that, and the team is doing a great job shifting. 
There's some other ones in around Automotive, but I'll shift for a second. Maritime, there, the shift is the new services. It's supply chain. It's decarbonization. It's -- you've got all the maritime fleet information. All of your suppliers that are trying to be ESG compliant need to know what's the carbon footprint of the delivery of my goods. And so we're now producing a full carbon fleet analysis for our customers, and that's a growth area. It's being driven from the Data Lake. It's new technology. It's just old products adapting to new worlds and making sure we're participating. 
If you go over to Energy, I think we covered that. Energy, we're going to have to make sure that we maintain the Upstream, $250 million to $300 million of revenue. And the rest of the revenue, we're going to have to grow as the energy markets transition. And we're very well positioned. We do consulting around all those services. That's helpful. We know where the assets are, so that's helpful for global warming. We know where the pipelines are, the distribution. We have a lot of data that plays into the new world. And we're transitioning and growing our solar, wind, hydrogen, battery storage businesses. And this is a growth market. So it's going to be a top -- for the energy folks, this is going to be a year where it's tough because we gave discounts last year and they got to recover into next year. But I think that by the time they get to '22, they might be the darlings again in the company, and you'll see somebody else on their back. 
And then Financial Services, I think we're in all the right growth markets. So there, I feel good about it. And I don't want to leave CMS out because, sometimes, we do. But RootMetrics, which is small, I know, but they're into 5G, and 5G is important. And if you go over to the CMS product design folks, their pipeline is all about digital transformation and focusing on the vast amounts of specs and standards that need to be added together to in-house documentation for engineers to make decisions. And we're playing that game with our digital platform. And we've got a great pipeline because we can save people money. So net-net, I think, for a great people, a great company, we're well positioned to get our share. 
The question always is, is IHS Markit, now S&P Global, will they get their share of the growth in TAMs that are substantive? And my bet is, yes, of course, they will. They're filled with great people and great customers. And therefore, there's lots to do."

We have 3 of those: TPM, World Petrochemical Conference and CERAWeek. And all of them had record audiences. So the -- and the audiences can be record because everybody's online virtually. So instead of 4,000 or 5,000 physical conference seats, you can have tens of thousands of virtual seats. 
People are willing to pay for top-quality content and access to the right audience, and we had all the right audience. We had top government officials, new U.S. Energy Minister, John Kerry, in his new climate envoy role. We had Bill Gates. We had heads of pharmaceutical companies. We had technology. Big sessions on hydrogen. It really was impressive, and we'll see that growth come into our next quarter. And it was -- all I can say is the team was well ahead of their plan and pressed all of us in all 3 events, and we'll give you those numbers next quarter. 
So I think worst-case scenario is we're always virtual, and we're going to get better and better at it and grow from there. Best-case scenario, which I think we're all hoping for, is we get to be back together in rooms and feel safe, and can network and build relationships like humans like to do. So let's hope for the second. But if the first comes, it's not going to hurt our growth path. I think the teams have proven they can make money and grow."

We made an investment in one of the world-class fund admins in -- that support the alternative space. We see substantive synergies and opportunities there to invest in our reporting services like iLEVEL and the integration of those products into the administration side. So that's an investing side. IHS Markit, now S&P Global, Adam's teams are investing with PIMCO, Man Group, McKinsey, Microsoft and others around a product called HUB, which they'll ultimately consolidate back into their Solutions businesses. That's all about new technology and efficiencies for asset managers. So yes, continued investment. 
When you get over into the automotive world, I mentioned already the enterprise mastermind, which is the broader OEM platform. That's been an investment through COVID. CMS has been investing in the digitization of their business. And all of these lead me to the upper half of our growth range if executed well. Hey, I was really pleased. I've never seen a 10% quarter probably since 2014 or somewhere before that. So to see a 10% quarter in FI, it's things coming back that -- it's your normal businesses performing at 5%, 6% growth range, but then your new investment areas, which are big into solutions, are performing at above their ranges. And that sometimes is volume, but in this case, it's a lot of the new product development and the hard work the teams have been doing. 
I think in Energy, it speaks for itself. It's renewables. It's -- we acquired the agriculture business, ag, and decarbonization. They all kind of go hand-in-hand, land use in this new world that we head into. And I think the teams are investing. They're adding people. They're investing in their businesses. And we only -- we give 100 basis points margin, but there's more than enough opportunity through the revenue side and cost management for us to create investment dollars. And all the teams are doing that. I'll pause here and go to the next question."

And I'd just like to pause for a moment here to respect all those that have passed and people that we know and love, and friends and family that may have been -- passed away through the pandemic. So if we could just take a moment of silence and then get started.  
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Eric, and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 earnings call. We started the year with a very strong set of Q1 results, which provides a great foundation for the full year.  
Q1 revenue was $1.12 billion, with organic growth of 3%; adjusted EBITDA of $467 million; and margin of 41.7%, up 180 basis points year-over-year; an adjusted EPS of $0.71, up 8% over the prior year.  Overall, we are pleased with the start of our year and now expect to deliver results in the upper half of our 2021 guidance.  
In terms of our core industry verticals, let me first start with our Financial Services segment, which had record organic growth of 10% in Q1. Within Financial Services, Information had another quarter of solid organic growth of 6%. Main contributors included increased demand for our pricing, reference data and valuation services as well as continued growth in our SFTR reporting platform and indices businesses.  
Solutions had a very strong quarter with 15% organic growth, driven by solid performance across our Solutions businesses. Increased capital market issuance and greater adoption of our corporate actions, private markets, and reg and compliance offerings were all significant contributors. We continue to expect Solutions to be a large growth contributor for the full year.  
Finally, our Processing business grew 6% organically, with strength in loans and derivative performance as expected. For the full year, we now expect Financial Services to be in the higher end of our 6% to 8% targeted organic growth range. I just want to congratulate the team on that record 10% quarter. That's the first time since Markit went public and the IHS Markit together that we had a 10% quarter. So congratulations to everybody.  
Moving on to Transportation, which had organic revenue growth improve to 4% in Q1.  As expected, we continue to see the rebound across our businesses at varying speeds. We're particularly pleased to see our recurring revenue growth improve to 8% in the quarter. Our dealer-facing businesses experienced strong growth across CARFAX and automotiveMastermind, with revenue growth rates approaching pre-COVID levels. New business was strong across the portfolio in Q1, and we remain confident about the outlook for the rest of the year.  
Also in Transportation, our Maritime & Trade business had a very good start to the year, which was in line with our expectations. We also hosted a successful virtual TPM conference in March. We expect strong new business and retention performance will drive an acceleration of recurring revenue growth through the rest of the year.  For the full year, we now expect Transportation's organic growth to be in the 13% to 15% range, which is up from our original 12% to 15%.  
Moving on to Resources, where organic decline was negative 10% in Q1. Our Resources business is playing out as expected. In 2020, given the industry conditions, we put into place a number of drivers that should help us return to growth in 2022. As expected, our ACV has bottomed in Q1 and expect for it to slowly recover through the rest of the year, which bodes well for 2022 recurring revenue. Our downstream organic revenue growth performed as expected and should accelerate through the rest of the year. 
In the beginning of March, we held our CERAWeek conference, which had over 19,000 participants. Even with the virtual event, we were able to bring together leaders in the energy industry, world governments, finance and technology to discuss the future of energy. We also hosted a successful virtual World Petrochemical Conference.  
In 2021, we continue to expect organic revenue results within Resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in low single-digits, as upstream improves and downstream continues its growth trajectory.  
Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was in line with our expectations of negative 1% for the quarter. We expect improving results across Product Design, TMT and ECR to continue through the year. For the full year, we still expect CMS to deliver mid-single-digit organic growth.  
Now on March 11, the shareholders of both IHS Markit and S&P Global overwhelmingly voted to approve the merger. We are working with the relevant regulatory bodies and still expect a second half close.  
And now I'll turn the call over to Jonathan."

Q1 results included revenue of $1.12 billion, which represents organic growth of 3% and total revenue increase of 4%, with recurring growth of 4%; net income of $149 million and GAAP EPS of $0.37; our adjusted EBITDA of $467 milli",736,"Great. Thanks, Lance.  
Q1 results included revenue of $1.12 billion, which represents organic growth of 3% and total revenue increase of 4%, with recurring growth of 4%; net income of $149 million and GAAP EPS of $0.37; our adjusted EBITDA of $467 million, an increase of 8%, with margins of 41.7%. This represents margin expansion of 180 basis points, and we also delivered adjusted EPS of $0.71, an increase of 8%.  
Regarding revenue, our Q1 organic growth of 3% included recurring organic growth of 4% and nonrecurring organic decline of 7%. This decline in nonrecurring was primarily driven by lower Automotive OEM activities, lower Energy consulting activities, and transactional content purchases for Upstream and Product Design when compared to Q1 of last year.  
Moving on to segment performance.  Our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 10%, including 9% recurring in the quarter. Solutions, in particular, had strong performance, delivering 15% organic growth, primarily from strength in equity capital markets, corporate actions, and reg and compliance offerings and strength in our core portfolio monitoring management tools, while Information and Processing each had a 6% organic increase, driven by pricing and valuations and loan market activities, respectively.  
Our Transportation segment delivered organic growth of 4% in the quarter. This included growth of 8% recurring, as Q1 had strong growth within our CARFAX and automotiveMastermind businesses. Nonrecurring revenue declined by 8%, primarily driven by continued lower activity in digital marketing and recall.  
Our Resources segment had 10% organic decline, which is comprised of a 9% recurring decline and 20% nonrecurring decline. Q1 organic ACV decreased by $7 million in the quarter, and our trailing 12-month organic ACV is down 11% as we have largely cycled through our subscription renewals since the North American energy market was severely impacted at the end of Q1 last year.  
Our CMS segment had 1% organic decline, including 2% increased recurring and a decline of 25% nonrecurring.  
Moving now to profits and margins.  Adjusted EBITDA was $467 million, up $35 million versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8%, with a margin of 41.7%, up 180 basis points.  
Moving on to our segments. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $233 million, with a margin of 48.1%, up 100 basis points. Financial Services margin was driven by strong revenue growth, while supporting continued investment.  
Transportation's adjusted EBITDA was $147 million, with a margin of 47.1%, up 740 basis points. We do expect margins to moderate to -- in forward quarters as we see more expense tied to revenue growth.  
Resources adjusted EBITDA was $74 million, with a margin of 36.6%, a decrease of 340 basis points as a result of lower revenue.  
CMS adjusted EBITDA was $26 million, with a margin of 21.5%, down 250 basis points. This quarter decrease was primarily driven by mix shift, which we expect to improve during the year.  
Adjusted EPS was $0.71 per diluted share, an increase of 8%. Our GAAP tax rate was 17%, and our adjusted tax rate was 20%. Q1 free cash flow was $172 million. As a reminder, Q1 is seasonally our lowest free cash flow quarter.  
Turning to the balance sheet.  Our Q1 ending debt balance was $5.1 billion, and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7x on a bank covenant basis and 2.6x net of cash. We closed the quarter with $172 million of cash, and our Q1 undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1.022 billion. Our Q1 weighted average diluted share count was 401 million shares. As we mentioned in Q4, the merger agreement with S&P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares. And therefore, our share repurchase program is currently suspended, other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share-based compensation.  
Moving to guidance.  We had a great start to the year, and now expect to deliver results in the upper half of our 2021 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, which include the following: revenue of $4.535 billion to $4.635 billion, with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, including recurring organic growth of 6% to 7%; adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.03 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 100 basis points when adjusted for FX; an adjusted EPS of $3.11 to $3.16. Finally, we expect cash conversion in the mid-60s as we lap our 2020 one-time cash impacts.  
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance."

And similarly, in some of the loans markets, we've seen strength as well. 
So we feel pretty good about the core businesses. They continue to grow at the rates that we've targeted, in some cases, towards the higher ends of those targets. With the addition of strong capital markets, that gives us the opportunity to deliver a double-digit quarter like we did here.

Okay. No. That's a great question, Manav.  
So the first off, I guess when you look at the agenda for CERAWeek, you see a strong formation of discussion in plenaries around energy transition, which is a step away from the big discussion around climate change. And when you think about how the world is responding now with the new Biden administration, with the COP26 coming up, real strong support for the 1.5 degree pathway. 
And I think that positions IHS Markit's Energy team very, very well for the energy transition associated growth that's going to come as the industrial participants start to shift gears and look for how they might participate in their businesses with respect to energy transition.  
That being said, it was pretty clear from the CERAWeek discussions that 100 million barrels a day is still a level of demand post COVID that is in the crosshairs of what needs to be supplied. And therefore, our Upstream business will need to continue to support and play an important role in the provision of the fossil fuels needed as the world is transitioning towards 2050.  
So I think we win both ways: a thought leadership, a player in the upstream to support the required supply and a team that's working very hard to transition itself through the solar, wind, hydrogen storage solutions and a variety of other activities that are expected to decarbonize our world.  
So I think we're doing a good job. I think CERAWeek, to me, really sung a story of energy transition stronger than it ever has. And I think we're well positioned to get the new growth and to maintain our contracts that we've managed through 2020 to longer term and a bit lower price. And so we'll see the slightly negative impact through this year. And I'd expect a mid-single-digit growth as we go into '22.  
Brian, do you want to add to that at all?"

And I really would refer you back to when Lance and Doug talked about it in the merger. Those core areas that were identified upfront continue to be the core areas of opportunity, whether it's in bringing together multi-asset class benchmarks in our index franchise; the scale of data assets that we can make available to customers and more efficient delivery to those customers; the combined ESG capabilities and assets of the business; the strong ability to play a role in private markets, an area growing quite rapidly; our deep knowledge of underlying company financials as well as the tools that are used by the private equity and private credit industry to manage their portfolios; and then, of course, a significant set of data and capabilities around credit and risk looking into the supply chain of customers. 
So all of the areas that were identified upfront, as we've gone through a more extended period of discovery, proven out to be quite significant opportunities for us forward.  I think in the coming months, the teams will update publicly our views on synergies. It's still early to do that. We're still in a regulatory approval period and still in a discovery phase.

What's driving it? I think it's the -- our core products, right? So if you look at the CARFAX offerings, if you look at the Mastermind offerings, or if you look at some of our core subscription products like supply chain and technology, all of these businesses are growing significantly and are showing kind of good resilience in the first quarter.  
On the digital marketing side, so what we're seeing is advertising spending is coming back relative to where it was 2 or 3 quarters ago. But it has not yet resumed to pre-COVID levels. Why is that? A couple of reasons, but one of the big ones is low inventories. The supply chain is still catching up and trying to rebuild inventory levels, in particular, in the North American market. And when inventories are low, advertising spend tends to be lower. And we're still seeing this in the industry today. And we will see subdued inventory levels for the next couple of quarters at least. And that's why advertising spend and digital marketing spend is still not quite where we would like it to be. 
We are seeing strength in the business. We are -- activities far higher than it was 2 quarters ago, so we expect digital marketing to be stronger as the year goes by."

We're also seeing some midsized vendors and some corporates who have been grappling with their own construct of a Data Lake, where they can leverage us as a technology platform to be able to not just provide them our data, but to provide them connectivity for their own and even distribution for their own.

And for a division like Transportation, that contribution has increased year after year over the past 5 years. New products and high-growth products are an increasing part of our kind of overall revenue growth. 
To give you an example, right, in concrete terms. And if you look at our Maritime & Trade business, it's always owned a number of incredibly valuable kind of legacy data assets. But over the past 3 years, it has repositioned essentially a data business into a solutions business targeting risk management workflows, trade compliance workflows, commodities analytics workflows and through this transformation, has become essentially a high single-digit growth business. A lot of these innovations have been enabled by the Data Lake and -- which strongly reduces the product development life cycle. So it's certainly a good innovation story there.

One, that it would give us efficiencies in terms of managing our own content, which we see through margin expansion. But secondly, that would give us opportunities for distribution, combination of data with customers and third parties, and give us a real competitive edge in our ability to sell and distribute our content. 
The piece that I think is additive to all that, that we're starting to learn about is more that there are significant numbers of larger customers who want to be able to interrogate large data sets to identify decision-making signals and decision points. And that's been leading us to some of the bigger quantitative hedge funds, but it also exists within the corporate world for analytics and analysis. So I think we're well on our way to gaining the efficiencies, and we're starting to see the revenue follow through as well. So a good story."

So the OEM customers last year had a slightly different cycle to the dealers in the sense that, in Q2, they were operating sort of more normally. But if you will, the COVID crisis really hit them in Q3, and they're still recovering from this. 
So today, they're doing much better. As you know, demand for vehicles is picking up significantly in the U.S. and globally in 2021, as is production. 
The one caveat I would bring is that the supply chain is still adjusting to this post-COVID world. So then some of those supply chain issues have been well documented, in particular the semiconductor shortages. And they have led us to revise our 2021 forecast down by 0.5 million vehicles. 
So that is a temporary kind of shock, but it is a shock nonetheless and it's slowing down the recovery of inventories in western markets. And there are some other challenges, right? 
So there was a bout of severe weather in the southern U.S. a few weeks ago. That has actually created a shortfall of chemical feedstocks. That's also impacting the supply chain. 
There was a fire last week in Japan in a major semiconductor plant. So all of these are sort of impacting our customers. But in the end, it's delaying the recovery, but the recovery is coming back. 
We're in a good place in the sense that we are supporting OEMs and suppliers with some of these secular structural transformations in the industry, and those are multiyear transformations. And our data and our solutions are critical to helping them. So slower recovery, but recovering nonetheless, and the outlook for the industry is positive."

Your business spans a number of end markets that are going through significant industry changes. You've talked about the energy transition. And also within Transportation, there seems to be a shift more towards technology long term. 
And I know you're providing companies with solutions to help them with these changes and shifting their strategies. 
I guess can you just talk about what this means within IHS? Is this -- does this mean selling different products to your existing customers as these changes take place? Do the traditional data sets become sort of less used, but new data sets receive more demand? And does this enable more upselling to existing customers, but also opportunities to get new customers, maybe technology players, et cetera, as these changes take place? So any color there would be helpful."
13651733,706133856,2305758,"IHS Markit Ltd., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 23, 2021",2021-03-23,"Earnings Calls","IHS Markit Ltd.","Executives","Okay. No. That's a good question and one that definitely encompasses our strategic vision.

No. That's a good question and one that definitely encompasses our strategic vision. And for all my team, they're very focused on the impact of the changing marketplaces around us that are being driven by either technology or a quest for decarbonization and, therefore, participating in a change in net zero world as we look forward. So you have to take those and go, ""Are we going to be able to participate and take revenue from that and adjust our business positively?"" Or, ""Are we going to find that we get disintermediated because some of the revenue streams will shrink?"" 
So our strategy is very, very clear. If you look in Transportation, you're seeing it right now in Maritime & Trade, and you see it in our strong Automotive recovery. And that is, is that, when you look at those revenue streams and you dig into them, you start to see how they're shifting their customer base to new solutions, new platforms and new decision-making tools. 
And within Automotive, we are an independent supplier of information that helps people make decisions. And the world -- the automotive world has gotten more complex. And it will continue to get more complex as we look forward given this drive towards net zero. So I feel like the information sets around automotive are very buoyant and participating in forecasting in good or bad markets is a good thing. 
The second thing I'd say is that Mastermind, when we acquired Mastermind, I think it was around $80 million of revenue. It's now running towards $120 million this year. And that's getting driven because Edouard and his team have taken the Mastermind platform, married it with Polk data, married it with CARFAX data, took full views for the OEMs. And the OEMs for the first time are saying, ""Geez, why do I want to provide a incentive that blankets the U.S.? Why don't I target market it right down the post codes or even right down the individuals?"" And that's where the Mastermind platform, which we call an enterprise mastermind, is adapting to this new digital world, and even a world where there's less dealerships and the car just lands in your driveway. So we want to participate in that, and the team is doing a great job shifting. 
There's some other ones in around Automotive, but I'll shift for a second. Maritime, there, the shift is the new services. It's supply chain. It's decarbonization. It's -- you've got all the maritime fleet information. All of your suppliers that are trying to be ESG compliant need to know what's the carbon footprint of the delivery of my goods. And so we're now producing a full carbon fleet analysis for our customers, and that's a growth area. It's being driven from the Data Lake. It's new technology. It's just old products adapting to new worlds and making sure we're participating. 
If you go over to Energy, I think we covered that. Energy, we're going to have to make sure that we maintain the Upstream, $250 million to $300 million of revenue. And the rest of the revenue, we're going to have to grow as the energy markets transition. 
And we're very well positioned. We do consulting around all those services. That's helpful. We know where the assets are, so that's helpful for global warming. We know where the pipelines are, the distribution. We have a lot of data that plays into the new world. And we're transitioning and growing our solar, wind, hydrogen, battery storage businesses. 
And this is a growth market. So it's going to be a top -- for the energy folks, this is going to be a year where it's tough because we gave discounts last year and they got to recover into next year. But I think that by the time they get to '22, they might be the darlings again in the company, and you'll see somebody else on their back. 
And then Financial Services, I think we're in all the right growth markets. So there, I feel good about it. 
And I don't want to leave CMS out because, sometimes, we do. But RootMetrics, which is small, I know, but they're into 5G, and 5G is important. And if you go over to the CMS product design folks, their pipeline is all about digital transformation and focusing on the vast amounts of specs and standards that need to be added together to in-house documentation for engineers to make decisions. And we're playing that game with our digital platform. And we've got a great pipeline because we can save people money. 
So net-net, I think, for great -- great people, a great company, we're well positioned to get our share. The question always is, is IHS Markit, now S&P Global, will they get their share of the growth in TAMs that are substantive? And my bet is, yes, of course, they will. They're filled with great people and great customers. And therefore, there's lots to do."

So instead of 4,000 or 5,000 physical conference seats, you can have tens of thousands of virtual seats. 
People are willing to pay for top-quality content and access to the right audience, and we had all the right audience. We had top government officials, new U.S. Energy Minister, John Kerry, in his new climate envoy role. We had Bill Gates. We had heads of pharmaceutical companies. We had technology. Big sessions on hydrogen. 
It really was impressive, and we'll see that growth come into our next quarter. And it was -- all I can say is the team was well ahead of their plan and impressed all of us in all 3 events, and we'll give you those numbers next quarter.

We made an investment in one of the world-class fund admins in -- that support the alternative space.

IHS Markit, now S&P Global, Adam's teams are investing with PIMCO, Man Group, McKinsey, Microsoft and others around a product called HUB, which they'll ultimately consolidate back into their Solutions businesses. That's all about new technology and efficiencies for asset managers. So yes, continued investment. 
When you get over into the automotive world, I mentioned already the enterprise mastermind, which is the broader OEM platform. That's been an investment through COVID. CMS has been investing in the digitization of their business. And all of these lead me to the upper half of our growth range if executed well. Hey, I was really pleased. I've never seen a 10% quarter probably since 2014 or somewhere before that. So to see a 10% quarter in FI, it's things coming back that -- it's your normal businesses performing at 5%, 6% growth range, but then your new investment areas, which are big into solutions, are performing at above their ranges. And that sometimes is volume, but in this case, it's a lot of the new product development and the hard work the teams have been doing. 
I think in Energy, it speaks for itself. It's renewables. It's -- we acquired the agriculture business. Ag and decarbonization, they all kind of go hand-in-hand, land use in this new world that we head into. And I think the teams are investing. They're adding people. They're investing in their businesses. And we only -- we give 100 basis points margin, but there's more than enough opportunity through the revenue side and cost management for us to create investment dollars.

Thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 earnings call. We had another very strong quarter. Q2 revenue was $1.18 billion, with organic growth of 13%. Adjusted EBITDA of $517 million and margin of 43.8%, up 30 basis points year-over-",753,"Thank you, Eric. Thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 earnings call. We had another very strong quarter. Q2 revenue was $1.18 billion, with organic growth of 13%. Adjusted EBITDA of $517 million and margin of 43.8%, up 30 basis points year-over-year, FX adjusted and up 80 basis points now year-to-date. Adjusted EPS up 0.81 or $0.81, up 17% over the prior year. So overall, we're pleased with the first half of our year, which puts us in an excellent position to raise our full year guidance today. 
In terms of core industry verticals, let me first start with our Financial Services segment, which had another strong quarter, with 9% organic growth in Q2. Within the division, Information performed solidly with an organic growth of 5%. -- contributors included increased demand for our pricing, reference data and valuations offerings as well as continued growth in our equities regulatory reporting and trade and analytics platforms. 
Solutions had an excellent quarter with 15% organic growth and they continue to benefit from robust market activity in equities and loan markets, combined with a broad-based rebound of investment for customers in our software solutions and our corporate actions and regulatory and compliance offerings. 
Finally, our Processing business grew 6% organically, strength in loans and derivatives performance as expected. For the full year, we still expect Financial Services to be in the 7% to 8% organic growth range. 
Now moving on to Transportation, which had organic revenue growth of 39% in Q2. Now you'll recall that the basis for comparison, the second quarter of 2020 was depressed by significant pricing concessions that we granted our customers at the height of the COVID-related lockdowns as well as by particularly challenging trading conditions in the automotive market. However, there is more to this quarter than a low comparison. 
I'm pleased to say that this quarter's performance also reflected strong underlying organic growth right across the Transportation businesses. Our dealer businesses, that includes CARFAX and Mastermind, are once again experiencing rapid growth. In a retail environment that's marked by a shortage of inventory, both used and new and by rapidly escalating used car prices, our products are critical to helping dealers acquire and sell more cars at the right price in the right time. 
Demand for our predictive solutions, volumes planning, powertrain emissions compliance supply chain and technology are all accelerating as the industry grapples with multiple supply chain disruptions and as it faces major strategic decisions related to the technology mega trends. Those include the connected car, autonomous driving and electrification. 
Our marketing audience and measurement business is rapidly expanding its footprint with automotive market tiers. And recently, we announced a wide-ranging partnership with Nielsen, which we are very excited about. 
And finally, our Maritime & Trade business continued to deliver strong performance. This has been the result of a very focused product strategy and disciplined execution over multiple quarters. We also hosted a successful virtual TPM conference in March. 
So for the full year, we now expect Transportation organic growth to be higher in the 14% to 16% range, which is up from our previously noted 13% to 15% range. This represents a healthy underlying high single-digit growth rate, excluding the favorable year-over-year comparison due to the pandemic. 
Moving on to Resources, where organic growth was flat in Q2. Our Resources business performance was as expected, with recurring revenue consistent with Q1 and and nonrecurring revenue benefiting from the return of both CERAWeek and the World Petrochemical conferences. 
As expected, our ECB experienced slight positive growth in Q2, which we believe should accelerate in the back half, providing a stronger foundation for our 2022 recurring revenue. Our Downstream organic revenue growth performed as expected and should accelerate throughout the rest of the year. Downstream is now 50% of the overall division and Upstream 50%, that's a 10% shift year-over-year. 
In 2021, we continue to expect organic revenue results within Resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in the low single digits as Upstream improves and Downstream continues its growth trajectory. 
Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was in line with our expectations of 1% for the quarter. We expect improving results continuing across CMS throughout the year. For the full year, we expect CMS to deliver mid-single-digit organic growth. 
The only update we have on the merger is what S&P Global recently disclosed that we expect the deal to now close in calendar Q4. And now I'll turn the call over to Jonathan."

Organic growth in the quarter was 13%, which included the current organic growth of 10% and nonrecurring organic growth of 41%.  
This increase was driven by strong underlying growth in Financial Services and Transportation as well as benefiting from favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the impact of COVID on some of our Transportation and Resources businesses. 
Moving on to segment performance. Our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 9%, including 7% recurring in the quarter. Solutions, in particular, had strong performance, delivering 15% organic growth, primarily from strength in capital market issuances and corporate actions and compliant offerings, while Information had 5% growth driven by pricing and valuations in our equities, regulatory reporting and trading analytics platforms. 
Processing had a 6% organic increase driven by volumes primarily in loans. Our Transportation segment delivered organic growth of 39% in the quarter. This included growth of 38% recurring as Q2 continued to have strong growth within our CARFAX and automotiveMastermind businesses and accelerated growth within our Maritime & Trade business. 
Nonrecurring revenue increased by 41%, primarily driven by strong performance in CARFAX, consumer and dealer transactions, core automotive insights and maritime and trade events. Our Resources segment remained flat, which is comprised of an 8% recurring decline and 73% nonrecurring increase. 
Q2 organic ACV increased by $2 million in the quarter and our trailing 12-month organic ACV is down 8% as we have now cycled through our subscription renewals since the North American energy market was severely impacted at the end of Q1 last year. 
We have great success with our entirely virtual CERAWeek and World Petrochem Conferences, and we continue to see strong demand in our downstream businesses, particularly in our products and services that support energy transition and energy market supply chains. Our CMS segment had 1% organic growth, including 2% recurring and a decrease of 10% nonrecurring. 
Moving now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA was $517 million, up $63 million versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% and with a margin of 43.8%, down 40 basis points and up 30 basis points FX adjusted. 
Moving to our segments. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $238 million with a margin of 48.2%, down 320 bps FX adjusted. Financial Services margins reflects a return to more normal margin levels post-COVID. 
Transportation's adjusted EBITDA was $171 million with a margin of 49.6%, up 870 bps FX adjusted. We do expect margins to moderate in forward quarters as we see more expense tied to revenue growth. Resources adjusted EBITDA was $91 million with a margin of 41.4%, a decrease of 210 bps FX adjusted as a result of lower revenue. 
CMS adjusted EBITDA was $29 million with a margin of 23.3%, down 520 bps FX adjusted. This quarter's decrease was driven primarily by the return to more normal margins compared to the prior year in addition to a mix shift. We do expect margins to continue to improve in the back half of the year. 
Moving now to net income and EPS. Net income was $159 million, and GAAP EPS was $0.40. Adjusted EPS was $0.81, an increase of 17% over prior year. Our GAAP tax rate was 26%, and our adjusted tax rate was 20%. Q2 free cash flow was $301 million and our trailing 12-month free cash flow conversion has increased to 56%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our Q2 ending debt balance was $5.0 billion, and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.6x on a bank covenant basis and 2.5x net of cash. We closed the quarter with $217 million of cash and our Q2 undrawn revolver balance was approximately $917 million. 
In the quarter, we paid off our $250 million 364-day term loan. Our Q2 weighted average diluted share count was 400.7 million shares. As we mentioned in Q4, the merger agreement with S&P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares and therefore, our share repurchase program is currently suspended other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share-based compensation. 
Moving to guidance. We had a strong first half of the year and are adjusting and raising our guidance ranges. We are raising revenue guidance to $4.635 billion to $4.675 billion with organic growth of 7% to 8%. Approximately $30 million of this increase is due to changes in FX rates, which are benefiting revenue, negative to margin percentage but neutral to adjusted EBITDA. 
Adjusted EBITDA is being raised $2.02 billion to $2.03 billion with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points adjusted for FX. Adjusted EPS is being increased to $3.15 to $3.17 per share. Finally, we expect cash conversion in the mid-60s as we lap our 2020 onetime cash impacts. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance."

The team has done an amazing job that comes down with nonrecurring revenue. And if you take the overall quarter '19 to '21, it's high single digits, and that's right in line if you look back to '18, '19, et cetera. So my view is the teams recovered. They've done the maximum they can. They've innovated into new products. They worked virtually well. I really think it's been a stellar performance for them.

Thanks, Kevin, for the question. And just to build on what Lance said, good callout on the inventories. So the industry is still in a process of recovery. And you're right, in this current environment, both dealers and carmakers have less of a need to spend on marketing. And that does create a headwind to some of our products. 
On the other hand, I would say that dealers in particular, are currently seeing higher margins than they have ever recorded. And when our customers do well, that's obviously a good thing for us. So you sort of have a balance of headwinds and tailwinds. But the takeaway for me is that and must environ most like today's auto industry, I think we're showing that our products are critical, must-have products that are helping dealers and carmakers sell more cars. And also in the case of dealers acquire used cars in a really tough and a used car market. So that's a big deal for us. and I'm really happy with how the business has been performing in response."

I think S&P has done a great job working with my teams on premerger planning. And because we probably had an extra 3 to 4 months, they really have rolled up their sleeves and just went deeper. 
The other thing you should know is we don't have that much of employee morale issues because our energy team is completely different. You know, the Platts overlap is going to create a sale that's been announced. So even within Opus, people are excited about the fact that they'll be doing something new again. So that's not an issue. There's no overlap with our Upstream and Downstream businesses into Platts really. The Financial Services, Adam is going to be leading that and it's an exciting integration given lots of opportunities. Automotive, transportation, no real for overlaps. Edouard is leading, so headwords leading that. Sally's leading alliances and building a new team across S&P. So I think the teams are all highly motivated. Where the overlap is, of course, in the services. And we did a really good job. Both firms have treated the employees very well through this merger period. And so we haven't had a lot of people at all leaving the firm. And I feel my teams have done an exceptional job and are still highly motivated. Jonathan has been leading the IMO from our side.

And in that process, I think a couple of things have come out. First, I think as we identified synergies at -- when we announced the deal, we take the last few quarters to really begin to certify exactly the path to CE those synergies. And I think we're increasing confidence on how to get there. And the second thing culturally to your question, has been a great opportunity for the team to really work with one another and get to know each other and get to know their future colleagues extremely well. And I think what's come out of it is certainly Lance and I know from our discussions in the fall is the values of the 2 terms are very, very similar.

So if you call last year Q2 call last year when we were entering COVID, we took some significant cost reductions. Some of those were permanent to those permanent savings have to being permanent. They haven't crept back in, but some were certainly temporary. There was impacts on executive salaries. A few other things we did, we pulled back on marketing spend, for example, in CARFAX given that the dealers have shut down in North America. And so those costs certainly built into our plan, into our guidance this year, those costs have been reverse. And so it does create, I'll call it, somewhat odd dynamic on the absolute margin of the segment level. transportation, for example, where we took significant cost reductions in Q2 of last year. see a significant year-on-year margin accretion, which a little bit of a false con, I would say you should see that normalize going forward. But those have been the main costs that have come back in. Then of course, we continue to invest in the business and where we see strong performance, make sure we're making investments to fund future growth.

So the fact is we've given you a very accurate picture for this year, flowed all the way through into earnings. Of course, we also feel that our strong mid- to upper single-digit revenue profile as a firm is 1 that's very intact, and we expect that to continue. And so I don't see us changing the percentage of revenue growth expected into '22, '23, '24.

Now what I would say, George, in terms of raising the guidance this time. Obviously, we're doing it on the back of what we saw in the first half of the year and what we're seeing going forward. I think at this point, we're not prepared to really give formal guidance for 2022 and will be back to our normal normal cadence.

So I think our combination is going to give us a competitive edge and give us a lot of opportunity to grow into. And I think across S&P Global and IHS Markit, this is a very strong double-digit growth engine for at least a decade because there's $1.5 trillion a year being spent on climate change now, and that number is expected to grow to something like $4.5 trillion.

And that we think should be a sustainable growth rate on our economic country risk that Adam mentioned, there's been some significant investments in terms of new products and new packaging around how we get much more a persona-based approach with our products there.

So it's a good -- it obviously is a good question because it's the one that's on the mind of all of our analysts. And I think what you should be really looking at is high single-digit growth for transportation, and it does that time and time again, in a very diversified way. And sometimes it's used car markets, sometimes it's new car markets. Sometimes, it's marketing and advertising; sometimes, it's supply chain and predictive analytics. And so when everything is ticking, we can peak into double digits. But in general, I look at transportation, say it's a strong high single-digit performer with ample opportunity in its markets to maintain that. And it's not reliant on new or used car sales alone, but many things that are actually needed by the automotive suppliers and the OEMs regardless of the environment we're in. So they all need to market for cars. They all need to spend their incentives. They all need to measure their own missions. They all need to order parts and and study the supply chains. They all need to do R&D and look into the future car, the connected car the electrification of vehicles. Next, it will be hydrogen. So there's always stuff to be done. Then we get on the dealer floor and the marriage of CARFAX and Mastermind and helping dealers sell cars in a connected digital world, those types of tools become even more important. And -- so I think you can expect more of the same in that high single-digit range for Transportation. But this is an outsized quarter that's catching up from a COVID period where really the comparison it's exciting to get to say, 39%. We actually teased the team that it was at 40% because it would have been a nicer number to shut out. But the fact is it's really a high single-digit consistent growth scenario where the teams recovered really well. I'll end there. I think that was our final question, operator."

Thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 earnings call. We had another very strong quarter. Q2 revenue was $1.18 billion, with organic growth of 13%; adjusted EBITDA of $517 million and margin of 43.8%, up 30 basis points year-over-",750,"Thank you, Eric. Thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 earnings call. We had another very strong quarter. Q2 revenue was $1.18 billion, with organic growth of 13%; adjusted EBITDA of $517 million and margin of 43.8%, up 30 basis points year-over-year FX adjusted, and up 80 basis points now year-to-date; adjusted EPS, up 0.81 or $0.81, up 17% over the prior year. So overall, we're pleased with the first half of our year, which puts us in an excellent position to raise our full year guidance today.
In terms of core industry verticals, let me first start with our Financial Services segment, which had another strong quarter, with 9% organic growth in Q2. Within the division, Information performed solidly with organic growth of 5%. Contributors included increased demand for our pricing, reference data and valuations offerings as well as continued growth in our equities regulatory reporting and trade and analytics platforms.
Solutions had an excellent quarter with 15% organic growth, and they continued to benefit from robust market activity in equities and loan markets, combined with a broad-based rebound of investment for customers in our software solutions and our corporate actions and regulatory and compliance offerings. Finally, our Processing business grew 6% organically, strength in loans and derivatives performance as expected. For the full year, we still expect Financial Services to be in the 7% to 8% organic growth range.
Now moving on to Transportation, which had organic revenue growth of 39% in Q2. Now you'll recall that the basis for comparison, the second quarter of 2020, was depressed by significant pricing concessions that we granted our customers at the height of the COVID-related lockdowns as well as by particularly challenging trading conditions in the automotive market. However, there is more to this quarter than a low comparison. I'm pleased to say that this quarter's performance also reflected strong underlying organic growth right across the Transportation businesses. 
Our dealer businesses, that includes CARFAX and Mastermind, are once again experiencing rapid growth. In a retail environment that's marked by a shortage of inventory, both used and new and by rapidly escalating used car prices, our products are critical to helping dealers acquire and sell more cars at the right price in the right time.
Demand for our predictive solutions, volumes planning, powertrain emissions compliance, supply chain and technology are all accelerating as the industry grapples with multiple supply chain disruptions and as it faces major strategic decisions related to the technology megatrends. Those include the connected car, autonomous driving and electrification.
Our marketing audience and measurements business is rapidly expanding its footprint with automotive market tiers. And recently, we announced a wide-ranging partnership with Nielsen, which we are very excited about.
And finally, our Maritime & Trade business continued to deliver strong performance. This has been the result of a very focused product strategy and disciplined execution over multiple quarters. We also hosted a successful virtual TPM conference in March.
So for the full year, we now expect Transportation organic growth to be higher and in the 14% to 16% range, which is up from our previously noted 13% to 15% range. This represents a healthy underlying high single-digit growth rate, excluding the favorable year-over-year comparison due to the pandemic. 
Moving on to Resources, where organic growth was flat in Q2. Our Resources business performance was as expected, with recurring revenue consistent with Q1 and nonrecurring revenue benefiting from the return of both CERAWeek and the World Petrochemical conferences.
As expected, our ECB experienced slight positive growth in Q2, which we believe should accelerate in the back half, providing a stronger foundation for our 2022 recurring revenue. Our Downstream organic revenue growth performed as expected and should accelerate throughout the rest of the year. Downstream is now 50% of the overall division and Upstream 50%, that's a 10% shift year-over-year.
In 2021, we continue to expect organic revenue results within Resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in the low single digits as Upstream improves and Downstream continues its growth trajectory.
Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was in line with our expectations of 1% for the quarter. We expect improving results continuing across CMS throughout the year. For the full year, we expect CMS to deliver mid-single-digit organic growth. 
The only update we have on the merger is what S&P Global recently disclosed, that we expect the deal to now close in calendar Q4. And now I'll turn the call over to Jonathan."

Q2 highlights included revenue organic growth of 13%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 14%. GAAP net income and EPS both had growth of 122%, and adjusted EPS had a growth of 17% year-over-year. Regarding revenue, our Q2 revenue was $1.18",845,"Great. Thank you, Lance. Q2 highlights included revenue organic growth of 13%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 14%. GAAP net income and EPS both had growth of 122%, and adjusted EPS had a growth of 17% year-over-year. Regarding revenue, our Q2 revenue was $1.18 billion, with total growth of 15%. 
Organic growth in the quarter was 13%, which included recurring organic growth of 10% and nonrecurring organic growth of 41%. This increase was driven by strong underlying growth in Financial Services and Transportation as well as benefiting from favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the impact of COVID on some of our Transportation and Resources businesses.
Moving on to segment performance. Our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 9%, including 7% recurring in the quarter. Solutions, in particular, had strong performance, delivering 15% organic growth, primarily from strength in capital market issuances, corporate actions and reg and compliant offerings, while Information had 5% growth driven by pricing and valuations in our equities, regulatory reporting and trading analytics platforms. Processing had a 6% organic increase driven by volumes, primarily in loans. 
Our Transportation segment delivered organic growth of 39% in the quarter. This included growth of 38% recurring as Q2 continued to have strong growth within our CARFAX and automotiveMastermind businesses and accelerated growth within our Maritime & Trade business.
Nonrecurring revenue increased by 41%, primarily driven by strong performance in CARFAX, consumer and dealer transactions, core automotive insights and Maritime & Trade events. 
Our Resources segment remained flat, which is comprised of an 8% recurring decline and 73% nonrecurring increase. Q2 organic ACV increased by $2 million in the quarter and our trailing 12-month organic ACV is down 8% as we have now cycled through our subscription renewals since the North American energy market was severely impacted at the end of Q1 last year.
We had great success with our entirely virtual CERAWeek and World Petrochem conferences, and we continue to see strong demand in our Downstream businesses, particularly in our products and services that support energy transition and energy market supply chains. Our CMS segment had 1% organic growth, including 2% recurring and a decrease of 10% nonrecurring.
Moving now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA was $517 million, up $63 million versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% and with a margin of 43.8%, down 40 basis points and up 30 basis points FX adjusted.
Moving to our segments. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $238 million with a margin of 48.2%, down 320 bps FX adjusted. Financial Services margins reflects a return to more normal margin levels post-COVID. 
Transportation's adjusted EBITDA was $171 million with a margin of 49.6%, up 870 bps FX adjusted. We do expect margins to moderate in forward quarters as we see more expense tied to revenue growth. Resources adjusted EBITDA was $91 million with a margin of 41.4%, a decrease of 210 bps FX adjusted as a result of lower revenue.
CMS adjusted EBITDA was $29 million with a margin of 23.3%, down 520 bps FX adjusted. This quarter's decrease was driven primarily by the return to more normal margins compared to the prior year in addition to a mix shift. We do expect margins to continue to improve in the back half of the year. 
Moving now to net income and EPS. Net income was $159 million, and GAAP EPS was $0.40. Adjusted EPS was $0.81, an increase of 17% over prior year. Our GAAP tax rate was 26%, and our adjusted tax rate was 20%. Q2 free cash flow was $301 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow conversion has increased to 56%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our Q2 ending debt balance was $5.0 billion, and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.6x on a bank covenant basis and 2.5x net of cash. We closed the quarter with $217 million of cash, and our Q2 undrawn revolver balance was approximately $917 million. In the quarter, we paid off our $250 million 364-day term loan. 
Our Q2 weighted average diluted share count was 400.7 million shares. As we mentioned in Q4, the merger agreement with S&P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares and, therefore, our share repurchase program is currently suspended other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share-based compensation. 
Moving to guidance. We had a strong first half of the year and are adjusting and raising our guidance ranges. We are raising revenue guidance to $4.635 billion to $4.675 billion with organic growth of 7% to 8%. Approximately $30 million of this increase is due to changes in FX rates, which are benefiting revenue, negative to margin percentage but neutral to adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted EBITDA is being raised to $2.02 billion to $2.03 billion with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points adjusted for FX. Adjusted EPS is being increased to $3.15 to $3.17 per share. Finally, we expect cash conversion in the mid-60s as we lap our 2020 onetime cash impacts. 
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance."

If you took out 2020, what you really want to look at is recurring revenue growth '19 to '21 and that's a mid- to upper teens number. So that's the blow away number from my perspective. The team has done an amazing job. 
That comes down with nonrecurring revenue. And if you take the overall quarter '19 to '21, it's high single digits, and that's right in line if you look back to '18, '19, et cetera. So my view is the teams recovered. They've done the maximum they can. They've innovated into new products. They worked virtually well. I really think it's been a stellar performance for them. 
But Edouard, do you want to add a little bit to that in terms of just your own color on the numbers?"

Thanks, Kevin, for the question. And just to build on what Lance said, good callout on the inventories. So the industry is still in a process of recovery. And you're right, in this current environment, both dealers and carmakers have less of a need to spend on marketing. And that does create a headwind for some of our products. 
On the other hand, I would say that dealers in particular, are currently seeing higher margins than they have ever recorded. And when our customers do well, that's obviously a good thing for us. So you sort of have a balance here of headwinds and tailwinds. 
But the takeaway for me is that even in marked environments, like today's auto industry, I think we're showing that our products are critical, must-have products that are helping dealers and carmakers sell more cars. And also in the case of dealers, acquire used cars in a really tough end of used car market. So that's a big deal for us, and I'm really happy with how the business has been performing in response."

A heavy issuance market, like we saw in Q1 in particular, that started to moderate a bit into Q2. It gives us some amount of lift. But across the portfolio, the core is really the strength in our pricing, our valuations, continued growth and demand for those products. And as Lance mentioned, our Solutions, we made a significant investment over the last couple of years. And we're winning some pretty significant mandates, and that's fueling growth. I think that will be an area of continued growth for us, certainly over the midterm."

But also building that data set into work flow for carmakers, such as dealer network optimization, dealer network design. So an exciting opportunity for us. 
We see connected car data has being a critical source for us in the future. Right now, availability is limited. Coverage is very light, and there are still some significant question marks around access to VIN-level data, who owns that data which will have to play out over the next 2 or 3 years.

Like anything, we worry that over time, you can get merger fatigue, but we haven't noticed that at all. I think S&P has done a great job working with my teams on premerger planning. And because we probably had an extra 3 to 4 months, they really have rolled up their sleeves and just went deeper.
The other thing you should know is we don't have that much of employee morale issues because our energy team is completely different. You know, the Platts overlap is going to create a sale that's been announced. So even within Opus, people are excited about the fact that they'd be doing something new again. So that's not an issue. There's no overlap with our Upstream and Downstream businesses into Platts really. 
The Financial Services, Adam is going to be leading that, and it's an exciting integration given lots of opportunities. Automotive, Transportation, no real need for overlaps. So Edouard is leading that. Sally's leading alliances and building a new team across S&P. So I think the teams are all highly motivated. 
Where the overlap is, of course, in the services. And we did a really good job. Both firms have treated the employees very well through this merger period. And so we haven't had a lot of people at all leaving the firm. And I feel my teams have done an exceptional job and are still highly motivated. Jonathan has been leading the IMO from our side, so maybe you can add a little bit additional color to that."

And teams are being stood up across all the different functions, all the different areas, of course, being careful not to jump the gun, but really get ahead on the integration planning. 
And in that process, I think a couple of things have come out. First, I think as we identified synergies at -- when we announced the deal, we take the last few quarters to really begin to certify exactly the path to achieve those synergies. And I think we're increasing confidence on how to get there. 
And the second thing, culturally, to your question, it's been a great opportunity for the teams to really work with one another and get to know each other and get to know their future colleagues extremely well. And I think what's come out of it is, certainly, Lance and I knew from our discussions in the fall, is the values of the 2 firms are very, very similar. And I think as the 2 teams have gotten to know each other, it's been relieving, if you will, for them to get to know that their colleagues they're going to be working with are people that they want to work with. So it's been -- we're making great progress, both culturally as well as the integration planning. And we should be well set up when we close."

So if you recall last year at Q2 call last year, when we were entering COVID, we took some significant cost reductions. Some of those were permanent, and those permanent cost savings have indeed been permanent. They haven't crept back in. But some were certainly temporary. There was impacts on executive salaries, a few other things we did. We pulled back on marketing spend, for example, in CARFAX, given that the dealers have shut down in North America. 
And so those costs, we certainly built it into our plan, into our guidance this year. Those costs have been reversed. And so it does create a, I'll call it, somewhat odd dynamic on the absolute margin at the segment level. Where in Transportation, for example, where we took significant cost reductions in Q2 of last year, you see a significant year-on-year margin accretion, which is a little bit of a false economy, I would say. You should see that normalize going forward. But those have been the main costs that have come back in. 
Then of course, we continued to invest in the business, and where we see strong performance, make sure we're making investments to fund future growth. But the key thing I will call out is really you're seeing the year-on-year reversal of some of those temporary cost reductions from last year."

Of course, we also feel that our strong mid- to upper single-digit revenue profile as a firm is one that's very intact, and we expect that to continue. And so I don't see us changing the percentage of revenue growth expected into '22, '23, '24. But that's not to say that as we go into those years, if we have a strong first, second quarter, we don't have any issue with raising our view forward. And we'd love to beat our guidance.

I think at this point, we're not prepared to really give formal guidance for 2022. And we'll be back to our normal cadence. Obviously, we'd much rather be in a position of strength exiting the year than a position of weakness.

Climate analytics, we have data that plays into climate analytics, so location data around energy assets. Our Maritime & Trade group have very detailed supply chain footprints for all the maritime fleet. We have some great new products and services that play into research and development around E. So I think we have a competitive edge as IHS Markit in E.
When you marry that with S&P Global, I actually think the combination gets even stronger. And they do have the RobecoSAM, Trucost and other assets that are very, very valuable in terms of competing with the likes of MSCI, FTSE, the LSE group, various of ESG ratings and scores that are much more driven off the public knowledge, S and G versus the E. So I think our combination is going to give us a competitive edge and give us a lot of opportunity to grow into. 
And I think across S&P Global and IHS Markit, this is a very strong, double-digit growth engine for at least a decade. Because there's $1.5 trillion a year being spent on climate change now, and that number is expected to grow to something like $4.5 trillion.

And I think what you should be really looking at is high single-digit growth for Transportation, and it does that time and time again in a very diversified way. And sometimes it's used car markets, sometimes it's new car markets. Sometimes, it's marketing and advertising; sometimes, it's supply chain and predictive analytics. And so when everything is ticking, we can peak into double digits. 
But in general, I look at Transportation, say it's a strong high single-digit performer with ample opportunity in its markets to maintain that. And it's not reliant on new or used car sales alone, but many things that are actually needed by the automotive suppliers and the OEMs regardless of the environment we're in. So they all need to market for cars. They all need to spend their incentives. They all need to measure their emissions. They all need to order parts and study the supply chains. They all need to do R&D and look into the future car, the connected car, the electrification of vehicles. Next, it will be hydrogen. So there's always stuff to be done. 
Then we get on the dealer floor and the marriage of CARFAX and Mastermind and helping dealers sell cars in a connected digital world. So those types of tools become even more important. And -- so I think you can expect more of the same in that high single-digit range for Transportation. 
But this is an outsized quarter that's catching up from a COVID period where really the comparison, it's exciting to get to say, 39%. We actually teased the team that it was at 40% because it would have been a nicer number to shut out. But the fact is it's really a high single-digit, consistent growth scenario where the teams recovered really well. I'll end there. I think that was our final question, operator."

We're definitely not ahead of schedule. But what I really like is the continued shift to a division that's highly diversified, like Financial Services, like Transportation, where we've got strong diversification across many facets of global economies that are dealing with energy transition, new sources of energy, circular economy and demands, waste. This division is, with its expertise in chemicals to agricultural business. The continued need for 90 million, 100 million barrels a day of oil. Oil prices at $70, when it wasn't long ago, they were sub-$50. 
So this team is always in thought leadership in center stage. And yes, we've had -- it's been one of the toughest divisions as we've come out of -- had to go through COVID. But we're back to a expected probably low to mid-single-digit growth year in '22 for Energy. And if '22 could be the first year where you've got CMS, you've got Energy in the mid-single digits, and you've got Transportation and Financial Services in high single digits, that's kind of -- that's the home run. And we're going to deliver this firm very strong into the S&P Global strategic merger.
I think that might be the final question, but let me know, operator."

And then you go to Upstream, and if you really want to be tough on Upstream, you could say it's flat, and that's your low single digits. Upstream, recovering though off of the price concessions, et cetera, to be low to mid-single digits, puts the whole division at 5% to 7%. And so I don't think it's a tall order to see those types of revenue growth in 2022, and we're well set up for that. 
And the demand around just understanding energy-related assets in a world of -- driven by regulatory change, climate change, investor perceptions and demands, I actually think our team's roles to help energy market participants navigate these forward challenges, I think there's a lot of growth. We saw it. CERAWeek virtually, I was shocked at the turnout and the needs of the teams to engage market participants in thought leadership. We saw the same in the World Petrochemical Conference and our Maritime & Trade, which is more around supply chain and the trade analytics. 
So I really -- yes, I guess I just -- I'm not a crazy optimist, but I think that when we say mid single digits, we mean it. And I think that Brian and the team have navigated COVID very well. But it was tough. It was the toughest division to run from a strategic point of view through this challenging period. It just had the most moving parts and the team, I have to say, they don't have the highest results. But for me, I'd give them a badge of honor. So great job.

Thank you, Eric, and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 Earnings Call. We had another very strong quarter.

Thank you, Eric, and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 Earnings Call. We had another very strong quarter. Q3 revenue was $1.18 billion with organic growth of 9%, adjusted EBITDA of $516 million, with margin of 43.7%, puts us on track for the full year margin expansion of 100 basis points excluding FX. Adjusted EPS of $0.85 will be up 10% over the prior year. 
Overall, we are very happy with our Q3 and year-to-date results and we're raising our full year underlying revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. 
In terms of industry verticals, let me first start with our Financial Services segment, which had another strong quarter with 8% organic growth in Q3. 
Within Financial Services, information performed well, with organic growth of 6% and the main price -- the main contributors of this included pricing valuations, equities regulatory reporting and trading analytics platforms and our Issuer Solutions products due to strong IPO markets and the momentum in ESG initiatives. 
Solutions also had a strong quarter, with 9% organic growth and similar trends, which we saw in Q2 due to the strong market activity in equities and loans as well as the continued broad-based rebound of the investments being made by our customers and solutions. 
This strength was accelerated by our new offerings and enhancements across the solutions portfolio. Finally, our processing business grew 12% organically with strengths in loans and derivatives performance as expected. For the full year, we still expect Financial Services to be in the 7% to 8% organic growth range. 
Let's move on to Transportation, which had organic revenue growth of 15% in Q3. You'll recall that the basis for comparison, the third quarter of 2020 was depressed by significant pricing concessions that we granted our customers at the height of the COVID-related lockdowns. But like Q2, this quarter's performance also reflected strong underlying growth across the transportation businesses. Our renewal performance was strong across the board demonstrating the must-have nature of our products in the current challenging market environments. 
For example, CARFAX for Life has now established itself as a critical and innovative service loyalty solution for dealers. At a time when driving higher levels of service lane activity is key to offsetting the lower levels of new car sales. 
Another example is the strong performance of our forecasting solutions as the industry grapples with the largest supply chain shock that has ever experienced. However, over the past 2 months, we have also seen the escalating supply chain crisis lead to further production cuts. And as a result of shortage of cars on dealer lots, we are seeing a temporary slowdown in sales and products that support OEM and dealer and sales and marketing. We remain very confident in the outlook for these products as inventory levels begin to recover, but overall, another great quarter for our auto businesses, which demonstrates the importance of our services to the industries. 
Our Maritime & Trade business continued to perform well, driven by momentum of our innovative risk and compliance solutions and by our growing footprint in the financial sector. I'm very pleased to see our new product investments over the past several years continuing to pay off. 
For the full year, we expect transportation organic growth to be in the 14% to 16% range. This represents a healthy underlying high single-digit growth rate, excluding the favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the pandemic. 
Let's move on to Resources, where organic decline was a modest 1% in Q3 and as expected. Recurring revenue improved sequentially across our businesses and nonrecurring revenue benefited from increased demand for consulting services and our software businesses. As expected, our ACV experienced continued positive growth in Q3, which we believe should continue in Q4, providing a strong foundation for our 2022 recurring revenue. Our downstream organic revenue growth was very strong in the quarter, and we expect this to continue into Q4 as we help our customers navigate global supply chain disruptions in many markets. 
In 2021, we continue to expect organic revenue results within resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in the low single digits. As the upstream improves, and strong growth in downstream continues. 
Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was strong at 11% and 5% and normalized for the BPVC and particularly, ECR was very strong and is benefiting from increased consulting services as a result of uncertainty due to global supply chain disruptions. For the full year, we still expect CMS to deliver mid-single-digit organic growth. There were 2 strategic initiatives announced in the quarter. We completed the formation of the OSA JV, which includes our MarkitSERV and CME's optimization businesses. We also signed a purchase agreement for the divestiture of OPIS commensurate with the close of the merger with S&P Global. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Jonathan."

Q3 highlights included revenue organic growth of 9%, which is 8% normalized PPPC, adjusted EBITDA growth of 6%, GAAP net income declined 2% and declined 2%, while adjusted EPS had growth of 10% year-over-year. 
Regarding our revenue, our Q3 revenue was $1.18 billion, with total growth of 10%. Organic growth in the quarter was 9%, which included recurring organic growth of 7% and nonrecurring organic growth of 20%. Normalized for PBC total company organic growth is 8% and nonrecurring is 14%. This increase was driven by continued strong underlying growth in Financial services and Transportation as well as benefiting from favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the impact of COVID primarily in our dealer-facing Transportation businesses. 
Moving on to segment performance. Our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 8%, including 7% recurring in the quarter. Overall strength was anchored by strong market activities in equities loans and the continued rebound of investment by our customers. Solutions had strong organic growth performance, delivering 9%. Information grew 6% and processing grew 12%. 
Our Transportation segment delivered organic growth of 15% in the quarter. This included growth of 17% recurring as Q3 continued to have strong growth within our CARFAX and automotiveMastermind businesses and accelerating growth within our Maritime & Trade business. Nonrecurring revenue increased by 8% primarily driven by strong performance in car fast consumer and dealer transactions and within our core automotive insights. Our Resources segment declined by 1%, which is comprised of a 4% recurring line and 30% nonrecurring increase. Q3 organic ACV increased by $7 million in the quarter, and our trailing 12-month organic ACV is down 3%. However, we are seeing strong underlying trends in our upstream pipeline, especially in North America, as we expect CapEx spend to begin to rebound in 2022. 
We continue to see strong demand in our downstream businesses, particularly in our products and services that support energy transition and energy market supply chains. Our CMS segment had 11% organic growth, including 5% recurring and an increase of 76% nonrecurring. 
Normalized for PPPC, total CMS organic growth is 5%, which includes nonrecurring organic growth of 14%. 
Moving now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA was $516 million, up $29 million versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6% with a margin of 43.7%, down 160 basis points and down 110 basis points FX adjusted. 
As a reminder, the margin percentages for the full company and segments were impacted because 2020 margins benefited significantly due to temporary COVID-related cost actions. 
Moving to our segments. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA margin of 49.2%, down 90 basis points FX adjusted. Transportation's adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.1%, down 280 basis points FX adjusted. Resources adjusted EBITDA margin of 40.2%, a decrease of 100 basis points FX adjusted and CMS adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.7%, up 240 basis points FX adjusted. 
Moving now to net income and EPS. Net income was $161 million, and GAAP EPS was $0.40. Adjusted EPS was $0.85, an increase of $0.10 over prior year. Our GAAP tax rate was 30% and our adjusted tax rate was 16%. 
Q3 free cash flow was $344 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow conversion is 56%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our Q3 ending debt balance was $4.9 billion and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.5x on a bank covenant basis and 2.3x net of cash. We closed the quarter with $338 million of cash, and our Q3 undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1 billion. Our Q3 weighted average diluted share count was 401.3 million shares. 
As we mentioned in Q4, the merger agreement with S&P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares and therefore, our share repurchase program is currently suspended other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share-based compensation. 
Moving on to guidance. Based on our performance through the first 3 quarters of the year, we are positioned to deliver strong full year results and providing the following improvements to revenue and EPS guidance for FY '21. 
On revenue, we are providing 3 updates to our guidance. First, based on this strong performance and the forward view of our business, we are raising the operational outlook for revenue by $20 million at the midpoint. 
Second, we are adjusting our revenue for the year due to the accounting treatment of the MarkitSERV joint venture. Under this 50-50 joint venture, we will no longer consolidate revenue. This will remove $45 million from our Q4 revenue guidance. It should be noted that we will receive 50% of the JV's earnings in our reported earnings, and thus, there will be no impact of the structure to either EBITDA or EPS. 
Finally, we are lowering revenue for the year by $10 million due to the FX impact in the second half. The net of these adjustments is our new range of $4.61 million to $4.63 billion, which represents a 7% to 8% organic growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA is being maintained at $2.02 billion to $2.03 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points adjusted for FX. And adjusted EPS is being increased by $0.03 to $3.18 to $3.20 per share. We do expect cash conversion in the upper 50s due primarily to the onetime impact of the MarkitSERV joint venture and also with S&P Global deal-related merger costs. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Lance."

So I think in an information business, volatility always bodes well across the whole portfolio.

Those can have temporary negative impacts.

Of course, when you take out the revenue you retain the earnings, there will be a lift on a margin percentage. And Adam, if you want to add to that? Adam?"

Thank you, Lance, and thanks, Jeff, for the question. So as Lan said, all of this -- so the disruption increase, multiple impacts across our business, some are headwinds, some -- so at the upper end of the supply chain, when there's disruption, we do more business with suppliers. And actually, we've never had a closer relationship with many of our supply customers in today. On the new car sales, you're right. Right now, we're seeing a temporary softening of bookings in a couple of areas, you name them, right, Mastermind and digital marketing. And we expect these to be a bit softer than they usually are until inventory starts to recover. On the used car side, we're not seeing that, right? If you think about the used car market and the service market, actually, the combination of low inventory and high prices means that market is pretty hot and that impact is neutral to positive on our business. 
So all in all, I would say the impact is not material in the grand scheme of things. It does not change our outlook for the business. But we do want to flag it because we recently revised our forecast downwards for the industry. across the board.

We've rebuilt the platform built out a whole digital product suite I was really pleased to show that mid-single-digit ex BPVC revenue. And congratulations to Ken Hondros and their team, we do a real good job. 
ECR has been a slow, low single-digit grower. They've built out these new supply chain products. The world in geopolitics is driving demand into their product base. So net-net, the teams there have been additive or accretive to the overall growth compared to where they used to be. And makes everybody's job easier. Automotive, strong recovery expected to continue. The underlying core of automotive at high single digits is right where we've always talked about it being, and we don't see that changing. Hats off really to the Mastermind team. That acquisition has turned out to be a very, very important forward component. I know many of our shareholders challenged us on that acquisition is not being as accretive as we wanted to do early. the teams stuck with it in terms of the build-out of the enterprise Mastermind products. Those have been rolled out to 2 major dealers and lots more to come. New products in CARFAX for Life, taking hold. Dick and the team are really excellent execution. You get into financial services, the Ipreo acquisition, again, our last 2 acquisitions, these are the real fruits of those acquisitions are showing the private equity markets around eye-level, substantively building recovery of investments in solutions really, really excellent acquisition that's turning into strong organic growth now. 
And then in energy, we're -- hey, who would have thought it you're a $70 oil price heading towards $100. It's a CapEx recovery, you've got the world recovery and that midstream, midi book across resources next year, coupled with recovered CMS, strong Financial Services and automotive, as we're at the top end of our long-term 5% to 7% guidance that we provide and both that bodes well for the firm. 
So very mixed strong revenue growth organically, looking to achieve the 100 basis points, of course, is our normal expected takeout with the rest going into investing in new products and new opportunity sets. So a great job. It's probably my last chance publicly congratulate the teams. But I have to say whether it was through market or post the IHS Markit merger teams have did focus on incremental organic growth, incremental margin expansion steady investments in our organic strategy and where we've -- to make sure we get the best set of that, and that all through to earnings has been excellent, and I don't expect that to change. 
I think with S&P Global, there's a whole new set of revenue opportunities and of course, substantive cost synergies and share buybacks ahead. So lots to look forward to. And it's been a really exciting journey, but the excitement doesn't stop here. Next question."

And you're getting our last question. So I'll start, and then I'm going to hand it to Adam. I think the most exciting thing about the fixed income indices is the combination with S&P Global but not so much from product creation. I think product creation, both groups are highly product-oriented. They're both innovative. They both like to create. 
But if you look over the years, whether it was S&P Global, MSCI, FTSE, et cetera, they all wanted to build fixed income franchises. And really in the early days, you really needed a bank partnership to build strong fixed income indices because you really needed to align the underlying prices with the OTC marketplaces, and that's shifted over time. 
But today, the combination is really about a huge footprint and marketing platform that S&P Global has for their index franchise and getting to overlay that across the fixed income franchises is going to be really a great uplift in terms of sales and opportunity. 
The second thing, of course, is what you had mentioned is opportunities to create new indices. And maybe I'll let Adam talk a little bit about some of the synergistic revenues that we expect to get out of the combination. And we'll pass that over to Adam now. But thank you for your question.

Thank you, Eric, and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 Earnings Call. We had another very strong quarter. Q3 revenue was $1.18 billion with organic growth of 9%. Adjusted EBITDA of $516 million, with margin of 43.7% puts us on track for",809,"Okay. Thank you, Eric, and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 Earnings Call. We had another very strong quarter. Q3 revenue was $1.18 billion with organic growth of 9%. Adjusted EBITDA of $516 million, with margin of 43.7% puts us on track for the full year margin expansion of 100 basis points excluding FX. Adjusted EPS of $0.85 will be up 10% over the prior year. Overall, we are very happy with our Q3 and year-to-date results, and we're raising our full year underlying revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. 
In terms of industry verticals, let me first start with our Financial Services segment, which had another strong quarter with 8% organic growth in Q3. Within Financial Services, Information performed well, with organic growth of 6%. And the main price -- the main contributors of this included pricing, valuations, equities regulatory reporting and trading analytics platforms and our issuer solutions products due to strong IPO markets and the momentum in ESG initiatives. 
Solutions also had a strong quarter, with 9% organic growth and similar trends, which we saw in Q2 due to the strong market activity in equities and loans as well as the continued broad-based rebound of the investments being made by our customers in Solutions. This strength was accelerated by our new offerings and enhancements across the Solutions portfolio. 
Finally, our Processing business grew 12% organically with strengths in loans and derivatives performance as expected. For the full year, we still expect Financial Services to be in the 7% to 8% organic growth range.
Let's move on to Transportation, which had organic revenue growth of 15% in Q3. You'll recall that the basis for comparison, the third quarter of 2020, was depressed by significant pricing concessions that we granted our customers at the height of the COVID-related lockdowns. But like Q2, this quarter's performance also reflected strong underlying growth across the Transportation businesses. Our renewal performance was strong across the board, demonstrating the must-have nature of our products in the current challenging market environments. 
For example, CARFAX for Life has now established itself as a critical and innovative service loyalty solution for dealers at a time when driving higher levels of service lane activities is key to offsetting the lower levels of new car sales. Another example is the strong performance of our forecasting solutions as the industry grapples with the largest supply chain shock it has ever experienced. 
However, over the past 2 months, we have also seen the escalating supply chain crisis lead to further production cuts. And as a result of shortage of cars on dealer lots, we are seeing a temporary slowdown in sales of products that support OEM and dealer and sales and marketing. We remain very confident in the outlook for these products as inventory levels begin to recover. But overall, another great quarter for our auto businesses, which demonstrates the importance of our services to the industries. 
Our Maritime & Trade business continued to perform well, driven by momentum of our innovative risk and compliance solutions and by our growing footprint in the financial sector. I'm very pleased to see our new product investments over the past several years continuing to pay off.
For the full year, we expect Transportation organic growth to be in the 14% to 16% range. This represents a healthy underlying high single-digit growth rate, excluding the favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the pandemic.
Let's move on to Resources, where organic decline was a modest 1% in Q3 and as expected. Recurring revenue improved sequentially across our businesses, and nonrecurring revenue benefited from increased demand for consulting services and our software businesses. As expected, our ACV experienced continued positive growth in Q3, which we believe should continue in Q4, providing a strong foundation for our 2022 recurring revenue. 
Our Downstream organic revenue growth was very strong in the quarter, and we expect this to continue into Q4 as we help our customers navigate global supply chain disruptions in many markets. In 2021, we continue to expect organic revenue results within Resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in the low single digits as the Upstream improves and strong growth in Downstream continues.
Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was strong at 11% and 5% normalized for the BPVC. And particularly, ECR was very strong and is benefiting from increased consulting services as a result of uncertainty due to global supply chain disruptions. For the full year, we still expect CMS to deliver mid-single-digit organic growth. 
There were 2 strategic initiatives announced in the quarter. We completed the formation of the OSA JV, which includes our MarkitSERV and CME's optimization businesses. We also signed a purchase agreement for the divestiture of OPIS commensurate with the close of the merger with S&P Global.
And now I'll turn the call over to Jonathan."

Regarding revenue, our Q3 revenue was $1.18 billion, with total growth of 10%. Organic growth in the quarter was 9%, which included recurring organic growth of 7% and nonrecurring organic growth of 20%. Normalized for BPVC, total company organic growth is 8% and nonrecurring is 14%. This increase was driven by continued strong underlying growth in Financial Services and Transportation as well as benefiting from favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the impact of COVID, primarily in our dealer-facing Transportation businesses. 
Moving on to segment performance. Our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 8%, including 7% recurring in the quarter. Overall strength was anchored by strong market activities in equities and loans and the continued rebound of investment by our customers. Solutions had strong organic growth performance, delivering 9%, Information grew 6% and Processing grew 12%.
Our Transportation segment delivered organic growth of 15% in the quarter. This included growth of 17% recurring as Q3 continued to have strong growth within our CARFAX and automotiveMastermind businesses and accelerating growth within our Maritime & Trade business. Nonrecurring revenue increased by 8%, primarily driven by strong performance in CARFAX consumer and dealer transactions and within our core Automotive insights. 
Our Resources segment declined by 1%, which is comprised of a 4% recurring decline and 30% nonrecurring increase. Q3 organic ACV increased by $7 million in the quarter, and our trailing 12-month organic ACV is down 3%. However, we are seeing strong underlying trends in our Upstream pipeline, especially in North America, as we expect CapEx spend to begin to rebound in 2022. We continue to see strong demand in our Downstream businesses, particularly in our products and services that support energy transition and energy market supply chains. 
Our CMS segment had 11% organic growth, including 5% recurring and an increase of 76% nonrecurring. Normalized for BPVC, total CMS organic growth is 5%, which includes nonrecurring organic growth of 14%. 
Moving now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA was $516 million, up $29 million versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6% with a margin of 43.7%, down 160 basis points and down 110 basis points FX-adjusted. As a reminder, the margin percentages for the full company and segments were impacted because 2020 margins benefited significantly due to temporary COVID-related cost actions.
Moving to our segments. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA margin of 49.2%, down 90 basis points FX-adjusted. Transportation's adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.1%, down 280 basis points FX-adjusted. Resources adjusted EBITDA margin of 40.2%, a decrease of 100 basis points FX-adjusted and CMS adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.7%, up 240 basis points FX-adjusted.
Moving now to net income and EPS. Net income was $161 million, and GAAP EPS was $0.40. Adjusted EPS was $0.85, an increase of $0.10 over prior year. Our GAAP tax rate was 30%, and our adjusted tax rate was 16%. Q3 free cash flow was $344 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow conversion is 56%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our Q3 ending debt balance was $4.9 billion and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.5x on a bank covenant basis and 2.3x net of cash. We closed the quarter with $338 million of cash, and our Q3 undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1 billion. 
Our Q3 weighted average diluted share count was 401.3 million shares. As we mentioned in Q4, the merger agreement with S&P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares and, therefore, our share repurchase program is currently suspended other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share-based compensation.
Moving on to guidance. Based on our performance through the first 3 quarters of the year, we are positioned to deliver strong full year results and providing the following improvements to revenue and EPS guidance for FY '21. 
On revenue, we are providing 3 updates to our guidance. First, based on this strong performance and the forward view of our business, we are raising the operational outlook for revenue by $20 million at the midpoint.
Second, we are adjusting our revenue for the year due to the accounting treatment of the MarkitSERV joint venture. Under this 50-50 joint venture, we will no longer consolidate revenue. This will remove $45 million from our Q4 revenue guidance. It should be noted that we will receive 50% of the JV's earnings in our reported earnings and, thus, there will be no impact at the structure to either EBITDA or EPS. 
Finally, we are lowering revenue for the year by $10 million due to the FX impact in the second half. The net of these adjustments is our new range of $4.61 billion to $4.63 billion, which represents a 7% to 8% organic growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA is being maintained at $2.02 billion to $2.03 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points adjusted for FX. 
And adjusted EPS is being increased by $0.03 to $3.18 to $3.20 per share. We do expect cash conversion in the upper 50s due primarily to the onetime impact of the MarkitSERV joint venture and also with S&P Global deal-related merger costs. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Lance."

So hey, Lance, you talked about kind of supply chain disruption a lot and obviously, the business is thriving within the context of that. How much of that is -- obviously, there's a lot of shock in the system. But just trying to understand how much of that is that and maybe just reshoring, is structural changes in businesses post-COVID.

So I think in an information business, volatility always bodes well across the whole portfolio. And there are pluses and minuses as our Automotive business is expecting, as car sales wane through the supply chain shortages that are unprecedented, coupled with less used cars available, those can have temporary negative impacts. But net-net, when we look across the whole firm and we look at our revenue for the year and our expectations as we start next year, it's a short-term set of pluses and minuses that provide the same guidance as we expected at the beginning of the year."

So as Lance said, all of this -- so the disruption creates multiple impacts across our business. Some are headwinds, some are tailwinds. So at the upper end of the supply chain, when there's disruption, we do more business with suppliers. And actually, we've never had a closer relationship with many of our supply customers than today. 
On the new car sales, you're right. Right now, we're seeing a temporary softening of bookings in a couple of areas. You named them, right, Mastermind and digital marketing. And we expect these to be a bit softer than they usually are until inventory starts to recover. 
On the used car side, we're not seeing that, right? If you think about the used car market and the service market, actually, the combination of low inventory and high prices means that market is pretty hot, and that impact is neutral to positive on our business.
So all in all, I would say the impact is not material in the grand scheme of things. It does not change our outlook for the business.

I was really pleased to show that mid-single-digit ex BPVC revenue. And congratulations to Ken Honroth and their team because real good job. 
ECR has been a slow, low single-digit grower. They've built out these new supply chain products. The world and geopolitics is driving demand into their product base. So net-net, the teams there have been additive or accretive to the overall growth compared to where they used to be. And that makes everybody's job easier. 
Automotive, strong recovery, expected to continue. The underlying core of Automotive at high single digits is right where we've always talked about it being, and we don't see that changing. Hats off really to the Mastermind team. That acquisition has turned out to be a very, very important forward component. 
I know many of our shareholders challenged us on that acquisition as not being as accretive as we wanted to do early on. The teams stuck with it in terms of the build out of the enterprise Mastermind products. Those have been rolled out to 2 major dealers and lots more to come. New products in CARFAX for Life taking hold. Dick and the team, really excellent execution. 
You get into Financial Services. The Ipreo acquisition, again, our last 2 acquisitions, these are -- the real fruits of those acquisitions are showing the private equity markets around iLEVEL, substantively building recovery of investments in Solutions. Really, really excellent acquisition that's turning into strong organic growth now.
And then in Energy, we're -- hey, who would have thought it, your $70 oil price heading towards $100. It's a CapEx recovery. You've got the world recovery. And that midstream, mid strategic look across Resources next year, coupled with a recovered CMS, strong Financial Services and Automotive, the view is we're at the top end of our long-term 5% to 7% guidance that we provide and bodes -- that bodes well for the firm. 
So very mixed. Strong revenue growth organically, looking to achieve the 100 basis points, of course, is our normal expected takeout with the rest going into investing in new products and new opportunity sets. 
So great job. It's probably my last chance publicly to congratulate the teams. But I have to say, whether it was through Markit or post the IHS Markit merger, teams have stayed focused on incremental organic growth, incremental margin expansion, steady investments in our organic strategy and where we've -- to make sure we get the best out of that. And the call through to earnings has been excellent, and I don't expect that to change. 
I think with S&P Global, there's a whole new set of revenue opportunities and, of course, substantive cost synergies and share buybacks ahead. So lots to look forward to. And it's been a really exciting journey, but the excitement doesn't stop here. Next question."

And you're getting our last question. So I'll start, and then I'm going to hand it to Adam. I think the most exciting thing about the fixed income indices is the combination with S&P Global but not so much from product creation. I think product creation, both groups are highly product-oriented. They're both innovative. They both like to create. 
But if you look over the years, whether it was S&P Global, MSCI, FTSE, et cetera, they all wanted to build fixed income franchises. And really in the early days, you really needed a bank partnership to build strong fixed income indices because you really needed to align the underlying prices with the OTC marketplaces, and that's shifted over time. 
But today, the combination is really about a huge footprint and marketing platform that S&P Global has for their index franchise. And getting to overlay that across the fixed income franchises is going to be really a great uplift in terms of sales and opportunity.
The second thing, of course, is what you had mentioned is opportunities to create new indices. And maybe I'll let Adam talk a little bit about some of the synergistic revenues that we expect to get out of the combination. And we'll pass that over to Adam now. But thank you for your question.
