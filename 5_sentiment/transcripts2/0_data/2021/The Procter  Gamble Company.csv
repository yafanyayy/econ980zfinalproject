I'm going to continue to have overall responsibility for Investor Relations with John's able leadership and will add Andre into our discussions as we move forward. 
We're again going to keep our prepared remarks brief this morning given strong and straightforward results, focusing most of our time on your questions. 
The strong momentum we've created over the past number of years, top line, bottom line and cash, continued in the October-December quarter, which will enable us to further increase fiscal year guidance for organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth, cash productivity and our commitment for cash return to shareowners. We've built strong momentum leading up to the COVID crisis. In calendar year '19, for example, pre-COVID, we grew organic sales, 6%; core earnings per share, 15%; and delivered 102% adjusted free cash flow productivity. This pre-COVID momentum gave us the confidence to continue providing guidance as many eliminated it and to increase our dividend at the highest rate in many years in April last year even as we struggled with new COVID realities. 
Building on that strong momentum, we accelerated organic top line growth in calendar year 2020, which we just completed, to nearly 8% overcoming significant challenges, including the lockdown in China; closure of the travel retail, electro, Specialty Beauty and away-from-home channels; operational challenges; safely staffing our facilities and sourcing materials necessary to maintain and some categories significantly increase production to serve heightened consumer cleaning, health and hygiene needs; strong momentum, before COVID and during COVID, reflecting the underlying strength of our brands and the appropriateness of the strategy, which is driving our business. 
Organic sales up 8% for the quarter, 5 points of volume growth, 1 point of pricing, 2 points of mix, broad-based growth. U.S. organic sales up 12%; past 4 quarters, sequentially for calendar year 2020, plus 10, plus 19, plus 16, now plus 12; Greater China, up 12%; past 4 quarters, minus 10% during lockdown; plus 14%, plus 12%, now plus 12%. Focused markets, up 10%; and enterprise markets, which are significantly impacted by the COVID pandemic, up 3%. Each of our 10 product categories grew organic sales. Home Care, up around 30%; Oral Care and Family Care, up double digits; Fabric Care, up high singles; Personal Health Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care, Skin and Personal Care and Grooming, up mid-singles; and Baby Care, up low single digits; e-commerce sales, up nearly 50% for the first half; aggregate market share growth of 20 basis points this quarter. 
Turning to earnings. Core earnings per share of $1.64, up 15%; currency-neutral core earnings per share, up 18%. [ Past ] 4 quarters, currency-neutral core earnings per share, up 15%, up 11%, up 22% and up 18% this past quarter. Second quarter core gross margin expansion of 150 basis points, up 200 basis points, excluding currency impacts. Core operating margin grew 250 basis points, up 310 basis points, excluding currency; adjusted free cash flow productivity of 113%, returning $5 billion of cash to shareowners [ of ] $2 billion of dividends paid and $3 billion of stock repurchased. So halfway through the fiscal year, year-to-date organic sales, up 9%; core earnings per share, up 17%, ex currency, up 20%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity over 100%; $9 billion of cash returned to shareowners, 110% of all [ end ] earnings. 
As we've shared previously, we've established 3 priorities that have been guiding our actions and our choices in this crisis period. First, and importantly, is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second, maximizing the availability of products we produce to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. These products are more important than ever given the needs created by the current crisis, increased awareness of health and hygiene and additional time that we're all spending at home. Third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the front lines of this global pandemic, with product donations, PPE production, financial support and using our marketing and communications expertise to encourage consumers to support public health measures which slow the spread of the virus. These priorities are completely congruent with our strategic choices, which we remain confident in and are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and long-term value creation. 
Our strategies. We focus our portfolio on daily use products in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. Leading category growth with superior offerings mathematically build market share and builds business for our retail partners. We've made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, and we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world. 
The strategic need for this investment, the short-term need to manage through this crisis and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. 
Our new organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, has served us well during these more recent volatile times, and we believe will continue to serve us well post crisis. I want to talk a little bit about post crisis dynamics. 
While we will undoubtedly experience some volatility as we move to a new reality and quarterly results will not move in a straight line, we're optimistic about our post-crisis prospects and generally like our hand. As consumers spend more time at home due to the pandemic, we've seen dynamics play out differently across different categories. More time at home benefits our Family, Fabric and Home Care businesses. It negatively impacts Grooming, SK-II, deodorants, adult incontinence. So COVID impacts are different, some positive and some negative across categories. 
Impacts have also differed across regions. While North America market growth has increased, the reverse is true in our Asia, Middle East and Africa region, as an example. We've suffered disruptions across multiple channels; closures across Electro, Specialty Beauty, away-from-home channels, dental offices. In Japan, department stores still lack beauty consultants, which impacts our premium SK-II business. As I mentioned, our P&G professional away-from-home business has been impacted by low hotel and restaurant occupancy. We've seen some supply chain benefits from higher throughput as we simplify the number of SKUs, but costs have increased to source materials, maximize safety and important leader transport finished goods. So as and when we're out of COVID, we expect some of the current tailwinds to our business will dissipate, but some very strong headwinds should also abate or disappear. And then there are the mid- to long-term impacts of the crisis, which may be accelerators of top and bottom line growth. The relevance of our categories in consumers' lives potentially increases. We will serve what will likely become a forever altered cleaning, health and hygiene focus for consumers who use our products daily or multiple times each day. There may be a continued increased focus on home, more time at home, more meals at home with related consumption impacts. 
The importance of noticeably superior performance potentially grows. There's potential for increased preference for established reputable brands that solve newly framed problems better than alternatives, potentially less experimentation, potential for a lasting shift to e-commerce, both e-tailers and omnichannel. Our experience to date makes us believe we are generally well positioned in this environment. 
We're discovering lower-cost ways of working with fewer resources, today's necessity giving rise to the productivity inventions of tomorrow. New digital tools are being brought to the forefront, providing another productivity driver on the factory floor, in our labs and the office environment. We very much like our long-term prospects. So the near term will continue to be challenging and more difficult to predict. 
Our near-term outlook begins with an assumption of how underlying consumer markets will develop. This by itself is highly uncertain. While the first rounds of vaccines have been deployed, the number of COVID cases remain high in many parts of the world, without the resources or infrastructure to effectively manage it. Despite the launch of vaccines, we'll likely be operating through fiscal '21 much as we have been for the past 9 months. 
In the U.S. and other markets, it's unclear how long we'll be operating at high unemployment levels and how much mitigating economic stimulus will actually be available. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that also affect the prospects for category growth. These same dynamics can result in an increased cost to operate. There is a risk of supply chain disruption of our operations are those of our suppliers. Channel disruptions will likely continue. Against this challenging backdrop, we're holding ourselves to an expectation of continued growth, top line and bottom line and expect to be highly cash generative. With a strong first half of the base, we're further increasing our fiscal year guidance for organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth, adjusted free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners. We're raising our organic sales growth guidance from a range of 2% to 4% going into the fiscal year, to a range of 4% to 5% after the first quarter now to a range of 5% to 6%. The outlook assumes a quarter-to-quarter step-down in the second half as retail inventories are fully replenished and as category consumption levels moderate. We saw a sequential deceleration in U.S. consumption in our categories in December and January. These trends are incorporated into our new higher guidance range. 
We're increasing core earnings per share growth guidance from a range of 3% to 7%, [ to ] previously 5% to 8%, now [ to ] 8% to 10%, a 2.5 point increase at the midpoint of the range. This bottom line outlook includes headwinds of approximately $100 million after tax of foreign exchange, $150 million from the combination of higher interest expense and lower interest income and $100 million after tax of higher freight costs. Commodities are currently forecast to be neutral to earnings on the year. 
We will continue our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return to shareowners. We're raising our target for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% going into the year to about 95% after Q1, now to a range of 95% to 100%. We continue to expect to pay approximately $8 [ billion ] in dividends and are further increasing our outlook on share repurchase from a range of $7 billion to $9 billion to up to $10 billion. Combined, a plan to return around $18 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year, over 125% of all-in earnings. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions major production stoppages or additional store closures are not anticipated within the guidance range. 
Wrapping up, we created strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We've strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well positioned to serve the heightened needs and new behaviors of consumers and our retail and distributor partners post crisis. We will manage what could be a volatile short to midterm, consistent with the strategy we've outlined many times and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products to serve cleaning, health and hygiene needs and helping society overcome the challenges of this crisis. 
We're stepping forward, not back. We're doubling down to serve consumers and our communities. We're doing this in our interest, in society's interest and in the interest of our long-term shareholders. We're happy now to take your questions."

So first was just closer in. I was curious if you had a view on household pantry inventory, knowing that in some regions, there's been still shortages, limited ability to purchase -- this is particularly U.S. conversation. 
In other markets, you go into a retailer and there's product on shelf, and that's obviously gotten better to the pandemic. So I was curious to get a sense of how much there is in terms of consumer pantry inventory right now of clean and particularly surface cleaning product was one? 
And then two, just thinking longer term to your reference to change heightened consumer interest. I mean how do you think a company like P&G can best address that? Is it occasions? Is it chemistry? Is it packaging? What are sort of the things you're thinking about as you prepare for that future and the ability to kind of capitalize on this heightened consumer interest that you've referred to going forward?"
33328,699310418,2176507,"The Procter & Gamble Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2021",2021-01-20,"Earnings Calls","The Procter & Gamble Company","Executives","Thanks, Lauren.

We obviously don't have perfect insights into pantry inventories. We know that they're higher, as you indicated, primarily in the U.S. And as you rightly pointed out and many parts of the world, there aren't homes that are large enough to accommodate significant pantry inventory build, and there are no pantries. 
We're also seeing, though, very, very importantly, increased consumption in these categories, more time at home, more meals at home, higher consumption. In the U.S., as an example, cleaning and sanitizing frequency is up 30%; dishwashing frequency is up 15%; air freshening frequency, up 20%; in-home paper towel usage, up 15%. So while there has been an understandable tendency for some consumers, particularly in the U.S., to build inventory to protect themselves and their families and to minimize trips outside their home, consumption is generally following. 
Could there be some reduction in top line growth rates if, God-willing, the situation gets better, and therefore, I need less in my pantry as protection, yes, that could occur for some period of time but not in the mid- to long term, obviously. And those increased levels of consumption are accompanied, in many cases, by new habit formation or habit strengthening. And unfortunately, we've not been at this for 4 weeks or 8 weeks where things might -- where behavior might snap back to precrisis levels. We've been at this on a global basis, well, even in the U.S., for a year. And that does tend to form habits, which means some higher level of consumption should continue to occur post crisis. 
And then while I'm on it, while it's not part of your question, remember again, from our prepared remarks that there are many categories that have suffered as a result of the dynamics we're all managing through. And those should provide an offset in a more normalized environment, the same with markets, the same with channel opening. 
Heightened consumer interest in health, hygiene and a clean home, what are we doing? The way I like to think about this is how can we step up and step forward to better serve consumers with these heightened needs. Some of that -- and it's all the things that you mentioned, we are innovating and bringing new products to market to better meet those needs, whether that's Microban 24 as an example; whether that's Safeguard sanitizer; whether that is for better oral health, as an example, the new IO offering, which has driven a 20% year-to-year increase in our power brush sales. We're modifying packaging, so that it's clearer relative to the health home benefits that our products offer. We're educating, both to your point on usage occasions and helpful tips around the home. One of our categories that's had a particularly good job on that is our home care category, which has shifted a fair amount of advertising to an educational format, which is designed again to serve consumers during this difficult period. And our broad brand communication and messaging is generally reflective of those kinds of opportunities. Claims support, developing claims are essentially communication that we can back up with laboratory research that highlights the benefit of our products in many categories to serve these needs. 
For example, hygiene, that's a benefit as a result of use of some of our laundry offerings. The long answer, but it was a good question, and I want to just reiterate the point again that the question behind the question in all of this I suspect today will be are you -- what kind of shape are you going to come out of this in? And I think, we think we're going to be in great shape coming out of this. I won't predict a top line growth rate or a bottom line growth rate that a company [ set ], but from a strategy standpoint, from a brand portfolio standpoint, from an organization execution standpoint, and as I mentioned, from the variety of impacts that COVID has had across the portfolio, both categories and geographies and channels, we feel very well positioned to continue the momentum that we've developed."

John, you mentioned the valuation-related pricing a few times in the release today.

As we think about your calendar '21 and the setup as we go forward, with FX set at the moment to reverse and likely the lapping of some of the COVID promotional pullbacks in 2020, I guess how are you sizing up the prospects of additional net reported price realization as we go forward? Investors are clearly focused on inflationary cost pressures that are building. And I guess the real question is I'm curious as to whether you think those incremental pressures can be offset by cost-justified pricing in the year ahead? Or will competition and a return to more normalized promotional patterns make that difficult?"

As you rightly point out, there are a lot of moving pieces within that top line. From a -- when you put it all together though, price contributed 1 point to the 8 points of top line growth in the quarter. So to the extent that everything that's happening, complex as it may be, reverses itself, that has about a 1 point impact on top line growth. 
Promotion levels, which you've mentioned, have returned from about the lowest point, which was about 17% of products sold on promotion, up to about 26%. So a significant amount of that promotion return is already in the numbers. And that compares to a precrisis range of, call it, averagely 33%. I don't know necessarily, where post crisis, we're going to net out on that percent, but that gives you that math. 
The other thing I would point out is that some modest pricing is inherent in our innovation-based and superiority-based business model. Superiority not in terms of price points, but superiority in terms of performance. And if you look at the 1 point sales impact in the quarter we just completed, that's pretty normal. But we look at -- if you look at the 41 out of the last 45 quarters, pricing has been neutral to a slight positive impact on the top line, 15 out of the last 16 years. So if we're going to define an expectation of the future based on normalization, it doesn't look a lot different than what you're seeing now. The drivers may vary and be different by category, by market. But I think what you're seeing is generally representative of our history and, to some extent, representative of the future."

Let me cover the second one first and then come closer in to the back half. 
We -- when I'm talking about being well positioned for a post-COVID environment, I'm talking about the mid- to long term. And I'm talking about the strength of our brands, our strategies and our organization, coupled with what versus pre-COVID will likely be some increase in health, hygiene and clean home consumption of a consumer base that's been through a very difficult and, frankly, for many of us, life-altering period of time. 
As we come back in and look at the back half, as I said, we are not assuming the situation changes. And in fact, I've mentioned that I expect we'll be operating very much as we have for the balance of at least the balance of a year. And I would view the upsides and the downsides in the back half is relatively symmetric. I would view them similar to how I viewed them, how we viewed them when we last spoke. So that hasn't changed. What's changed is 2 very strong quarters now in the books, which on a fiscal year basis, certainly removes some of that risk and as reflected in our guidance in [ presses ]. But there are just so many things going on in all of our lives and in the world around us. But to assume linearity of any degree is difficult. Think about simple things like rents, like repayment of student loans, like employment, those issues were somewhat offset by stimulus and regulation, for example, in the U.S. in the first half, and it's still unclear exactly what's going to happen to many of those items in the second half. We obviously start getting to higher base periods as we get into the back half as well. And some amount of promotion will move closer off that 26%, closer to something like 30% over some period of time. We'll have to see how that plays out. 
So again, I think that all the steps we've taken to build momentum in our business pre-COVID have served us very well during COVID. They will continue to serve us well in the back half, and they set us up well for the long term. But there's a ton of volatility between here and there. One way for me to frame that is just think as we were having this conversation last year at this time, and we were trying to prognosticate about what the 6 -- next 6 months or the next year would look like. None of us would have had any idea. And if anything, the level of certainty has been -- is less today than it was then. But within that, there are opportunities as well as risks. Sorry for the long-winded answer. I hope that helped a little bit."

So I just wanted to follow up on Steve's question. You highlighted your historical ability to take pricing.

But also, the higher prices appear more sustainable this time around with the post-COVID economic rebound. So I just wanted to understand your mindset or sort of willingness to take pricing, either maybe shortening the lead time to take pricing or just in terms of level of magnitude relative to the past because it does seem like it's probably a little more of an atypical situation on the commodity front. 
And then just second, on the other side of it, what's your sense for retailer enthusiasm in the U.S. for pricing in this environment? Obviously, companies like yourselves have posted significant gross margin expansion over the last couple of years, and there's an uncertain consumer outlook. So do you really need to see that pressure materialize in gross margins before you discuss pricing with retailers? Can you be more proactive? And again, I'm just trying to understand sort of the mindset here around the past when you've typically been able to take price increases and if anything is potentially different this time around."

So to generalize is difficult, and I apologize for that. But what I would tell you is in general, when your strategy is based on innovation and superiority in categories where superiority drives brand choice, you have more ability to pass on modest cost increases while improving consumer perception of value because they're delivering more performance at the same time. So at the end of the day, you -- we get ourselves in trouble a little bit when we look at pricing in isolation because that's not how the world works, and that's not how the consumer works. That's not how our retail customers think about things either. So a conversation with a retail customer would involve a whole host of topics with the fundamental question being, ""Do we have a plan together that grows the retailers business and does so in a profitable way.""

So as online moves to closer to 20% of sales, which would be likely without stretching much in an intermediate term, if you will, using reasonable assumptions, what do you think this will mean for company sales with respect to market share, margins and returns?

We've had a strong year-to-date outcome within e-commerce growing 50%, now [ above ] 14% of the business globally. Plus you're right, it's not far from closing in on that 20% level, particularly with those kind of growth rates. 
Without going through all the details, you know that I've always viewed this channel and the development of this channel as being big established and preferred brand-friendly, not an adverse situation, but a conducive situation for growth. We need to perform in this channel against all the vectors of superiority just as we do in the others. But when we do that, there's no reason to expect that the outcome isn't as or more attractive than it is in some of the traditional retail channels. 
If you look at your question about market share and margin, on an aggregate basis today, different by category, by country. But on an aggregate basis, our market share in e-commerce broadly defined, so pure-play and omni, is slightly higher, not by much than our brick-and-mortar market shares. And I think that's more reflective of the demographics of the online shopper than it is anything else. 
Our margins are also, on aggregate, similar across the 2 channels. So we were in a very nice place that we aim to be in, which is we want to be channel-agnostic, serve shoppers wherever they choose to shop and be able to do that, as you rightly point out, in a way that's neutral to accretive to share margin and return. I think we're very well positioned, requires work every day, very volatile space. We keep our eye on the consumer and serving them with superior offerings, again, in categories where performance drives brand choice, we should continue to do well."

The -- as we said in our prepared remarks, on a total fiscal year basis, the commodity impact to the bottom line is neutral. That's not one of the things that I'm actually spending a lot of time on and overly focused on relative to some other things. There has been a recent increase in some of our exposures. But even if you were to take spot rates versus a year ago and annualize that as 1 evaluation of what the impact could be, it's modest compared to some of the significant commodity spikes that we've been through the last decade. It's also currently offset to a degree by FX. 
The other thing is that within the total cost pool, there are significant increases reflected in the current results and in the current margin growth for operating in the environment that we've been operating in. And if vaccinations occur broadly and we return more to normality and economies accelerate and therefore, put pressure on commodity markets, I would expect that some of these other costs that we've been incurring would abate. So much like the COVID impact on categories or markets, there are offsets that we have to consider when we look at commodities. And we need to look at the total picture as we think about pricing going forward, which we will do. But again, I mean, we could be having a very different conversation a quarter from now.

Stepping back, our strategic objective in establishing a different approach for enterprises markets was twofold. The first and primary objective was to enable leadership and the broad resources of the company to focus on the largest markets",424,"Thanks, Wendy. Stepping back, our strategic objective in establishing a different approach for enterprises markets was twofold. The first and primary objective was to enable leadership and the broad resources of the company to focus on the largest markets and most profitable markets of the company, what we call, not surprisingly, focused markets. And our progress there has accelerated pretty dramatically. And if that's all we accomplished, that would be a major step forward. So I just mentioned the U.S. and China, both growing 12% in the quarter, both growing double digits year-to-date. I in no way want to assert causality. That would be careless, but there's certainly nothing to indicate that increased focus in those markets has hurt us. It certainly appears to have helped us. So that was objective one. 
Objective two was to ensure -- was ideally for these markets to continue to be a source of top line growth and a more dependable source of bottom line growth for the company by moving management of activity closer to the market, closer to consumers actually in the market with consumers, competitors and customers. And that generally has played out well as well. So we grew -- the enterprise markets grew top line. They grew bottom line last fiscal year. We got to a point at the end of the year where we had 2 countries within 100 enterprise markets that we're losing money, which is a huge step forward from where we've been historically. And importantly, we did that while holding or building market share. So this wasn't a cost, if you will, to top line growth and development relative to the market. 
In an ideal world, to answer your question about the future, we would continue to enable a strong emphasis of resources on focus markets and manage the enterprise markets in a way that are accretive to company top line accretive to company bottom line. And I think in a normalized post-COVID environment, that's possible. But we're being very selective in where we choose to win and how we choose to do that. And again, we want to be a source of support for the major markets in the company, both from the standpoint of enabling focus and from a standpoint of creating financial resource to do that while maintaining an option on the growth that these markets represent in the future. I'd be happy to spend more time. It's obviously a pretty full topic. But in general, we're progressing along the lines that we've set out to do."

COVID has expose some of, for example, the supply chain weaknesses that exist within the ecosystem that have been supporting those retail partners.

There are some clear exception where growth has accelerated plus 15%, plus 30%, and we don't build our manufacturing infrastructure for that kind of upside. But we're catching up here pretty quickly. But in general, we've been a very dependable source of supply. In general, consumers are shifting to known reputable brands. And obviously, our retail partners are consumer-centric themselves. 
One of the data that support that conclusion, if you look at private-label data as 1 example, market shares of private label in our categories are down in the U.S. for any time period you look at in the last 12 months. And we're talking significant -- relatively significant declines of up to a point, which on their base is not a small number, and the same general dynamic in Europe. So retailers are looking to serve the changing needs of their consumers, and we do -- we are well positioned in that regard. 
Retailers are looking at their assortment. We're also looking at their inventory levels. And there will be pros and cons within that decision set that occur over time. But again, we're relatively well positioned. The dynamics obviously differ by market, with some markets that are more challenged even than ours from a COVID standpoint, focused almost exclusively on supply. And again, our supply chain sets us up pretty well to serve those retailers. 
It's early days. We're still working through, as are they, the demand and supply dynamics. But I really think our position has been strengthened as a result of the experience and the response that we've all been working on."

We view the market's job as focusing on T. And over time, strong E with a strong P, as you know. I'm sorry, I'm simplistic. 
In terms of share repurchase and capital return in general, if you go back to the beginning of this fiscal year, our estimated range of share repurchase was $6 billion to $8 billion, and we're now up to $10 billion. So if you look at the midpoint of the range, 7 to 10, that's almost a 50% increase in our expectation of share repurchase for the current fiscal year. And if you look at the combination of dividend and share repurchase, that's $18 billion, 125% of all-in earnings, we have historically returned more than 100% of all-in earnings in the form of both dividends and share repurchase, I would expect us to continue on that journey. 
April is the timing in which we would next normally review capital allocation with our Board of Directors, including both dividend and share repurchase. But our belief here, Rob, is very simple. Excess cash is not ours, it's yours or the shareowners and will be, as it has historically been, returns to them. 
In terms of M&A as a part of capital allocation, we've been looking at and executing what have typically been relatively small acquisitions that fill in our portfolio and the categories that we've chosen to compete in, things like native deodorant, things like this is [ L ] and then as you know and as you referenced, we looked at Billy within the shave care market. Those things by their size don't, in and of themselves, make much of an impact on our capital allocation choices. So I don't see any reason today, again, this can change tomorrow as well. But as we sit here today, we're pretty committed to the course that we've been on, and I don't see anything that should cause us to run off those tracks. 
Your question on how I spend my time. So we're in the middle of transitioning Andre and are in the middle of transition, and he'll take over the CFO responsibilities March 1. I look forward to that, one, because he's incredibly talented, committed and energetic leader; and two, as you rightly point out, that gives me a little bit more capacity to focus on very volatile set of circumstances around the world. I will continue to have Investor Relations responsibility, as I mentioned earlier, from a function standpoint. I'll have responsibility for IT for our global business services; for our sales function; our product supply function, including engineering procurement, manufacturing distribution. I'll have responsibility -- continue to have responsibility for our market operations around the world. And we'll continue, as you know, to have P&L responsibility for the 100-or-so enterprise markets. So I've got plenty to do, and I look forward to, as we mentioned, a little bit of additional capacity to focus on each of those items."

Also remember that consumer situation has changed measurably from, call it, October through to December and then January in terms of the amount of stimulus that was available, the lockdown situations in different parts of the world, the employment situation, all of which can reverse themselves fairly quickly, both from a policy standpoint and hopefully, from a human health standpoint. So I'm not looking at any of that as a foregone conclusion either for the rest of the year or for the future. But it's important, particularly when we have a quarter as strong as it is, to be holistic in our explanation of what's happening. 
Well, thanks, everybody. Thanks for your time on what I know is a very busy day. And John and his team will be available on the balance of the day as well, of course, I to answer any additional questions that you have. Thanks again."

We're again going to keep our prepared remarks brief this morning given strong and straightforward results, focusing most of our time on your questions.
The strong momentum we've created over the past number of years, top line, bottom line and cash, continued in the October-December quarter, which will enable us to further increase fiscal year guidance for organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth, cash productivity and our commitment for cash return to shareowners. We've built strong momentum leading up to the COVID crisis. In calendar year '19, for example, pre-COVID, we grew organic sales, 6%; core earnings per share, 15%; and delivered 102% adjusted free cash flow productivity. This pre-COVID momentum gave us the confidence to continue providing guidance as many eliminated it and to increase our dividend at the highest rate in many years in April last year even as we struggled with new COVID realities.
Building on that strong momentum, we accelerated organic top line growth in calendar year 2020, which we just completed, to nearly 8% overcoming significant challenges, including: the lockdown in China; closure of the travel retail, electro, specialty beauty and away-from-home channels; operational challenges; safely staffing our facilities and sourcing materials necessary to maintain and, in some categories, significantly increase production to serve heightened consumer, cleaning, health and hygiene needs. Strong momentum, before COVID and during COVID, reflecting the underlying strength of our brands and the appropriateness of the strategy, which is driving our business.
Organic sales, up 8% for the quarter, 5 points of volume growth, 1 point of pricing, 2 points of mix, broad-based growth. U.S. organic sales up 12%; past 4 quarters, sequentially for calendar year 2020, plus 10%, plus 19%, plus 16%, now plus 12%. Greater China, up 12%; past 4 quarters, minus 10% during lockdown; plus 14%, plus 12%, now plus 12%. Focused markets, up 10%; and enterprise markets, which are significantly impacted by the COVID pandemic, up 3%. 
Each of our 10 product categories grew organic sales. Home Care, up around 30%; Oral Care and Family Care, up double digits; Fabric Care, up high singles; Personal Health Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care, Skin and Personal Care and Grooming, up mid-singles; and Baby Care, up low single digits. E-commerce sales, up nearly 50% for the first half; aggregate market share growth of 20 basis points this quarter.
Turning to earnings. Core earnings per share of $1.64, up 15%; currency-neutral core earnings per share, up 18%; past 4 quarters, currency-neutral core earnings per share, up 15%, up 11%, up 22% and up 18% this past quarter. Second quarter core gross margin expansion of 150 basis points, up 200 basis points, excluding currency impacts. 
Core operating margin grew 250 basis points, up 310 basis points, excluding currency. Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 113%, returning $5 billion of cash to shareowners, $2 billion of dividends paid and $3 billion of stock repurchased. So halfway through the fiscal year, year-to-date organic sales, up 9%; core earnings per share, up 17%, ex currency, up 20%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity over 100%; $9 billion of cash returned to shareowners, 110% of all-in earnings.
 
As we've shared previously, we've established 3 priorities that have been guiding our actions and our choices in this crisis period. First, and importantly, is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second, maximizing the availability of products we produce to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. These products are more important than ever given the needs created by the current crisis, increased awareness of health and hygiene and additional time that we're all spending at home. 
Third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the front lines of this global pandemic with product donations, PPE production, financial support and using our marketing and communications expertise to encourage consumers to support public health measures which slow the spread of the virus. These priorities are completely congruent with our strategic choices, which we remain confident in and are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and long-term value creation.
Our strategies. We focus our portfolio on daily use products in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority: product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. Leading category growth with superior offerings mathematically builds market share and builds business for our retail partners. 
We've made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. And we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world.
The strategic need for this investment, the short-term need to manage through this crisis and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. 
Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important.
Our new organizational structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organizational structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, has served us well during these more recent volatile times, and we believe will continue to serve us well post crisis. 
I want to talk a little bit about post-crisis dynamics. While we will undoubtedly experience some volatility as we move to a new reality and quarterly results will not move in a straight line, we're optimistic about our post-crisis prospects and generally like our hand. As consumers spend more time at home due to the pandemic, we've seen dynamics play out differently across different categories. More time at home benefits our Family, Fabric and Home Care businesses. It negatively impacts Grooming, SK-II, deodorants, adult incontinence. So COVID impacts are different, some positive and some negative across categories.
Impacts have also differed across regions. While North America market growth has increased, the reverse is true in our Asia, Middle East and Africa region, as an example. We've suffered disruptions across multiple channels; closures across electro, specialty beauty, away-from-home channels, dental offices. In Japan, department stores still lack beauty consultants, which impacts our premium SK-II business. As I mentioned, our P&G professional away-from-home business has been impacted by low hotel and restaurant occupancy. We've seen some supply chain benefits from higher throughput as we simplify the number of SKUs, but costs have increased to source materials, maximize safety and importantly, to transport finished goods. 
So as and when we're out of COVID, we expect some of the current tailwinds to our business will dissipate, but some very strong headwinds should also abate or disappear. And then there are the mid- to long-term impacts of the crisis, which may be accelerators of top and bottom line growth. 
The relevance of our categories in consumers' lives potentially increases. We will serve what will likely become a forever altered cleaning, health and hygiene focus for consumers who use our products daily or multiple times each day. There may be a continued increased focus on home, more time at home, more meals at home with related consumption impacts.
The importance of noticeably superior performance potentially grows. There's potential for increased preference for established, reputable brands that solve newly framed problems better than alternatives, potentially less experimentation, potential for a lasting shift to e-commerce, both e-tailers and omnichannel. Our experience to date makes us believe we are generally well positioned in this environment.
We're discovering lower-cost ways of working with fewer resources, today's necessity giving rise to the productivity inventions of tomorrow. New digital tools are being brought to the forefront, providing another productivity driver on the factory floor, in our labs and the office environment. We very much like our long-term prospects, though the near term will continue to be challenging and more difficult to predict.
Our near-term outlook begins with an assumption of how underlying consumer markets will develop. This by itself is highly uncertain. While the first rounds of vaccines have been deployed, the number of COVID cases remain high in many parts of the world, without the resources or infrastructure to effectively manage it. Despite the launch of vaccines, we'll likely be operating through fiscal '21 much as we have been for the past 9 months.
In the U.S. and other markets, it's unclear how long we'll be operating at high unemployment levels and how much mitigating economic stimulus will actually be available. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that also affect the prospects for category growth. These same dynamics can result in an increased cost to operate. There is a risk of supply chain disruption of our operations or those of our suppliers. Channel disruptions will likely continue. 
Against this challenging backdrop, we're holding ourselves to an expectation of continued growth, top line and bottom line, and expect to be highly cash generative. With a strong first half as a base, we're further increasing our fiscal year guidance for organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth, adjusted free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners. We're raising our organic sales growth guidance from a range of 2% to 4% going into the fiscal year, to a range of 4% to 5% after the first quarter, now to a range of 5% to 6%. The outlook assumes a quarter-to-quarter step-down in the second half as retail inventories are fully replenished and as category consumption levels moderate. We saw a sequential deceleration in U.S. consumption in our categories in December and January. These trends are incorporated into our new higher guidance range.
We're increasing core earnings per share growth guidance from a range of 3% to 7%, to previously 5% to 8%, now to 8% to 10%, a 2.5 point increase at the midpoint of the range. This bottom line outlook includes headwinds of approximately $100 million after tax of foreign exchange, $150 million from the combination of higher interest expense and lower interest income and $100 million after tax of higher freight costs. Commodities are currently forecast to be neutral to earnings on the year.
We will continue our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return to shareowners. We're raising our target for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% going into the year to about 95% after Q1, now to a range of 95% to 100%. We continue to expect to pay approximately $8 billion in dividends and are further increasing our outlook on share repurchase from a range of $7 billion to $9 billion to up to $10 billion. Combined, a plan to return around $18 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year, over 125% of all-in earnings. 
This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or additional store closures are not anticipated within the guidance range.
Wrapping up, we created strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We've strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well positioned to serve the heightened needs and new behaviors of consumers and our retail and distributor partners post crisis. We will manage what could be a volatile short to midterm, consistent with the strategy we've outlined many times and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products to serve cleaning, health and hygiene needs and helping society overcome the challenges of this crisis.
We're stepping forward, not back. We're doubling down to serve consumers and our communities. We're doing this in our interest, in society's interest and in the interest of our long-term shareholders. 
We're happy now to take your questions."

So first was just closer in. I was curious if you had a view on household pantry inventory, knowing that in some regions, there's been still shortages, limited ability to purchase. This is a particular U.S. conversation.
In other markets, you go into a retailer and there's product on shelf, and that's obviously gotten better through the pandemic. So I was curious to get a sense of how much there is in terms of consumer pantry inventory right now of cleaning, and particularly, surface cleaning products was one. 
And then two, just thinking longer term to your reference to change -- heightened consumer interest. I mean how do you think a company like P&G can best address that? Is it occasions? Is it chemistry? Is it packaging? What are sort of the things you're thinking about as you prepare for that future and the ability to kind of capitalize on this heightened consumer interest that you've referred to going forward?"
33328,699310418,2176585,"The Procter & Gamble Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2021",2021-01-20,"Earnings Calls","The Procter & Gamble Company","Executives","Thanks, Lauren.

We obviously don't have perfect insights into pantry inventories. We know that they're higher, as you indicated, primarily in the U.S. And as you rightly pointed out and many parts of the world, there aren't homes that are large enough to accommodate significant pantry inventory build, and there are no pantries.
We're also seeing, though, very, very importantly, increased consumption in these categories, more time at home, more meals at home, higher consumption. In the U.S., as an example, cleaning and sanitizing frequency is up 30%; Dishwashing frequency is up 15%; air freshening frequency, up 20%; in-home paper towel usage, up 15%. So while there has been an understandable tendency for some consumers, particularly in the U.S., to build inventory to protect themselves and their family and to minimize trips outside their home, consumption is generally following.
Could there be some reduction in top line growth rates if, God-willing, the situation gets better and, therefore, I need less in my pantry as protection? Yes, that could occur for some period of time, but not in the mid- to long term, obviously. And those increased levels of consumption are accompanied, in many cases, by new habit formation or habit strengthening. And unfortunately, we've not been at this for 4 weeks or 8 weeks where things might -- where behavior might snap back to precrisis levels. We've been at this on a global basis, well, even in the U.S., for a year. And that does tend to form habits, which means some higher level of consumption should continue to occur post crisis.
And then while I'm on it, while it's not part of your question, remember again, from our prepared remarks that there are many categories that have suffered as a result of the dynamics we're all managing through. And those should provide an offset in a more normalized environment, the same with markets, the same with channel opening.
Heightened consumer interest in health, hygiene and a clean home, what are we doing? The way I like to think about this is, how can we step up and step forward to better serve consumers with these heightened needs. Some of that -- and it's all the things that you mentioned, we are innovating and bringing new products to market to better meet those needs, whether that's Microban 24 as an example; whether that's Safeguard sanitizer; whether that is for better oral health, as an example, the new iO offering, which has driven a 20% year-to-year increase in our power brush sales. 
We're modifying packaging, so that it's clearer relative to the health, hygiene, clean home benefits that our products offer. We're educating both, to your point, on usage occasions and helpful tips around the home. One of our categories that's done a particularly good job on that is our Home Care category, which has shifted a fair amount of advertising to an educational format, which is designed again to serve consumers during this difficult period. And our broad brand communication and messaging is generally reflective of those kinds of opportunities. 
Claims support, developing claims are essentially communication that we can back up with laboratory research that highlights the benefit of our products in many categories to serve these needs. For example, hygiene, that's a -- benefit as a result of use of some of our laundry offerings. 
A long answer, but it was a good question, and I want to just reiterate the point again that the question behind the question in all of this I suspect today will be are you -- what kind of shape are you going to come out of this in? And I think, we think, we're going to be in great shape coming out of this. I won't predict a top line growth rate or a bottom line growth rate that accompanies that. But from a strategy standpoint, from a brand portfolio standpoint, from an organization execution standpoint, and as I mentioned, from the variety of impacts that COVID has had across the portfolio, both categories and geographies and channels, we feel very well positioned to continue the momentum that we've developed."

As we think about your calendar '21 and the setup as we go forward, with FX set at the moment to reverse and likely the lapping of some of the COVID promotional pullbacks in 2020, I guess how are you sizing up the prospects of additional net reported price realization as we go forward? Investors are clearly focused on inflationary cost pressures that are building. 
And I guess the real question is, I'm curious as to whether you think those incremental pressures can be offset by cost-justified pricing in the year ahead. Or will competition and a return to more normalized promotional patterns make that difficult?"

As you rightly point out, there are a lot of moving pieces within that top line. From a -- when you put it all together though, price contributed 1 point to the 8 points of top line growth in the quarter. So to the extent that everything that's happening, complex as it may be, reverses itself, that has about a 1 point impact on top line growth. 
Promotion levels, which you've mentioned, have returned from about the lowest point, which was about 17% of products sold on promotion, up to about 26%. So a significant amount of that promotion return is already in the numbers. And that compares to a precrisis range of, call it, averagely, 33%. I don't know necessarily, where post crisis, we're going to net out on that percent, but that gives you that math.
The other thing I would point out is that some modest pricing is inherent in our innovation-based and superiority-based business model. Superiority not in terms of price points, but superiority in terms of performance. And if you look at the 1 point sales impact in the quarter we just completed, that's pretty normal. But we look at -- if you look at the 41 out of the last 45 quarters, pricing has been neutral to a slight positive impact on the top line 15 out of the last 16 years. 
So if we're going to define an expectation of the future based on normalization, it doesn't look a lot different than what you're seeing now. The drivers may vary and be different by category, by market. But I think what you're seeing is generally representative of our history and, to some extent, representative of the future."

Let me cover the second one first and then come closer in to the back half. 
We -- when I'm talking about being well positioned for a post-COVID environment, I'm talking about the mid- to long term. And I'm talking about the strength of our brands, our strategies and our organization, coupled with what, versus pre-COVID, will likely be some increase in health, hygiene and clean home consumption of a consumer base that's been through a very difficult and, frankly, for many of us, life-altering period of time.
As we come back in and look at the back half, as I said, we are not assuming the situation changes. And in fact, I've mentioned that I expect we'll be operating very much as we have for the balance of at least the balance of the fiscal year. And I would view that the upsides and the downsides in the back half is relatively symmetric. I would view them similar to how I've viewed them, how we viewed them when we last spoke. So that hasn't changed. 
What's changed is 2 very strong quarters now in the books, which on a fiscal year basis, certainly removes some of that risk and as reflected in our guidance in précis. But there are just so many things going on in all of our lives and in the world around us that to assume linearity of any degree is difficult. Think about simple things like rent, like repayment of student loans, like employment. Those issues were somewhat offset by stimulus and regulation, for example, in the U.S. in the first half, and it's still unclear exactly what's going to happen to many of those items in the second half. 
We obviously start getting to higher base periods as we get into the back half as well. And some amount of promotion will move closer off that 26%, closer to something like 30% over some period of time. We'll have to see how that plays out.
So again, I think that all the steps we've taken to build momentum in our business pre-COVID have served us very well during COVID. They will continue to serve us well in the back half, and they set us up well for the long term. But there's a ton of volatility between here and there. 
One way for me to frame that is just think as we were having this conversation last year at this time, and we were trying to prognosticate about what the 6 -- next 6 months or the next year would look like, none of us would have had any idea. And if anything, the level of certainty has been -- is less today than it was then. But within that, there are opportunities as well as risks. Sorry for the long-winded answer. I hope that helped a little bit."

So I just wanted to follow up on Steve's question. You highlighted your historical ability to take pricing.

So I just wanted to understand your mindset or sort of willingness to take pricing, either maybe shortening the lead time to take pricing or just in terms of level of magnitude relative to the past. Because it does seem like it's probably a little more of an atypical situation on the commodity front.
And then just second, on the other side of it, what's your sense for retailer enthusiasm in the U.S. for pricing in this environment? Obviously, companies like yourselves have posted significant gross margin expansion over the last couple of years, and there's an uncertain consumer outlook. So do you really need to see that pressure materialize in gross margins before you discuss pricing with retailers? Can you be more proactive? And again, I'm just trying to understand sort of the mindset here around the past when you've typically been able to take price increases. And if anything is potentially different this time around?"

So to generalize is difficult, and I apologize for that. But what I would tell you is in general, when your strategy is based on innovation and superiority in categories where superiority drives brand choice, you have more ability to pass on modest cost increases while improving consumer perception of value because they're delivering more performance at the same time. So at the end of the day, you -- we get ourselves in trouble a little bit when we look at pricing in isolation because that's not how the world works, and that's not how the consumer works. That's not how our retail customers think about things either. 
So a conversation with a retail customer would involve a whole host of topics with the fundamental question being, ""Do we have a plan together that grows the retailer's business and does so in a profitable way?"" Very rarely, do we dissect the conversation to focus on a single variable. That really isn't in either of our interest.
Having said all that, is there anything fundamentally different that should -- that I know today that changes materially our ability to deliver the kind of top line and bottom line that we have in the past? No."

And there seemed to be a false narrative out there, probably a year or 2 ago, that the shift to this channel was unfavorable for big brands, which we just really haven't seen, at least broadly in staples. 
So as online moves to closer to 20% of sales, which would be likely without stretching much in the intermediate term, if you will, using reasonable assumptions, what do you think this will mean for company sales with respect to market share, margins and returns?

We've had a strong year-to-date outcome within e-commerce growing 50%, now about 14% of the business globally. So you're right, it's not far from closing in on that 20% level, particularly with those kind of growth rates.
Without going through all the details, you know that I've always viewed this channel and the development of this channel as being big, established and preferred brand-friendly, not an adverse situation, but a conducive situation for growth. We need to perform in this channel against all the vectors of superiority, just as we do in the others. But when we do that, there's no reason to expect that the outcome isn't as or more attractive than it is in some of the traditional retail channels.
If you look at your question about market share and margin, on an aggregate basis today, different by category, by country. But on an aggregate basis, our market share in e-commerce broadly defined, so pure-play and omni, is slightly higher, not by much, than our brick-and-mortar market shares. And I think that's more reflective of the demographics of the online shopper than it is anything else. Our margins are also, on aggregate, similar across the 2 channels. 
So we were in a very nice place that we aim to be in, which is we want to be channel-agnostic, serve shoppers wherever they choose to shop and be able to do that, as you rightly point out, in a way that's neutral to accretive to share margin and return. I think we're very well positioned, requires work every day, very volatile space. We keep our eye on the consumer and serving them with superior offerings, again, in categories where performance drives brand choice. We should continue to do well."

Jon, I think your back half guidance implies relatively modest inflation, including freight. I think it's around 1.5% of COGS, back of the envelope, not that substantial. So is that a factor of just early on, your hedges to the contracts haven't rolled off? And when they do, it's going to step up significantly. Or is there -- or is the magnitude of inflation that we're all talking about is somewhat sensationalized?"

The -- as we said in our prepared remarks, on a total fiscal year basis, the commodity impact to the bottom line is neutral. So it's not one of the things that I'm actually spending a lot of time on and overly focused on relative to some other things. 
There has been a recent increase in some of our exposures. But even if you look at -- if you were to take spot rates versus a year ago and annualize that as one evaluation of what the impact could be, it's modest compared to some of the significant commodity spikes that we've been through the last decade. It's also currently offset to a degree by FX.
The other thing is that within the total cost pool, there are significant increases reflected in the current results and in the current margin growth for operating in the environment that we've been operating in. And if vaccinations occur broadly and we return more to normality and economies accelerate and, therefore, put pressure on commodity markets, I would expect that some of these other costs that we've been incurring would abate. 
So much like the COVID impact on categories or markets, there are offsets that we have to consider when we look at commodities. And we need to look at the total picture as we think about pricing going forward, which we will do. But again, I think we could be having a very different conversation a quarter from now. But at this point, not a huge concern."

Stepping back, our strategic objective in establishing a different approach for enterprises markets was twofold: The first and primary objective was to enable leadership and the broad resources of the company to focus on the largest markets",424,"Thanks, Wendy. Stepping back, our strategic objective in establishing a different approach for enterprises markets was twofold: The first and primary objective was to enable leadership and the broad resources of the company to focus on the largest markets and most profitable markets of the company, what we call, not surprisingly, focused markets. And our progress there has accelerated pretty dramatically. And if that's all we accomplished, that would be a major step forward. So I just mentioned the U.S. and China, both growing 12% in the quarter, both growing double digits year-to-date. I, in no way, want to assert causality. That would be careless, but there's certainly nothing to indicate that increased focus in those markets has hurt us. It certainly appears to have helped us. So that was objective one.
Objective two was to ensure -- was ideally for these markets to continue to be a source of top line growth and a more dependable source of bottom line growth for the company by moving management of activity closer to the market, closer to consumers actually in the market with consumers, competitors and customers. And that generally has played out well as well. 
So we grew -- the enterprise markets grew top line. They grew bottom line last fiscal year. We got to a point at the end of the year where we had 2 countries within 100 enterprise markets that were losing money, which is a huge step forward from where we've been historically. And importantly, we did that while holding or building market share. So this wasn't a cost, if you will, to top line growth and development relative to the market. 
In an ideal world, to answer your question about the future, we would continue to enable a strong emphasis of resources on focused markets and manage the enterprise markets in a way that are accretive to company top line, accretive to company bottom line. And I think in a normalized post-COVID environment, that's possible. 
But we're being very selective in where we choose to win and how we choose to do that. And again, we want to be a source of support for the major markets in the company, both from the standpoint of enabling focus and from the standpoint of creating financial resource to do that while maintaining an option on the growth that these markets represent in the future. I'd be happy to spend more time. It's obviously a pretty full topic. But in general, we're progressing along the lines that we've set out to do."

COVID has exposed some of, for example, the supply chain weaknesses that exist within the ecosystem that have been supporting those retail partners.

And we don't build our manufacturing infrastructure for that kind of upside, though we're catching up here pretty quickly. But in general, we've been a very dependable source of supply. 
In general, consumers are shifting to known reputable brands. And obviously, our retail partners are consumer-centric themselves. One of the data that support that conclusion, if you look at private-label data as one example, market shares of private label in our categories are down in the U.S. for any time period you look at in the last 12 months. And we're talking significant -- relatively significant declines of up to a point, which on their base, is not a small number, and the same general dynamic in Europe. So retailers are looking to serve the changing needs of their consumers, and we do -- we are well positioned in that regard. 
Retailers are looking at their assortment. We're also looking at their inventory levels. And there will be pros and cons within that decision set that occur over time. But again, we're relatively well positioned. The dynamics obviously differ by market, with some markets that are more challenged even than ours from a COVID standpoint, focused almost exclusively on supply. And again, our supply chain sets us up pretty well to serve those retailers.
It's early days. We're still working through, as are they, the demand and supply dynamics. But I really think our position has been strengthened as a result of the experience and the response that we've all been working on."

I was wondering if you can perhaps give any sort of sense of where you see the disconnect with investors. And whether over time, it may make sense to be perhaps more aggressive on share buybacks?

But based on our analysis, the stock is trading really near 20-year lows, versus the market, looks extremely cheap to us. You have had problems on the M&A side with Billie, so maybe in terms of capital allocation long term, more buybacks. Just love to get your thoughts on that issue as well."

We view the market's job as focusing on P. And over time, a strong E with a strong P, as you know. I'm sorry I'm being so simplistic. 
In terms of share repurchase and capital return in general, if you go back to the beginning of this fiscal year, our estimated range of share repurchase was $6 billion to $8 billion, and we're now up to $10 billion. So if you look at the midpoint of the range, $7 billion to $10 billion, that's almost a 50% increase in our expectation of share repurchase for the current fiscal year. 
And if you look at the combination of dividend and share repurchase, that's $18 billion, 125% of all-in earnings, we have historically returned more than 100% of all-in earnings in the form of both dividends and share repurchase. I would expect us to continue on that journey. April is the timing in which we would next normally review capital allocation with our Board of Directors, including both dividend and share repurchase. But our belief here, Rob, is very simple. Excess cash is not ours. It's yours or the shareowners and will be, as it has historically been, returns to them. 
In terms of M&A as a part of capital allocation, we've been looking at and executing what have typically been relatively small acquisitions that fill in our portfolio in the categories that we've chosen to compete in, things like Native deodorant, things like This Is L. And then as you know and as you referenced, we looked at Billie within the Shave Care market. Those things by their size don't, in and of themselves, make much of an impact on our capital allocation choices. So I don't see any reason today -- again, this can change tomorrow as well. But as we sit here today, we're pretty committed to the course that we've been on, and I don't see anything that should cause us to run off those tracks.
Your question on how I spend my time. So we're in the middle of transitioning. Andre and I are in the middle of transitioning. He'll take over the CFO responsibilities March 1. I look forward to that, one, because he's an incredibly talented, committed and energetic leader; and two, as you rightly point out, that gives me a little bit more capacity to focus on a very volatile set of circumstances around the world. 
I will continue to have investor relations responsibility, as I mentioned earlier. From a function standpoint, I'll have responsibility for IT; for our global business services; for our sales function; our product supply function, including engineering procurement, manufacturing, distribution. I'll have responsibility -- continue to have responsibility for our market operations around the world and will continue, as you know, to have P&L responsibility for the 100-or-so enterprise markets. So I've got plenty to do, and I look forward to, as you mentioned, a little bit of additional capacity to focus on each of those items."

And remember -- so in terms of drivers, you're absolutely right on there being some impact from the November stock up. Also remember that consumer situation has changed measurably from, call it, October through to December and then January in terms of the amount of stimulus that was available, the lockdown situations in different parts of the world, the employment situation. All of which can reverse themselves fairly quickly, both from a policy standpoint and hopefully, from a human health standpoint. 
So I'm not looking at any of that as a foregone conclusion either for the rest of the year or for the future. But it's important, particularly when we have a quarter as strong as it is, to be holistic in our explanation of what's happening.

Joining me on the call today are Andre Schulten, Chief Financial Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Let me quickly summarize another strong quarter and then turn it over to Andre to provide additional perspectives. 
Organic sales were up 4% on the quarter, up 10% 2-year stacked. Global market share was up 40 basis points. Fiscal year-to-date through 3 quarters, organic sales are up 7%. Core earnings per share up 8% in the quarter, up 14% fiscal year-to-date. Free cash flow productivity over 100%. We're on track to deliver the top and bottom line guidance we've raised twice this fiscal. We're increasing estimates for the third time for free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners, which Andre will take us through. 
One more very important highlight, a 10% dividend increase, which we announced last Tuesday. The team has been managing very successfully with priorities I'll describe again later through volatility, uncertainty and some extreme challenges. COVID reopening in some markets increased viral spread, renewed lockdown and severe economic impact in others. Some are growing at very high rates, others essentially shut; FX and commodity volatility; event specific challenges like the blockage of the Suez Canal; transportation demand mismatched with supply; market-specific dynamics impacting operations in countries like Argentina, Myanmar and Lebanon; and a very mild cough cold season. That's just a very quick synopsis of strong top line, bottom line and cash results in a very challenging environment with a huge thanks to our team. For more perspective, Andre?"

Bottom line and market share growth along with strong cash generation and strong cash returns to shareowners. Organic sales were up 4% for the quarter, volume in line with year ago, 2 points of pricing, 2 points of positive mix. Organic sales growth was mixed across regions. Overall focus markets grew 5% with strong growth in our 2 largest markets: U.S. organic sales, up 7%; and Greater China sales were up 22%. European focus markets were down 2%, largely due to the impact of lockdowns in the region. Japan was down 5%. Enterprise markets were up 1% and were also mixed within the region. Latin America, up 8%. Asia, Middle East, Africa, in line with year ago quarter, and European enterprise markets were down 4%. 
We delivered strong organic sales growth in most categories: Home Care, up high teens; Oral Care, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care are high singles. Family Care and grooming, up mid-single; Fabric Care, up low singles. Feminine Care, organic sales were down low singles mainly due to market softness in Europe, but share trends remained strong in the region and on a global basis. Baby Care was down mid singles mainly due to market softness in Europe and heightened competitive activity in China. Importantly, Baby Care all outlet value share in the U.S. is up 130 basis points over the past 1 month and 80 basis points over the past 3 months. Personal Health Care organic sales were down mid singles, driven by a very weak cold flu season on top of difficult comparisons in the base period. U.S. sales in the respiratory category were down more than 40% in this March quarter versus last year. Despite the weak category trends, Vicks share was up for the quarter. E-commerce sales were up at about 50% fiscal year-to-date with no notes for change in shopping trends in the quarter. E-comm sales represent 40% of our global sales. Aggregate market share growth of 40 basis points this quarter. 
Turning to earnings. Core earnings per share were $1.26, up 8%; currency-neutral core EPS also up 8%. Core margin was up 30 basis points, up 80 basis points, excluding currency impacts. Core operating margin was in line with prior year, up 30 basis points, excluding currency impacts. We generated $4.1 billion in operating cash flow with free cash flow productivity at 106%. We returned $5 billion in cash to shareowners, $2 billion in dividends and $3 billion in share repurchase. Last week, we announced a 10% increase in our dividend, reflecting strong results and confidence in our future. This is the 65th consecutive annual dividend increase and 131st consecutive year in which P&G has paid a dividend. 
So 3 quarters into the year, organic sales up 7%, with global value share growing, core EPS, up 14%; x FX, up 16%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity over 100%, $14 billion of cash returned to shareowners, which is 120% of all-in earnings. Back to you, Jon."

Third priority is supporting the communities for agencies and people who are on the front lines of this global pandemic. These priorities are completely congruent with our strategic choices, which we remain confident in, and which are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and long-term value creation. 
We've focused our portfolio on daily use products in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority: product package, brand communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. Leading category market growth with superior offerings mathematically builds market share and builds business for our retail partners. We're continuing to invest in and behind superior offerings. We launched Dawn Powerwash just over a year ago. Its superior formula and unique spray technology provide powerful -- that cut -- and contact. Powerwash has become a welcome addition to consumers' dish care regimen with so many more meals being cooked at home. Powerwash delivered around $150 million in year 1 sales and was a significant contributor to Dawn's U.S. all outlet market share growth of more than 400 basis points over the period. 
Pampers Baby Dry in the U.S. took another step forward towards regaining superiority across all vectors. Baby Dry drive recently launched innovation, providing more absorbency, improved comfort and better leakage protection for dry and healthy skin. Product graphics were refreshed with improved leakage protection queues, and packaging was upgraded to introduce the claim #1 pediatrician recommended and hypoallergenic with no parabens or latex. Innovation includes improved in-store displays and online messaging to highlight the improved product packaging and communication. It's still very early in the launch as new products and packages just began shipping in the last month, and we're now just starting full commercialization. But this initiative represents an important step in reestablishing superiority in the mid-tier on Baby Care. 
Tide and Ariel are expanding their 2030 brand ambition to focus on decarbonizing laundry at every step, from design, manufacturing and distribution to consumer use and end of life while maintaining superior cleaning performance. Ariel's new campaign, Every Degree Makes a Difference, advocates lower washing temperatures. Up to 60% of laundry's carbon footprint comes from heating the water in washing machines. Lowering the wash temperature is the single most important thing we can all do to reduce the environmental impact of laundry. To do this, we continue to innovate to ensure superior performance in cold water. 
In China Hair Care, 2 examples of premium innovation launched in the fast-growing conditioner and treatment segments. Pantene Quench Shot masks and 3-Minute Miracle has successfully attracted new consumers to the Pantene brand as well as expanded the regimen of current Pantene shampoo consumers. These innovations have contributed to over 35% market growth in these segments online over the past 12 months. Greater China Hair care organic sales are up mid-teens fiscal year-to-date and were up 25% this quarter led by conditioners and treatments. 
The strategic need for investment to continue to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this crisis and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscores the importance of ongoing productivity. We're driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. 
Success in our highly competitive industry also requires agility that comes with the mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our new organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, following new demands, seamlessly supporting each other, to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. We executed well. They grow markets, which, in turn, grow share of sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, have served us well during these more recent volatile times that we believe will continue to serve us well post crisis. We're optimistic about our crisis prospects and, generally, like our hand. We will undoubtedly experience some volatility as we move through the crisis, and quarterly results will not move in a straight line and are more difficult to predict. 
In many countries, the number of COVID cases, unfortunately, are the worst they've been. Risk of supply chain disruption remains high. Channel closures will likely continue. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that also affect the prospects for category growth. Against this challenging backdrop, we continue to hold ourselves to an expectation of continued growth, top line and bottom line and expect to be highly cash generative. With that context, back to Andre to discuss guidance."

We are increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow product",440,"So with 3 strong quarters behind us and having raised guidance twice across all key metrics, we are maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth and core EPS growth for the fiscal year. We are increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity and cash returns to shareowners. We continue to expect organic sales growth in the range of 5% to 6% for the fiscal year. This outlook reflects continued volatility from both base period and current year dynamics, including a challenging fourth quarter base period in the U.S. and in Greater China and continued soft market conditions in Europe and in enterprise markets. Our core earnings per share guidance remains in the range of 8% to 10%. This bottom line outlook includes headwinds of approximately $150 million after-tax of foreign exchange and now more than $200 million after-tax of higher freight costs. Commodities are now forecast to be a headwind of approximately $125 million after tax. This is a $400 million swing to the negative since our initial guidance for the year with much of this impact affecting our fiscal fourth quarter. 
As we stand today, our internal estimates for organic sales growth are above the midpoint of the fiscal year guidance range. On the bottom line, we're trending towards the midpoint of the core EPS range. We are again raising our target for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% starting the year to now over 100%. We expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends and are further increasing our outlook for share repurchase from up to $10 billion to approximately $11 billion. Combined, we plan to return about $19 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or additional store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. 
The commodity cost challenges we face this year will obviously be larger next fiscal year. We will offset a portion of this impact with price increases. Our Baby Care, Feminine Care and adult incontinence businesses have announced price increases in the United States that will go into effect in mid-September. The exact timing and amount of increases vary by brand and sub-brand in the range of mid- to high single digits. As opportunities allow, we'll close a couple of price increases with new product innovations, adding value for consumers. We are analyzing raw material and foreign exchange impacts in other categories and markets, and we are assessing the need for additional pricing moves. Back to Jon for closing comments."

So can you just give us some perspective on this commodity spike and what we're seeing in terms of magnitude versus past cycles and your view on longevity? And then on the pricing front, as a response to that, I know you're not going to want to be precise on forward pricing. But just holistically, given the large magnitude of this commodity increase, I'd love to get a bit of a sense if it's nebulous on what sort of the end goal is with pricing eventually? Is it to fully cover commodity increases? Is it to mostly cover? It's obviously a timing lag, but sort of the ultimate offsets to higher cost through pricing, any perspective there? And then last, and apologies for the multipart question, but you're in the fortunate position of strong market share gains heading into this pricing cycle, and kudos. Obviously, a lot of hard work to be in that position. But how might that change your willingness to be bolder on pricing or even put at risk some of those market share gains that you do, in fact, take pricing?"

First, in comparison to prior cycles, this is one of the bigger increases in commodity costs that we've seen over the period of time that I've been involved with this, which is a fairly long period of time. That's not all bad. When commodities move significantly, and obviously, they affect everyone, including both manufacturer brands and own label retail brands, the industry has pushed to price. When they move modestly it can be much more difficult in that regard. We're also blessed to have very strong innovation in market and coming to market, which provides an opportunity to price in a value-accretive manner. We define value holistically. And we'll be looking -- our overall objective is to cover cost increases. It's important -- and I want to emphasize that, because I didn't say cover or restore margin. It's covering cost increases, which is inherently a little bit margin-dilutive, but we think that strikes the right balance, particularly when we can combine that pricing with innovation and increased perception of value across the portfolio. 
If we do that well, we should continue to grow markets, and we've talked about the math of growing markets. We do that disproportionately, which is certainly our intention. We will not lose share. We will, in effect, well, necessarily build share. All of that is easy to talk about. All of that is hard to execute. And it's done at a very detailed level by brand, by market. And so it will play out differently across the world. 
The last very important point on this topic I want to make, if we go back to large commodity cost increase cycles in the past, this company had not yet fully embedded productivity into its mindset and activity system, and that will be a significant part of this endeavor going forward as well. And we feel good about opportunities to continue to increase productivity to help us manage this situation."

Many of these markets do indeed represent significant challenges, and I think it's important we talk about that a little bit. So that's why I appreciate the question. The health situation in markets like India, Brazil, Turkey is worse than it's ever been. The number of new cases, the number of hospitalizations, the number of deaths, unfortunately, was higher in the last week and over the weekend than has ever been the case. These markets do not have the health care infrastructure nor the financial means to provide subsidies to their citizenry. And as a result, when this happens, employment is affected. Consumption is affected. GDP is down significantly in some of these markets. No better time to help and to serve our consumers at a time of real need. We need to do that in a profitable way.

But as we focus on superiority, drive market value, we have a business model that works as illustrated in the U.S. and Europe."

So I just wanted to come back, why only these categories and why only the U.S. because it's certainly far beyond just pulp? And then within that context, Jon, to your credit and to the team's credit, Procter has done a remarkable job here in terms of improving market share to put the company in a position to take price behind the leading brand portfolio in these circumstances. So I think the question is what is giving you pause here in terms of broader pricing beyond just the categories where you're seeing it following Kimberly's pricing announcement. So why just these categories and why just the U.S.? And then I'm sorry for being a little bit verbose here, but just on the commodity outlook, I think to the extent that you can quantify, I know you don't want to give guidance, but some further degree of quantification beyond just June, beyond just your fiscal year, I think would be helpful for folks."

Pricing is a topic that we are limited in the perspective that we can actually provide relative to specific brands in-country and brands that relate to specific brands and countries. I wouldn't -- I would suggest that we not take that reality and conclude necessarily, but the only categories we're taking pricing in are the ones that have been mentioned. And the only country that we're taking pricing is the one that has been mentioned. This will be a holistic effort with productivity in mind, with innovation in mind. We're -- our business model positions us on a relative basis well to deal with these situations for 2 reasons. One I've just mentioned, which is productivity is part of the culture, part of our DNA. We don't have to start a program. Our program for next year is well underway. The second, an even more important way, is an innovation-based business model, which positions us with opportunities to take pricing in a way that's actually value-accretive to consumers. And you can imagine that if you have those opportunities and they're spread out across the year, your pricing might be announced at different timing and might take effect at different times throughout the year. I would offer you 1 data point or 2 data points. Pricing has been -- and it speaks to the business model point. Pricing has been a positive contributor to our top line -- sorry, a neutral or a positive contributor, but mostly positive to our top line for 42 out of the last 46 quarters and 15 out of the last 16 years. That doesn't guarantee anything going forward, but it points to the -- again, the nature of our business model, which provides no guarantees but does put us in a relatively better position with ways to help the top line and the bottom line as we work to manage this and continue to create value. 
Relative to the question on impact of commodities for next year. As I said earlier, we are really early in the process of putting next year together, couple that with a very volatile, both commodity and FX environment, and I'd rather help you with specifics that are meaningful, closer to the beginning of the year."

The figures you referenced relative to channel growth are the correct figures as we see them. The growth is significant in both U.S. and China. Both markets have become even more competitive in the e-commerce channel, but I would argue that was true in brick-and-mortar channels as well or global market places becoming more global. And there's strong and healthy competition across channels and markets. 
The biggest opportunity for us from a superiority standpoint in the e-commerce channel, there are several. But fundamentally, first, second and third is, as you mentioned, superiority. That carries the day in this channel and categories where performance drives brand choice, as much as it does in every other channel. Now we need to scale our offerings in a way that best serve e-commerce and digital commerce consumers. And an example of one of the things we're working on there is packaging, particularly for liquid products, ensuring those products survive the journey to a consumer's home and when she opens box with delight. The conditions that, that bottle travels through are much more strenuous in an e-commerce context, and we need to have packaging that's designed for that in mind. So that's just an example. But the mindset of superiority across everything is the same in that channel as well as any other channels.

I want to call out that negative 40 basis points is not necessarily a negative structurally. Many of our premium propositions in the market come with significantly higher unit sales and unit profit, though with slightly dilutive gross margin mix impact. When you think about, for example, 50% premium on a unit sales basis, 20% higher penny profit but minus 6% on a margin perspective. So the same is true for Pampers Pure. When you think about fem care variants, so premiumization, to some degree, carries a margin impact, but we much prefer the penny profit over the margin as we follow that strategy."

For many of the prestige beauty companies, big parts of their business were severely impacted by COVID. Think about salon-based treatments, offerings that went through specialty beauty channels, which are effectively shut, as an example, travel retail. And as a result, they are smartly investing in a category that continues to offer significant growth, is very profitable and is open, and that is China Skin Care. So one dynamic that we have happening is a lot of competitive activity. That's not inherently bad. That grows markets. And if you look at, for example, SK-II, we grew SK-II globally strong double digits, over 30% in the quarter that we just completed. Within that, Mainland China, we grew over 50%. Part of that dynamic is something else that's going on, which is the movement of purchase from travel retail and from travel in general, so for example, consumers traveling to Japan to buy prestige beauty products, which they are no longer doing. That purchase that, consumption has not gone away, and that purchase is shifting into the Chinese market, which is feeding significant growth if you report business on a mainland China basis. But it's very encouraging that we're delivering the growth that we are in SK-II. It's been a little bit tougher for Olay, simply because one of the mechanisms that companies are using to compete and take advantage of this opportunity is to reduce prices. And so the gap between Olay and some of the others kind of changes the competitive dynamic. And quite frankly, we need to work to premiumize our lines even more to be fully competitive with some of these brands, which we're in the midst of doing. But overall, beauty grew 7%.

How much of that should we be thinking about sticking in the business? I hear you on the commodities and the pricing and pricing to protect how you were referring to before on margin. So can you maybe help us a little bit more about how much of that is maybe leverage from stronger sales and how much of that can actually continue on a go-forward basis? Maybe just sort of puts and takes that we don't necessarily see in looking at the numbers."

And we've been very clear about that from the beginning. I also think that you need to be careful when you think just about commodities in terms of its effect on the gross margin, even on a net basis of pricing because that's not the only thing going on. So for example, there have been significant cost increases associated with COVID in terms of being able to operate safely and successfully that we would expect over some period of time, God willing, as we get through this, both here and in other countries could be an opportunity for productivity and cost reduction. So this -- I've talked about this many times, but there's a chart that I show our leadership team meeting, our team whenever we get together, which simply shows the importance of the combination of sales growth and margin growth and delivering top third TSR. And the simple fact is that if we don't grow margin and we want to deliver top third TSR, we would need to be comfortable sustainably growing sales, organic sales 8% every year. And that's not something that our industry has historically done. It's not something we've historically done, but we remain committed through our innovation programs, through productivity, through the right amount of pricing to continue some level of operating margin growth."

In aggregate, our market shares in e-commerce are about equal to brick-and-mortar. There are countries where it's lower. There are countries where it's higher. There are categories where it's lower. There are categories where it's higher. And the same is true generally for margin. So all that put together wouldn't necessarily indicate that were preferenced by the development of one channel versus the other. And of course, you also get into -- increasingly, we should be talking about digital commerce. And  that is, as someone mentioned earlier on the call, just as important for Walmart or Target as it is for Amazon or Alibaba. So when we think about channel differences, that historically, in the past, was a customer difference. That's no longer the case. So there's a blending that's occurring as well. But we are very comfortable and, in fact, encouraged by the development of digital commerce in general across all of those forms. We feel we're well positioned. Andre mentioned some of the reasons earlier. I have talked ad nauseum about how this is actually a limited assortment environment as opposed to an unlimited assortment environment. And as a result, how the barriers to entry can be even higher for non leading brands in some of these channels. But we want to be available, relevant, super attractive, wherever consumers want to shop, and if it happens to be more digital commerce, we're prepared to serve. 
So I think that's -- yes, I want to thank everybody for your time. I really do feel we're in a good place, albeit with challenges, as we've talked in this call. Again, I go to -- let me just quickly go through one dynamic. We talked about how -- the biggest question that I get is, what's this all going to look like post COVID. And I look at just a couple of things as indicators of that. I don't have the full answer. But if we go back to a COVID-normalized, non-affected environment, so how are we growing pre COVID? We were growing the top line at about 6%. We were growing the bottom line high singles. So very strong momentum with the current strategy and a portfolio of leading brands and daily use categories for performance stage franchise and a very effective, highly competent organization executing against that strategy. All of that has carried forward into COVID and has built momentum. So fiscal year-to-date, as we were talking earlier, organic sales up 7% core earnings per share up 14%. 
And if we flash forward to a transition to post COVID normal, whatever that looks like. I would just point to 2 data points. Our 2 largest markets, the U.S. is arguably beginning the transition to a new normal; China has arguably transitioned to a new level or closer to that than most other large countries. In the U.S., in the last quarter, we grew 7% on the top line. In China in the last quarter, we grew 22% on the top line, albeit against a base that was partly lockdown-affected. If you look at it on a 2-year stack basis, we're up 12%. We are also importantly globally, on an aggregate basis, building share. And none of that is to brag, and none of that is to guarantee future success. But as I look at that combination of data, it's hard to believe that those same strategies, brands, people that delivered success pre COVID and during COVID are all of a sudden not going to be delivering attractive results. And that's our commitment and our plan. With that, we'll let you go. Again, thank you very, very much for your time this morning."

Organic sales were up 4% on the quarter, up 10% 2-year stacked. Global market share was up 40 basis points. Fiscal year-to-date through 3 quarters, organic sales are up 7%. Core earnings per share, up 8% in the quarter, up 14% fiscal year-to-date. Free cash flow productivity over 100%. We're on track to deliver the top and bottom line guidance we've raised twice this fiscal. We're increasing estimates for the third time for free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners, which Andre will take us through. 
One more very important highlight, a 10% dividend increase, which we announced last Tuesday. The team has been managing very successfully with priorities I'll describe again later through volatility, uncertainty and some extreme challenges. COVID reopening in some markets increased viral spread, renewed lockdown and severe economic impact in others. Some of them are growing at very high rates, others essentially shut; FX and commodity volatility; event-specific challenges like the blockage of the Suez Canal; transportation demand mismatched with supply; market-specific dynamics impacting operations in countries like Argentina, Myanmar and Lebanon; and a very mild cough cold season. That's just a very quick synopsis of strong top line, bottom line and cash results in a very challenging environment with a huge thanks to our team. For more perspective, Andre?"

Bottom line and market share growth along with strong cash generation and strong cash returns to shareowners. Organic sales were up 4% for the quarter, volume in line with the year ago, 2 points of pricing, 2 points of positive mix. Organic sales growth was mixed across regions. Overall focus markets grew 5% with strong growth in our 2 largest markets: U.S. organic sales, up 7%; and Greater China sales were up 22%. European focus markets were down 2%, largely due to the impact of lockdowns in the region. Japan was down 5%. Enterprise markets were up 1% and were also mixed within the region. Latin America, up 8%. Asia, Middle East, Africa, in line with the year ago quarter, and European enterprise markets were down 4%.  
We delivered strong organic sales growth in most categories: Home Care, up high teens; Oral Care, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care, up high singles; Family Care and grooming, up mid-singles; Fabric Care, up low singles; Feminine Care, organic sales were down low singles mainly due to market softness in Europe, but share trends remained strong in the region and on a global basis; Baby Care was down mid singles mainly due to market softness in Europe and heightened competitive activity in China. Importantly, Baby Care all-outlet value share in the U.S. is up 130 basis points over the past 1 month and 80 basis points over the past 3 months. 
Personal Health Care organic sales were down mid singles, driven by a very weak cold flu season on top of difficult comparisons in the base period. U.S. sales in the respiratory category were down more than 40% in this March quarter versus last year. Despite the weak category trends, Vicks' share was up for the quarter. E-commerce sales were up at about 50% fiscal year-to-date with no notes for change in shopping trends in the quarter. E-comm sales represent 40% of our global sales. Aggregate market share growth of 40 basis points this quarter. 
Turning to earnings. Core earnings per share were $1.26, up 8%; currency-neutral core EPS also up 8%. Core margin was up 30 basis points, up 80 basis points, excluding currency impacts. Core operating margin was in line with prior year, up 30 basis points, excluding currency impacts. We generated $4.1 billion in operating cash flow with free cash flow productivity at 106%. We returned $5 billion in cash to shareholders, $2 billion in dividends and $3 billion in share repurchase. Last week, we announced a 10% increase in our dividend, reflecting strong results and confidence in our future. This is the 65th consecutive annual dividend increase and 131st consecutive year in which P&G has paid a dividend.  
So 3 quarters into the year, organic sales up 7%, with global value share growing, core EPS, up 14%; x-FX, up 16%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity over 100%, $14 billion of cash returned to shareowners, which is 120% of all-in earnings. Back to you, Jon."

First is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world; second, maximizing the availability of products we produce to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs; third priority is supporting the communities with weak agencies and people who are on the front lines of this global pandemic. These priorities are completely congruent with our strategic choices, which we remain confident in, and which are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and long-term value creation.  
We've focused our portfolio on daily use products in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority: product package, brand communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. Leading category market growth with superior offerings mathematically builds market share and builds business for our retail partners. We're continuing to invest in and behind superior offerings. We launched Dawn Powerwash just over a year ago. Its superior formula and unique spray technology provide powerful suds that cut when its on-contact. Powerwash has become a welcome addition to consumers' dish care regimen with so many more meals being cooked at home. Powerwash delivered around $150 million in year 1 sales and was a significant contributor to Dawn's U.S. all outlet market share growth of more than 400 basis points over the period.  
Pampers Baby Dry in the U.S. took another step forward towards regaining superiority across all vectors. Baby Dry drive recently launched innovation, providing more absorbency, improved comfort and better leakage protection for dry and healthy skin. Product graphics were refreshed with improved leakage protection queues, and packaging was upgraded to introduce the claim #1 pediatrician recommended and hypoallergenic with no parabens or latex. Innovation includes improved in-store displays and online messaging to highlight the improved product packaging and communication.  
It's still very early in the launch as new products and packages just began shipping in the last month, and we're now just starting full commercialization. But this initiative represents an important step in reestablishing superiority in the mid-tier on Baby Care.  
Tide and Ariel are expanding their 2030 brand ambition to focus on decarbonizing laundry at every step, from design, manufacturing and distribution to consumer use and end of life while maintaining superior cleaning performance. Ariel's new campaign, ""Every Degree Makes a Difference"" ,advocates lower washing temperatures. Up to 60% of laundry's carbon footprint comes from heating the water in washing machines. Lowering the wash temperature is the single most important thing we can all do to reduce the environmental impact of laundry. To do this, we continue to innovate to ensure superior performance in cold water.  
In China Hair Care, 2 examples of premium innovation launched in the fast-growing conditioner and treatment segments. Pantene Quench Shot masks and 3 Minute Miracle has successfully attracted new consumers to the Pantene brand as well as expanded the regiment of current Pantene shampoo consumers. These innovations have contributed to over 35% market growth in these segments online over the past 12 months. Greater China Hair Care organic sales are up mid-teens fiscal year-to-date and were up 25% this quarter led by conditioners and treatments.  
The strategic need for investment to continue to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this crisis and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscores the importance of ongoing productivity. We're driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet.  
Success in our highly competitive industry also requires agility that comes with the mindset of constructive disruption. A willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our new organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, following to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other, to deliver against our priorities around the world. 
These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. If executed well, they grow markets, which, in turn, grow shares, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, have served us well during these more recent volatile times, and we believe will continue to serve us well post crisis. We're optimistic about our crisis prospects and, generally, we like our hand. We will undoubtedly experience some volatility as we move through the crisis, and quarterly results will not move in a straight line and are more difficult to predict.  
In many countries, the number of COVID cases, unfortunately, are the worst they've been. Risk of supply chain disruption remains high. Channel closures will likely continue. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that also affect the prospects for category growth. Against this challenging backdrop, we continue to hold ourselves to an expectation of continued growth, top line and bottom line and expect to be highly cash generative. With that context, back to Andre to discuss guidance."

We are increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity and cash returns to shareowners. We continue to expect organic sales growth in the range of 5% to 6% for the fiscal year. 
This outlook reflects continued volatility from both base period and current year dynamics, including a challenging fourth quarter base period in the U.S. and in Greater China and continued soft market conditions in Europe and in enterprise markets. Our core earnings per share guidance remains in the range of 8% to 10%. This bottom line outlook includes headwinds of approximately $150 million after-tax of foreign exchange and now more than $200 million after-tax of higher freight costs. Commodities are now forecast to be a headwind of approximately $125 million after tax. This is a $400 million swing to the negative since our initial guidance for the year with much of this impact affecting our fiscal fourth quarter.  
As we stand today, our internal estimates for organic sales growth are above the midpoint of the fiscal year guidance range. On the bottom line, we're trending towards the midpoint of the core EPS range. We are again raising our target for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% starting the year to now over 100%. We expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends and are further increasing our outlook for share repurchase from up to $10 billion to approximately $11 billion. Combined, we plan to return about $19 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or additional store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range.  
The commodity cost challenges we face this year will obviously be larger next fiscal year. We will offset a portion of this impact with price increases. Our Baby Care, Feminine Care and adult incontinence businesses have announced price increases in the United States that will go into effect in mid-September. The exact timing and amount of increases vary by brand and sub-brand in the range of mid- to high single digits. As opportunities allow, we'll close a couple of price increases with new product innovations, adding value for consumers. We are analyzing raw material and foreign exchange impacts in other categories and markets, and we are assessing the need for additional pricing moves. Back to Jon for closing comments."

So can you just give us some perspective on this commodity spike and what we're seeing in terms of magnitude versus past cycles and your view on longevity? And then on the pricing front, as a response to that, I know you're not going to want to be precise on forward pricing. But just holistically, given the large magnitude of this commodity increase, I'd love to get a bit of a sense, even if it's nebulous, on what sort of the end goal is with pricing eventually. Is it to fully cover commodity increases? Is it to mostly cover? 
There's obviously a timing lag, but sort of the ultimate offsets to higher cost through pricing, any perspective there? And then last, and apologies for the multipart question, but you're in the fortunate position of strong market share gains heading into this pricing cycle, and kudos. Obviously, a lot of hard work to be in that position. But how might that change your willingness to be bolder on pricing or even put at risk some of those market share gains that you do, in fact, take pricing?"

First, in comparison to prior cycles, this is one of the bigger increases in commodity costs that we've seen over the period of time that I've been involved with this, which is a fairly long period of time. That's not all bad. When commodities move significantly, and obviously, they affect everyone, including both manufacturer brands and own label retail brands, the industry has pushed to price. When they move modestly, it can be much more difficult in that regard. 
We're also blessed to have very strong innovation in market and coming to market, which provides an opportunity to price in a value-accretive manner. We define value holistically. And we'll be looking -- our overall objective is to cover cost increases. It's important, and I want to emphasize that, because I didn't say cover or restore margin. It's covering cost increases, which is inherently a little bit margin-dilutive, but we think that strikes the right balance, particularly when we can combine that pricing with innovation and increased perception of value across the portfolio.  
If we do that well, we should continue to grow markets, and we've talked about the math of growing markets. We do that disproportionately, which is certainly our intention. We will not lose share. We will, in effect, well, necessarily build share. All of that is easy to talk about. All of that is hard to execute. And it's done at a very detailed level by brand, by market. And so it will play out differently across the world.  
The last and very important point on this topic I want to make, if we go back to large commodity cost increase cycles in the past, this company had not yet fully embedded productivity into its mindset and activity system, and that will be a significant part of this endeavor going forward as well. And we feel good about opportunities to continue to increase productivity to help us manage this situation."

Many of these markets do indeed represent significant challenges, and I think it's important we talk about that a little bit. So that's why I appreciate the question. The health situation in markets like India, Brazil, Turkey is worse than it's ever been. The number of new cases, the number of hospitalizations, the number of deaths, unfortunately, was higher in the last week and over the weekend than has ever been the case. These markets do not have the health care infrastructure nor the financial means to provide subsidies to their citizenry. 
And as a result, when this happens, employment is affected. Consumption is affected. GDP is down significantly in some of these markets. No better time to help and to serve our consumers at a time of real need. We need to do that in a profitable way. And frankly, we, knock on wood, have never been more profitable in any of those markets than we are as we sit here conversing today. So the operational discipline that's required is significant. We will have to make choices, but I fully expect, to the main point of your question, that these will be markets that will continue to offer top and bottom line growth opportunities for our company."

Can we talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in Baby and Family, specifically, because you call out retailer destocking and higher competitive activity? I guess just curious if you see that continuing. And if so, I guess, how does that impact your decision to follow what we heard from Kimberly-Clark on announced pricing in the U.S., but doing so on a 2.5 to 3-month lag and seemingly only on Baby and Feminine in the comments, yet not on Family Care categories? 
So just how should investors interpret that tactical positioning in the context of ultimately doing what's optimal for category growth? And I guess kind of relatedly, is there anything that you've announced today preclude other revenue growth management activities that might help drive higher net price in Baby and Family overall as we go forward? I guess, specifically, I'm thinking about potential de-sheeting or other kind of net price accretive activities in tissue categories that might not be a list price increase."

We are pricing in the 3 categories that you mentioned because that's where the commodity costs are -- the increases are the more significant. It's really that simple. From a Family Care standpoint, demand continues to be strong. We grew family care 5% in the quarter that we just completed. That's even despite some reduction in household pantry inventory. But usage at home continues to be above pre-COVID levels, and we're managing the balance between home inventory, store inventory and our own production very, very carefully.

And where we do that successfully, we see the results turning. You've heard us talk about value share being up 130 basis points plus 1. 
In Europe, where we've also invested in  superiority, France, Germany, Spain, Russia, are all up in terms of where you share significantly in excess of a point. So bringing innovation at the same time as we price is the ideal scenario, which we are pushing in the U.S. Now slower growth rates and commodity pressures will continue to be headwinds. So we need to acknowledge that. So productivity will also be a continued element of that toolbox we have to use to drive growth. But as we focus on superiority, drive market value, we have a business model that works as illustrated in the U.S. and Europe."

So just in the interest of clarity here, the pricing that you outlined for the U.S. in Baby, Fem and Adult Care comes behind Kimberly's announcement.

So I just wanted to come back, why only these categories and why only the U.S. because it's certainly far beyond just pulp? And then within that context, Jon, to your credit and to the team's credit, Procter has done a remarkable job here in terms of improving market share to put the company in a position to take price behind the leading brand portfolio in these circumstances. 
So I think the question is what is giving you pause here in terms of broader pricing beyond just the categories where you're seeing it following Kimberly's pricing announcement. So why just these categories and why just the U.S.? And then I'm sorry for being a little bit verbose here, but just on the commodity outlook, I think to the extent that you can quantify, I know you don't want to give guidance, but some further degree of quantification beyond just June, beyond just your fiscal year, I think would be helpful for folks."

Pricing is a topic that we are limited in the perspective that we can actually provide relative to specific brands in-country and brands that relate to specific brands and countries. I wouldn't -- I would suggest that we not take that reality and conclude necessarily, but the only categories we're taking pricing in are the ones that have been mentioned. And the only country that we're taking pricing in is the one that has been mentioned. This will be a holistic effort with productivity in mind, with innovation in mind. We're -- our business model positions us on a relative basis well to deal with these situations for 2 reasons. 
One I've just mentioned, which is productivity is part of the culture, part of our DNA. We don't have to start a program. Our program for next year is well underway. The second is -- and even more important way, is an innovation-based business model, which positions us with opportunities to take pricing in a way that's actually value-accretive to consumers. And you can imagine that if you have those opportunities and they're spread out across the year, your pricing might be announced at different timing and might take effect at different times throughout the year. 
I would offer you 1 data point or 2 data points. Pricing has been, and it speaks to the business model point. Pricing has been a positive contributor to our top line -- sorry, a neutral or a positive contributor, but mostly positive to our top line for 42 out of the last 46 quarters and 15 out of the last 16 years. That doesn't guarantee anything going forward, but it points to the -- again, the nature of our business model, which provides no guarantees, but does put us in a relatively better position with ways to help the top line and the bottom line as we work to manage this and continue to create value.  
Relative to the question on impact of commodities for next year. As I said earlier, we are really early in the process of putting next year together, couple that with a very volatile, both commodity and FX environment, and I'd rather help you with specifics that are meaningful, closer to the beginning of the year."

The figures you referenced relative to channel growth are the correct figures as we see them. The growth is significant in both U.S. and China. Both markets have become even more competitive in the e-commerce channel, but I would argue that it was true in brick-and-mortar channels as well or global market places becoming more global. And there's strong and healthy competition across channels and markets.  
The biggest opportunity for us from a superiority standpoint in the e-commerce channel, and there are several. But fundamentally, first, second and third is, as you mentioned, superiority. That carries the day in this channel in categories where performance drives brand choice, as much as it does in every other channel. Now we need to scale our offerings in a way that best serve e-commerce and digital commerce consumers. 
And an example of one of the things we're working on there is packaging, particularly for liquid products, ensuring those products survive the journey to a consumer's home and when she opens that box with delight. The conditions that, that bottle travels through are much more strenuous in an e-commerce context, and we need to have packaging that's designed for that in mind. So that's just an example.

So from a gross margin perspective, you will have seen, we have about a negative 40 basis points from mix. We're actually being helped by the strong growth that we see in the U.S. and China from a region mix perspective. But you see negative segment mix impacting the quarter by -- mainly driven by faster growth in Home Care and in Appliances and Personal Health Care being down on the quarter. I want to call out that negative 40 basis points is not necessarily a negative structurally. 
Many of our premium propositions in the market come with significantly higher unit sales and unit profit, though with slightly dilutive gross margin mix impact. And when you think about price cost, for example, 50% premium on a unit sales basis, 20% higher penny profit but minus 6% on a margin perspective. So the same is true for Pampers Pure. When you think about Fem Care Radiant variants, so premiumization, to some degree, carries a margin impact, but we'd much prefer the penny profit over the margin as we follow that strategy."

For many of the prestige beauty companies, big parts of their business were severely impacted by COVID. Think about salon-based treatments, offerings that went through specialty beauty channels, which are effectively shut, as an example, travel retail. And as a result, they are smartly investing in a category that continues to offer significant growth, is very profitable and is open, and that is China Skin Care. So one dynamic that we have happening is a lot of competitive activity. That's not inherently bad. That grows markets. 
And if you look at, for example, SK-II, we grew SK-II globally strong double digits, over 30% in the quarter that we just completed. Within that, Mainland China, we grew over 50%. Part of that dynamic is something else that's going on, which is the movement of purchase from travel retail and from travel in general, so for example, consumers traveling to Japan to buy prestige beauty products, which they are no longer doing. That purchase that, consumption has not gone away, and that purchase is shifting in into the Chinese market, which is feeding significant growth if you report business on a mainland China basis. But it's very encouraging that we're delivering the growth that we are in SK-II. 
It's been a little bit tougher for Olay, simply because one of the mechanisms that companies are using to compete and take advantage of this opportunity is to reduce prices. And so the gap between Olay and some of the others kind of changes the competitive dynamic. And quite frankly, we need to work to premiumize our line even more to be fully competitive with some of these brands, which we're in the midst of doing. But overall, beauty grew 7%. Skin and Personal Care grew 7%. Hair Care grew 7%. We've grown organic sales for 22 quarters. It's a business we really like, and SK-II is an important part of it, as is Olay."

How much of that should we be thinking about sticking in the business? 
I hear you on the commodities and the pricing and pricing to protect how you were referring to before on margin. So can you maybe help us a little bit more about how much of that is maybe leverage from stronger sales and how much of that can actually continue on a go-forward basis? Maybe just sort of puts and takes that we don't necessarily see in looking at the numbers."

And we've been very clear about that from the beginning. I also think that you need to be careful when you think just about commodities in terms of its effect on the gross margin, even on a net basis of pricing because that's not the only thing going on. So for example, there have been significant cost increases associated with COVID in terms of being able to operate safely and successfully that we would expect over some period of time, God willing, as we get through this, both here and in other countries, could be an opportunity for productivity and cost reduction. 
So I -- this -- I've talked about this many times, but there's a chart that I show our leadership team meeting, our team whenever we get together, which simply shows the importance of the combination of sales growth and margin growth and delivering top third TSR. And the simple fact is that if we don't grow margin, and we want to deliver top third TSR, we would need to be comfortable sustainably growing sales, organic sales 8% every year. And that's not something that our industry has historically done. It's not something we've historically done, but we remain committed through our innovation programs, through productivity, through the right amount of pricing to continue some level of operating margin growth."

So I would ask, are you as stronger in categories that have developed more in e-commerce? And are you more profitable in totality, in your judgment, in those categories?

In aggregate, our market shares in e-commerce are about equal to brick-and-mortar. There are countries where it's lower. There are countries where it's higher. There are categories where it's lower. There are categories where it's higher. And the same is true generally for margin. So all that put together wouldn't necessarily indicate that we're preferenced by the development of one channel versus the other. And of course, you also get into -- increasingly, we should be talking about digital commerce. And that is, as someone mentioned earlier on the call, just as important for Walmart or Target as it is for Amazon or Alibaba. 
So when we think about channel differences, that historically, in the past, was a customer difference. That's no longer the case. So there's a blending that's occurring as well. But we are very comfortable and, in fact, encouraged by the development of digital commerce in general across all of those forms. We feel we're well positioned. Andre mentioned some of the reasons earlier. 
I have talked ad nauseum about how this is actually a limited-assortment environment as opposed to an unlimited-assortment environment. And as a result, how the barriers to entry can be even higher for nonleading brands in some of these channels. But we want to be available, relevant, super attractive, wherever consumers want to shop, and if it happens to be more digital commerce, we're prepared to serve.  
So I think that's -- yes, I want to thank everybody for your time. I really do feel we're in a good place, albeit with challenges, as we've talked in this call. Again, I go to -- let me just quickly go through one dynamic. We talked about how -- the biggest question that I get is, what's this all going to look like post-COVID? And I look at just a couple of things as indicators of that. I don't have the full answer. But if we go back to a COVID-normalized, nonaffected environment, so how are we growing pre-COVID? We were growing the top line at about 6%. We were growing the bottom line high singles. So very strong momentum with the current strategy and a portfolio of leading brands and daily use categories where performance drives brand choice and a very effective, highly competent organization executing against that strategy. All of that has carried forward into COVID and has built momentum. So fiscal year-to-date, as we were talking earlier, organic sales up 7%, core earnings per share up 14%. 
And if we flash forward to a transition to post-COVID normal, whatever that looks like, I would just point to 2 data points: our 2 largest markets, the U.S. is arguably beginning a transition to a new normal; China has arguably transitioned to a new level or closer to that than most other large countries. In the U.S., in the last quarter, we grew 7% on the top line. 
In China in the last quarter, we grew 22% on the top line, albeit against a base that was partly lockdown-affected. If you look at it on a 2-year stack basis, we're up 12%. We are also importantly globally, on an aggregate basis, building share. And none of that is to brag, and none of that is to guarantee future success. But as I look at that combination of data, it's hard to believe that those same strategies, brands, people that delivered success pre-COVID and during COVID are all of a sudden not going to be delivering attractive results. And that's our commitment and our plan. With that, we'll let you go. Again, thank you very, very much for your time this morning."

Last evening, we announced that I will retire as CEO on November 1, and Jon Moeller was elected as the incoming CEO. I will remain as Executive Chair of the Board. 
We also announced that Shailesh Jejurikar, has been elected Chief Operating Officer effective October 1, 2021, transitioning behind Jon Moeller. These moves have been thoughtfully planned and provide P&G with highly capable and experienced leadership going forward. I truly have full confidence and strongly support these changes. 
Jon, you know well. He has a distinguished track record throughout his 33-year career with P&G, including more than 12 years as CFO. More recently, Jon added responsibility as Vice Chairman and then Chief Operating Officer with P&L sponsoring ownership for our enterprise markets. 
In my nearly 6 years as CEO, I've had the benefit of partnering with Jon and an outstanding global leadership team to integrate a comprehensive set of strategies to guide our choices and priorities. 
Now to go back, in 2012, Jon led the initial work to make productivity an integral part of P&G's business. Our team doubled down on this strategy when we announced our second 5-year $10 billion cost savings program in 2017. Today, productivity is built into our operating model and is an ongoing part of our strategy in every part of our business. 
We worked together for several years to focus the company's portfolio on faster growing, more profitable daily use categories where products solve problems and performance drives consumer brand choice. The team largely completed this work with the divestiture of several fashion-driven beauty categories in 2016. This strategy continues to guide our disciplined approach to managing our category and brand portfolio. 
At the CAGNY conference in 2016, we first discussed the tests we were doing on a new approach to our organization design. We refined and formalized the plans and announced the new focused market and enterprise market design at our November 2018 Analyst Day. Our objective was to create a more engaged, agile and accountable organization, which is exactly what we've done. 
In April 2017, we first discussed our work to set a much higher bar for measuring the success of our innovation and execution across products, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. If there were any doubts about the importance of consistently delivering irresistible superiority, our results over the last few years should have put those to bed. 
 
And finally, in 2018, we first talked about the need to lead constructive disruption in our highly dynamic and competitive industry. We continue to drive disruption in innovation, brand building, digitization, supply chain transformation and with our citizenship and ESG efforts. 
Over several years, through many challenges, our organization responded brilliantly as we integrated each element of the strategy, building momentum that is evident in our results in the past 3 fiscal years. The team fully embraced the idea that we must be willing to change anything and everything needed to win. The only things we will not change are our purpose, values and principles and our commitment to winning. 
This has been especially evident during the continuing COVID crisis, where the organization has demonstrated tremendous agility to meet the needs of consumers, while ensuring the safety of our employees and supporting communities around the world to deal with the impacts of this crisis. Through all of it, delivering results that should delight owners and do it in a way that makes us proud to be P&G-iers. 
Put simply, our strategies are working, our team is outstanding, and I could not be more confident in the next generation of leadership that will take the range of P&G later this year. 
Now I'll turn it over to Andre Schulten, Chief Financial Officer, to lead us through the fiscal year 2021 fourth quarter and year-end earnings announcement. Andre?"

Joining David and me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. 
I'll start with an overview of company results for fiscal '21 and fourth quarter, and David will add perspective on our immediate priorities and strategic focus areas. We'll close with guidance for fiscal '22 and then take your questions. 
Fiscal 2021 was another very strong year. Our focus on superiority and strong investment in the business [indiscernible] with strong productivity improvements and cost savings drove market growth, and in turn, strong sales share, earnings and cash results leading to balanced growth and value creation. 
Organic sales for the fiscal year grew more than 6%, up more than 12% on a 2-year stack. Growth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing or holding organic sales. Home Care, up high teens; Oral Care, up double digits; Skin & Personal Care, up high single digits; Grooming, Fabric Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care and Personal Health Care organic sales, each up mid-single digits. Family Care grew low singles. Baby Care was in line with prior year. 
We delivered strong results in our 2 largest and most funded at over $10 billion in sales, representing 14% of company total. 
Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points, 33 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the fiscal year. 
All outlet value share in the U.S. improved through the year growing from 33% over the past 12 months to 33.5% for the past 6 months to 34% over the past quarter, one of the highest absolute value shares in the last 20 years. Consumers are increasingly choosing P&G brands. 
We translated the strong top line growth into strong earnings and cash results. Core earnings per share grew 11% for the year. Currency-neutral core EPS was also up 11%. Within this, core gross margin expanded 20 basis points, up 60 basis points, excluding currency impacts. Core operating margin grew 80 basis points, up 130 points, excluding currency impacts. 
Productivity improvements helped operating margin by 250 basis points, enabling strong reinvestment in marketing programs. Advertising was at 10.8% of sales, an increase of more than 40 basis points. 
Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 107%. We increased our dividend by 10% and returned $19 billion of value to share owners, $8 billion in dividends and $11 billion in share repurchase. 
Moving on to the April-June quarter. Organic sales grew 4%. Volume, pricing and mix each contributed more than 1 point to top line growth. Growth rates by market reflected the volatility in shipments in the base period. 
Organic sales were down 1% in the U.S. However, this is still 18% growth on a 2-year stack. Recall that in the April-June quarter last year, organic sales were up 19% in the U.S., 13 points above tracked channel sales as we work to restock depleted trade inventories. 
Organic sales in Greater China were up 5%, also comping a strong base period. On a 2-year stack, Greater China, up 19%. 
Focus markets were up 2%. Enterprise markets were up 14% in the quarter. Strong market share trends with aggregate global value share up 70 basis points. 
All outlet share in the U.S. increased 260 basis points for the quarter to 34.1%. 
On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.13, down 3% versus prior year, down 4% on a currency-neutral basis, mainly due to gross margin pressure from higher input costs as we had anticipated. 
Core gross margin decreased 260 basis points. Currency-neutral core gross margin also down 260 points. This includes 220 basis point impact from higher commodity and freight costs, nearly $400 million in just this quarter. We also saw a sharp headwind from mix of 210 basis points, mainly geographic mix impacts. 
Recall that in our fourth quarter last year, the U.S. and China accounted for more than 100% of organic sales growth. In this year's fourth quarter, enterprise markets lead the growth. 
Core operating margin decreased 230 basis points. Currency-neutral core operating margin declined 210 basis points. Productivity improvements were 320 basis points help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was 117%. 
In summary, we exceeded each of our going-in targets for the year: Organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareholders. Our team has operated with excellent discipline in a challenging and volatile environment. 
And with that, I'll pass it back to David."
33328,715199442,2356549,"The Procter & Gamble Company, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","The Procter & Gamble Company","Executives","Thanks, Andre. As I said at the outset, our team has done some outstanding work over the last 18 months to manage through the challenges of the COVID crisis and make our business even stronger in the process.

As I said at the outset, our team has done some outstanding work over the last 18 months to manage through the challenges of the COVID crisis and make our business even stronger in the process. 
In our April earnings call last year, we said we would step forward into the challenge of COVID, not back. We said we would double down to serve consumers, and that's exactly what our team has done. 
As we continue to manage the crisis, we'll remain focused on the 3 priorities that have been guiding our near-term actions and choices. First is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second, maximizing the availability of our products to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. And third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the front lines of this global pandemic. 
The strategic choices I outlined earlier are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and long-term value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. 
In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority: Product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. And I'd like to share just a few examples. 
First, in our Oral Care business, superior offerings are driving market growth across forms. Last summer, we launched Oral-B iO power brush, which offers an irresistible consumer brushing experience. The value of this superior performance is evident to the consumers, even with the premium price. 
P&G's global value share in the brush segment is up more than 2.5 points over the past year, and the U.S. power brush category is up nearly 14 points since the innovation launched with IO contributing more than half of the category growth. 
We recently launched the next breakthrough in Teeth Whitening. Crest whitening emulsions create a micro thin layer of concentrated peroxide droplets, enabling consumers to move beyond occasion-based whitening to a product that can used up to 4x per day with no rinsing or brushing needed. This innovation is a leading contributor to our more than 20% organic sales growth of our tooth whitening business in fiscal '21 and is driving 2/3 of the U.S. whitening category growth. 
In Personal Health Care, [ Niquil ] and Niquil Honey launched last summer, offering a great tasting formula while also delivering powerful relief. Niquil Honey is the #1 new item in the U.S. respiratory market, and our Vicks share is up 90 basis points over the past 12 months. 
Despite the soft market due to the very weak cough/cold season, when consumers are shopping in the category, they're increasingly choosing Vicks. 
For some consumers, the environmental aspects of our product offering are taking on increased importance in their assessment of superiority. We are offering a superior products -- or products that are more sustainable and educating consumers on the benefits of those products with superior brand communication. 
I'll switch to Fabric Care. Here, Tide and Ariel innovating to extend their superior cleaning performance advantages while encouraging consumers to reduce their carbon footprint. Ariel's new campaign, Every Degree Makes a Difference, advocates lower washing temperatures. Up to 60% of laundry's carbon footprint comes from heating the water in the washing machine. Lowering the wash temperature is the single most important thing we can do to reduce the environmental impact of laundry. 
To achieve our goals, we continue to innovate to ensure superior fabric cleaning performance in cold water, and we utilize superior communication to educate the consumer on the benefits. This innovation has helped contribute to global Fabric Care's 120 basis points of value share growth over the past 12 months. 
In our European Shave Care business, we're driving superiority across all 5 vectors and improving sustainability along the way. We're moving to a plastic-free packaging on our razor systems, simplifying our lineup, improving on-shelf fundamentals and improving margin for our retail partners. This innovation contributed to mid-single-digit organic sales growth in our European Grooming business in fiscal '21 with market share up 1 point. 
Good business results and good for the environment. This packaging innovation will save the equivalent of 85 million water bottles per year when fully launched around the world. 
More important than one example is the common theme of superior innovation and execution drives market growth. Leading category growth builds business for our retail partners, and mathematically, builds market share for P&G. 
We've made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, and we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world. 
The strategic need for investment to contribute to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, the short-term need to manage through the crisis and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business. 
In cost of goods, we're delivering flexible formulations that can allow us to change between ingredients to lower cost or create supply chain flexibility while ensuring no impact on consumer preference for our brands. 
We're optimizing plastic bottle designs to reduce the amount of plastics we use while also lowering costs. 
We're improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our advertising investments, bringing some media planning work in-house to achieve greater cost efficiency while also enabling us to place ads with greater precision based on more granular analytics to reduce waste and increase effectiveness. 
No area of cost is left untouched. We've given more authority and accountability to the business units to decide how to balance the need for more resources in some areas of the business with the opportunities for savings in other areas. They need to make the choices that are best for their business as they work to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth. 
Our success in our highly competitive industry also requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. 
In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organizational structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to meet new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity and constructive disruption and organizational structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. 
When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, have served us well during the crisis, and they will serve us well on the other end of this crisis. We're confident they remain the right strategic choices as we move through and beyond the pandemic. 
We delivered strong results in fiscal '21 in a very challenging environment. While we're pleased with these results and the overall strength of our business, the external environment continues to be volatile and difficult to predict, and our eyes are wide open to the many challenges we face. 
We compete in product categories against highly capable multinational and local competitors. Raw material and transport freight costs have risen sharply. Increased social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world are putting pressure on local GDP growth. And the pandemic continues to create risk for consumers, retail partners and supply chains. 
With these challenges, there are also opportunities as we emerge from the pandemic. The relevance of our categories in consumers' lives likely remains elevated. We will serve what will likely become a forever altered cleaning health and hygiene focus for consumers who use our products daily or multiple times day. 
There may be a continued increased focus on home, more time at home, more meals at home with related consumption impacts. The importance of noticeably superior performance potentially grows.
There is potential for increased preference for established reputable brands that solve newly framed problems better than alternatives, potentially less experimentation, potential for a lasting shift to e-commerce, both e-tailers and omnichannel. Our experience to date makes us believe we are generally well positioned in this environment. 
We're discovering lower-cost ways of working with fewer resources, today's necessity giving rise to the productivity inventions of tomorrow. 
New digital tools are being brought to the forefront, providing another productivity driver on the factory floor, in our labs and in our office environment. 
Our business exhibited strong momentum well before the crisis, we strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well positioned to serve the heightened needs and new behaviors of consumers and our retail and distributor partners post crisis. 
We have the right strategies, we have the right portfolio, we have the right organization structure. We have a team of 100,000 employees focused on executing to delight consumers, win with customers and deliver balanced growth and value creation. With that, I'll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for fiscal 2022. Andre?"

Quarterly results will be heavily influenced by top line volatility embedded in base period results, along with the realities of current year cost pressures and continued effects of the global pandemic. Input costs have risen sharply, current spot prices for materials such as resins, chemicals and other ingredients are up anywhere from 30% to 200% versus April 2020. Most of the material cost increases occurred in this calendar year and will disproportionately affect the first half of fiscal 2022. 
Based on current spot prices, we estimate a $1.8 billion after-tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal '22. Freight costs have also increased substantially due to several factors affecting the supply of drivers and the demand for drivers and trucks, and diesel fuel prices are up 35% so far in the calendar. We currently expect freight and transportation costs to be an incremental $100 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '22. 
We will offset a portion of these higher costs with price increases, but there is a lag between the time when costs begin to rise and when pricing is implemented to provide an offset. 
As discussed last quarter, our Baby Care, Feminine Care and adult incontinence businesses have announced increases in the U.S. that will go into effect in mid-September. 
Earlier this year, we executed a significant product upgrade on our Japan liquid aerial detergent, coupled with a 35% price increase. 
In U.S. Fabric Care, we recently announced a list price increase on Tide Simply, chia and Era liquid detergents effective in September. 
In U.S. Home Care, we've announced double-digit price increases across all product forms of the Swiffer brand. These increases are effective mid-September. 
We have announced price increases in many Central Eastern European markets to offset a portion of currency impacts. In Latin America, we've taken a cumulative high single-digit price increase across our business over the past 12 months. 
We are analyzing input costs and foreign exchange rate impacts in other categories and markets, and we are assessing the need for additional pricing moves. When opportunities allow, we will close a couple of price increases with new product innovations, adding value for consumers along the way. 
We believe this is a temporary bottom line rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the business and not a reason to redesign a strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. 
Our guidance ranges for fiscal '22 incorporate these dynamics. We expect organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. The high end of this range assumes global markets continue growing at about 3% or so, and P&G continues to grow above market level. The low end of this range assumes deceleration in global markets to 2% or lower with P&G growth at or above underlying markets. 
This range also reflects the strong organic sales growth, more than 8% that we delivered in the first half of fiscal '21. Given this base period dynamic, we expect organic sales growth to be stronger in the back half of fiscal '22 versus the front half. 
On the bottom line, we expect core earnings per share growth in the range of 3% to 6%. This outlook includes headwinds of approximately $1.9 billion from after tax from commodity costs and freight, as I mentioned earlier, with a modest offset of around $100 million after tax from an exchange rate benefits. 
The combined impact of materials, freight and FX is approximately a $0.70 per share headwind to EPS, or a 12% point headwind to EPS growth in fiscal '22. 
Considering the cost challenge is weighted heavily towards the front half of the year, earnings growth is expected to be much stronger in the back half of fiscal '22. We are targeting adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% starting the year. We expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends, and to repurchase between $7 billion and $9 billion of common stock. Combined, the plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. 
This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. 
Now back to David for closing comments."

So you delivered $2 billion in media spending -- efficiencies over 5 years, right? And then marketing reinvestment this quarter was way stronger than we had expected. I think it was up 170 basis points on top of a 270 basis point investment last year. 
So one, how much is really left to go for on that efficiency side of the equation? Two, as you think about incremental reinvestment, there's so much funding in the base from the past 2 years. I'd love to hear everyone's perspective."

Let me start with the last part first and then Andre can hit some of the marketing spending numbers. But first, no, the marketer should not be worried. The marketers should feel wonderful in that we've got a senior leadership that is maintaining a high degree of consistency. 
And you all know Jon very, very well. He has supported these investments in media to the extent they grow the market and grow market share and are helping drive awareness and trial of superior products and brands, that's a good thing. It's about creating value, not reducing or increasing one element of cost. And Jon has been very engaged with me and the leadership team in these decisions. 
The other thing about our organization structure, we leave it to the sector CEOs and the enterprise leader to decide how much to invest in their businesses. This is not a decision we make at the headquarters. It's a decision made by each one of the business leaders. And we hold them accountable to create the top and bottom line growth and cash generation for their business. And I think the results for the last 3 years speak for themselves. 
And so, they actually should feel very good, as do I, that the leadership of the company and the organization structure is working very well. 
And I have one comment on the marketing spending efficiency, then Andre can add some additional comment. We have increased meaningfully the investment in marketing, but we have also increased the rate of meaningful innovation that grows the market. 
So one of the key parts is you have to help consumers understand what the product is, how to use it and then help drive awareness and trial. And these investments have done that. It's evidenced, again, in the top line growth. You recall very well, if you go back 4 or 5 years ago, our average growth was about 2%. We moved up the past 4 years, we've -- past 5 years, we've averaged 4%. In the last 3 years, 6%. And we've got the strongest share growth we've seen in many years, which tells me the combination of the superiority strategy and the brilliant execution by our people is really working, and we'll continue to invest behind both brands that are winning and invest to make sure we get the trial. 
And Andre, any comments on the specific numbers?"

And as David said, superior communication is a core element of our superiority framework and we've not reached the point of diminishing return on those investments. So we'll continue to invest at around that level in percent of sales. 
We also do believe that there is significant productivity improvement still within the media spend. When you think about shift into digital media, improved targeting capability, with first-party audiences or third-party audiences and ability to sharpen our focus, even on TV audiences with our own data. So there continues to be a significant leverage in terms of direct media spend efficiencies that we can create to improve quantity of reach and quality of reach. 
In the indirect space, we're also striving to continue to improve production costs, agency structures. So you'll see us continue to work in that direction, mostly to reinvest in superiority and superior communication."

The U.S. consumption, I think we believe at this point in time, will return to normal levels. Most importantly, we see our shares at record levels in the U.S. Our brands are continuing to strive. We're gaining share across categories. Our retail partnerships are strong, and we have very strong innovation programs hitting in the U.S. So we remain confident.

We do believe that the health planning and the hygiene brands will continue to play an increased role. There are the statistics that I saw a while back that prepandemic, about 5% of people work from home and then post pandemic, estimated 20%. I don't know what the number will be, but certainly, there's a significant number of people that will be in home more than they were pre-pandemic. That bodes well for us. 
I believe the strength of our brands and I actually see the shift towards trusted brands will likely last a good while. We've had meaningful increased household penetration on some of our brands as there was a stock up, and then people got exposed to the superior performance. I think that will have a lingering positive impact. 
So you've got both more people at home, now take the U.S. especially, more occasions at home. You've got a shift towards trusted brands and the role that health plan and hygiene plays will anniversary some tough comps. But the health of the brands and the share momentum, to me, gives me a lot of confidence going forward. 
The U.S. and Europe, I call it our biggest focused markets are having some of the strongest share progress they've had in every one of those categories in absolute share is higher than they were pre-pandemic with the exception of Family Care that had a supply issue for the first part. Just couldn't supply because of the increased demand, and they're growing share in the fourth quarter. 
So we've got good momentum. Consumers continue to vote for trusted, superior performing brands and that I think those consumer habit changes will likely last."

You've obviously got lots of fragmentation in the category with more organic or natural players sort of trying to gain traction.

Our focus markets grew top line and profits last year. All-in profits increased, global Baby Care made progress. Our North America business, especially was plus 3%, the highest it's been in 6 years. We're leading the category growth. We actually have strong share growth now in North America, most recent period, it's up 1 point or more. 
Our superiority metric, which is really important. Back several years ago, it was 25%, which is unacceptable. It's up to 60% rising, and we'll continue to be investing to again, delight consumers. But with North America doing better, Europe returned to growth for the first time in 6 years, you're right, it's been challenging both the birth rate, but return to growth, expanded the margins. 
We addressed some of the challenges we had in our enterprise markets. Jon and his team did a great job there, working to make sure we had structurally profitable businesses and adjusting the business model and supply systems where need be. So you look across those. 
And then this shift towards fast growth segments. Our wipes business was up 10%. Our pants business was up 12%. We doubled our bed weather segment growth to 12% behind the successful [ Ninjamas ] launch. So there's a number of things going well. 
We still have much work to do, and we understand that. Baby Care does take time, but this was the best year we've had in 6 years, and the trends are positive. We're now playing in fast-growing segments and the product superiority is getting better each year. So I become more optimistic on Baby Care each year. I think the leader and their team are doing a really nice job recognizing that this is a mid- to long term game, and they're continuing to make the right investments."

Broader portfolio question, just to kind of pull back a little bit. So really beyond fiscal '22, and it relates specifically around strategic priorities and where you see the greatest opportunities to accelerate profitable growth. 
So Jon, I understand your comments that the strategy is indeed working. It's just going to be sort of a continuation of execution against that. And David, you talked about what the company has done with respect to productivity, structure, culture, innovation and I think there's sort of general recognition among the investment community. You look at the market share momentum and the results, it is a strategy that's clearly working. 
But that being said, as you look across your geographies, your categories and your cost structure, I would like to get your perspective on the areas where you see the greatest opportunity to accelerate growth and maximize profitability, and Jon, how you intend to prioritize those?"

First, there are many opportunities, but it starts right here in the U.S. It's our largest market. We have -- we declared several years ago, the U.S. is a growth market. We don't have any markets that aren't growth markets. It's our job to create the innovation that drives the growth. And I think it's best illustrated by the U.S. We are averaging 1% to 2%, and we've moved to mid-singles. And certainly the last 2 years, we've been in high singles. And it has driven by the innovation and the communication, just the superiority strategy of being brought to health and executed in a very good way. 
We have had some bolt-on acquisitions that you're well aware of. There have been some categories that we've been open about. We added the Merck international business to our Health Care, and that's done very well, and you've seen the growth recently in our Health Care business. That remains an interesting segment. You've seen some bolt-on acquisitions in the Beauty Care business. Again, that remains an interesting business as well. And each of the sector leaders has the opportunity to evaluate whether they see bolt-on acquisitions or acquisitions that would be helpful. 
The core though is most important, driving the core in the focus markets and then continuing to have smart growth and value creations in the enterprise markets is working. And I believe that's the right strategy. 
I'll turn it to Jon to offer any comments about how he's thinking about the future. But we've worked together on these and been very aligned that it starts with delivering the core and seeing market growth is a key responsibility of each category."

And I firmly believe that they all have opportunity to grow and to create value. And you're seeing that in the results that Andre described, for example, there's very broad progress that's occurring across those businesses. 
Similarly, from a geographic standpoint, are -- what people would view as mature markets have significant growth potential that exists within them. You've seen the results in the U.S. If you look at category development outside of the U.S., on average, is 20% of U.S. levels. So there's significant opportunity across geographies to continue to develop these categories to grow markets and increase consumption. 
And historically, while we probably felt that way for the focus markets, we were a little bit concerned about what kind of future the enterprise markets held for us. But the team there has made significant progress in the last couple of years in dramatically increasing the structural profitability of those businesses. So they are investment grade, and we can take advantage of the population and income growth that will occur in those markets and do so in a very profitable value accretive way. We exited last year with one country and the well over 100 countries in the enterprise markets losing any money. So the majority are contributing positively to the company's top line and bottom line. 
So I don't want to, in any way, backhand the question, but I really do believe that we have opportunities for growth and value creation in each of our categories and broadly across the global geography. And then it becomes executing the strategy that we've all talked about a number of times, and that, as Andre mentioned, we will continue to double down on, stepping forward, not back."

I get the comments about the roughly 3 points or so, if my math is right, of input commodity cost headwinds for '22. So I guess broader picture, '21 sounds like you're saying that's a base. You think you can obviously expand over time in a normalized world. I guess maybe you could just talk a bit about how holistically you're thinking about that. 
And then maybe drilling in a little bit as well. Looking at segments, most of the -- were the strongest rate of expansion has come from household products, whether it's a household care or a fabric or baby, et cetera. So how sustainable is that? What can you do there to further improve? And just as I said, broadly, kind of how are you thinking about margins?"

I think they all offer continued growth opportunity. If you think about either growing the market via innovation with the examples that David mentioned earlier, if you think about trading consumers up into premium propositions will have superior profitability in terms of penny profit for us. If you -- for example, liquid fabric enhancers, household penetration in the U.S. is only 37% and only 52% of those households use the fabric enhancer with every load. So there's tons of runway when you think about beats, those numbers are even lower. 
Those propositions are accretive to our portfolio, are accretive to our margin, and we'll continue to focus on those and they provide a good source for future growth, both top and bottom line. 
Productivity is another key lever that still has enormous runway across the balance sheet and across the P&L. Our supply chain continues to have significant opportunity in terms of synchronization, but also every innovation that we bring basically creates a new cost S curve that we can then optimize from. We talked about media and advertising spend as a significant source of future profitability growth and productivity. And I would add go-to-market, specifically in terms of go-to-market logistics, but also go-to-market spend as a source. 
So we feel confident in our ability to deliver even with cost headwinds, which is reflected in our guidance for next year. And we do believe there's enough levers in the portfolio from trade-up to usage expansion to be able to continue to do so."

First, you mentioned our beauty business, specifically SK-II. I'm very pleased, if I just take SK-II as an example, you would have expected it to get hit very, very hard because of travel retail virtually stopping in Asia, and it's certainly a huge channel. But the team pivoted amazingly well and was able to actually grow the business. Last year, the business was up double digits, up 13%. So SK-II is actually healthy and continues to grow nicely because the consumption that did not happen in travel retail happened in the home market. And then there was the duty-free area in Hainan province. They did a really nice job making sure that the brand was both available and had the innovation and communication to win. So SK-II is healthy, and I expect -- I don't know when travel retail will resume. You can take your guess. It looks like it's going to be a while. But the good news is, at the strong growth that we're seeing already, we're not dependent on that. That will be -- it could be a help if and when it opens up anytime soon. 
More broadly, the Skin and Personal Care business had a strong year last year as did the overall Beauty business. So again, I feel very good about the business. How strong it grows next year will be dependent again on many of the factors that we've already mentioned. While there's meaningful cost headwinds, the innovation that both Hair Care, skin and Personal Care has launched and will be launching, I feel very good about. So both businesses had strong years on the top and bottom line and I feel good about those. 
Baby Care, I made a number of comments earlier, so I'm not sure what else would be helpful. Yes, we are very committed to the category. The innovation coming will continue to come. We are on a multiyear innovation program. Certainly, part of it has hit the market. You see that improvements in percent superiority from 25% to 60%. We'll continue to work to move that up significantly. And we also recognize that for many consumers in many markets, the premiumization is critically important in these high-growth areas. And that allows us to offset some of the challenges that you're well aware of on the birth rate and still grow the category and grow share and create value. And Baby Care did create value this year. It's a very strong year, strong improvement. 
So all these businesses to me have meaningful upside and especially the Beauty business has very good momentum, and Baby Care is accelerating. So I feel good about both."

And what the team has done, which I think is very strong and very important going for the future, we're no longer a wet shave business. We're truly a Grooming business with growth in wet shave, dry shave, which we call appliances. We're also growing in many of the new areas like IPL, the intense pulse light area. All of those to me give me confidence. And it's in new segments as well. We have innovation coming King Gillette, which helps people with facial hair. So it's a broader portfolio, innovation across all those different forms and segments and it's leading to mid-single top and double-digit bottom.

Now we have full respect for our competitors. And you're right, we have very strong growth in both North America, Europe and Latin America. And in those markets, we'll see what happens next year. But if this share growth has been now sustained in North America for 3 years and in Europe for 3 years. So the focus markets are performing very well.

But the other thing is very real, you have to earn it every day. And so our teams understand that our competitors are refocusing and those that lost share will come back with their innovations and investments. And it's our job to go earn it.

In terms of trade promotion, certainly, it's in our best interest to bring to our retail partners, programs that build their business and build their margin. I do believe, as you said that, that can best be done by innovation and market growing plans. And there's roles they play with us in making sort of things like the shelf, virtual or physical shelf is arranged in a way that creates market growth and helps consumers find the brands that they're most apt to use. We work with retail partners around the world. And the ones we've partnered with best success is they grow, the market grows, the margin grows and that we help them do it, we get rewarded. So we will continue with that certainly objective. And certainly, our eyes are wide open. I expect from a very low base, we will see an increase in trade spending. 
Do I believe it will go all the way back to what it was before? I think many retailers are very interested in finding smart ways and they have the same pressures that we do with the commodity cost. They need as well as we to find ways to create value. So I'm hopeful that we'll see some thoughtful change in promotion strategy that is more value creating for the market."

And then second, maybe a little more in follow-up one is we've had a lot of discussions with consumer staples leaders in the past really 2 weeks about the state of retailer inventory, and that's largely a U.S. question, but it seems all over the board. A lot of retailers are seeing better foot traffic, certain retailers, certain channels have had unprecedented volume that's stuck around, and there's a little bit of a mentality of maybe taking on more inventory and shipping, maybe not matching up with measured takeaway, not only in the U.S. but other places. And I think you touched both ways. So I know there's a lot to that question, but anything you could say about retailer inventories, where you think that is? And you say, your big markets, your focus markets, where you stand and how that plays into your guidance for '22, your thoughts about that, how that plays in. I'd appreciate it."

The way I think about the retailers' approach to their business, I don't really think about it through an inventory lens so much as I think about it through a desire to maintain dependability of supply. And those manufacturers that can offer that assurance are often being rewarded with increased shelf space and increased focus on the part of our retail partners. 
There's a small amount of inventory build, but that's not really the focus. The focus is on how do we ensure supply and maintain the satisfaction of our shoppers. And that's a very fertile place for us to play.

Last evening, we announced that I will retire as CEO on November 1, and Jon Moeller was elected as the incoming CEO. I will remain as Executive Chair of the Board. 
We also announced that Shailesh Jejurikar, has been elected Chief Operating Officer effective October 1, 2021, transitioning behind Jon Moeller. These moves have been thoughtfully planned and provide P&G with highly capable and experienced leadership going forward. I truly have full confidence and strongly support these changes. 
Jon, you know well. He has a distinguished track record throughout his 33-year career with P&G, including more than 12 years as CFO. More recently, Jon added responsibility as Vice Chairman and then Chief Operating Officer with P&L responsibility and ownership for our enterprise markets. In my nearly 6 years as CEO, I've had the benefit of partnering with Jon and an outstanding global leadership team to integrate a comprehensive set of strategies to guide our choices and priorities. 
Now to go back, in 2012, Jon led the initial work to make productivity an integral part of P&G's business. Our team doubled down on this strategy when we announced our second 5-year $10 billion cost savings program in 2017. Today, productivity is built into our operating model and is an ongoing part of our strategy in every part of our business. 
We worked together for several years to focus the company's portfolio on faster growing, more profitable daily use categories where products solve problems and performance drives consumer brand choice. The team largely completed this work with the divestiture of several fashion-driven beauty categories in 2016. This strategy continues to guide our disciplined approach to managing our category and brand portfolio. 
At the CAGNY conference in 2016, we first discussed the tests we were doing on a new approach to our organization design. We refined and formalized the plans and announced the new focused market and enterprise market design at our November 2018 Analyst Day. Our objective was to create a more engaged, agile and accountable organization, which is exactly what we've done. 
In April 2017, we first discussed our work to set a much higher bar for measuring the success of our innovation and execution across products, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. If there were any doubts about the importance of consistently delivering irresistible superiority, our results over the last few years should have put those to bed. 
And finally, in 2018, we first talked about the need to lead constructive disruption in our highly dynamic and competitive industry. We continue to drive disruption in innovation, brand building, digitization, supply chain transformation and with our citizenship and ESG efforts. 
Over several years, through many challenges, our organization responded brilliantly as we integrated each element of the strategy, building momentum that is evident in our results in the past 3 fiscal years. The team fully embraced the idea that we must be willing to change anything and everything needed to win. The only things we will not change are our purpose, values and principles and our commitment to winning. 
This has been especially evident during the continuing COVID crisis, where the organization has demonstrated tremendous agility to meet the needs of consumers, while ensuring the safety of our employees and supporting communities around the world to deal with the impacts of this crisis. Through all of it, delivering results that should delight owners and do it in a way that makes us proud to be P&Gers. 
Put simply, our strategies are working, our team is outstanding, and I could not be more confident in the next generation of leadership that will take the reins of P&G later this year. 
Now I'll turn it over to Andre Schulten, Chief Financial Officer, to lead us through the fiscal year 2021 fourth quarter and year-end earnings announcement. Andre?"

Good morning, everyone. Joining David and me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
I'll start with an overview of company results for fiscal '21 and fourth quarter, and David will add perspective on our immediate priorities and strategic focus areas. We'll close with guidance for fiscal '22 and then take your questions. 
Fiscal 2021 was another very strong year. Our focus on superiority and strong investment in the business funded with strong productivity improvements and cost savings drove market growth, and in turn, strong sales share, earnings and cash results leading to balanced growth and value creation. 
Organic sales for the fiscal year grew more than 6%, up more than 12% on a 2-year stack. Growth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing or holding organic sales: Home Care, up high teens; Oral Care, up double digits; Skin & Personal Care, up high single digits; Grooming, Fabric Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care and Personal Health Care organic sales, each up mid-single digits; family Care grew low singles; baby Care was in line with prior year. 
We delivered strong results in our 2 largest and most largest and most profitable markets, annualizing strong base periods. Organic sales were up 8% in the U.S. and 12% in Greater China for the fiscal year. Focus markets grew 7% for the year. Enterprise markets were up 5% despite significant market growth impacts from the pandemic. E-commerce sales were up 35% for the year at over $10 billion in sales, representing 14% of company total. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points, 33 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the fiscal year. 
All outlet value share in the U.S. improved through the year growing from 33% over the past 12 months to 33.5% for the past 6 months to 34% over the past quarter, one of the highest absolute value shares in the last 20 years. Consumers are increasingly choosing P&G brands. 
We translated the strong top line growth into strong earnings and cash results. Core earnings per share grew 11% for the year. Currency-neutral core EPS was also up 11%. Within this, core gross margin expanded 20 basis points, up 60 basis points, excluding currency impacts. Core operating margin grew 80 basis points, up 130 points, excluding currency impacts. 
Productivity improvements helped operating margin by 250 basis points, enabling strong reinvestment in marketing programs. Advertising was at 10.8% of sales, an increase of more than 40 basis points. 
Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 107%. We increased our dividend by 10% and returned $19 billion of value to share owners, $8 billion in dividends and $11 billion in share repurchase. 
Moving on to the April-June quarter. Organic sales grew 4%. Volume, pricing and mix each contributed more than 1 point to top line growth. Growth rates by market reflected the volatility in shipments in the base period. 
Organic sales were down 1% in the U.S., however, this is still 18% growth on a 2-year stack. Recall that in the April-June quarter last year, organic sales were up 19% in the U.S., 13 points above tracked channel sales as we work to restock depleted trade inventories. Organic sales in Greater China were up 5%, also comping a strong base period. On a 2-year stack, Greater China, up 19%. 
Focus markets were up 2%. Enterprise markets were up 14% in the quarter. Strong market share trends with aggregate global value share up 70 basis points. All outlet share in the U.S. increased 260 basis points for the quarter to 34.1%. 
On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.13, down 3% versus prior year, down 4% on a currency-neutral basis, mainly due to gross margin pressure from higher input costs as we had anticipated. Core gross margin decreased 260 basis points. Currency-neutral core gross margin also down 260 points. This includes 220 basis points impact from higher commodity and freight costs, nearly $400 million in just this quarter. We also saw a sharp headwind from mix of 210 basis points, mainly geographic mix impacts. 
Recall that in our fourth quarter last year, the U.S. and China accounted for more than 100% of organic sales growth. In this year's fourth quarter, enterprise markets lead the growth. 
Core operating margin decreased 230 basis points. Currency-neutral core operating margin declined 210 basis points. Productivity improvements were 320 basis points help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was 117%. 
In summary, we exceeded each of our going-in targets for the year: Organic sales growth; core EPS growth; free cash flow productivity; and cash returned to shareholders. Our team has operated with excellent discipline in a challenging and volatile environment. 
And with that, I'll pass it back to David."
33328,715199442,2356687,"The Procter & Gamble Company, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","The Procter & Gamble Company","Executives","Thanks, Andre. As I said at the outset, our team has done some outstanding work over the last 18 months to manage through the challenges of the COVID crisis and make our business even stronger in the process. In our April earnings call last year, we said",1553,"Thanks, Andre. As I said at the outset, our team has done some outstanding work over the last 18 months to manage through the challenges of the COVID crisis and make our business even stronger in the process. In our April earnings call last year, we said we would step forward into the challenge of COVID, not back. We said we would double down to serve consumers, and that's exactly what our team has done. 
As we continue to manage the crisis, we'll remain focused on the 3 priorities that have been guiding our near-term actions and choices: First is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world; second, maximizing the availability of our products to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs; and third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the front lines of this global pandemic. 
The strategic choices I outlined earlier are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and long-term value creation, a portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority: Product; package; brand communication; retail execution and value. 
Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. And I'd like to share just a few examples. First, in our Oral Care business, superior offerings are driving market growth across forums. Last summer, we launched Oral-B iO power brush, which offers an irresistible consumer brushing experience. The value of this superior performance is evident to the consumers, even with the premium price. P&G's global value share in the brush segment is up more than 2.5 points over the past year, and the U.S. power brush category is up nearly 14 points since the innovation launched, with iO contributing more than half of the category growth. 
We recently launched the next breakthrough in teeth whitening, Crest Whitening Emulsions, create a micro-thin layer of concentrated peroxide droplets, enabling consumers to move beyond occasion-based whitening to a product that can be used up to 4x per day with no rinsing or brushing needed. This innovation is a leading contributor to our more than 20% organic sales growth of our tooth whitening business in fiscal '21 and is driving 2/3 of the U.S. whitening category growth.
In Personal Health Care, NyQuil and DayQuil Honey launched last summer, offering a great tasting formula while also delivering powerful relief. NyQuil Honey is the #1 new item in the U.S. respiratory market, and our Vicks share is up 90 basis points over the past 12 months. Despite the soft market due to the very weak cough/cold season, when consumers are shopping in the category, they're increasingly choosing Vicks. 
For some consumers, the environmental aspects of our product offering are taking on increased importance in their assessment of superiority. We are offering the superior performing products or products that are more sustainable and educating consumers on the benefits of those products with superior brand communication. 
I'll switch to Fabric Care. Here, Tide and Ariel are innovating to extend their superior cleaning performance advantages while encouraging consumers to reduce their carbon footprint. Ariel's new campaign, every degree makes a difference, advocates lower washing temperatures. Up to 60% of laundry's carbon footprint comes from heating the water in the washing machine. Lowering the wash temperature is the single most important thing we can do to reduce the environmental impact of laundry. 
To achieve our goals, we continue to innovate to ensure superior fabric cleaning performance in cold water, and we utilize superior communication to educate the consumer on the benefits. This innovation has helped contribute to global Fabric Care's 120 basis points of value share growth over the past 12 months. 
In our European Shave Care business, we're driving superiority across all 5 vectors and improving sustainability along the way. We're moving to a plastic-free packaging on our razor systems, simplifying our lineup, improving on-shelf fundamentals and improving margin for our retail partners. This innovation contributed to mid-single-digit organic sales growth in our European Grooming business in fiscal '21, with market share up 1 point. 
Good business results and good for the environment. This packaging innovation will save the equivalent of 85 million water bottles per year when fully launched around the world. 
More important, and one example is the common theme of superior innovation and execution drives market growth. Leading category growth builds business for our retail partners, and mathematically, builds market share for P&G. We've made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, and we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world. 
The strategic need for investment to contribute to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, the short-term need to manage through the crisis and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business. 
In cost of goods, we're delivering flexible formulations that can allow us to change between ingredients to lower cost or create supply chain flexibility while ensuring no impact on consumer preference for our brands. We're optimizing plastic bottle designs to reduce the amount of plastics we use while also lowering costs. We're improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our advertising investments, bringing some media planning work in-house to achieve greater cost efficiency while also enabling us to place ads with greater precision based on more granular analytics to reduce waste and increase effectiveness. 
No area of cost is left untouched. We've given more authority and accountability to the business units to decide how to balance the need for more resources in some areas of the business with the opportunities for savings in other areas. They need to make the choices that are best for their business as they work to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth. 
Our success in our highly competitive industry also requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. 
Our organizational structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to meet new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity and constructive disruption and organizational structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. 
When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, have served us well during the crisis, and they will serve us well on the other end of this crisis. We're confident they remain the right strategic choices as we move through and beyond the pandemic. 
We delivered strong results in fiscal '21 in a very challenging environment. While we're pleased with these results and the overall strength of our business, the external environment continues to be volatile and difficult to predict, and our eyes are wide open to the many challenges we face. 
We compete in product categories against highly capable multinational and local competitors. Raw material and transport freight costs have risen sharply. Increased social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world are putting pressure on local GDP growth. And the pandemic continues to create risk for consumers, retail partners and supply chains. 
With these challenges, there are also opportunities as we emerge from the pandemic. The relevance of our categories in consumers' lives likely remains elevated. We will serve what will likely become a forever altered cleaning health and hygiene focus for consumers who use our products daily or multiple times each day. There may be a continued increased focus on home, more time at home, more meals at home with related consumption impacts. 
The importance of noticeably superior performance potentially grows. There is potential for increased preference for established reputable brands that solve newly-framed problems better than alternatives, potentially less experimentation, potential for a lasting shift to e-commerce, both e-tailers and omnichannel. Our experience to date makes us believe we are generally well positioned in this environment. 
We're discovering lower-cost ways of working with fewer resources, today's necessity giving rise to the productivity inventions of tomorrow. New digital tools are being brought to the forefront, providing another productivity driver on the factory floor, in our labs and in our office environment. 
Our business exhibited strong momentum well before the crisis. We strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well positioned to serve the heightened needs and new behaviors of consumers and our retail and distributor partners post crisis. We have the right strategies, we have the right portfolio, we have the right organization structure. We have a team of 100,000 employees focused on executing to delight consumers, win with customers and deliver balanced growth and value creation. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for fiscal 2022. Andre?"

Quarterly results will be heavily influenced by top line volatility embedded in base period results, along with the realities of current year cost pressures and continued effects of the global pandemic. 
Input costs have risen sharply. Current spot prices for materials such as resins, chemicals and other ingredients are up anywhere from 30% to 200% versus April 2020. Most of the material cost increases occurred in this calendar year and will disproportionately affect the first half of fiscal 2022. 
Based on current spot prices, we estimate a $1.8 billion after-tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal '22. Freight costs have also increased substantially due to several factors affecting the supply of drivers and the demand for drivers and trucks, and diesel fuel prices are up 35% so far in the calendar. 
We currently expect freight and transportation costs to be an incremental $100 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '22. We will offset a portion of these higher costs with price increases, but there is a lag between the time when costs begin to rise and when pricing is implemented to provide an offset. 
As discussed last quarter, our Baby Care, Feminine Care and adult incontinence businesses have announced increases in the U.S. that will go into effect in mid-September. Earlier this year, we executed a significant product upgrade on our Japan liquid Ariel detergent, coupled with a 35% price increase. 
In U.S. Fabric Care, we recently announced a list price increase on Tide Simply, Cheer and Era liquid detergents effective in September. In U.S. Home Care, we've announced double-digit price increases across all product forms of the Swiffer brand. These increases are effective mid-September. 
We have announced price increases in many Central Eastern European markets to offset a portion of currency impacts. In Latin America, we've taken a cumulative high single-digit price increase across our business over the past 12 months. 
We are analyzing input costs and foreign exchange rate impacts in other categories and markets, and we are assessing the need for additional pricing moves. When opportunities allow, we will close a couple of price increases with new product innovations, adding value for consumers along the way. We believe this is a temporary bottom line rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the business and not a reason to redesign a strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. 
Our guidance ranges for fiscal '22 incorporate these dynamics. We expect organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. The high end of this range assumes global markets continue growing at about 3% or so, and P&G continues to grow above market level. The low end of this range assumes deceleration in global markets to 2% or lower with P&G growth at or above underlying markets. 
This range also reflects the strong organic sales growth, more than 8% that we delivered in the first half of fiscal '21. Given this base period dynamic, we expect organic sales growth to be stronger in the back half of fiscal '22 versus the front half. 
On the bottom line, we expect core earnings per share growth in the range of 3% to 6%. This outlook includes headwinds of approximately $1.9 billion from -- after tax from commodity costs and freight, as I mentioned earlier, with a modest offset of around $100 million after tax from an exchange rate benefits. The combined impact of materials, freight and FX is approximately a $0.70 per share headwind to EPS, or a 12% point headwind to EPS growth in fiscal '22.  
Considering the cost challenge is weighted heavily towards the front half of the year, earnings growth is expected to be much stronger in the back half of fiscal '22. We are targeting adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% starting the year. We expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends, and to repurchase between $7 billion and $9 billion of common stock, combined the plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. 
This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. 
Now back to David for closing comments."

This is not a decision we make at the headquarters, it's a decision made by each one of the business leaders. And we hold them accountable to create the top and bottom line growth and cash generation for their business. And I think the results for the last 3 years speak for themselves. And so, they actually should feel very good, as do I, that the leadership of the company and the organization structure is working very well. 
And I'll leave one comment on the marketing spending efficiency, then Andre can add some additional comments. We have increased meaningfully the investment in marketing, but we have also increased the rate of meaningful innovation that grows the market. 
So one of the key parts is you have to help consumers understand what the product is, how to use it and then help drive awareness and trial. And these investments have done that. It's evidenced, again, in the top line growth. You'll recall very well, if you go back 4, 5 years ago, our average growth was about 2%. We moved up the past 4 years -- past 5 years, we've averaged 4%. In the last 3 years, 6%. And we've got the strongest share growth we've seen in many years, which tells me the combination of the superiority strategy and the brilliant execution by our people is really working. And we'll continue to invest behind both brands that are winning and invest to make sure we get the trial. 
And Andre, any comments on the specific numbers?"

We also do believe that there is significant productivity improvement still within the media spend when you think about shift into digital media, improved targeting capability, with first-party audiences or third-party audiences and ability to sharpen our focus, even on TV audiences with our own data. So there continues to be a significant leverage in terms of direct media spend efficiencies that we can create to improve quantity of reach and quality of reach. 
In the indirect space, we're also striving to continue to improve production costs, agency structures. So you'll see us continue to work in that direction, mostly to reinvest in superiority and superior communication."

We do believe that the health, cleaning, the hygiene brands will continue to play an increased role. There were these statistics that I saw a while back, that prepandemic, about 5% of people work from home and then post pandemic, estimated 20%. I don't know what the number will be, but certainly, there's a significant number of people that will be in home more than they were prepandemic. That bodes well for us. 
I believe the strength of our brands and actually, the shift towards trusted brands will likely last a good while. We've had meaningful increased household penetration on some of our brands as there was a stock up, and then people got exposed to the superior performance. I think that will have a lingering positive impact. 
So you've got both more people at home, now take the U.S. especially, more occasions at home. You've got a shift towards trusted brands and the role that health, cleaning and hygiene plays will anniversary some tough comps. But the health of the brands and the share momentum, to me, gives me a lot of confidence going forward. 
The U.S. and Europe, I call it our biggest focused markets are having some of the strongest share progress they've had. In every one of those categories, in absolute share is higher than they were prepandemic with the exception of Family Care that had a supply issue for the first part, just couldn't supply because of the increased demand, and they're growing share in the fourth quarter. 
So we've got good momentum. Consumers continue to vote for trusted, superior performing brands and that I think those consumer habit changes will likely last."

And I know the last 12 months have been really funny, you've actually had some market share recovery because they were depressed last year given supply issues. 
But still just sort of in totality, Baby Care just looks to be such a competitive marketplace. I think Kimberly sounded more aggressive and more optimistic about their market share positions. You've obviously got lots of fragmentation in the category with more organic, all-natural players sort of trying to gain traction. 
So can you kind of give us a state of the union on Baby Care, in particular, where you think Procter is? Why you think it's been sort of a stubborn business for you in terms of being able to really make progress, especially in China? That would be great."

It would take time because of the technical changes we needed to make to deliver product superiority. And we continue to make those changes, but I'm actually very encouraged by the progress they've made. 
Our focus markets grew top line and profits last year. All-in profits increased, global Baby Care made progress. Our North America business, especially was plus 3%, the highest it's been in 6 years. We're leading the category growth. We actually have strong share growth now in North America, most recent period, it's up 1 point or more. 
Our superiority metric, which is really important, back several years ago, it was 25%, which is unacceptable. It's up to 60% rising, and we'll continue to be investing to, again, delight consumers. But with North America doing better, Europe returned to growth for the first time in 6 years, you're right, it's been challenging, both the birth rate, but return to growth, expanded the margins. 
We addressed some of the challenges we had in our enterprise markets. Jon and his team did a great job there, working to make sure we had structurally profitable businesses and adjusting the business model and supply systems where need be. So you look across those. 
And then this shift towards fast growth segments. Our wipes business was up 10%. Our Pants business was up 12%. We doubled our bedwetter segment growth to 12% behind the successful Ninjamas launch. So there's a number of things going well. 
We still have much work to do, and we understand that. Baby Care does take time, but this was the best year we've had in 6 years, and the trends are positive. We're now playing in fast-growing segments, and the product superiority is getting better each year. So I become more optimistic on Baby Care each year. I think the leader and their team are doing a really nice job recognizing that this is a mid- to long-term game, and they're continuing to make the right investments."

And it has driven by the innovation and the communication, just the superiority strategy of being brought to health and executed in a very good way.

Similarly, from a geographic standpoint, are -- what people would view as mature markets have significant growth potential that exists within them. You've seen the results in the U.S. If you look at category development outside of the U.S., on average, is 20% of U.S. levels. So there's significant opportunity across geographies to continue to develop these categories, to grow markets and increase consumption. 
And historically, while we probably felt that way for the focus markets, we were a little bit concerned about what kind of future the enterprise markets held for us. But the team there has made significant progress in the last couple of years, in dramatically increasing the structural profitability of those businesses. So they are investment grade, and we can take advantage of the population and income growth that will occur in those markets and do so in a very profitable value-accretive way. 
We exited last year with one country and the well over 100 countries in the enterprise markets losing any money. So the majority are contributing positively to the company's top line and bottom line. 
So I don't want to, in any way, backhand the question, but I really do believe that we have opportunities for growth and value creation in each of our categories and broadly across the global geography.

I think they all offer continued growth opportunity. If you think about either growing the market via innovation with the examples that David mentioned earlier, if you think about trading consumers up into premium propositions would have superior profitability in terms of penny profit for us. If you -- for example, liquid fabric enhancers, household penetration in the U.S. is only 37% and only 52% of those households use the fabric enhancer with every load. 
So there's tons of runway. When you think about beats, those numbers are even lower. Those propositions are accretive to our portfolio, are accretive to our margin, and we'll continue to focus on those and they provide a good source for future growth, both top and bottom line. 
Productivity is another key lever that still has enormous runway across the balance sheet and across the P&L. Our supply chain continues to have significant opportunity in terms of synchronization, but also every innovation that we bring basically creates a new cost S curve that we can then optimize from. 
We talked about media and advertising spend as a significant source of future profitability growth and productivity. And I would add go-to-market, specifically in terms of go-to-market logistics, but also go-to-market spend as a source. 
So we feel confident in our ability to deliver even with cost headwinds, which is reflected in our guidance for next year. And we do believe there's enough levers in the portfolio from trade-up to usage expansion to be able to continue to do so."

What matters most is what Andre referred to, which is penny profit and overall profit and profitability. And we've got to make sure that we keep our eyes firmly on that as we work to grow the top line."

I have a question on the Beauty and follow-up -- Beauty and follow-up on Baby Care. What are you expecting for fiscal '22 in terms of recovery in Skin Care in Japan and China for both SK-II and Olay?
And for baby, David, your comments of improvement most recently, are you putting -- and a question now for Jon, more money behind innovation this fall due to -- because Pampers Pure was a good launch, but it seems that core Pampers is still lagging? 
And a clarification on the $1.9 billion headwind for fiscal '22. Are you embedding that commodities and transportation costs will restabilize or decline? Or have you conservatively assumed that these cost pressures will linger at current levels given understandably, a wide EPS range that you gave?"

There are quite a few questions there. So you have to help me if we don't answer each one. First, you mentioned our Beauty business, specifically SK-II. I'm very pleased, if I just take SK-II as an example, you",472,"Let me start with a couple of those here. There are quite a few questions there. So you have to help me if we don't answer each one. 
First, you mentioned our Beauty business, specifically SK-II. I'm very pleased, if I just take SK-II as an example, you would have expected it to get hit very, very hard because of travel retail virtually stopping in Asia, and it's certainly a huge channel. But the team pivoted amazingly well and was able to actually grow the business. 
Last year, the business was up double digits, up 13%. So SK-II is actually healthy and continues to grow nicely because the consumption that did not happen in travel retail happened in the home market. And then there was the duty-free area in Hainan province. They did a really nice job making sure that the brand was both available and had the innovation and communication to win. 
So SK-II is healthy, and I expect -- I don't know when travel retail will resume. You can take your guess. It looks like it's going to be a while. But the good news is, at the strong growth that we're seeing already, we're not dependent on that. That will be -- it could be a help if and when it opens up anytime soon. 
More broadly, the Skin and Personal Care business had a strong year last year as did the overall Beauty business. So again, I feel very good about the business. How strong it grows next year will be dependent again on many of the factors that we've already mentioned. While there's meaningful cost headwinds, the innovation that both Hair Care, Skin and Personal Care has launched and will be launching, I feel very good about. So both businesses had strong years on the top and bottom line and I feel good about those. 
Baby Care, I made a number of comments earlier, so I'm not sure what else would be helpful. Yes, we are very committed to the category. The innovation coming will continue to come. We are on a multiyear innovation program. Certainly, part of it has hit the market. You see that improvement in percent superiority from 25% to 60%. We'll continue to work to move that up significantly. 
And we also recognize that for many consumers in many markets, the premiumization is critically important in these high-growth areas. And that allows us to offset some of the challenges that you're well aware of on the birth rate and still grow the category and grow share and create value. And Baby Care did create value this year. It's a very strong year, strong improvement. 
So all these businesses to me have meaningful upside and especially the Beauty business has very good momentum, and Baby Care is accelerating. So I feel good about those."

And as you rightfully said, as people return to working outside their home, I think that will benefit the category. 
And what the team has done, which I think is very strong and very important going into the future, we're no longer a wet shave business. We're truly a grooming business with growth in wet shave, dry shave, which we call appliances. 
We're also growing in many of the new areas like IPL, the intense pulse light area. All of those, to me, give me confidence. And it's in the new segments as well. We have innovation coming, King C. Gillette, which helps people with facial hair. So it's a broader portfolio, innovation across all those different forms and segments and it's leading to mid-single top and double-digit bottom. So that's the strongest year we've had in many, many years in grooming. And the reason it's strong should continue because it's innovation-driven, consumer-driven."

So it pushes us to maintain and try to extend the advantage we have. 
Now we have full respect for our competitors. And you're right, we have very strong growth in both North America, Europe and Latin America. And in those markets, we'll see what happens next year. But if this share growth has been now sustained in North America for 3 years and in Europe for 3 years, so the focus markets are performing very well. 
And as Jon mentioned, we have very strong progress in the enterprise markets. We are mid-singles with double-digit growth in a very, very difficult environment. So that gives me confidence we're at least well positioned. 
But the other thing is very real, you have to earn it every day. And so our teams understand that our competitors are refocusing and those that lost share will come back with their innovations and investments. And it's our job to go earn it.

It's not coming back kind of to full extent as you would expect as you're taking pricing and what have you. And I just kind of want to understand if you think this is kind of a permanent change, if we've kind of made a shift back to where marketing and innovation really take the lead in terms of investment dollars and trade promotion never really kind of goes back to where it was pre-pandemic levels, or if you do see it starting to creep back into pre-pandemic levels.

The organization deserves a ton of credit and the total leadership team, but I appreciate your comments on me and very much agree with your comments on Jon. 
In terms of trade promotion, certainly, it's in our best interest to bring to our retail partners, programs that build their business and build their margin. I do believe, as you said that, that can best be done by innovation and market-growing plans. And there's roles they play with us in making sort of things like the shelf. The virtual or physical shelf is arranged in a way that creates market growth and helps consumers find the brands that they're most apt to use. We worked with retail partners around the world. And the ones we've partnered with best success is they grow, the market grows, the margin grows and that we help them do it, we get rewarded. 
So we will continue with that certainly objective. And certainly, our eyes are wide open. I expect from a very low base, we will see an increase in trade spending. Do I believe it will go all the way back to what it was before? I think many retailers are very interested in finding smart ways and they have the same pressures that we do with the commodity cost. They need as well as we to find ways to create value. So I'm hopeful that we'll see some thoughtful change in promotion strategy that is more value creating for the market."

The -- a quick one and then a little bit more involved one, please. The quick one, does the point guidance you gave us on cost headwinds and ForEx benefits, does that include hedging, current or anticipated? 
And then second, maybe a little more involved one is we've had a lot of discussions with consumer staples leaders in the past really 2 weeks about the state of retailer inventory. And that's largely a U.S. question, but it seems all over the board. A lot of retailers are seeing better foot traffic, certain retailers, certain channels have had unprecedented volume that's stuck around, and there's a little bit of a mentality of maybe taking on more inventory and shipping maybe not matching up with measured takeaway, not only in the U.S. but other places. And I think you touched both ways. 
So I know there's a lot to that question, but anything you could say about retailer inventories, where you think that is. And say, your big markets, your focus markets, where you stand and how that plays into your guidance for '22, your thoughts about that, how that plays in. I'd appreciate it."

There's a small amount of inventory build, but that's not really the focus. The focus is on how do we ensure supply and maintain the satisfaction of our shoppers. And that's a very fertile place for us to play.

Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, currently Vice Chair and incoming President and Chief Executive Officer as of November 1, and  John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. 
We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. The July to September quarter provides a good start to the fiscal year, putting us on track to deliver our guidance for organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to share owners. We experienced the full impact of rising commodity and transportation costs this quarter, but healthy top line growth and strong cost savings kept EPS growth nearly in line with prior year. Earnings growth should improve sequentially through the balance of the fiscal year as price increases go into effect and productivity programs ramp up. 
So moving to first quarter results. Organic sales grew 4%. Volume contributed 2 points of sales growth, pricing and mix each at 1 point. Growth was broad-based across business units with 9 out of 10 product categories growing organic sales. Personal Health Care up double digits. Fabric Care grew high singles. Baby Care, Feminine Care and Grooming, up mid-singles; Home Care, Oral Care, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care organic sales each up low single digits. Family Care declined mid-singles, comping very strong growth in the base period. Organic sales were up 4% in the U.S. despite 16% growth in the base period. On a 2-year stack basis, U.S. organic sales are up 20%. 
Greater China organic sales were in line with prior year due to strong growth in the base period comp and due to intra-quarter softness in beauty market growth. On a 2-year stack basis, organic -- China organic sales are up 12%, in line to slightly ahead of underlying market growth. Focus markets grew 4% for the quarter and enterprise markets were up 5%. E-commerce sales grew 16% versus prior year. 
Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points, 36 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. Our superiority strategy continues to drive strong market growth and in turn, share growth for P&G. All channel market value sales in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew mid-single digits this quarter, and P&G value share continued to grow to over 34%. We are up more than 1.5 points versus first quarter last year. Importantly, the share growth is broad-based 9 out of 10 product categories grew share over the past 3 months, with the tenth improving to flat versus year ago over the past 1 month. Consumers are continuing to prefer P&G brands. 
On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.61, down 1% versus the prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS declined 3%, mainly due to gross margin pressure from higher input costs, which we highlighted in our initial outlook for the year. Core gross margin decreased 370 basis points and currency-neutral core gross margin was down 390 basis points. Higher commodity and freight cost impacts combined were a 400 basis point hit to gross margins. Mix was an 80 basis point headwind, primarily due to geographic impacts.  Productivity savings, pricing and foreign exchange provided a partial offset to the gross margin headwinds. Within SG&A, marketing expense as a percentage of sales was in line with prior year level for the quarter, increasing more than 5% in absolute dollars, consistent with all-in sales growth. Core operating margin decreased 260 basis points. Currency-neutral core operating margin declined 270 basis points. Productivity improvements were 180 basis points help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 92%. 
We returned nearly $5 billion of cash to shareowners, $2.2 billion in dividends and approximately $2.8 billion in share repurchase. In summary, in the context of a very challenging cost environment, good results across top line, bottom line and cash to start the fiscal year. 
Our team continues to operate with excellence and stay focused on the near-term priorities and long-term strategies that enabled us to create strong momentum prior to the COVID crisis and to make our business even stronger since the crisis began. We continue to step forward into these challenges and to double down our efforts to delight consumers. As we continue to manage through this crisis, we remain focused on the 3 priorities that have been guiding our near-term actions and choices. First is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world; second, maximizing the availability of our products to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs; third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the front lines of this global pandemic. The strategic choices we've made are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation, a portfolio of daily use products,  many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. 
In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution, drive market growth. In our categories, this drives value creation for our retail partners and build market share for P&G brands. We've made investments to strengthen the health and competitiveness of our brands, and we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving solutions for consumers around the world. 
The strategic need for investment to continue to strengthen the superiority of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this challenging cost environment and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business, no area of cost is left untouched. Each business is driving productivity within their P&L and balance sheet to support balanced top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and to create new trends and technology that will shape the industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. 
When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis and have served us well during the volatile times. We're confident they remain the right strategy framework as we move through and beyond the crisis. 
Moving on to guidance. We will undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through this fiscal year. As we saw this quarter, growth results going forward will be heavily influenced by base period effects, along with the realities of current year cost pressures and continued effects of the global pandemic. Supply chains are under pressure from tight labor markets, tight transportation markets and overall capacity constraints. Inflationary pressures are broad-based and sustained. Foreign exchange rates add more volatility to this mix. We have also experienced some short-term disruptions in materials availability in several regions around the world. Our purchasing, R&D and logistics experts have done a great job managing these challenges. These costs and operational challenges are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impact. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. 
Input costs have continued to rise since we gave our initial outlook for the year in late July. Based on current spot prices, we now estimate a $2.1 billion after-tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal 2022. Fiscal cost -- freight costs have also continued to increase. We now expect freight and transportation costs to be an incremental $200 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '22. We will offset a portion of these higher costs with price increases and with productivity savings. As discussed last quarter and in the more recent investor conferences, we've announced price increases in the U.S. on portions of our Baby Care, Feminine Care, Adult Incontinence, Family Care, Home Care and Fabric Care businesses. In the last few weeks, we've also announced to retailers in the U.S. that we will increase prices on segments of our Grooming, Skin Care and Oral Care businesses. The degree and timing of these moves are very specific to the category, brand and sometimes the product form within a brand, this is not a one-size-fits-all approach. 
We're also taking pricing in many markets outside the U.S. to offset commodity, freight and foreign exchange impacts. As always, we will look to close a couple of price increases with new product innovations, adding value for consumers along the way. As we said before, we believe this is a temporary bottom line rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the business. We're sticking with the strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. Our good first quarter results confirm our guidance ranges for the fiscal year across all key metrics. We continue to expect organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Our solid start to the fiscal year increases our confidence in the upper half of this range. We expect pricing to be a larger contributor to sales growth in coming quarters as more of our price increases become effective in the market. 
As this pricing reaches store shelves, we'll be closely monitoring consumption trends. While it's still early in the pricing cycle, we haven't seen notable changes in consumer behavior. On the bottom line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of 3% to 6% despite the increased cost challenges we're facing. Foreign exchange is now expected to be neutral to after-tax earnings compared to the modest tailwind we estimated at the start of the year. Considering FX was a modest help to first quarter earnings, we're projecting it to be a headwind for the balance of the year. In total, our revised outlook for the impact of materials, freight and foreign exchange is now a $2.3 billion after-tax headwind for fiscal '22 earnings or roughly $0.90 per share, a 16 percentage point headwind to core EPS growth. This is $500 million after tax of incremental cost pressure versus our initial outlook for the year. Despite these cost challenges, we are committed to maintaining strong investment in our brands. So while we are not changing our core EPS guidance range, please take note of these dynamics as you update your outlook for the year. 
We will face the most significant cost impact in the first half of the fiscal year as pricing goes into effect as savings programs ramp up and as we begin to annualize the initial spike in input costs, earnings growth should be sequentially stronger in the third and fourth quarters of the year. We are targeting adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends and to repurchase $7 billion to $9 billion of common stock, combined to a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal. 
This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. To conclude, our business exhibited strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well positioned to grow beyond the crisis. We will manage through the near-term cost pressures and continued market level volatility with the strategy we've outlined many times and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products and helping society overcome the corporate challenges that still exist in many parts of the world. 
We'll continue to step forward towards our opportunities and remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to maintain balanced top and bottom line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

I'll start by saying that overall consumption trends remain strong globally, particularly as you said in the U.S., markets continue to grow within our categories of daily use, health and hygiene in the range of mid-singles. So from a consumption standpoint, consumer behavior continues to elevate the importance of health, hygiene and a clean home. More time at home certainly is also a factor. We continue to see elevated consumption on Bounty paper towels, for example, by 10%. Sharman bath tissue is still elevated, consuming about 5% with more time at home. So overall consumption trends remain strong and fuel most of the growth. We also have been able to grow share as we've outlined in our prepared remarks. Both on a global basis, we're up 50 basis points over the past 3 months, 70 basis points over the past 6 months. So that's certainly contributing to a stronger position to benefit from that growth. 
In the U.S., we've reached a record share of 34.4% of value share up more than 1 point Inventory effects, I would tell you, certainly play a role in some geographies. Mainly in China, we saw some inventory build in the base period, which the reverse is obviously happening in this period. But in the grand scheme of things, they don't really impact our consumption trends and our shipment trends in the quarter."

The increases that we are seeing are broad-based across commodity classes. Our forecast is based on spot rates. We are assuming that the spot rates sustain. So all of our productivity programs, all of our pricing programs, all of our innovation programs are based on the assumption that current spot rates as reflected in the current guidance will sustain. We do not hedge commodities per se. So the position that you see here is the position as it impacts our P&L. 
We offset within our natural hedging position within foreign exchange rate, commodity basket and interest rates. That's the best way for us to protect against volatility in the most cost-effective way to protect against volatility. In terms of supply chain dynamics, certainly, demand and supply have not balanced globally as we can see. We continue to see pressure on transportation and warehousing. We continue to see driver shortages, diesel increases. And as I mentioned before, across our commodity classes, whether it's chemicals, resins, packaging or pulp, these increases that we've seen and reflected in the current guidance reflects the existing market dynamics. So the best forecast we have is current spot, and that's what we're going to continue to operate against. 
We will -- as we articulated, I think, before and want to reemphasize in this call as well, we will recover these costs over time. We will not we will not sacrifice investment in the business as we do so. So strong productivity programs that are ramping up throughout the fiscal year. Pricing with innovation that we are bringing into the market if we can to improve value at the same time as we take pricing, or straight commodity pricing throughout the year will ease the margin pressures over time. But it will take time to recover the cost, and we will intentionally take our time to recover the cost to protect investment in our superiority strategy, which is working well to drive our top line growth and overall balance growth model."

And then I know you're probably not going to want to be too specific on the go forward. But just any insight on conceptually how you think about implementing pricing to offset cost pressures. Is there some point this fiscal year, when you think you'll catch up with the dollar cost pressure you're seeing year-over-year with dollar pricing, whether it be Q3 or Q4, is that unrealistic, just given the magnitude of cost pressures. 
And then the last point, just where you've taken pricing so far, it sounds like you haven't seen much demand impact. Maybe you can elaborate on that a bit and talk about the risk to market share momentum as you take pricing and how you guys think about that."

Look, we're taking pricing around the globe, and it's really a decision that is taken market by market, category by category. In many cases, SKU by SKU, depending on the situation in the market.

In many cases, SKU by SKU, depending on the situation in the market. So broad-based statements are difficult. So let me try to maybe focus on the U.S. here as a good example and our biggest market. We have now announced pricing in 9 out of 10 categories. So very broad-based. Many of these price increases are being implemented -- have been implemented in September or being implemented over the next, call it, 90 days. You've seen the price increases we've announced across Baby, Feminine Care, Family Care, they are mid-singles. I would expect even though the price increases on grooming, skin care have just been out, and they are different by SKU, about the same range. mid-singles is about the range that I would expect, again, out on the majority of our portfolio at this point. 
I cannot comment on future price increases but will continue to evolve as the situation evolves in terms of cost and in terms of ability to take more pricing. In terms of recovery of costs, we expect, as we said in our prepared remarks that the margin situation and the comp situation on core EPS will sequentially improve throughout the fiscal year. We will annualize part of the commodity cost increase starting with Q3 -- Most of the pricing will also take effect and actually flow through to the bottom line as of Q3, and our productivity programs will significantly ramp up throughout the fiscal year. All of that said, hard to predict exactly where we're going to land, but sequential progress is certainly what we are striving for. Most important point, as I said before, we will not reduce investment in the business. We continue to drive marketing spend. We continue to drive investment in superiority to sustain our balanced growth strategy for the mid and long term. 
Very early to read anything in terms of price elasticity. I will tell you for those price increases that have gone into the market in the U.S., most of them became effective middle of September. And we have not seen any material reaction from consumers in terms of volume offtake. So that makes us feel good about our relative position. And obviously, we feel that we should be in a favorable position given the strength of our portfolio. We're going into this pricing round with 75% of our portfolio truly superior. Probably 80% by the time most of these price increases hit, and that should give us a relatively strong position with consumers to deliver value in their mind even as we take pricing."

Given the inflationary cycle that we're in, how do you want to be positioned? You want to have -- first of all, being in categories that are daily use that are focused on -- where performance drives brand choice is a good place to be. Consumers through the pandemic have shifted their consumption in those categories towards trusted performing brands. And you see that even in what's happening with private label market shares as an example, down in the U.S. over the past 3, 6, 12 months down in Europe over the same periods of time. None of that is a guarantee for the future, but you start in a very good position with a strong superiority profile, as Andre said, and a strong innovation program and investment program to continue that work. 
Number two, you want to be -- just one more thing to add: number one, this is essentially a parcel of our business model. So sometimes the reaction is this pricing is a new dynamic. Pricing has been a positive contributor to our top line for 44 out of 47 for the last quarters and 16 out of the last 17 years. Again, no guarantee for the future, but we start with a business model that fundamentally supports pricing in a way that's value accretive to consumers. Second, you want to be in a position to minimize the need for pricing through productivity. We're in a better position in that regard than we've ever been. This organization has done a tremendous job reducing costs, and we'll continue to do so. You want to be in a position where you have product available at different price points to appeal to consumers for whom price is a bigger part of their personal value equation. We're in a much better position there than we were in the last cycle. So again, none of that is any guarantee for the future, but all of that positions us much better than we've been historically."

Look, we are certainly not immune to the stress that is put on the supply chains globally. And we are very thankful to our supply chain teams who have done a tremendous job in developing business continuity plans and executing against those business continuity plans over the past 18 months, 24 months as supply chains were stressed throughout the COVID pandemic. 
The strength of our supply chains is mainly driven by the flexibility that we can create within those supply chains. So strong supplier partnerships around the globe allow us to shift sourcing if we need to from 1 supplier to another, either because of supply not being available or freight lanes not being available to get material from point A to B. It also allows us to optimize cost to a degree. And we've been doing that over the past few months and will continue to do so. We have an ability to reformulate some of our products, which we're doing actively without impacting the superiority of the product or any noticeable impact to the consumer. And that gives us flexibility to adjust again to material availability or cost. 
We also have an organization that looks around the corner, anticipates potential bottlenecks and then choose to build inventories, either on materials, in intermediates or on finished products to then be able to withdraw from those inventories on a global basis. So it doesn't mean that we build inventory in the same region where we consume, but we have the ability to do that on a global basis. So in that sense, the global footprint is an advantage to us. As I said, we're not immune to any impact here. But if history is any indication of the future, we feel relatively well positioned because of the strength of our organization here. Of course, if there are any major disruptions to supply chains, we would be exposed just like everyone else. 
In terms of energy availability, we'll acknowledge that we've obviously been part of some of those curtailments that we've seen in China, for example, but they have not had a material effect of our supply chains. Again, when you think about our ability to potentially source from other regions for a period of time, most of our factories are able to run formula cards and run products, 4 other regions which gives us flexibility on our footprint to overcome short-term challenges."

Second, related, the increments of capacity that we can off-take generate economics at the supplier level that make investments viable.

And again, the dynamics I was describing within our supply chain is how we're dealing with it, and it changes really period by period. 
On the overall cost trade-off versus strategy, I will start, and then I'm sure John has a lot to add here. I would say that sticking to our strategy is core and the commitment is relentless. We have, over many periods, tried to do it in a different way, and that is not a good outcome. So our ability to continue to invest in superiority, drive innovation, grow markets and thereby build our share and improve our retailers business is core to the business model of balanced growth, balanced growth across the top line with moderate margin expansion to drive the bottom line and cash productivity is the only way forward for the industry and is the way forward for P&G. 
We will continue to be on this path even if in the short term and midterm, that means margin pressure will continue to rise. We would do everything possible within our P&L, within the balance sheet to optimize for productivity, and we continue to have significant opportunities and productivity that do not impact our ability to run the business model. When you think about our marketing spend, we estimate there is still significant opportunity to optimize in the ability to reach consumers more broadly and more effectively at significantly lower cost as our digital reach increases. We have significant opportunities still in our supply chain to optimize, leverage the digitization we've been investing in, in our supply chain over the past years, better synchronized demand from suppliers all the way to retail partners. And there are certainly still opportunities within our overhead structure where we can optimize work processes, leverage innovation, leverage automation to focus employees on higher order tasks.

Nowhere in there, at least to my ears, is pulling back on investment. The third and last piece of perspective I'd offer. The productivity muscle that we built, and Andre was just describing the opportunities that remain there, which are significant, will or should build margin over time.

So the game here is stay on course, continue to drive productivity to fuel investment in superiority in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. 
We do all of that over time. As Andre said, that is the recipe for balanced growth, growing the top line, and the bottom line. We're in an environment where there will be volatility across quarters.

It doesn't all have to be productivity, it can be mixed as some of those lower-margin regions become more profitable. Can you give us an update on those enterprise markets have some swung to be less of a whatever hold back from a margin perspective? And what's the outlook there? 
And then, Andre, you talked so fast at the beginning, I didn't get the number for the growth in the enterprise market. If you could give us that, again, that would be great."

So we're in a very good position in enterprise markets. If we look at the quarter we just completed, focus markets grew 4%. Enterprise markets grew 5%. Having said all of that, a part of a responsible answer has to address the volatility that exists in these markets from a geopolitical standpoint and unfortunately, from a health and COVID standpoint. So it's not a straight line in all likelihood from here or there, but we're much, much better positioned, and I give all the credit to the teams on the ground in these markets who are operating in very difficult. But as you rightly indicate, promising environments."

And secondly, more high level. it will be interesting how the earnings season plays out. But I'm guessing when we look back in the rearview mirror, you will have recorded one of the weakest price lines in the group and perhaps be the only one to not show sequential acceleration. And I guess my question is why are we not seeing more? Is this a competitive strategy? And if so, how much of your market share momentum would you attribute to your -- what seems to be an approach to dragging your feet on price?

We would have expected some quarter-to-quarter volatility due to base period dynamics and also some continued effects of COVID shutdowns on a regional level. Overall, we feel well positioned with our portfolio within China and expect the market to return to mid-single-digit growth going forward. Again, we take some comfort in the retail sales coming up to above 4% again. in the past quarter. 
On beauty, specifically, we've seen our strongest results in hair care in fiscal '21, '22 in China with strong top line growth and strong bottom line growth. SK-II, sales were flat in China for the quarter. But again, on a 13% increase last fiscal year. We see Travel Retail coming up in SK-II. So that also needs to be considered as we think about the total market of SK-II consumption. So certainly a slowdown in the market in the first quarter, specifically, as you point out on skincare and in the beauty sector overall, we feel still confident in our ability to win in the market and in the market's ability to sustain mid-single-digit market growth."

We're also annualizing a base period where we had lower promotion in the market, as you recall, we are now seeing a normalization of promotion levels back to around 30% volume sold on deal. So that's certainly offsetting some of the pricing that you otherwise would see flow through. we certainly expect pricing to become a bigger part of the top line and the bottom line construct going forward as the pricing again, materializes in the markets. And as we said before, we are not lagging pricing. We are driving pricing by category, ideally in line with innovation to ensure that we have the best possible value creation for consumers. 
We're executing SKU by SKU, market by market in what is right for that market in that particular scenario, and that's driving the pricing. And we expect pricing to be a net positive to the top line and to the share position."

It's specifically in the U.S. is obviously pure play, but many of our omni partners, so when you think about target.com, walmart.com, et cetera, where you have fulfillment from store, pick up at store play a significant role in that growth trajectory. The business in the U.S., specifically, we see about 11% growth in our e-comm business. So again, continued strong momentum across all of these formats. 
We are well positioned in e-com for multiple reasons. As we explained before, we believe that a focus on strong brands as driven by COVID is benefiting us, specifically also in an e-com environment where we show up in search on the first page. And we are generally able to explain our benefits, our superiority at a more detailed e-content than we would be at a shelf, for example. We have strong relationships with our partners as it comes to developing propositions and ensuring that our positions are fit for use in either e-com channel or omnichannel. 
And when you think about an omni environment, being the leading brand generally results in more shelf space, more inventory on the shelves. So as consumers order, we can make sure that we are in stock that as we're being picked up, we have product on shelf and therefore, can be found and can be fulfilled in store. So generally, e-com, we believe, plays to our strength, and we can support our e-comm business with strong marketing and brand building to sustain that level of growth."

From a marketing efficiency standpoint, I think you'll see a combination of both. We -- as I said, I think we'll continue to drive efficiency as we bring more media spend into our optimized targeting pool.  As we increase the percentage of digital media around the world as we continue to optimize our own algorithms to target messaging to consumers. There continues to be significant opportunity.

So I think the strength of consumption in our categories is really driven by the choice of categories that we operate in. We've chosen to be not in discretionary, but in daily use essential categories for the consumer. -- again, health, hygiene-focused and the clean home. The consumer continues to elevate the importance of these jobs coming out of COVID we've seen in COVID. And I think that continues to drive the importance of these categories and our ability to win in these categories because consumers return or turn to trusted brands because they know that they can deliver on the promise and the job to be done. We see that in our share results. And as Jon mentioned, we see it in the reverse share results of private label, for example, declining both in the U.S. and Europe over time. We also benefit and the consumer spending shows it from more time at home, which we believe is an ongoing phenomenon.  More time at home means more meals at home, more dishwashing at home, more laundry at home. And again, those elements benefit our brands and our categories in terms of growth. 
We will continue to focus on superiority, as we said before, to ensure that we have the strongest solutions for our consumers at any price point at any price ladder. But really, we benefit, I think, from overall more time at home and an elevated focus on our categories. 
On the -- on the organic price/mix and guidance, you're right. We are expecting pricing to become a bigger part of the top line construct as we said throughout the year. We are 1 quarter in. There's a lot of volatility in the market. And so we believe that it's prudent to maintain the guidance range of 2% to 4% on the top line. But as we said in our prepared remarks, quarter 1 results give us confidence to the upper half of that guidance range."

We have, since the interaction of that about a year ago, we've built over 2 points of share, which has come by driving the market. The market is up 14% over that period of time. We've driven over 50% of that. So what you see is a consumer who is responsive to performance-based innovation. We can utilize that responsiveness to grow markets in a constructive way, which, as Andreas mentioned many times, is beneficial to our retail partners and is constructive from a market dynamic standpoint.

But we feel good about our ability to deal with the ongoing supply chain pressures, and that's reflected in the organic sales guidance. Look, I think the story behind Fabric Care is really bringing to life the strategy. This is a category where performance drives brand choice, where daily use is essential to the consumer, and performance is very visible. 
And the category has done a phenomenal job in driving superiority with new forms or by creating new jobs to be done that are relevant for the consumer. If you think about single-unit dose, for example, very superior proposition, very -- very intuitive to the consumer in terms of use.  A premiumization of the category in trading up dollars per wash with superior cleaning properties and penetration outside of the U.S. still is a significant growth opportunity. In Germany and Canada, we only had 20% household penetration on single-unit dose. And in Japan, we're only at 11%. So there continues to be significant runway with a truly superior product form. We also, in Fabric Care, have done -- the team has done a phenomenal job in looking into fast-growing new segments. When you think about fabric enhancers, 14% growth in the quarter. Beat, for example, right now is a $1 billion brand and continues to grow significantly. Household penetration in the U.S. on beats only 20% load penetration, only about 30%.

Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, currently Vice Chair and incoming President and Chief Executive Officer as of November 1; and  John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.  
We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. The July to September quarter provides a good start to the fiscal year, putting us on track to deliver our guidance for organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to share owners. We experienced the full impact of rising commodity and transportation costs this quarter, but healthy top line growth and strong cost savings kept EPS growth nearly in line with prior year. Earnings growth should improve sequentially through the balance of the fiscal year as price increases go into effect and productivity programs ramp up.  
So moving to first quarter results. Organic sales grew 4%. Volume contributed 2 points of sales growth, pricing and mix each added 1 point. Growth was broad-based across business units with 9 out of 10 product categories growing organic sales. Personal Health Care, up double digits; Fabric Care grew high singles; Baby Care, Feminine Care and Grooming, up mid-singles; Home Care, Oral Care, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care organic sales each up low single digits. Family Care declined mid-singles, comping very strong growth in the base period. 
Organic sales were up 4% in the U.S. despite 16% growth in the base period. On a 2-year stack basis, U.S. organic sales are up 20%.  
Greater China organic sales were in line with prior year due to strong growth in the base period comp and due to intra-quarter softness in beauty market growth. On a 2-year stack basis, organic China -- China organic sales are up 12%, in line to slightly ahead of underlying market growth. 
Focus markets grew 4% for the quarter and enterprise markets were up 5%. E-commerce sales grew 16% versus prior year.  Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points, 36 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. 
Our superiority strategy continues to drive strong market growth and in turn, share growth for P&G. All channel market value sales in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew mid-single digits this quarter, and P&G value share continued to grow to over 34%. We are up more than 1.5 points versus first quarter last year. 
Importantly, the share growth is broad-based 9 out of 10 product categories grew share over the past 3 months, with the tenth improving to flat versus year ago over the past 1 month. Consumers are continuing to prefer P&G brands.  
On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.61, down 1% versus the prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS declined 3%, mainly due to gross margin pressure from higher input costs, which we highlighted in our initial outlook for the year. 
Core gross margin decreased 370 basis points and currency-neutral core gross margin was down 390 basis points. Higher commodity and freight cost impacts combined were a 400 basis point hit to gross margins. Mix was an 80 basis point headwind, primarily due to geographic impacts. Productivity savings, pricing and foreign exchange provided a partial offset to the gross margin headwinds. 
Within SG&A, marketing expense as a percentage of sales was in line with prior year level for the quarter, increasing more than 5% in absolute dollars, consistent with all-in sales growth. 
Core operating margin decreased 260 basis points. Currency-neutral core operating margin declined 270 basis points. Productivity improvements were 180 basis points help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 92%.  We returned nearly $5 billion of cash to shareowners, $2.2 billion in dividends and approximately $2.8 billion in share repurchase. 
In summary, in the context of a very challenging cost environment, good results across top line, bottom line and cash to start the fiscal year.  
Our team continues to operate with excellence and stay focused on the near-term priorities and long-term strategies that enabled us to create strong momentum prior to the COVID crisis and to make our business even stronger since the crisis began. We continue to step forward into these challenges and to double down our efforts to delight consumers. 
As we continue to manage through this crisis, we remain focused on the 3 priorities that have been guiding our near-term actions and choices. First is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world; second, maximizing the availability of our products to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs; third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the front lines of this global pandemic. 
The strategic choices we've made are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation, a portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice.  
In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution, drive market growth. In our categories, this drives value creation for our retail partners and builds market share for P&G brands. We've made investments to strengthen the health and competitiveness of our brands, and we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving solutions for consumers around the world.  
The strategic need for investment to continue to strengthen the superiority of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this challenging cost environment and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business, no area of cost is left untouched. Each business is driving productivity within their P&L and balance sheet to support balanced top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation. 
Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and to create new trends and technology that will shape the industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. 
Our organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other.  
When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis and have served us well during the volatile times. We're confident they remain the right strategy framework as we move through and beyond the crisis.  
Moving on to guidance. We will undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through this fiscal year. As we saw this quarter, growth results going forward will be heavily influenced by base period effects, along with the realities of current year cost pressures and continued effects of the global pandemic. 
Supply chains are under pressure from tight labor markets, tight transportation markets and overall capacity constraints. Inflationary pressures are broad-based and sustained. Foreign exchange rates add more volatility to this mix. We have also experienced some short-term disruptions in materials availability in several regions around the world. Our purchasing, R&D and logistics experts have done a great job managing these challenges. 
These costs and operational challenges are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impact. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time.  
Input costs have continued to rise since we gave our initial outlook for the year in late July. Based on current spot prices, we now estimate a $2.1 billion after-tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal 2022. Fiscal cost -- freight costs have also continued to increase. We now expect freight and transportation costs to be an incremental $200 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '22. We will offset a portion of these higher costs with price increases and with productivity savings. 
As discussed last quarter and in the more recent investor conferences, we've announced price increases in the U.S. on portions of our Baby Care, Feminine Care, Adult Incontinence, Family Care, Home Care and Fabric Care businesses. In the last few weeks, we've also announced to retailers in the U.S. that we will increase prices on segments of our Grooming, Skin Care and Oral Care businesses. The degree and timing of these moves are very specific to the category, brand and sometimes the product form within a brand. This is not a one-size-fits-all approach.  
We're also taking pricing in many markets outside the U.S. to offset commodity, freight and foreign exchange impacts. As always, we will look to close a couple of price increases with new product innovations, adding value for consumers along the way. As we said before, we believe this is a temporary bottom line rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the business. We're sticking with the strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. 
Our good first quarter results confirm our guidance ranges for the fiscal year across all key metrics. We continue to expect organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Our solid start to the fiscal year increases our confidence in the upper half of this range. We expect pricing to be a larger contributor to sales growth in coming quarters as more of our price increases become effective in the market. As this pricing reaches store shelves, we'll be closely monitoring consumption trends. While it's still early in the pricing cycle, we haven't seen notable changes in consumer behavior. 
On the bottom line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of 3% to 6% despite the increased cost challenges we're facing. Foreign exchange is now expected to be neutral to after-tax earnings compared to the modest tailwind we estimated at the start of the year. Considering FX was a modest help to first quarter earnings, we're projecting it to be a headwind for the balance of the year. 
In total, our revised outlook for the impact of materials, freight and foreign exchange is now a $2.3 billion after-tax headwind for fiscal '22 earnings or roughly $0.90 per share, a 16 percentage point headwind to core EPS growth. This is $500 million after tax of incremental cost pressure versus our initial outlook for the year. Despite these cost challenges, we are committed to maintaining strong investment in our brands. So while we are not changing our core EPS guidance range, please take note of these dynamics as you update your outlook for the year.  
We will face the most significant cost impacts in the first half of the fiscal year as pricing goes into effect, as savings programs ramp up and as we begin to annualize the initial spike in input costs. Earnings growth should be sequentially stronger in the third and fourth quarters of the year. 
We are targeting adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends and to repurchase $7 billion to $9 billion of common stock, combined a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year.  
This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. 
To conclude, our business exhibited strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We've strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well positioned to grow beyond the crisis. We will manage through the near-term cost pressures and continued market-level volatility with the strategy we've outlined many times and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products and helping society overcome the COVID challenges that still exists in many parts of the world.  
We'll continue to step forward toward our opportunities and remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to maintain balanced top and bottom line growth. 
With that, we'll be happy to take your questions."

I'll start by saying that overall consumption trends remain strong globally, particularly as you said, in the U.S., markets continue to grow within our categories of daily use, health and hygiene in the range of mid-singles. So from a consumption standpoint, consumer behavior continues to elevate the importance of health, hygiene and a clean home. 
More time at home certainly is also a factor. We continue to see elevated consumption on Bounty paper towels, for example, by 10%. Shower and bath tissue is still elevated, consuming about 5% with more time at home. So overall consumption trends remain strong and fuel most of the growth. 
We also have been able to grow share, as we've outlined in our prepared remarks. Both on a global basis, we're up 50 basis points over the past 3 months, 70 basis points over the past 6 months. So that's certainly contributing to a stronger position to benefit from that growth.  
In the U.S., we've reached record share of 34.4% of value share, up more than 1 point. Inventory effects, I would tell you, certainly play a role in some geographies. Mainly in China, we saw some inventory build in the base period, which the reverse is obviously happening in this period. But in the grand scheme of things, they don't really impact our consumption trends and our shipment trends in the quarter."

And then just broader views as best you can share. I don't know if around the supply chain issues, overall expectation in terms of how long these challenges are going to remain a headwind and just how you're thinking about the cadence of gross margin restoration as you sort of try to get back to low 50% gross margin, I think that would be helpful."

The increases that we are seeing are broad-based across commodity classes. Our forecast is based on spot rates. We are assuming that these spot rates sustain. So all of our productivity programs, all of our pricing programs, all of our innovation programs are based on the assumption that current spot rates, as reflected in the current guidance, will sustain. 
We do not hedge commodities per se. So the position that you see here is the position as it impacts our P&L. We offset within our natural hedging position within foreign exchange rate, commodity basket and interest rates. That's the best way for us to protect against volatility and the most cost-effective way to protect against volatility. 
In terms of supply chain dynamics, certainly, demand and supply have not balanced globally as we can see. We continue to see pressure on transportation and warehousing. We continue to see driver shortages, diesel increases. And as I mentioned before, across our commodity classes, whether it's chemicals, resins, packaging or pulp, these increases that we've seen as reflected in the current guidance reflects the existing market dynamics. So the best forecast we have is current spot, and that's what we're going to continue to operate against.  
We will -- as we articulated, I think, before and want to reemphasize in this call as well, we will recover these costs over time. We will not sacrifice investment in the business as we do so. So strong productivity programs that are ramping up throughout the fiscal year. Pricing with innovation that we are bringing into the market, if we can, to improve value at the same time as we take pricing, or straight commodity pricing throughout the year will ease the margin pressures over time. But it will take time to recover the cost, and we will intentionally take our time to recover the cost to protect investment in our superiority strategy, which is working well to drive our top line growth and overall balanced growth model."

And then I know you're probably not going to want to be too specific on the go forward. But just any insight on conceptually how you think about implementing pricing to offset cost pressures. Is there some point this fiscal year, when you think you'll catch up with the dollar cost pressure you're seeing year-over-year with dollar pricing, whether it be Q3 or Q4? Is that unrealistic just given the magnitude of cost pressures? 
And then the last point, just where you've taken pricing so far, it sounds like you haven't seen much demand impact. Maybe you can elaborate on that a bit and talk about the risk to market share momentum as you take pricing and how you guys think about that."

Look, we're taking pricing around the globe, and it's really a decision that is taken market by market, category by category, in many cases, SKU by SKU, depending on the situation in the market. So broad-based statements are difficult. 
So let me try to maybe focus on the U.S. here as a good example and our biggest market. We have now announced pricing in 9 out of 10 categories. So very broad-based. Many of these price increases are being implemented -- have been implemented in September or are being implemented over the next, call it, 90 days. You've seen the price increases we've announced across Baby, Feminine Care, Family Care, they are mid-singles. I would expect, even though the price increases on Grooming, Skin Care have just been out, and they are different by SKU, about the same range. Mid-singles is about the range that I would expect, again, out on the majority of our portfolio at this point.  
I cannot comment on future price increases but will continue to evolve as the situation evolves in terms of cost and in terms of ability to take more pricing. 
In terms of recovery of costs, we expect, as we said in our prepared remarks, that the margin situation and the comp situation on core EPS will sequentially improve throughout the fiscal year. We will annualize part of the commodity cost increase starting with Q3. Most of the pricing will also take effect and actually flow through to the bottom line as of Q3, and our productivity programs will significantly ramp up throughout the fiscal year. All of that said, hard to predict exactly where we're going to land, but sequential progress is certainly what we are striving for. 
Most important point, as I said before, we will not reduce investment in the business. We continue to drive marketing spend. We continue to drive investment in superiority to sustain our balanced growth strategy for the mid and long term.  
Very early to read anything in terms of price elasticity. I will tell you for those price increases that have gone into the market in the U.S., most of them became effective middle of September. And we have not seen any material reaction from consumers in terms of volume offtake. So that makes us feel good about our relative position. And obviously, we feel that we should be in a favorable position given the strength of our portfolio. We're going into this pricing round with 75% of our portfolio truly superior. Probably 80% by the time most of these price increases hit, and that should give us a relatively strong position with consumers to deliver value in their mind even as we take pricing."

Given the inflationary cycle that we're in, how do you want to be positioned? You want to have -- first of all, being in categories that are daily use, that are focused on -- where performance drives brand choice is a good place to be. 
Consumers through the pandemic have shifted their consumption in those categories towards trusted performing brands. And you see that even in what's happening with private label market shares as an example, down in the U.S. over the past 3, 6, 12 months, down in Europe over the same periods of time. None of that is a guarantee for the future, but you start in a very good position with a strong superiority profile, as Andre said, and a strong innovation program and investment program to continue that work.  
Number two, you want to be -- just one more thing to add to number one. This is essentially part and parcel of our business model. So sometimes, the reaction is this pricing is a new dynamic. Pricing has been a positive contributor to our top line for 44 out of 47 of the last quarters and 16 out of the last 17 years. Again, no guarantee for the future, but we start with a business model that fundamentally supports pricing in a way that's value accretive to consumers. 
Second, you want to be in a position to minimize the need for pricing through productivity. We're in a better position in that regard than we've ever been. This organization has done a tremendous job reducing costs, and we'll continue to do so. You want to be in a position where you have product available at different price points to appeal to consumers for whom price is a bigger part of their personal value equation. We're in a much better position there than we were in the last cycle. 
So again, none of that is any guarantee for the future, but all of that positions us much better than we've been historically."

Look, we are certainly not immune to the stress that is put on the supply chains globally. And we are very thankful to our supply chain teams who have done a tremendous job in developing business continuity plans and executing against those business continuity plans over the past 18 months, 24 months as supply chains were stressed throughout the COVID pandemic. 
The strength of our supply chains is mainly driven by the flexibility that we can create within those supply chains. So strong supplier partnerships around the globe allow us to shift sourcing if we need to from one supplier to another, either because of supply not being available or freight lanes not being available to get material from point A to B. It also allows us to optimize cost to a degree. And we've been doing that over the past few months and will continue to do so. We have an ability to reformulate some of our products, which we're doing actively without impacting the superiority of the product or any noticeable impact to the consumer. And that gives us flexibility to adjust again to material availability or cost. 
We also have an organization that looks around the corner, anticipates potential bottlenecks and then chooses to build inventories, either on materials, in intermediates or on finished products to then be able to withdraw from those inventories on a global basis. So it doesn't mean that we build inventory in the same region where we consume, but we have the ability to do that on a global basis. So in that sense, the global footprint is an advantage to us. 
As I said, we're not immune to any impact here. But if history is any indication of the future, we feel relatively well positioned because of the strength of our organization here. Of course, if there are any major disruptions to supply chains, we would be exposed just like everyone else. 
In terms of energy availability, we'll acknowledge that we've obviously been part of some of those curtailments that we've seen in China, for example, but they have not had a material effect of our supply chains.

Second, and related, the increments of capacity that we can off-take generate economics at the supplier level that make investments viable. If we were just adding to demand on the margin, that would be a very different equation. So we become a very attractive customer for our suppliers because of both the size and importantly, the momentum of our business."

And I wanted to follow up on the comments you made regarding continuing to invest, and that is a priority. But what if the cost situation gets worse? What if competitors don't act rationally on pricing? It looks like they will, but what if they don't? Like as a CEO of Prop & Gamble, what trade-offs are you willing to make? Is there a threshold where you say, ""Hey, look, we have to cut back on investments because we have to protect the margins so we can reinvest down the road."" Any clarity around that would be very helpful."

So it's really different week by week. I wouldn't point to any specific material that is structurally more exposed than another. It really is across the input basket. And again, the dynamics I was describing within our supply chain is how we're dealing with it, and it changes really period by period. 
On the overall cost trade-off versus strategy, I will start, and then I'm sure Jon has a lot to add here. I would say that sticking to our strategy is core and the commitment is relentless. We have, over many periods, tried to do it in a different way, and that is not a good outcome. So our ability to continue to invest in superiority, drive innovation, grow markets and thereby build our share and improve our retailers business is core to the business model of balanced growth. Balanced growth across the top line with moderate margin expansion to drive the bottom line and cash productivity is the only way forward for the industry and is the way forward for P&G. 
We will continue to be on this path even if, in the short term and midterm, that means margin pressure will continue to rise. We will do everything possible within our P&L, within the balance sheet, to optimize for productivity, and we continue to have significant opportunities and productivity that do not impact our ability to run the business model. 
When you think about our marketing spend, we estimate there is still significant opportunity to optimize in the ability to reach consumers more broadly and more effectively at significantly lower cost as our digital reach increases. We have significant opportunities still in our supply chain to optimize, leverage the digitization we've been investing in, in our supply chain over the past years, better synchronized demand from suppliers all the way to retail partners. And there are certainly still opportunities within our overhead structure where we can optimize work processes, leverage innovation, leverage automation to focus employees on higher order tasks. 
So Jon, I'm sure you have a point of view here."

Just a couple of pieces of perspective. First, this is a time to step forward, not back. Second, Andre, in his prepared remarks, articulated again the 3 priorities and the integrated set of strategies. Nowhere in there, at least to my ears, is pulling back on investment. The third and last piece of perspective I'd offer. The productivity muscle that we built, and Andre was just describing the opportunities that remain there, which are significant, will or should build margin over time. 
If we look at the last 12 years, our operating margin on an all-in basis has increased 320 basis points from 20.4% to 23.6% last year. On a constant currency basis, that's an increase of 1,020 basis points. So the game here is stay on course, continue to drive productivity to fuel investment in superiority, in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. 
We do all of that, over time, as Andre said, that is the recipe for balanced growth, growing the top line, and the bottom line. We're in an environment where there will be volatility across quarters. That's not our concern. We're concerned about the execution of the holistic strategy and the value that, that creates over time."

It doesn't all have to be productivity, it can be mixed as some of those lower-margin regions become more profitable. Can you give us an update on those enterprise markets have some swung to be less of a -- whatever, hold back from a margin perspective? And what's the outlook there?

First, can you expound more on what's happening in China, particularly on the Beauty business? Because I think there are some references in the press release around mix and some slowing growth in Skin Care. I suspect it's tethered to China. 
And secondly, more high level. It will be interesting how the earnings season plays out. But I'm guessing when we look back in the rearview mirror, you will have recorded one of the weakest price lines in the group and perhaps be the only one to not show sequential acceleration.

We would have expected some quarter-to-quarter volatility due to base period dynamics and also some continued effects of COVID shutdowns on a regional level. 
Overall, we feel well positioned with our portfolio within China and expect the market to return to mid-single-digit growth going forward. Again, we take some comfort in the retail sales coming up to above 4% again in the past quarter. 
On Beauty, specifically, we've seen our strongest results in Hair Care in fiscal '21, '22 in China with strong top line growth and strong bottom line growth. SK-II, sales were flat in China for the quarter. But again, on a 13% increase last fiscal year. We see Travel Retail coming up in SK-II. So that also needs to be considered as we think about the total market of SK-II consumption. 
So certainly a slowdown in the market in the first quarter, specifically, as you point out on Skin Care and in the Beauty sector overall, we feel still confident in our ability to win in the market and in the market's ability to sustain mid-single-digit market growth."

We're also annualizing a base period where we had lower promotion in the market, as you recall. We are now seeing a normalization of promotion levels back to around 30% volume sold on deal. So that's certainly offsetting some of the pricing that you otherwise would see flow through. 
I -- we certainly expect pricing to become a bigger part of the top line and the bottom line construct going forward as the pricing, again, materializes in the markets. And as we said before, we are not lagging pricing. We are driving pricing by category, ideally, in line with innovation to ensure that we have the best possible value creation for consumers. We're executing SKU by SKU, market by market in what is right for that market in that particular scenario, and that's driving the pricing.

It's -- specifically in the U.S., it's obviously pure play, but many of our omni partners, so when you think about target.com, walmart.com, et cetera, where you have fulfillment from store, pick up at store, play a significant role in that growth trajectory. 
The business in the U.S., specifically, we see about 11% growth in our e-comm business. So again, continued strong momentum across all of these formats. 
We are well positioned in e-comm for multiple reasons. As we explained before, we believe that a focus on strong brands as driven by COVID is benefiting us, specifically also in an e-comm environment where we show up in search on the first page. And we are generally able to explain our benefits, our superiority via more detailed e-content than we would be at a shelf, for example. We have strong relationships with our partners as it comes to developing propositions and ensuring that our positions are fit for use in either e-comm channel or omnichannel. 
And when you think about an omni environment, being the leading brand generally results in more shelf space, more inventory on the shelf. So as consumers order, we can make sure that we are in stock, that as we're being picked up, we have product on shelf and therefore, can be found and can be fulfilled in store. So generally, e-comm, we believe, plays to our strength, and we can support our e-comm business with strong marketing and brand building to sustain that level of growth."

From a marketing efficiency standpoint, I think you'll see a combination of both.

We've chosen to be not in discretionary, but in daily use essential categories for the consumer. Again, health, hygiene-focused and the clean home. 
The consumer continues to elevate the importance of these jobs coming out of COVID we've seen in COVID. And I think that continues to drive the importance of these categories and our ability to win in these categories because consumers return or turn to trusted brands because they know that they can deliver on the promise and the job to be done. 
We see that in our share results. And as Jon mentioned, we see it in the reverse share results of private label, for example, declining both in the U.S. and Europe over time. 
We also benefit, and the consumer spending shows it, from more time at home, which we believe is an ongoing phenomenon. More time at home means more meals at home, more dishwashing at home, more laundry at home. And again, those elements benefit our brands and our categories in terms of growth. 
We will continue to focus on superiority, as we said before, to ensure that we have the strongest solutions for our consumers at any price point, at any price ladder. But really, we benefit, I think, from overall more time at home and an elevated focus on our categories. 
On the -- on the organic price/mix and guidance, you're right. We are expecting pricing to become a bigger part of the top line construct as we said throughout the year. We are 1 quarter in. There's a lot of volatility in the market. And so we believe that it's prudent to maintain the guidance range of 2% to 4% on the top line.

We have -- since the introduction of that about a year ago, we've built over 2 points of share, which has come by driving the market. The market is up 14% over that period of time. We've driven over 50% of that. 
So what you see is a consumer who is responsive to performance-based innovation. We can utilize that responsiveness to grow markets in a constructive way, which, as Andre has mentioned many times, is beneficial to our retail partners and is constructive from a market dynamic standpoint. So there are many categories where through performance-based innovation, we can provide more delight through regimen solutions, we can provide more delight. The consumer generally is responsive to performance in these categories and consumption is expandable."

Just around the organic sales guidance for the year. You've made some statements just around material supply chain constraints, how much of that is factored into how you're thinking about the full year organic sales outlook? 
And then just from a categories perspective, Fabric Care has been a good story. Volumes were particularly strong again on difficult comps. Just in general, what do you think is driving the share gains that you've seen in the category? We've heard about some material constraints for some of your competitors. Do you think that's a factor? Is this more about innovation? Just in general some perspective on what you think is driving this particularly strong delivery on the Fabric Care side of the business."

Thank you. So on organic sales guidance, as we said, I think the supply chain pressures that we see today and our ability to deal with those pressures as we have been over the past 18 to 24 months, is anticipated to continue in the organic sales guidance that we've given. And any unforeseen major disruptions, obviously, we will have to reassess and see where we are. But we feel good about our ability to deal with the ongoing supply chain pressures, and that's reflected in the organic sales guidance. 
Look, I think the story behind Fabric Care is really bringing to life the strategy. This is a category where performance drives brand choice, where daily use is essential to the consumer, and performance is very visible. And the category has done a phenomenal job in driving superiority with new forms or by creating new jobs to be done that are relevant for the consumer. If you think about single-unit dose, for example, very superior proposition, very -- very intuitive to the consumer in terms of use. 
A premiumization of the category in trading up dollars per wash with superior cleaning properties and penetration outside of the U.S. still is a significant growth opportunity. In Germany and Canada, we only had 20% household penetration on single-unit dose. And in Japan, we're only at 11%. So there continues to be significant runway with a truly superior product form. 
We also, in Fabric Care, have done -- the team has done a phenomenal job in looking into fast-growing new segments. When you think about fabric enhancers, 14% growth in the quarter. Beads, for example, right now is a $1 billion brand and continues to grow significantly. Household penetration in the U.S. on beads only 20%, load penetration, only about 30%. So there continues to be significant runway with superior innovation and superior products. So we continue to drive that, and that's what you see in the results."
