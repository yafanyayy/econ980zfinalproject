Welcome to FMC Corporation's Fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Mark Douglas, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mark wil",2547,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FMC Corporation's Fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Mark Douglas, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andrew Sandifer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mark will review our fourth quarter and full year performance and provide our outlook for 2021 and the quarter. Andrew will provide an overview of select financial items. Following the prepared remarks, we will take questions. 
Our earnings release and today's slide presentation are available on our website, and the prepared remarks from today's discussion will be made available after the call. Let me remind you that today's presentation and discussion will include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors, including, but not limited to, those factors identified in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. 
Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties [Audio Gap] Our very strong Q1 2020, makes this quarter year-over-year comparison, a particularly difficult one. 
All of FMC's manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and fully staffed, despite the ongoing pandemic. However, 1 of our U.S. toll manufacturers was disrupted in Q4 because of COVID related staffing issues, illustrating just 1 of the ongoing business risks during the pandemic. 
We successfully completed the implementation of our new SAP system in November. We now have a single modern system across the entire company for the first time in our history, which is enabling significant efficiencies in our back-office processes. 
And finally, we give a thorough technology update to investors on November '17, highlighting the increasingly positive impact new synthetic and biological active ingredients will have on our business over the next decade and the ways in which we are driving to be the leader in crop protection innovation. 
We plan to launch 7 new active ingredients of 4 new biologicals this decade, which we expect will contribute a combined $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion in incremental sales by 2030. We recently announced a new collaboration with Novozymes, a world leader in enzyme discovery and production to research, co-develop and commercialize biological enzyme-based crop solutions for growers around the world. This adds to research collaborations and partnerships signed in 2020 with Zymogen and continues our trend of investing in new and innovative technologies that will enhance our long-term competitiveness. 
Turning to our Q4 results on Slide 3. We reported $1.15 billion in fourth quarter revenue, which reflects a 4% decrease on a reported basis and 2% organic growth. Despite those headwinds, we posted double-digit sales growth in Asia, led by India, China, Japan and Australia. And in EMEA, with double-digit growth across a broad set of countries. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $290 million, a decrease of 9% compared to the prior year period. EBITDA margins were 25.2%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings were $1.42 per diluted share in the quarter, a decrease of 19% versus Q4 2019. This year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the decrease in EBITDA and an increase in tax rate compared to the very low tax rate in Q4 2019 and slightly higher D&A, partially offset by lower interest expense and lower noncontrolling interest. 
Moving now to Slide 4. Q4 revenue decreased by 4% versus prior year, driven by a 5% FX headwind and a 3% volume decrease. Price increases contributed a positive 4% impact and offset 80% of the FX headwind, the highest in the past few quarters to deliver a positive 2% organic growth. 
Volume growth in EMEA and Asia was more than offset by weakness in North America and Latin America. Sales in EMEA increased 45% year-over-year and 42% organically. We saw particularly strong demand for insect control applications for specialty crops as well as herbicides for cereals, especially in France, Spain, Russia and Germany. We also had significant growth in the U.K. as customers secured orders in advance of Brexit. 
In Asia, revenue increased 11% year-over-year, driven by broad volume growth in India, China, Japan and Australia. India saw strong demand in rice and pulses in the south and in sugarcane in the north, in addition to the growth from our recent market access expansion activities. 
Last earnings call, we highlighted India as a key pillar of growth in Asia. And the strength we saw in Q4 exemplifies this potential, with India growing over 25% organically in the quarter. China saw robust demand for diamide insecticides and fungicides on fruit and vegetables. 
Growth in Australia was driven by demand in herbicides for cereals and oilseeds, while Japan strength came from a variety of insecticides. 
Moving now to Latin America. Sales decreased 9% year-over-year, but grew 4%, excluding significant FX headwinds. Pricing actions across the region offset about 50% of the currency headwind at the earnings level in Q4, substantially more than in the prior 2 quarters. The Brazil season was delayed by at least 30 days due to hot dry weather and this delay meant many numerous crops missed applications that will not return. The drought persisted throughout Q4, resulting in lower-than-expected demand across many crops, and it also impacted Argentina and other countries in the region. 
For Latin America overall, we estimated the drought reduced sales by about $30 million. In Argentina, we also had about $10 million of product held in bonded warehouses that was not released by customs officials in a timely manner. Although these factors reduced Q4 growth in Argentina, 2020 was still our best year ever for the country. 
In North America, sales decreased 34% year-over-year. Roughly $40 million of this decline was due to supply chain disruptions including COVID-related factors associated with logistics and a toll manufacturing partner, impacting our ability to meet demand late in December. An additional $30 million of the decrease was due to reduced volume in some lower value pre-emergent herbicides. Our new herbicides, such as Authority Edge, Authority Supreme, Anthem Max, continue to add value and grow well. 
We should also note our biologicals business had a very strong Q4, with sales up in all regions by at least a high teens percentage, including very strong sales of [indiscernible] in Brazil and successful launches of ACCUDA in EMEA and [indiscernible] in South Korea. 
Turning now to the fourth quarter EBITDA bridge on Slide 5. We had a $50 million contribution from higher pricing, which was nearly double what we realized in Q3. We also aggressively managed costs to offset nearly all the $30 million year-over-year headwind we had anticipated. However, the FX headwinds were more severe than expected, and the late volume misses in North America and Latin America were too large to overcome. 
Moving to Slide 6 for a review of our full year results. We reported $4.64 billion in revenue, which reflects a 1% increase on a reported basis and a 7% organic growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.25 billion, an increase of 2% compared to 2019, even with nearly $270 million in headwinds from FX. EBITDA margins were 26.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the prior year. 
2020 adjusted earnings was $6.19 per diluted share, an increase of 2% versus 2019. This increase was driven by the increase in EBITDA and as well as lower interest expense and lower share count, offset partially by a higher tax rate compared to the very low tax rate in the prior year and higher D&A. 
Turning to Slide 7 for some of the drivers behind the full year revenue growth. Overall, volume contributed 4% to revenue growth, while price increased sales by 3%. About $50 million of the 2020 revenue growth came from product launches within the year. In Asia, sales increased 6% year-over-year and 9% organically. 
Market expansion and share gains in India, coupled with a very strong market rebound in Australia were the primary drivers. Our diamides were in high demand throughout the region in 2020 as we continue to grow on specialty crops, such as rice and fruits and vegetables. 
Sales in EMEA grew 4% versus 2019 and 6% organically. Demand was driven by diamides on specialty crops, battle delta herbicide on cereals and spotlight plus herbicide on potatoes. Latin America posted a 1% year-over-year revenue growth, but high single-digit volume growth and solid price increases led to 17% organic growth. Brazil had robust demand for our products for soybeans and sugarcane, while there was reduced demand acreage for. 
North America sales decreased 8% as we had channel destocking in the first half and then a tough Q4 as described earlier. Of note, the Lucento fungicide launch had a strong second year and insect control had a good launch year. 
Moving to Slide 8, where you can see our full year EBITDA bridge. Volume contributed 9% to the growth while a combination of stringent cost controls and price increases offset 70% of the impact of foreign currencies. 
Turning now to Slide 9 and a look at the overall market conditions for 2021. We expect the global crop protection market will be up low single digits on a U.S. dollar basis. Commodity prices for many of the major crops are higher and stock to use ratios have improved compared to this time last year. All regions are seeing some benefit from better crop commodity prices, while the impacts from COVID on crop demand appear to be lessening. 
Growth issue is expected to be in the low to mid-single digits, driven by India, Australia and ASEAN. Favorable weather should contribute in many countries. The weather-related recovery in Australia is expected to continue. The other 3 regions are each projected to grow in the low single digits. 
Growth in the Latin American market will be strengthened by price recovery from FX headwinds from 2020 in Brazil, continued strength in the soybean market, an increase of fruit and vegetable exports from Mexico and more normal weather patterns that are forecasted across the region. 
In the EMEA market, we are seeing a solid market for cereals and specialty crops, which should be helped by improved weather in several parts of the region. The market in North America is projected to have a firm foundation from crop commodity prices, but we are seeing a trend of distributors and retailers looking to strategically reduce their own inventory levels. The specialty crop market is stable, but a more significant change in demand will depend on the pace of the economic recovery. 
Taking all the above into consideration, we view 2021 as a more positive ag macro environment than we did this time last year. Having said that, we are all too well aware of the potential disruptions that COVID and weather can cause in any 1 quarter. 
Turning to Slide 10 and the review of FMC's full year 2021 and Q1 earnings outlook. FMC full year 2020 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.65 to $7.35 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 13% at the midpoint. Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from planned share repurchases in our EPS estimates. 
2021 revenue is forecasted to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020 and 9% organic growth. We believe the strength of our portfolio will allow us to deliver this organic growth, continuing a multiyear trend of above market performance. 
EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.42 billion, which represents a 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Guidance for Q1 implies year-over-year sales contraction of 7% at the midpoint on a reported basis and 5% organically. We are forecasting an EBITDA decline of 15% at the midpoint versus Q1 2020, and EPS is forecasted to be down 18% year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 11 and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from 7% volume growth with the largest growth in Asia and a 2% contribution from higher prices. FX is forecasted to be a 1% top line headwind. We are expecting broad growth across all regions. Asia has the best overall fundamentals, but we're also seeing the benefit of better weather in Europe, strong soybean outlook for both Latin America and North America and a cotton recovery in Brazil next fall. Because of these factors, we are expecting a very strong second half of 2020 -- 2021 relative to the first half. 
New products such as Overwatch Herbicide in Australia based on our Isoflex active and Xyway fungicide in the U.S. are expected to make meaningful contributions, and we are also launching Fluindapyr fungicide in the U.S. for non crop applications. 
We are forecasting a strong year for each of our product areas. In addition to continuing strength of Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls, insecticide growth is also expected to come from products such as Talisman, Hero and Avatar herbicide should see growth in several of our top brands, including Authority, Gamit, Riata and Spotlight Plus, in addition to the Overwatch launch and growth in fungicides is forecasted to be driven primarily by the Xyway launch in the U.S. 
Our EBITDA guidance reflects strong volume and pricing benefits, offset partially by increases in R&D spending as well as the reversal of some of the temporary cost savings from 2020. We are forecasting a $40 million increase in R&D to bring us to a level of funding that keeps all projects on a critical path to commercialization. Additionally, we're making growth investments in our farm intelligence and other precision Ag initiatives, new product launches like Overwatch as well as FMC ventures. 
We are also expecting some supply chain cost increases, including logistics and pockets of raw materials. These headwinds will be partially offset by the realization of the final $15 million of SAP synergies which will give us a cumulative SAP synergies of approximately $65 million. 
Moving to Slide 12, where you see the Q1 drivers. On the revenue line, volume is expected to drive a 6% decline, while a 1% contribution from higher prices largely offsets the FX headwind. We expect the benefit of approximately $25 million in sales from Q4, and supply and logistics delays to be captured in Q1. This is about half of the Q4 impact. In the U.S., this miss timing limits what we can recoup. And in Argentina, ongoing customers delays in releasing products could cause us to miss application windows. 
There are several headwinds in Q1 revenue that more than offset the flow-through from Q4. First, we're facing a particularly difficult comparison in Latin America, where sales increased 26% year-over-year and 38% organically in Q1 2020. Brazil's cotton business was very strong for us a year ago. This will not be repeated this season. As cotton acreage is down 15%. 
In EMEA, we are facing continued headwinds from discontinued registrations and the $15 million for sales related to Brexit that would normally have been sold in the first quarter. Regarding EBITDA drivers, reduced volume is the biggest factor, while pricing is forecast to offset the FX headwind. 
Costs are expected to be higher by $12 million, driven primarily by the increased R&D investments we mentioned earlier. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andrew."

Let me start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement. FX was a 5% headwind to revenue in the quarter, as expected, with the impact of higher-than-anticipated local currency denominated sales in Brazil, offset in part by",1311,"Thanks, Mark. Let me start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement. FX was a 5% headwind to revenue in the quarter, as expected, with the impact of higher-than-anticipated local currency denominated sales in Brazil, offset in part by a modest tailwind in the Eurozone. 
For full year 2020, FX was a 6% headwind to revenue. The Brazilian real represented the vast majority of the FX headwinds in 2020, followed by the Indian rupee, Pakistan rupee and a broad number of non-euro currencies in EMEA. Pricing actions offset slightly half of the currency headwinds in the year. 
Looking ahead to 2021, we expect a more stable FX environment with only a slight headwind on revenue. We will continue to take pricing actions in Brazil to recover the FX impact from 2020. But overall, pricing will be somewhat dampened by price volume choices being made in our Asia business to drive higher growth. 
Interest expense for the fourth quarter was $34.2 million, down $8.7 million from the prior year period, benefiting from lower debt balances and lower LIBOR rates. Interest expense for full year 2020 was down $7.3 million from the prior year, with the benefit of lower interest rates, partially offset by changes in debt outstanding. 
Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for 2020 was 13.7%, well within our expectations and up from the very low 2019 rate due to shifts in the geographic mix of taxable earnings and inter related impacts on the U.S. minimum tax and foreign earnings. The tax rate in the fourth quarter was 14.4% to true-up with the full year actual rate. Tax was a headwind to earnings in the quarter due to the very low tax rate in the prior year period. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 12.5% to 14.5% in 2021, similar to 2020. 
Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt at year-end was $3.3 billion, essentially flat with the prior quarter with nearly $600 million of cash on hand. We chose to hold cash on the balance sheet in advance of the seasonal working capital build we see in the first quarter to avoid having to take on as much commercial paper in the beginning of the new year. As such, gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.6x at the end of the year, while net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.3x. 
We are comfortable we're in the right leverage range given the excess cash at year-end. We do not expect to carry this level of cash on a steady-state basis going forward. So you should expect cash balances to decline through the coming year. 
Moving to Slide 13 and a look at 2020 cash flow and the outlook for 2021. Free cash flow for 2020 was $544 million, with free cash flow conversion from adjusted earnings of 67%, both metrics up 80% from the prior year period. Adjusted cash from operations increased by about $170 million in 2020, with growth in working capital more than offset by lower non working capital factors and increased EBITDA. 
Capital additions were down $60 million due to project delays in deferrals related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Legacy and transformation spending was down $14 million with relatively stable legacy spending and transformation spending lower as we completed our SAP implementation. 
We anticipate full year 2021 free cash flow to be in the range of $530 million to $620 million, an increase of 6% at the midpoint, with free cash flow conversion of 63% at the midpoint. Growth in adjusted cash from operations and reduced legacy and transformation spending are expected to be partially offset by a significant year-over-year increase in capital additions. This increase in capital additions comes as we catch up on projects that were delayed or deferred in 2020 due to the pandemic. 
Turning to Slide 14. We're pleased with our strong free cash flow growth and improvement in free cash converted. There are a number of moving parts in our 2020 cash flow results and 2020 outlook that merit some further discussion and will help better explain this trajectory. 
2020 free cash flow benefited from a planned real estate asset sale that will not repeat as well as the unforecasted delay of a lump sum environmental liability payment we had expected to be paid in December. Excluding these impacts, 2020 free cash flow would have been about $500 million and cash conversion about 62%. 
Similarly, 2021 free cash flow is negatively impacted by the timing shift of the environmental liability payment. Adjusting for this timing shift, 2021 free cash flow would be about $600 million, and cash conversion 65%. So on a more comparable basis, free cash conversion steps up from 38% in 2019 to 62% in 2020 and 65% in 2021, getting closer to our 70% to 80% target range for 2023. 
I note that this view of cash flow, we've not made any adjustments for the abnormally low capital additions in 2020 or the catch-up to a more normal level in 2021. But this shift is in large part the reason why cash conversion steps up more slowly in 2021. As the increase in capital additions largely offsets the step down in transformation cash spending from the completion of the SAP program. 
You should expect that capital additions continue in a similar range to 2021 for the next several years to support our organic growth, including new capacity to support new active ingredient introductions. 
Equally as important to us growing our free cash flow is the discipline with which we deploy it. As you can see on Slide 15, we continue our balanced approach to cash deployment. We are fully funding our organic growth and making modest inorganic investments to enhance our growth. We are then returning the excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while keeping debt at our targeted leverage levels. 
In 2020, we deployed nearly $350 million of cash flow, while maintaining excess liquidity throughout the pandemic. We deployed $65 million to acquire the remaining rights to fungicide for in taper. We paid nearly $230 million in dividends, and we repurchased $50 million in FMC shares in the fourth quarter. 
In 2021, we expect to accelerate cash deployment. We are planning to repurchase between $400 million and $500 million worth of FMC shares in the year, with purchases in every quarter of the year, the more heavily weighted to the second half. We expect to pay dividends approaching $250 million. And we will continue to look for attractive opportunities to make additional modest inorganic investments to complement our organic growth and expand our technological capabilities. 
I'd like to close with a final update on our SAP S/4HANA ERP system implementation. We had a successful last go live in November. And are now operating on a single thoroughly modern system across the entire company for the first time in our history. The go-live went better than expected, and we have smoothly transitioned to operating the company and closing the books in the new system. 
Our new SAP system has enabled significant efficiencies in our back-office processes. We captured over $50 million in synergies in 2020, having moved aggressively to accelerate $30 million in planned savings from 2021 to 2020. We now expect to deliver $15 million in SAP enabled synergies in 2021, the benefit of which is reflected in our full year guidance for a total of $65 million in synergies from implementing the new system. 
There will certainly be additional efficiency gains in 2022 and beyond as we further leverage this generational investment in our business process infrastructure. But we will drive them as part of our business as usual efforts to gain leverage on back-office costs as we continue to grow the company. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

We had a number of issues in late Q4 that we're having to address. We do not expect all of them to be resolved in Q1. We do, however, see these issues as transitory and are focused on ensuring we can mitigate supply chain risks and continue to expand our market growth opportunities. 
As you can see from our robust 2021 guidance, we are confident that 2021 will be another year of strong revenue and earnings growth for FMC. We continue to renew our portfolio, launching 2 new important products in Q1. We continue to invest in our R&D pipeline, and we remain fully committed to bringing new sustainable technologies to our customers. 
Our overall agenda on sustainability continues to advance with the recent appointment of our first Chief Sustainability Officer and through new partnerships, like the 1 recently announced with Novozymes. We plan to return about $700 million to shareholders this year through dividends and buybacks. 
And finally, with our 2021 growth rates above the long-range plan, we remain firmly on track to deliver our 5-year planned commitments.

Listen, it's fairly obvious when you look at the release that what we have -- we have a weak Q1, yet a very strong full year. And certainly, from our perspective, when we look at what is going on in Q1, it does bear some relationships",956,"Yes. Thanks, Chris. Listen, it's fairly obvious when you look at the release that what we have -- we have a weak Q1, yet a very strong full year. And certainly, from our perspective, when we look at what is going on in Q1, it does bear some relationships to what is happening in the second half of the year. And I'll give you some color on that. 
First of all, when we talk about some headwinds in the quarter, you look at what is happening in Europe, we have headwinds from lots of registrations. It happens all the time. It just so happens that about 50% of the total revenue that is lost in the whole year occurs in Q1 in Europe. And that's just purely down to the types of products that are sold in Q1 and the timing. So that's 1 element that's somewhat unique. 
I think the second 1 is really all around Latin America. We highlighted in the script that we had a very strong cotton business last year, and it really was strong. And this year, it is lower. The acreage is down. We do have some lingering effects from the drought miss opportunities. But that all rolls together very importantly. And it's something that we didn't highlight in the script, but something that operationally, we're managing very carefully. 
We are watching and managing inventories in Brazil very carefully. There is no way you go through a fourth quarter like we did with 30 days delay. I mean, put that in perspective, soybeans take 110 days to grow. We had a 30-day delay. 
Now that means that some sprays get missed. Those products were already in the marketplace. They didn't get used. We've told you many times that we manage inventories very carefully. We see that our inventories are elevated. They are nowhere near as bad as they were 5 years ago, but the industry is elevated as well. We are making a decision in Q1 to deliberately sell-out of inventory and make no mistake, we're selling nicely in Q1. EDI, our business on the ground is actually up year-on-year, but we are not replenishing those inventories. 
Why are we making that decision now? Because it makes the second half of the year and our position in the marketplace, much stronger. We still want to recover price. We didn't fully recover all the price in 2020. This reduction of inventory puts us in a much better position to get price increases in Q3 and Q4. Allied to the fact that we already see today that the industry is moving on price. There are many more companies signaling to the marketplace with letters that are public that they are moving on price. We are doing the same. 
So it's very deliberate. We could make a decision. We could sell and have a more normal Q1 in Latin America, and particularly in Brazil in Q1, or we can reduce the sales today, sell-out of inventory and have a much stronger season '21, '22. 
I think there's some other facets as well to the second half that we should highlight. Our growth in Asia is weighted towards the second half of the year. You've already talked -- we've already talked about India a couple of times over the last calls. India is very strong in Q3 and Q4. We expect that to continue. 
We've talked about investing in India to get us better market access in underrepresented regions of India. That continues and will bear fruit as we go through this year. A lot of different crops involved there, rices, pulse, sugarcane, fruit and vegetables. More importantly, as our market access grows, we're growing our herbicide portfolio as well, introducing new mixtures, especially into sugarcane, corn and soybeans. So India is expected to continue that very strong growth path in the second half of the year. 
Allied to the fact that in the ASEAN region, we're seeing much better conditions in Vietnam and Thailand as we drive our rice business and our fruit and vegetables business. We're seeing Indonesia with much better weather conditions and again, very similar to India, growing our market access in Indonesia to geographies where we're not present today. Once again, insecticide sales and herbicide sales in a variety of crops. 
And then in China, we see continued momentum as we develop our Rynaxypyr and diamides business in China. And then lastly, not only do we expect Brazil to be stronger in the second half given the moves we're making. Other parts of the region are doing very well for us. We continue to expect Argentina will grow. Our crop exposure is getting better, the portfolios we're introducing are better products there. 
In North America, frankly, with what happened in Q4, we should have a much easier comp in terms of our volumes. So we see that as a very key driver in Q4. And then in Europe, we expect a strong Q3 on cereal herbicides. We are developing a nice position on cereal herbicides. You've heard me talk about battle delta. That's a product that's growing well, but we had a very weak Q3 last year due to weather on cereal. So this year, we expect much better conditions. 
You put all that together, you can see why we're much bullish for the whole year, but you can see why we have a very different profile Q1 through Q3, Q4. I know that's a very long answer to a very simple question, but I think it's worth getting it out there because I'm not surprised you asked that question first, Chris.

The team -- the commercial team will be working hard to recoup that position, and we're very confident that the products that we have to deliver then will deliver. 
I think the comments on distributors and retailers in the U.S. We've watched this evolve over the last year or so. And as growers have faced lower income, supply chains of being squeezed bar. And I think, frankly, I think many others, at our point in the value chain and distribution and retail are paying much closer attention to working capital. So the comments we're making them are broad-based, and it's something we're aware of. 
We will work with our customers under these circumstances. It's what we do. But we're highlighting it out there because we believe it's a facet for the industry that needs to be highlighted because everybody is talking about strong commodity prices and how everything is going to grow rapidly in the U.S., that may well be true in certain segments. But let's not forget, there is a value chain here that needs to make money. And the balance sheets are important to many of our customers, and that will get managed appropriately. So that's why we made that comment because we do see that trend of an increased focus on working capital and balance sheet."

We've been forecasting for the last few years, sort of a flattish tight market. And frankly, we've been pretty close to where the market has really finished up. You can tell by our organic growth rates and revenue growth rates that we are above the top end of our 5-year planned sort of numbers. So we do consider it a good year. 
Clearly, when you have strong commodity prices like we see, growers are going to spend money to protect the crops. They want the highest yields, therefore, they get the most value. So I think it's going to be a combination of a couple of things. Price recovery in Latin America, as I said, is going to be important. The good news is, Brazilian growers, Argentinian growers, the Mexico and veg growers, they're all in much better shape than they were 12 months, 18 months ago. So they're feeling confident. 
We do expect to see acreage increase in Latin America on top of the good prices. So soy should be increased. We would expect cotton to bounce back quite considerably next year. So I think it's going to be more of a combination impact of price in Latin America and then really maximizing our customers' ability to get the highest yields by using the better products. 
And frankly, that's why our diamides -- 1 of the reasons our diamides has been doing very well around the world is the fact that they do enhance yield and allow the growers to get that productivity. 
So bottom line for me, Steve, I think we are more confident than we were 12 months ago. These growth rates are higher than we would have had 12 months ago for 2021. And we're confident that our grower customers are going to be looking for the best solutions to improve you."

When we look at where we are today and we think about that $90 million of cost that we have year-over-year, we think roughly about $25 million to $30 million is really what we would call COGS increases. I was very deliberate in my comments that we do see disruptions and logistics costs that are higher than they have been at any time. 
You can go and look at any of the data out there and look at shipping rates. Shanghai to Rotterdam a year ago was about $1,700 a container. It's now $9,300 a container. That is real increase that we simply don't control. We can try and mitigate it as much as possible, but there are real logistics costs out there that are starting to flow through many industries. And this is not peculiar to our industry or even FMC. We hear about it and see about it in many of the industries. 
I think the other piece is we are starting to see some raw material and active ingredient increases coming out of China. It would appear that parts of China, and particularly the north, have had supply constraints due to pockets of COVID and those are starting to ripple through. So we've been very careful on raw material costs, but we do believe we will see higher raw material costs, not across the Board, but in pockets through 2021. 
So that's how we kind of get to that $25 million to $30 million increase. It's not broad-based. It is more pockets of activity, but I do think you're going to hear more about it as more people get into the year and talk about their cost structures."

I think the last time I gave you an update, we said we had about 40 to 41 agreements around the world. That number is up to about 50 today. So commercial teams are continuing to develop those local relationships as well as some of the global relationships that we have. 
Diamides has grown very strongly, as you and everybody else knows. Last year, I think we finished just north of $1.8 billion in revenue in size, up from an initial $1.1 billion when we acquired the business. We -- I think the business grew in the mid- to high single digits last year, closer to the high single digits on an organic basis. It would be even higher than that. We just don't track it at the product level. So very successful. 
The registration side of this, I've talked about in the past, and it continues to evolve. When I think about 2020, between Cyazypyr and Rynaxypyr, we had over 70 brand-new registrations in the year. And that is essentially driving you into new geographies. I think there's something like 21 brand-new crops added with those registrations. So those are crops that we've never been on before. 
So you can see why we keep that registration portfolio very close to heart because that's 1 of the key drivers. Not only do we have to keep the market access going, but we also have to get those brand-new registrations. So from our perspective, we track it very closely. I can give you -- I'll throw you some numbers out that you may find interest in. In 2018, we had 106 Cyazypyr registrations around the world. We are now at 173. And then if you look at Rynaxypyr, we had 170 in 2018. We're now 250. So people often ask, well, why does that matter? It gets you new access. It gives the commercial group's new markets to go sell against older chemistries that are out there. 
So expect that growth rate to continue, as we've said for many years as we go forward. At some point this year, probably in the August call or -- yes, probably the August call, we'll give more details around the third-party relationships, where are they going, what are the encompass. I think we owe it that to our investor community. We've talked about it in sort of a high level term. I think it's time now that we have over 50 of these in place, but we have to start giving some more granularity here."

It's -- I would probably say 6 or 7 different compounds spread across that 2%. 
I think that's a fair rate. We've talked about roughly on average, about a 1.5% drag due to registration or deliberate actions by ourselves.

The missed opportunity I was referring to is more on the soy complex and some of the crops because of the drought. Cotton is purely around just 15% acreage reduction is an enormous reduction in cotton in Brazil. So hopefully, that clarifies that for you. 
On generics, yes, I have to say, I think at the low end of our pre-emergent business, we are seeing more generic pressure. And our North American team makes decisions on an annual basis. So they want to compete in that low end, or are they continuing to focus their marketing efforts on the high end. Obviously, this year, we decided we were not going to go take volume at low margin. It didn't suit what we wanted the business to look like. It wouldn't have helped our inventories, that's for sure. So we decided to focus on the high end Authority Supreme, Authority Max. 
And actual fact, it really suits where the market is going because as weed resistance builds, it is the tougher to control weeds that the growers are willing to pay the high premiums for to allow you to get rid of those weeds. The older formulations, the more, how should I say, simpler, less sophisticated more generic formulations are not actually performing in those fields. So for us, it's quite a natural life cycle progression to move away from those generic products. 
Elsewhere in the portfolio? I would say the generic pressures is probably as low as it's always been. Preemergent, we highlighted it because we felt it was a significant event in the quarter, and it needed to be talked about. The positive to take from that is our formulation expertise moves us forward with new products that allow us to continue to take market share at the high end."

I would say right now, we're feeling very good about the price piece, given what we're seeing in Latin America in the marketplace. From a volume perspective, also very confident, given the fact that a lot of the growers are in much better position than they were 12 months ago. 
And you shouldn't underestimate the psychology of farmers. That is a very important aspect to how they think forward, how they will prepare for a strong season. And what that means for us to feed that value chain as we get into the season.

Look, Mike, I think the -- as we've talked about for quite some time, it's a combination of both the faster growth of higher-value products, higher-margin products as well as SG&A leverage both from SAP synergies and just also from other leverage and growing the business. And on that -- you've seen that trajectory. We were at a 25.9% EBITDA margin in 2018 grew that expanded that by 60 basis points in 2019, expanded another 40 basis points in 2020 in the face of the cost and FX headwinds Mark described. And at the midpoint of our guidance this year, we're expecting to expand margins another 50 basis points. 
So the next couple of years, it is still that balanced story between SG&A leverage and mix improvement that will allow us to keep driving up that trajectory. Year 3, the 5-year plan, we're at 150 basis points of margin expansion against the goal, 250 to 300. So particularly in light of the headwinds we face, we feel like we're exactly where we need to be on that trajectory, and we feel very confident about continuing on it."

So yes, Brexit, we have a strong business in the U.K. We sort of think about it in terms of a roughly a $15 million to $20 million swing between Q4 and Q1 on a revenue basis. 
I have to say, when we put the plans in place with our customers, I was skeptical that it would be needed. But given what we've seen in the U.K. and Europe with regards to freight and logistics, I'm very pleased we actually did that. I know it makes Q1 look a little worse, but the reality is, I'm glad we did it. 
On the second piece with the toll manufacturing relationship, it is a toll manufacturer that we've used for many years. They were in a particular hotspot related to COVID and simply could not get staff and could not make the products that we needed in the time frame that we needed it. We are making some adjustments to our network to obviously help mitigate some of that. We're not seeing that reoccurring in Q1. Frankly, most of that business occurs in Q4 from a tolling perspective anyway, so you wouldn't really expect it to see. 
I think what it highlights for us is we do a very good job of mitigating raw material intermediate movements around the world where we might have issues. Of course, we do employ like many other companies, many toll manufacturers, and we really do have to we have to pay attention to every single 1 all the time. This one, we did not have the right communication flow. And obviously, we paid a price for that. You can rest assured that we've learned a lesson there, and it will not be happening again, either there or anywhere else. 
And the second piece of that was the logistics element, there was a lot of logistics issues in Q4 that we had to overcome. Some of it was related to lack of drivers in parts of the world. We've seen that in the U.S. and some of it was related to more warehousing. But the reality is the toll manufacturer is the big piece."

Let me start by saying the fourth quarter was an unusually difficult one for our company, and we are disappointed in our earnings results. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance on EPS and EBITDA for a long stretch of quarters, principally because of the strength of our portfolio and our geographic balance, combined with strong execution in the face of extreme weather events and significant industry-specific supply chain disruptions. This quarter was an anomaly, and we will be as transparent as always to explain what happened. 
We experienced significant logistics and supply chain constraints in the U.S., reduced demand in the U.S. on some lower-value herbicides, lower demand in Brazil and Argentina following the drought related delay to the start of the season and products that were held up in Argentine customs. On the positive side, we saw strong growth in EMEA and, once again, broad growth in Asia. 
We had a very strong quarter from a cash flow perspective, which led to full year free cash flow of $544 million, an 80% increase over 2019. We also posted very solid 2020 overall results despite numerous challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and $280 million in revenue headwinds from foreign currencies. Our organic revenue growth of 7% and our 2% EBITDA growth shows how aggressively we managed costs and implemented price increases to offset as much of that FX headwind as possible. 
The guidance for Q1 reflects our view of the environment in Brazil as well as continued logistics and supply chain disruptions occurring around the world. We believe these COVID impacts are perhaps as severe as at any point over the last year. In addition our very strong Q1 2020 makes this quarter year-over-year comparison a particularly difficult one. 
All of FMC's manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and fully staffed despite the ongoing pandemic. However, one of our U.S. toll manufacturers was disrupted in Q4 because of COVID-related staffing issues, illustrating just one of the ongoing business risks during the pandemic. We successfully completed the implementation of our new SAP system in November. We now have a single, modern system across the entire company for the first time in our history, which is enabling significant efficiencies in our back-office processes. 
And finally, we give a thorough technology update to investors on November 17, highlighting the increasingly positive impact new synthetic and biological active ingredients will have on our business over the next decade and the ways in which we are driving to be the leader in crop protection innovation. We plan to launch 7 new active ingredients of 4 new biologicals this decade, which we expect will contribute a combined $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion in incremental sales by 2030. 
We recently announced a new collaboration with Novozymes, a world leader in enzyme discovery and production, to research, co-develop and commercialize biological enzyme-based crop solutions for growers around the world. This adds to research collaborations and partnerships signed in 2020 with Zymergen and Cyclica and continues our trend of investing in new and innovative technologies that will enhance our long-term competitiveness. 
Turning to our Q4 results on Slide 3. We reported $1.15 billion in fourth quarter revenue, which reflects a 4% decrease on a reported basis and 2% organic growth. Despite those headwinds, we posted double-digit sales growth in Asia, led by India, China, Japan and Australia; and in EMEA, with double-digit growth across a broad set of countries. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $290 million, a decrease of 9% compared to the prior year period. EBITDA margins were 25.2%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings were $1.42 per diluted share in the quarter, a decrease of 19% versus Q4 2019. This year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the decrease in EBITDA and increase in tax rate compared to the very low tax rate in Q4 2019 and slightly higher D&A partially offset by lower interest expense and lower noncontrolling interest. 
Moving now to Slide 4. Q4 revenue decreased by 4% versus prior year driven by a 5% FX headwind and a 3% volume decrease. Price increases contributed a positive 4% impact and offset 80% of the FX headwind, the highest in the past few quarters, to deliver a positive 2% organic growth. Volume growth in EMEA and Asia was more than offset by weakness in North America and Latin America. Sales in EMEA increased 45% year-over-year and 42% organically. We saw particularly strong demand for Rynaxypyr insect control applications for specialty crops as well as herbicides for cereals, especially in France, Spain, Russia and Germany. We also had significant growth in the U.K. as customers secured orders in advance of Brexit. 
In Asia, revenue increased 11% year-over-year driven by broad volume growth in India, China, Japan and Australia. India saw strong demand in rice and pulses in the south and in sugarcane in the north, in addition to the growth from our recent market access expansion activities. Last earnings call, we highlighted India as a key pillar of growth in Asia, and the strength we saw in Q4 exemplifies this potential, with India growing over 25% organically in the quarter. China saw robust demand for diamide insecticides and fungicides on fruit and vegetables. Growth in Australia was driven by demand in herbicides for cereals and oilseeds, while Japan's strength came from a variety of insecticides. 
Moving now to Latin America. Sales decreased 9% year-over-year but grew 4% excluding significant FX headwinds. Pricing actions across the region offset about 50% of the currency headwind at the earnings level in Q4, substantially more than in the prior 2 quarters. The Brazil season was delayed by at least 30 days due to hot dry weather, and this delay meant many numerous crops missed applications that will not return. The drought persisted throughout Q4, resulting in lower-than-expected demand across many crops, and it also impacted Argentina and other countries in the region. 
For Latin America overall, we estimate that the drought reduced sales by about $30 million. In Argentina, we also had about $10 million of product held in bonded warehouses that was not released by customs officials in a timely manner. Although these factors reduced Q4 growth in Argentina, 2020 was still our best year ever for the country. 
In North America, sales decreased 34% year-over-year. Roughly $40 million of this decline was due to supply chain disruptions, including COVID-related factors associated with logistics and a toll manufacturing partner, impacting our ability to meet demand late in December. An additional $30 million of the decrease was due to reduced volume in some lower value preemergent herbicides. Our newer herbicides, such as Authority Edge, Authority Supreme and Anthem Maxx, continue to add value and grow well. 
We should also note our biologicals business had a very strong Q4, with sales up in all regions by at least a high teens percentage, including very strong sales of Quartzo in Brazil and successful launches of ACCUDO in EMEA and [indiscernible] in South Korea. 
Turning now to the fourth quarter EBITDA bridge on Slide 5. We had a $50 million contribution from higher pricing, which was nearly double what we realized in Q3. We also aggressively managed costs to offset nearly all the $30 million year-over-year headwind we had anticipated. However, the FX headwinds were more severe than expected, and the late volume misses in North America and Latin America were too large to overcome. 
Moving to Slide 6 for a review of our full year results. We reported $4.64 billion in revenue, which reflects a 1% increase on a reported basis and a 7% organic growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.25 billion, an increase of 2% compared to 2019, even with nearly $270 million in headwinds from FX. EBITDA margins were 26.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the prior year. 
2020 adjusted earnings was $6.19 per diluted share, an increase of 2% versus 2019. This increase was driven by the increase in EBITDA as well as lower interest expense and lower share count, offset partially by a higher tax rate compared to the very low tax rate in the prior year and higher D&A. 
Turning to Slide 7 for some of the drivers behind the full year revenue growth. Overall, volume contributed 4% to revenue growth, while price increased sales by 3%. About $50 million of the 2020 revenue growth came from product launches within the year. In Asia, sales increased 6% year-over-year and 9% organically. Market expansion and share gains in India, coupled with a very strong market rebound in Australia, were the primary drivers. Our diamides were in high demand throughout the region in 2020 as we continue to grow on specialty crops, such as rice and fruits and vegetables. 
Sales in EMEA grew 4% versus 2019 and 6% organically. Demand was driven by diamides on specialty crops, Battle Delta Herbicide on cereals and Spotlight Plus Herbicide on potatoes. Latin America posted a 1% year-over-year revenue growth, but high single-digit volume growth and solid price increases led to 17% organic growth. Brazil had robust demand for our products for soybeans and sugarcane, while there was reduced demand acreage for corn.
North America sales decreased 8% as we had channel destocking in the first half and then a tough Q4, as described earlier. Of note, the Lucento fungicide launch had a strong second year, and Elevest insect control had a good launch year. 
Moving to Slide 8 where you can see our full year EBITDA bridge. Volume contributed 9% to the growth while a combination of stringent cost controls and price increases offset 70% of the impact of foreign currencies. 
Turning now to Slide 9 and a look at the overall market conditions for 2021. We expect the global crop protection market will be up low single digits on a U.S. dollar basis. Commodity prices for many of the major crops are higher, and stock-to-use ratios have improved compared to this time last year. All regions are seeing some benefit from better crop commodity prices, while the impacts from COVID on crop demand appear to be lessening. 
Growth in Asia is expected to be in the low to mid-single digits, driven by India, Australia and ASEAN. Favorable weather should contribute in many countries. The weather-related recovery in Australia is expected to continue. 
The other 3 regions are each projected to grow in the low single digits. Growth in the Latin American market will be strengthened by price recovery from FX headwinds from 2020 in Brazil, continued strength in the soybean market, an increase of fruit and vegetable exports from Mexico and more normal weather patterns that are forecasted across the region. In the EMEA market, we are seeing a solid market for cereals and specialty crops, which should be helped by improved weather in several parts of the region. The market in North America is projected to have a firm foundation from crop commodity prices, but we are seeing a trend of distributors and retailers looking to strategically reduce their own inventory levels. The specialty crop market is stable, but a more significant change in demand will depend on the pace of the economic recovery. 
Taking all the above into consideration, we view 2021 as a more positive ag macro environment than we did this time last year. Having said that, we are all too well aware of the potential disruptions that COVID and weather can cause in any one quarter. 
Turning to Slide 10 and the review of FMC's full year 2021 and Q1 earnings outlook. FMC full year 2020 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.65 to $7.35 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 13% at the midpoint. Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from planned share repurchases in our EPS estimates. 
2021 revenue is forecasted to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020 and 9% organic growth. We believe the strength of our portfolio will allow us to deliver this organic growth, continuing a multiyear trend of above-market performance. 
EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.42 billion, which represents a 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Guidance for Q1 implies year-over-year sales contraction of 7% at the midpoint on a reported basis and 5% organically. We are forecasting an EBITDA decline of 15% at the midpoint versus Q1 2020, and EPS is forecasted to be down 18% year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 11 and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from 7% volume growth, with the largest growth in Asia, and a 2% contribution from higher prices. FX is forecasted to be a 1% top line headwind. We are expecting broad growth across all regions. Asia has the best overall fundamentals, but we're also seeing the benefit of better weather in Europe, strong soybean outlook for both Latin America and North America and a cotton recovery in Brazil next fall. Because of these factors, we are expecting a very strong second half of 2020 -- 2021 relative to the first half. New products such as Overwatch Herbicide in Australia based on our Isoflex active and Xyway fungicide in the U.S. are expected to make meaningful contributions, and we are also launching Fluindapyr fungicide in the U.S. for noncrop applications. 
We are forecasting a strong year for each of our product areas. In addition to continuing strength of Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls, insecticide growth is also expected to come from products such as Talisman, Hero and Avatar. Herbicides should see growth in several of our top brands, including Authority, Gamit, [ Riata ] and Spotlight Plus, in addition to the Overwatch launch. And growth in fungicides is forecasted to be driven primarily by the Xyway launch in the U.S. 
Our EBITDA guidance reflects strong volume and pricing benefits, offset partially by increases in R&D spending as well as the reversal of some of the temporary cost savings from 2020. We are forecasting a $40 million increase in R&D to bring us to a level of funding that keeps all projects on a critical path to commercialization. Additionally, we're making growth investments in our farm intelligence and other precision Ag initiatives, new product launches like Overwatch as well as FMC ventures. We are also expecting some supply chain cost increases, including logistics and pockets of raw materials. These headwinds will be partially offset by the realization of the final $15 million of SAP synergies, which will give us accumulative SAP synergies of approximately $65 million. 
Moving to Slide 12 where you see the Q1 drivers. On the revenue line, volume is expected to drive a 6% decline, while a 1% contribution from higher prices largely offsets the FX headwind. We expect the benefit of approximately $25 million in sales from Q4. Supply and logistics delays to be captured in Q1. This is about half of the Q4 impact. In the U.S., this missed timing limits what we can recoup. And in Argentina, ongoing customers' delays in releasing products could cause us to miss application windows. 
There are several headwinds in Q1 revenue that more than offset the flow-through from Q4. First, we're facing a particularly difficult comparison in Latin America where sales increased 26% year-over-year and 38% organically in Q1 2020. Brazil's cotton business was very strong for us a year ago. This will not be repeated this season as cotton acreage is down 15%. In EMEA, we are facing continued headwinds from discontinued registrations and the $15 million in Q4 sales related to Brexit that would normally have been sold in the first quarter. 
Regarding EBITDA drivers, reduced volume is the biggest factor, while pricing is forecast to offset the FX headwind. Costs are expected to be higher by $12 million, driven primarily by the increased R&D investments we mentioned earlier. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andrew."
28606,701219262,2202939,"FMC Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2021",2021-02-10,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Let me start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement. FX was a 5% headwind to revenue in the quarter, as expected, with the impact of higher-than-anticipated local currency denominated sales in Brazil offset in part by a",1303,"Thanks, Mark. Let me start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement. FX was a 5% headwind to revenue in the quarter, as expected, with the impact of higher-than-anticipated local currency denominated sales in Brazil offset in part by a modest tailwind in the Eurozone. For full year 2020, FX was a 6% headwind to revenue. The Brazilian real represented the vast majority of the FX headwinds in 2020, followed by the Indian rupee, Pakistan rupee and a broad number of non-euro currencies in EMEA. Pricing actions offset slightly half of the currency headwinds in the year. 
Looking ahead to 2021, we expect a more stable FX environment with only a slight headwind to revenue. We will continue to take pricing actions in Brazil to recover the FX impacts from 2020. But overall, pricing will be somewhat dampened by price volume choices being made in our Asia business to drive higher growth. 
Interest expense for the fourth quarter was $34.2 million, down $8.7 million from the prior year period, benefiting from lower debt balances and lower LIBOR rates. Interest expense for full year 2020 was down $7.3 million from the prior year, with the benefit of lower interest rates partially offset by changes in debt outstanding. 
Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for 2020 was 13.7%, well within our expectations and up from the very low 2019 rate due to shifts in the geographic mix of taxable earnings and interrelated impacts from the U.S. minimum tax on foreign earnings. The tax rate in the fourth quarter was 14.4% to true-up with the full year actual rate. Tax was a headwind to earnings in the quarter due to the very low tax rate in the prior year period. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 12.5% to 14.5% in 2021, similar to 2020. 
Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt at year-end was $3.3 billion, essentially flat with the prior quarter, with nearly $600 million of cash on hand. We chose to hold cash on the balance sheet in advance of the seasonal working capital build we see in the first quarter to avoid having to take on as much commercial paper in the beginning of the new year. As such, gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.6x at the end of the year, while net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.3x. We are comfortable we're in the right leverage range given the excess cash at year-end. We do not expect to carry this level of cash on a steady-state basis going forward, so you should expect cash balances to decline through the coming year. 
Moving to Slide 13 and a look at 2020 cash flow and the outlook for 2021. Free cash flow for 2020 was $544 million, with free cash flow conversion from adjusted earnings of 67%, both metrics up 80% from the prior year period. Adjusted cash from operations increased by about $170 million in 2020, with growth in working capital more than offset by lower nonworking capital factors and increased EBITDA. Capital additions were down $60 million due to project delays and deferrals related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Legacy and transformation spending was down $14 million with relatively stable legacy spending and transformation spending lower as we completed our SAP implementation. 
We anticipate full year 2021 free cash flow to be in the range of $530 million to $620 million, an increase of 6% at the midpoint, with free cash flow conversion of 63% at the midpoint. Growth in adjusted cash from operations and reduced legacy and transformation spending are expected to be partially offset by a significant year-over-year increase in capital additions. This increase in capital additions comes as we catch up on projects that were delayed or deferred in 2020 due to the pandemic. 
Turning to Slide 14. We're pleased with our strong free cash flow growth and improvement in free cash conversion. There are a number of moving parts in our 2020 cash flow results and 2020 outlook that merit some further discussion and will help better explain this trajectory. 2020 free cash flow benefited from a planned real estate asset sale that will not repeat as well as the unforecasted delay of a lump sum environmental liability payment we had expected to be paid in December. Excluding these impacts, 2020 free cash flow would have been about $500 million and cash conversion about 62%. 
Similarly, 2021 free cash flow is negatively impacted by the timing shift of the environmental liability payment. Adjusting for this timing shift, 2021 free cash flow would be about $600 million, and cash conversion 65%. So on a more comparable basis, free cash conversion steps up from 38% in 2019 to 62% in 2020 and 65% in 2021, getting closer to our 70% to 80% target range for 2023. 
I'd note that this view of cash flow, we've not made any adjustments for the abnormally low capital additions in 2020 or the catch-up to a more normal level in 2021. But this shift is in large part the reason why cash conversion steps up more slowly in 2021 as the increase in capital additions largely offsets the step down in transformation cash spending from the completion of the SAP program. You should expect that capital additions continue in a similar range to 2021 for the next several years to support our organic growth, including new capacity to support new active ingredient introductions. 
Equally as important to growing our free cash flow is the discipline with which we deploy it. As you can see on Slide 15, we continue our balanced approach to cash deployment. We are fully funding our organic growth and making modest inorganic investments to enhance our growth. We are then returning the excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while keeping debt at our targeted leverage levels. 
In 2020, we deployed nearly $350 million of cash flow while maintaining excess liquidity throughout the pandemic. We deployed $65 million to acquire the remaining rights to the fungicide Fluindapyr. We paid nearly $230 million in dividends, and we repurchased $50 million in FMC shares in the fourth quarter. 
In 2021, we expect to accelerate cash deployment. We are planning to repurchase between $400 million and $500 million worth of FMC shares in the year, with purchases in every quarter of the year, though more heavily weighted to the second half. We expect to pay dividends approaching $250 million. And we will continue to look for attractive opportunities to make additional modest inorganic investments to complement our organic growth and expand our technological capabilities. 
I'd like to close with a final update on our SAP S/4HANA ERP system implementation. We had a successful last go-live in November and are now operating on a single, thoroughly modern system across the entire company for the first time in our history. The go-live went better than expected, and we have smoothly transitioned to operating the company and closing the books in the new system. 
Our new SAP system has enabled significant efficiencies in our back-office processes. We captured over $50 million in synergies in 2020, having moved aggressively to accelerate $30 million in planned savings from 2021 to 2020. We now expect to deliver $15 million in SAP-enabled synergies in 2021, the benefit of which is reflected in our full year guidance, for a total of $65 million in synergies from implementing the new system. There will certainly be additional efficiency gains in 2022 and beyond as we further leverage this generational investment in our business process infrastructure, but we will drive them as part of our business-as-usual efforts to gain leverage on back-office costs as we continue to grow the company. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

We had a number of issues in late Q4 that we're having to address. We do not expect all of them to be resolved in Q1. We do, however, see these issues as transitory and are focused on ensuring we can mitigate supply chain risks and continue to expand our market growth opportunities. 
As you can see from our robust 2021 guidance, we are confident that 2021 will be another year of strong revenue and earnings growth for FMC. We continue to renew our portfolio, launching 2 new important products in Q1; we continue to invest in our R&D pipeline; and we remain fully committed to bringing new sustainable technologies to our customers. 
Our overall agenda on sustainability continues to advance with the recent appointment of our first Chief Sustainability Officer and through new partnerships, like the one recently announced with Novozymes. We plan to return about $700 million to shareholders this year through dividends and buybacks. And finally, with our 2021 growth rates above the long-range plan, we remain firmly on track to deliver our 5-year planned commitments. 
Before I close, I'd like to highlight the press release issued yesterday regarding Pierre Brondeau's retirement as Executive Chairman, effective April 27. I very much appreciate his leadership and look forward to his continued involvement as Non-Executive Chairman. 
I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions."

Listen, it's fairly obvious when you look at the release that what we have -- we have a weak Q1, yet a very strong full year. And certainly, from our perspective, when we look at what is going on in Q1, it does bear some relationships",955,"Yes. Thanks, Chris. Listen, it's fairly obvious when you look at the release that what we have -- we have a weak Q1, yet a very strong full year. And certainly, from our perspective, when we look at what is going on in Q1, it does bear some relationships to what is happening in the second half of the year, and I'll give you some color on that. 
First of all, when you talk about some headwinds in the quarter, you look at what is happening in Europe. We have headwinds from loss of registrations. It happens all the time. It just so happens that about 50% of the total revenue that is lost in the whole year occurs in Q1 in Europe, and that's just purely down to the types that are sold in Q1 and the timing. So that's one element that's somewhat unique. 
I think the second one is really all around Latin America. We highlighted in the script that we had a very strong cotton business last year, and it really was strong. And this year, it is lower. The acreage is down. We do have some lingering effects from the drought and missed opportunities. But that all rolls together very importantly. And it's something that we didn't highlight in the script, but something that operationally we're managing very carefully. We are watching and managing inventories in Brazil very carefully. There is no way you go through a fourth quarter like we did with 30 days delay. 
I mean put that in perspective, soybeans take 110 days to grow. We had a 30-day delay. Now that means that some sprays get missed. Those products were already in the marketplace. They didn't get used. We've told you many times that we manage inventories very carefully. We see that our inventories are elevated. They are nowhere near as bad as they were 5 years ago, but the industry is elevated as well. We are making a decision in Q1 to deliberately sell out of inventory, and make no mistake, we're selling nicely in Q1. EDI, our business on the ground, is actually up year-on-year, but we are not replenishing those inventories. 
Why are we making that decision now? Because it makes the second half of the year and our position in the marketplace much stronger. We still want to recover price. We didn't fully recover all the price in 2020. This reduction of inventory puts us in a much better position to get price increases in Q3 and Q4. Allied to the fact that we already see today that the industry is moving on price. There are many more companies signaling to the marketplace with letters that are public that they are moving on price. We are doing the same. So it's very deliberate. We could make a decision. We could sell and have a more normal Q1 in Latin America, and particularly in Brazil in Q1, or we can reduce the sales today, sell out of inventory and have a much stronger season '21/'22. 
I think there's some other facets as well to the second half that we should highlight. Our growth in Asia is weighted towards the second half of the year. You've already talked -- we've already talked about India a couple of times over the last calls. India is very strong in Q3 and Q4. We expect that to continue. 
We've talked about investing in India to get us better market access in underrepresented regions of India, that continues and will bear fruit as we go through this year. A lot of different crops involved there, rices, pulse, sugarcane, fruit and vegetables. More importantly, as our market access grows, we're growing our herbicide portfolio as well, introducing new mixtures, especially into sugarcane, corn and soybeans. So India is expected to continue that very strong growth path in the second half of the year. 
Allied to the fact that in the ASEAN region, we're seeing much better conditions in Vietnam and Thailand as we drive our rice business and our fruit and vegetables business. We're seeing Indonesia with much better weather conditions and, again, very similar to India, growing our market access in Indonesia to geographies where we're not present today. Once again, insecticide sales and herbicide sales in a variety of crops. And then in China, we see continued momentum as we develop our Rynaxypyr and diamides business in China. 
And then lastly, not only do we expect Brazil to be stronger in the second half given the moves we're making, other parts of the region are doing very well for us. We continue to expect Argentina will grow. Our crop exposure is getting better, the portfolios we're introducing are better products there. 
In North America, frankly, with what happened in Q4, we should have a much easier comp in terms of our volumes. So we see that as a very key driver in Q4. And then in Europe, we expect a strong Q3 on cereal herbicides. We are developing a nice position on cereal herbicides. You've heard me talk about Battle Delta. That's a product that's growing well. We had a very weak Q3 last year due to weather on cereal. So this year, we expect much better conditions. 
You put all that together, you can see why we're much bullish for the whole year, but you can see why we have a very different profile Q1 through Q3, Q4. I know that's a very long answer to a very simple question, but I think it's worth getting it out there because I'm not surprised you asked that question first, Chris. But the reality is we're setting ourselves up for a very strong second half of the year."

And the reality is we did lose some sales. We consider that transitory. We don't expect that to happen in Q4 next year. The team -- the commercial team will be working hard to recoup that position, and we're very confident that the products that we have to deliver then will deliver. 
I think the comments on distributors and retailers in the U.S., we've watched this evolve over the last year or so. And as growers have faced lower income, supply chains have been squeezed more, and I think -- frankly, I think many others, at our point in the value chain and distribution and retail are paying much closer attention to working capital. So the comments we're making are more broad-based and it's something we're aware of. 
We will work with our customers under these circumstances. It's what we do. But we're highlighting it out there because we believe it's a facet to the industry that needs to be highlighted because everybody is talking about strong commodity prices and how everything is going to grow rapidly in the U.S. That may well be true in certain segments, but let's not forget, there is a value chain here that needs to make money. And the balance sheets are important to many of our customers, and that will get managed appropriately. So that's why we made that comment because we do see that trend of an increased focus on working capital and balance sheets."

We've been forecasting for the last few years sort of a flattish tight market. And frankly, we've been pretty close to where the market has really finished up. You can tell by our organic growth rates and revenue growth rates that we are above the top end of our 5-year plan sort of numbers, so we do consider it a good year. 
Clearly, when you have strong commodity prices like we see, growers are going to spend money to protect the crops. They want the highest yields, therefore, they get the most value. So I think it's going to be a combination of a couple of things. Price recovery in Latin America, as I said, is going to be important. The good news is Brazilian growers, Argentinian growers, the Mexico fruit and veg growers, they're all in much better shape than they were 12 months, 18 months ago. So they're feeling confident. 
We do expect to see acreage increase in Latin America on top of the good prices. So soy should be increased. We would expect cotton to bounce back quite considerably next year. So I think it's going to be more of a combination impact of price in Latin America and then really maximizing our customers' ability to get the highest yields by using the better products. And frankly, that's why our diamides -- one of the reasons our diamides has been doing so well around the world is the fact that they do enhance yield and allow the growers to get that productivity. 
So bottom line for me, Steve, I think we are more confident than we were 12 months ago. These growth rates are higher than we would have had 12 months ago for 2021. And we're confident that our grower customers are going to be looking for the best solutions to improve yield."

When we look at where we are today and we think about that $90 million of cost that we have year-over-year, we think roughly about $25 million to $30 million is really what we would call COGS increases. I was very deliberate in my comments that we do see disruptions and logistics costs that are higher than they have been at any time. You can go and look at any of the data out there and look at shipping rates. Shanghai to Rotterdam a year ago was about $1,700 a container. It's now $9,300 a container. That is real increase that we simply don't control. We can try and mitigate it as much as possible, but there are real logistics costs out there that are starting to flow through many industries. And this is not peculiar to our industry or even FMC, we hear about it and see about it in many of the industries. 
I think the other piece is we are starting to see some raw material and active ingredient increases coming out of China. It would appear that parts of China, and particularly the north, have had supply constraints due to pockets of COVID and those are starting to ripple through. So we've been very careful on raw material costs, but we do believe we will see higher raw material costs, not across the board but in pockets through 2021. 
So that's how we kind of get to that $25 million to $30 million increase. It's not broad-based. It is more pockets of activity, but I do think you're going to hear more about it as more people get into the year and talk about their cost structures."

I think the last time I gave you an update, we said we had about 40 to 41 agreements around the world. That number is up to about 50 today. So commercial teams are continuing to develop those local relationships as well as some of the global relationships that we have. 
Diamides has grown very strongly, as you and everybody else knows. Last year, I think we finished just north of $1.8 billion in revenue in size, up from an initial $1.1 billion when we acquired the business. We -- I think the business grew in the mid- to high single digits last year, closer to the high single digits. On an organic basis, it would be even higher than that, we just don't track it at the product level. So very successful. 
The registration side of this, I've talked about in the past and it continues to evolve. When I think about 2020, between Cyazypyr and Rynaxypyr, we had over 70 brand-new registrations in the year, and that is essentially driving you into new geographies. I think there's something like 21 brand-new crops added with those registrations. So those are crops that we've never been on before. 
So you can see why we keep that registration portfolio very close to heart because that's one of the key drivers. Not only do we have to keep the market access going but we also have to get those brand-new registrations. So from our perspective, we track it very closely. I could give you -- I'll throw you some numbers out that you may find interesting. 
In 2018, we had 106 Cyazypyr registrations around the world, we are now at 173. And then when you look at Rynaxypyr, we had 170 in 2018, we're now at 250. So people often ask, well, why does that matter? It gets you new access. It gives the commercial groups new markets to go sell against older chemistries that are out there. 
So I expect that growth rate to continue, as we've said for many years, as we go forward. At some point this year, probably in the August call or -- yes, probably the August call, we'll give more details around the third-party relationships, where are they going, what do the encompass. I think we owe that to our investor community. We've talked about it in sort of a high-level term. I think it's time now that -- we have over 50 of these in place, that we have to start giving some more granularity here."

Cotton is not necessarily missed opportunity, it is lower acreage. The missed opportunity I was referring to is more on the soy complex and some of the crops because of the drought. Cotton is purely around just 15% acrea",314,"Yes. You're right on cotton, Joel. Cotton is not necessarily missed opportunity, it is lower acreage. The missed opportunity I was referring to is more on the soy complex and some of the crops because of the drought. Cotton is purely around just 15% acreage reduction is an enormous reduction in cotton in Brazil. So hopefully, that clarifies that for you. 
On generics, yes, I have to say. I think at the low end of our preemergent business, we are seeing more generic pressure. And our North American team makes decisions on an annual basis do they want to compete in that low end or are they continuing to focus their marketing efforts on the high end. Obviously, this year, we decided we were not going to go take volume at low margin. It didn't suit what we wanted the business to look like. It wouldn't have helped our inventories, that's for sure. So we decided to focus on the high-end Authority Supreme, Authority Max. 
And actual fact, it really suits where the market is going because as weed resistance builds, it is the tougher-to-control weeds that the growers are willing to pay the high premiums for to allow you to get rid of those weeds. The older formulations, the more, how should I say, simpler, less sophisticated, more generic formulations are not actually performing in those fields. So for us, it's quite a natural life cycle progression to move away from those generic products. 
Elsewhere in the portfolio, I would say the generic pressure is probably as normal as it's always been. Preemergent, we highlighted it because we felt it was a significant event in the quarter and it needed to be talked about. The positive to take from that is our formulation expertise moves us forward with new products that allow us to continue to take market share at the high end."

I mean, obviously, the further out you forecast, the more variance there could possibly be. But today, I would say there is obviously 2 pieces: volume and price. I would say right now, we're feeling very good about the price piece, given what we're seeing in Latin America in the marketplace. 
From a volume perspective, also very confident, given the fact that a lot of the growers are in much better position than they were 12 months ago. And you shouldn't underestimate the psychology of farmers. That is a very important aspect to how they think forward, how they will prepare for a strong season and what that means for us to feed that value chain as we get into the season. 
So obviously, listen, both price and volume, we don't ultimately control. They are part of the marketplace. But I feel very confident that given where the business is positioning itself, the new product growth, the continued growth of diamides, our ability to move price, which we've shown as we went through last year, we gathered each quarter was higher than the last. And we eventually ended up in not a bad place at all, especially in Latin America. 
So just think of it in terms of, I would say, normal risk. Yes, weather will play a part as well pest pressure, but we're forecasting it to be normal and pretty confident of that forecast."

I think the confidence you should have in 2021 relays itself at here we are 3 years into our plan, and we are right in the ranges where we should be. Despite the fact that in 2019, we had something like $150 million of headwind on cost, and in 2021, we had about $270 million, $280 million headway on FX, yet here we are still in the middle of our planned range. 
So it's very -- it should give you a lot of confidence that we know how to manage these. Yes, you can have dislocations in a quarter, obviously, but if you think about '19, '20, '21, that's a very strong track record of delivery with almost pretty close to, if not more than, $400 million of headwind over this 3-year period.

And on that -- you've seen that trajectory. We were at a 25.9% EBITDA margin in 2018. Grew that -- expanded that by 60 basis points in 2019, expanded another 40 basis points in 2020 in the face of the cost and FX headwinds Mark described. And at the midpoint of our guidance, this year, we're expecting to expand margins another 50 basis points. 
So the next couple of years, it is still that balanced story between SG&A leverage and mix improvement that will allow us to keep driving up that trajectory. Year 3 of the 5-year plan, we're at 150 basis points of margin expansion against the goal of 250 to 300. So particularly in light of the headwinds we face, we feel like we're exactly where we need to be on that trajectory, and we feel very confident about continuing on it."

I have to say, when we put the plans in place with our customers, I was skeptical that it would be needed. But given what we've seen in the U.K. and Europe with regards to freight and logistics, I'm very pleased we actually did that. I know it makes Q1 look a little worse, but the reality is I'm glad we did it. 
On the second piece with the toll manufacturing relationship, it is a toll manufacturer that we've used for many years. They were in a particular hotspot related to COVID and simply could not get staff and could not make the products that we needed in the time frame that we needed it. We are making some adjustments to our network to obviously help mitigate some of that. We're not seeing that reoccurring in Q1. Frankly, most of that business occurs in Q4 from a tolling perspective anyway, so you wouldn't really expect it to see. 
I think what it highlights for us is we do a very good job of mitigating raw material intermediate movements around the world where we might have issues. Of course, we do employ, like many other companies, many toll manufacturers, and we really do have to we have to pay attention to every single one all the time. This one, we did not have the right communication flow, and obviously, we paid a price for that. You can rest assured that we've learned the lesson there, and it will not be happening again, either there or anywhere else. 
And then the -- and the second piece of that was the logistics element. There was a lot of logistics issues in Q4 that we had to overcome. Some of it was related to lack of drivers in parts of the world, we've seen that in the U.S., and some of it was related to more warehousing. But the reality is the toll manufacturer was the big piece."

Revenue and earnings were down as forecasted, though earnings were modestly above the midpoint of our guidance. We continue to expect a good second quarter and a strong full year. 
We had 2 important product launches in the quarter, Overwatch Herbicide based on our Isoflex active in Australia and Xyway fungicide in the U.S. Isoflex is 1 of 11 new active ingredients we plan to launch this decade. Both launches have exceeded our expectations and have delivered approximately $50 million of Q1 sales. 
In March, we announced an important agreement with UPL to toll manufacture Rynaxypyr insect control in India and to distribute products based on the active ingredient in selected markets. In the future, FMC will supply Rynaxypyr Active to UPL for use in product formulations developed and marketed by UPL around the world. This agreement is the next step in growing our important diamide franchise and accelerating FMC's long-term plans to expand the franchise in diverse geographies and crops with differentiated formulations. 
It also reaffirms the strength of our patent portfolio that protects our diamide franchise, far beyond just the composition of matter patents. 
We returned over $135 million to shareholders in the quarter through our recently increased dividend and share repurchases. 
Our guidance for Q2 indicates an expected return to mid-single-digit growth on the top line, with slightly lower earnings growth because of higher costs compared to Q2 2020. These higher costs are principally related to increasing raw materials and logistics. Additionally, we will be spending more on SG&A and R&D compared to the abnormally low spend in Q2 2020. 
I'd like to take a moment to provide a COVID-19 update on our business. All our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and properly staffed. Our research laboratories and greenhouses also have continued to operate throughout the pandemic. While many of FMC's other employees continue to work from home, plans are in place to resume in-office operations where permitted by local authorities. 
Finally, we are all aware of the challenges India is facing with significant increases of COVID cases across that country. Last week, FMC announced it will donate 7 pressure swing absorption oxygen plants to hospitals across 5 states in India to help address the rapidly increasing demand for medical oxygen. This program focuses on rural areas where we are providing further community support. 
Turning to our Q1 results on Slide 3. We reported $1.2 billion in first quarter revenue, which reflects a 4% decrease on a reported basis and a 5% decrease organically. As planned, we saw slower sales in Brazil as we drew down channel inventories in that country as well as the shortfall in EMEA due to Brexit-related sales that occurred in Q4 2020. 
In North America, we saw very good demand based on strong fundamentals in row crops and commodity prices, offset by a shift of diamide third-party sales to Latin America. 
In Asia, double-digit sales growth in Australia, Japan and our Asian subregion drove a new performance in that region. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $307 million, a decrease of 14% compared to the prior year period and $2 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. EBITDA margins were 25.7%, a decrease of 290 basis points compared to the prior year. 
Adjusted earnings were $1.53 per diluted share in the quarter, a decrease of 17% versus Q1 2020, but also $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the decrease in EBITDA, partially offset by lower interest expense. 
Moving now to Slide 4. Q1 revenue decreased by 4% versus prior year driven by a 4% volume decrease and a 1% price decline. Foreign currencies were a modest tailwind in the quarter on the top line. 
Sales in Asia increased 18% year-over-year and 13% organically driven by double-digit growth in Australia, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. We had strong Overwatch herbicide sales for cereals, and sales of our diamides were robust for fruit and vegetable and rice applications. 
Insecticides also performed well in Indonesia, helped by our recent expanded market access in that country, and improved weather helped sales across the ASEAN subregion. 
EMEA sales were down 4% year-over-year and 8% organically. We had strong sales of diamides and other insecticides as well as fungicides, but these were more than offset by headwinds from the Brexit-related U.K. sales in Q4 that we described a quarter ago as well as discontinued registrations. 
In North America, sales decreased 8% year-over-year. Our herbicide business grew double digits, partially due to the timing of some sales that shifted from Q4 to Q1 as well as the continued strength of Authority Edge and Authority Supreme herbicides. We also had a strong launch in the U.S. of Xyway fungicide for corn and Vantacore insect control for specialty crops. These were offset primarily by a shift of diamide third-party partner sales from North America to Latin America, as one of our key partners adjusted the way it purchases from FMC globally. 
This was simply a move of purchasing location and not a change in demand. Excluding this shift, our North America sales were up low double digits. 
Moving now to Latin America. Sales decreased 22% year-over-year and 13% organically. As a reminder, we were facing a particularly difficult comparison in Latin America, where sales increased 26% year-over-year and 38% organically in Q1 2020. Brazil's cotton business was very strong for us a year ago, which did not repeat this season as cotton hectares were down 15%. We also proactively reduced channel inventory and C products as planned in Q1, improving our inventory situation in Brazil. 
And our Andean zone subregion continued the momentum from 2020, with double-digit sales growth. 
Turning now to the first quarter EBITDA bridge on Slide 5. EBITDA in the quarter was down $3 million year-over-year due to a very strong Q1 2020 comparison. Volume headwinds in Latin America and EMEA were partially offset by new product launches in Asia and North America. 
In Latin America, we focused on reducing channel inventory to set ourselves up for a much stronger pricing environment in the second half of 2021. 
Cost headwinds were slightly higher than expected, while FX headwinds were far lower than in the prior 4 quarters. 
Turning now to our view of the overall market conditions for 2021. We continue to expect the global crop protection market will be up low single digits on a U.S. dollar basis. Relative to this time last year, commodity prices for many of the major crops are higher, and stock to use ratios are much improved. All regions are seeing some benefit from better crop commodity prices, while the negative impact from COVID on crop demand appeared to be modest. 
The only change to our regional forecast is that we now forecast mid-single-digit growth in the EMEA market versus low single-digit growth before. This improved view is due to the strengthening of currencies in that region relative to the U.S. dollar. 
Market growth in Asia is still expected to be in the low to mid-single digits driven by India, Australia and ASEAN countries, while growth in the North American and Latin American markets is still projected to be in the low single digits. 
Basic crop fundamentals remain strong. However, our overall forecast for the total crop protection market remains low single-digit growth due to signs of supply chain constraints in the industry as well as modest channel inventory overhang in certain countries. Although Brazil and India are facing significant increases of COVID cases, we are not seeing signs that this is impacting their respective agricultural markets at this time. This is, however, something we are continuing to watch closely. 
Turning to Slide 6 and the review of FMC's full year 2021 and Q2 earnings outlook. FMC full year 2021 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.70 and to $7.40 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 14% at the midpoint. This is up slightly versus our prior forecast, reflecting the share count reduction from our Q1 share repurchases. Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from future share repurchases in our EPS guidance. 
Our 2021 revenue forecast remains in the range of $4.9 to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020 and 8% organic growth. We believe the strength of our portfolio will allow us to deliver this organic growth, continuing a multiyear trend of above-market performance. 
EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.42 billion, representing 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Guidance for Q implies a year-over-year sales growth of 6% at the midpoint on a reported basis and 5% organically. 
We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 1% at the midpoint versus Q2 2020, and  EPS is forecasted to be up 3% year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 7 and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth, with the largest growth in Asia and a 2% contribution from higher prices. FX is now forecasted to have no impact on the top line. 
We continue to expect broad growth across all regions and a very strong second half of 2021. New products like Overwatch herbicide, Xyway fungicide and Vantacore insect control, are already making meaningful contributions. We are also planning to launch Fluindapyr fungicide in the U.S. for non-crop applications later this year. 
We expect new products to contribute $400 million in revenue this year. This includes all products launched since 2018. 
We are forecasting strong growth in each of our product categories in the year. In addition to the continued growth of Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr Insect controls, we expect growth from other key insecticide brands in our portfolio, including Avatar, Hero and Talisman. 
Our herbicide portfolio is also expected to grow led by brands, including Authority, Gamut, Spotlight Plus and Overwatch. As Iowa is expected to lead growth of our fungicide portfolio, building on the successful launch of Lucento fungicide a couple of years ago. 
Our EBITDA guidance reflects significant volume and pricing benefits, offset partially by increases in R&D spending, the reversal of some temporary cost savings from 2020 as well as increase in raw material and logistics costs. 
As we've stated in February, we are forecasting an increase in R&D to bring us to a level of funding that keeps all projects on a critical path to commercialization. We are taking cost control actions to limit the net cost headwind to an incremental $10 million versus what we showed in February. We also intend to offset the higher raw material costs with an additional $10 million in price increases, which will come primarily in the second half of the year. 
Moving to Slide 8, where you can see the Q2 drivers. On the revenue line, we are expecting positive contributions from all categories, volume 4%, pricing 1% and FX 1%. We're expecting solid sales growth in Asia, EMEA and Latin America. Asia growth is expected to be broad-based across the region, with particular strength in India, Australia and China. Growth in EMEA will be driven by improved crop conditions for cereals and sugar beets. Latin America growth should be supported by improved conditions in both Brazil and Mexico and the continuation of strong growth in the Amgen zone. We see good conditions in North America for row crops and a positive outlook for our new products. 
Regarding EBITDA drivers, positive contributions from volume, price and FX more than offset the increased costs, which we previously discussed. 
Turning now to Slide 9. With the guidance for Q2 and the full year on record, we would like to also show the implied forecast for the second half. We have a very strong outlook for H2, and let me outline the drivers for that growth. We forecast year-over-year revenue growth of 15% in the second half driven by 5 main elements. 
First, our expectations are strong for the U.S. and Brazil, following our weak Q4 2020 performance in those countries. Second, price increases, primarily in Brazil, with contributions from numerous other countries will help offset the FX headwind from last year and the higher costs from raw materials this year. Thirdly, new products will continue to be a major factor, Overwatch in Australia, Xyway and diamide formulations Livestand Vantacore and Fluindapyr for non-crop applications in the U.S. and Authority NXT herbicide in India. Fourth, improved crop fundamentals. Cotton in Brazil is the most obvious to us, as growers have indicated, a 15% increase in hectares for next season, and we also expect a strong Q4 in North America and Latin America driven by good fundamentals for soybeans and corn. And finally, fifth, improved market access and expansions into new geographies and crops. This is having a significant impact in Asia with recent initiatives in India, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam all forecast to drive high-growth rates. 
Our guidance also implies a 30% year-over-year EBITDA growth in the second half of the year, much of that will come directly from the volume and pricing growth I just described, but we also expect to limit the raw material and supply chain cost headwinds with sustained cost discipline in other areas. 
I will now turn the call over to Andrew."

FX was a modest tailwind for revenue growth in Q1 at 1% versus our expectations of a 2% headwind, as the U.S. dollar weakened against many currencies with the notable exception of the Brazilian real. 
Interest expense for the first quarter was $30.4 million, down $8.4 million from the prior year period, with the benefit of lower LIBOR rates as well as lower foreign debt and lower term loan balances, partially offset by higher average commercial paper balances. We continue to anticipate interest expense between $130 million and $140 million for the full year. 
Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the first quarter was 13.1% as anticipated and in line with our continued expectation for a full year tax rate between 12.5% and 14.5%. 
Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt at the end of the quarter was $3.6 billion, up over $300 million from the prior quarter, with the expected seasonal build of working capital. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 3.0x at the end of the first quarter, while net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.7x. Both metrics were above our targeted full year average levels due to the seasonality of working capital. We expect that this will improve throughout the year, and we will return to target levels by year-end. 
Moving on to Slide 10 and cash flow and cash deployment. Free cash flow for the first quarter was negative $354 million. Adjusted cash from operations was similar to the prior year period, with improved working capital, offset by changes in nonworking capital items and lower EBITDA. 
Capital additions were somewhat higher as we ramped up spending following deferral of projects last year due to COVID. Legacy and transformation spending was substantially lower with the completion of our SAP program. 
We continue to expect to generate full year free cash flow within a range of $530 million to $620 million, with the vast majority of this cash flow coming in the second half of the year. 
We returned $137 million to shareholders in the quarter via $62 million in dividends and $75 million of share repurchases, buying back 696,000 shares in the quarter at an average price of $107.73 per share. We continue to anticipate paying dividends approaching $250 million and repurchasing $400 million to $500 million of FMC shares this year. 
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark."

We are now focused on delivering against our full year forecast. COVID-19 continues to be a factor to watch, and we're closely monitoring raw material and supply chain costs. 
We remain confident in our full year forecast, but build upon the new technologies and improved market access that are driving our growth. The market demand for our most recent product launches is important as it confirms the strength and value that our innovative R&D pipeline delivers to growers. 
We expect this momentum to continue to accelerate over the coming years, with launches of new active ingredients and products as well as outcomes from technology partnerships we've established in the past year. 
Finally, we remain committed to our cash deployment plan. We are on track to deliver more than $700 million to shareholders this year, building on a trend since 2018 of improving cash generation and returning excess cash to shareholders. 
I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions."

It seems like both raw material inflation has been accelerating pretty meaningfully. Logistics is a challenge for many across the industry, and some of your peers do seem to be taking some more aggressive price action than what's implied in your guidance. And so I'm trying to just reconcile all those pieces and think about how that leads to you competitive position this year, and there's either more pricing opportunity or carryover cost inflation into next year, just thinking well to direct."

I mean, supply chain costs and raw material costs, and it's not just the cost element. It's actually availability that is causing some of that inflation that we're seeing. 
We are raising prices, and we have raised price last year. We're raising price this year. Most of it will come in the second half because of the way it's falling, although we did raise price in North America in, and we didn't get as much price as we thought we would get in Latin America. 
We were very clear that we were focused on drawing down inventory, and we've very successfully done that. We continue to do that as we enter Q2, but I feel very good where the inventory levels are. That is boding well for our ability to move price in the second half. 
And as you just alluded to, the industry itself is moving because, certainly, FMC is not the only one facing these pressures. Everybody is.

Adam, as you noted, it's a modest adjustment in terms of what net hits the EBITDA bridge for cost and increased to $100 million headwind for cost on a full year versus $90 million when we gave initial guidance in February. 
The increase in raw materials and logistic costs is substantially more than that $10 million. We are taking additional cost control actions across all of our spending, whether it be in plant level spending in COGS or in SG&A and R&D, really continuing the strong discipline we've had throughout the pandemic to partially offset some of that increase in raw materials and logistics inflation. 
So certainly, the underlying increase in raw material and logistics cost is much more than the $10 million. But again, we'll be taking some very aggressive actions to continue maintaining costs has going to offset that. 
Net-net, we look at that $100 million increase year-over-year, I think directionally speaking, about $40 million to $50 million of that is really raw material and logistics cost increases. Another $30 million to $40 million of it is a return to more normal R&D spending levels. Some variability there based on how we do the exact execution of certain project expenses in that range. 
And the remainder is increases in SG&A against an artificially low 2020 when we run a very extreme controls for the COVID pandemic."

Yes, fundamentally, I mean, we made a statement in February that in -- probably in the August call, we're going to do a deep dive. The August call is when we generally deep dive on one aspect of the business. We are going to do another deep dive on the diamides and the impact of all the programs we've put in place, whether it's defense from a legal perspective, where we've been very successful over the last year in litigating against people who are thinking about or trying to move around our patents in India and China, to the whole third-party relationships. 
And I'm sure I'm going to get a question, so I'll head it off. On the third-party relationships, we have 5 global relationships now, UPL being the latest one. And we have 41, 42 now local relationships. We have 12 more that we're in discussions with that will probably be put in place sometime this year. So we continue that expansion. 
And in August, we'll talk about the scale of this, how we see it growing. It's obviously very successful because we've been working on this since 2017 when we acquired the assets. It's been put in place. It's been driven regionally and globally. 
So we'll put in place a program where we'll show you how big it is, how it's growing. The bottom line, I do believe that in 2023, we will probably be at the very high end, if not above the high end of our expectations for diamides."

Listen, it's a very good question, one that we've been working on a lot over the last couple of years, which is obviously the new technologies, the new products. Let me give you some numbers to sort of put this in perspective for you.",546,"Yes. Thanks, Mark. Listen, it's a very good question, one that we've been working on a lot over the last couple of years, which is obviously the new technologies, the new products. Let me give you some numbers to sort of put this in perspective for you. 
I just said that $400 million of this year's revenue growth is coming from products that we've introduced since 2018. We usually take a 5-year look at this, but 2017 was a very strange year for us because we made a major acquisition, so it kind of fit in the clock in 2018. 
Of that $400 million, $180 million is growth that are coming from products that were launched in 2018. So it's real growth this year, year-on-year. Of the $180 million, $100 million is coming from products that were launched this year, such as Vantacore, such as Xyway, such as Overwatch. 
So you can see that. Think about it. This year, we're projecting an 8% growth rate. 4%, so almost half of that overall growth is coming from new products, and that's exactly the trajectory we want to see. And we expect that to continue as these major launches start to gather steam. 
So the products we've launched this year will obviously add to next year and continue for 5 years under this metric. I think it's a very important aspect that people are overlooking. I mean, we obviously focus on the diamides, and they continue to grow very well for us, will in the future as we bring on more partners. 
But you've got to remember, we're introducing brand-new products into spaces that we've never participated before. For instance, Xyway. It is a systemic fungicide for corn in the U.S. We've never had a fungicide for corn in the U.S. It's a large market, and it's one that we can now go and exploit because the technology is so different. That's the growth algorithm that we're running. 
To your second point, Mark, on market access, we have invested over the last couple of years in more basic salespeople, boots on the ground, in the field, in places like Indonesia and India, Vietnam, the Philippines. These are all, as you just said, very, very attractive markets, but they're very local markets. You have hundreds and thousands of small retailers and distributors that need to be promoted to. You only do that by having more people on the ground. So we continue to invest in that. 
And you've heard me talk over the last few quarters about how important the growth in Asia is. Well, it's coming not just from the portfolio. It's coming from our market access expansions, which were not slowing down, even as we go through the COVID-19 pandemic. 
So it's a very good picture from a new product introduction standpoint. And don't forget, overall, new products, generally speaking, have a higher margin than products that are discontinued out of the portfolio. So as Andrew has talked about many times in our 5-year plan, we have a 300 basis improvement in EBITDA margin, not only is that related to the investment in SAP and how we run the company, it is also related to the new products we're introducing and how that mix changes over time."

So they're there. They're very real. It's not just India. China has also had issues not necessarily related to COVID, but other areas of manufacturing. So yes, it's something that we're very focused on. 
The supply chain groups and procurement groups work closely together. It's not something that you can predict, so the key is to make sure that your demand forecasts are as solid as they possibly can be so that you can procure forward as much as possible. 
And don't forget, our supply chains are long in nature. From the moment an active ingredient is manufactured to it getting through to a distributor or to a retailer and to a grower, that's a 6 to 8-month supply chain. So it is a very, very complex area that takes a lot of managing."

As our diamide business gets much bigger and our third-party relationships get bigger, we don't control that demand. So it is going to move on us at times, and this is just one example. It doesn't mean to say that the overall company has lost any business. In fact, it's all good growth.

With regards to the first part of the question, yes, there are some opportunities for us to replace the product that's being removed. Diamides would potentially take some of that market share. It all depends on what price point and what particular crop that is on. But yes, the team is looking at what upside there is there. 
I think from a general regulatory perspective, whether it's a fungicide, a herbicide or insecticide, they're all under regulatory scrutiny as they always have been. We just did a recent study where we looked at the insecticide overall market. So when we think about the classes of chemistry that are out there, I do think there are some of the older chemistries that are going to come under pressure, and that's going to give great opportunity for things like the diamides, especially diamides and mixtures for different pests, and that's where I think we're going to see significant growth with some of our competitors in terms of how we're supplying product to the partners and how they will grow. 
So I'm not really focused on whether it's a herbicide or it's insecticide. We know the regulatory environment is getting more stringent. And as I've said before, for a basic R&D producer, that's not necessarily a bad thing because with a robust pipeline like we have, we're bringing the latest technologies to marketplace, which, generally speaking, because of the environmental regulations that we have today are better chemistries than more targeted, they are softer in nature. That leads itself to the second part, which is the biologicals. And our biological program is really heavily focused around fungicides. Secondary is the insecticide area. 
We don't really have anything yet in the herbicide space. But we do see that growth in our biologicals business. That biological business is now just north of $100 million in revenue. It is growing in the very high double digits, and its EBITDA margins are strong. 
And we have good products coming in the near future from the pipeline. So you will see us talk more and invest more in the biological space going forward."

It is -- it's not what we predicted, so it's something that we saw last year, actually. The drought occurred at the same time last year. It's just part of the climate change that we're seeing in the very short term that weather patterns are moving on it.

They're not necessarily, at this point in time, driving forces for revenue, but I wouldn't disagree with you that they won't become more important discussions as we go forward. And for us, we're happy to have that conversation. Because of the strength of the pipeline and the way we're developing those products, we believe there are advantages to have those discussions around the most efficacious products that have the lowest residues and especially in the biological space because that's where I can see biologicals playing a very important role."

Yes, we are projecting that growth rate in the low to mid-single digits. That's higher than we've projected over the last few years, and we were reasonably spot on with our projections in terms of  flat markets over the last couple of years. 
I obviously think that over the longer haul, if commodity prices stay where they are, then, yes, we should fundamentally see some uplift in the marketplace going forward. I think, this year, obviously, it's come, and we see -- I think the supply chain side and the raw material side is what's weighing on our view of the world. I think growers, as you say, are obviously in a much better place. 
I'm more concerned about ability to supply products that are needed at certain times in the marketplace. I think if prices stay like this into the next year, and we start to get through the COVID crisis, and that manufacturing frees up and supply chains free up a little more, logistics become freer, then, yes, I think maybe next year, we might see FMC giving you a guidance that's slightly higher than where we are today."

Listen, on the inventory side, I can certainly tell you from FMC's perspective, we're in very good shape with all the activities that we put in place. So I think the industry is generally getting better as well. We'll see as we exit Q2",359,"Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Listen, on the inventory side, I can certainly tell you from FMC's perspective, we're in very good shape with all the activities that we put in place. So I think the industry is generally getting better as well. We'll see as we exit Q2 and think about Q3 and Q4 as we enter the '21, '22 season. 
But yes, from FMC, we're in very good shape. Very happy with what the team's done. I know it's been painful for everybody involved, but it was the right thing to do. 
From a growth from our perspective, our market share on soy is reasonably low in Brazil. So when I talk about the second half of the year, and I said expectations in the U.S. and Brazil not only from a weak Q4 that we had, but generally speaking, from good crop fundamentals, soy is somewhere where we're growing. We're growing on insecticides for stink bug control, and that's not with diamide. That's with other insecticides in our portfolio. 
A couple of the brands that I mentioned here on Talisman, they are major growth products for us. So I do believe, and fundamentally, I think most people would agree that with higher crop prices, many growers are willing to invest in the best technologies to protect those crops. And that's one of the premises we're taking forward as we think about soy in the next season coming up in '21, '22. 
I also think that there is an opportunity on fungicides. We're gaining access to a new fungicide in Brazil that will be used on soybeans. That will help us as we gain a more broader footprint there. 
And then the third piece around Brazil is sheer market access. We're inking some deals as we speak, getting ready for the next season going forward with major distributors where we're increasing our market access to those distributors to sell the product. 
So a backdrop to your question is, do we think we can do more with higher crop prices in soy in Brazil. The answer is yes, and it is one of those drivers for our strong second half."

We are seeing it developing well, actually, and our growth has been very good, especially with the diamides and some of the new fungicide applications that we put in there. 
I think a watch out that I would say and the team has made this local to me is labor constraints, especially in the California areas, getting people into the field, into the packing stations. It's something we're watching. It's not been a disruptor yet, but we're always trying to look around the corner. But fundamental growth is good. 
I have to say that, generally speaking, with the specialty crops and fruit and vegetables around the world, we have seen a very good growth, especially in Asia. Many of the countries in Asia are improving their inputs into many of the specialty crops, whether it's chilis or pulses in India. Mexico is doing well, a lot of exports from Mexico, so the Mexican specialty crop business is doing well. 
And I'm expanding a little bit outside of North America and the horseshoe, but the reality is the markets are intertwined in terms of demand. 
So generally speaking, yes, very good, but one watch out would be labor in the U.S."

Those are in place. So yes, that's behind us at this point. 
When it comes to cotton, 2 things are happening. First of all, we're thinking forward to the '21, '22 season. We're already seeing raised prices for the next season, and that's something that we're driving, gives us a lot of confidence as to the previous question on price in Latin America. So not only are prices moving, but more importantly, hectares are increasing. '20 to '21 cotton hectares in Brazil were down about 15%, maybe a little bit more. We're actually seeing that rebound now on the back of better cotton prices, lower stock to use ratios around the world and, frankly, more people buying clothes as we come out of the pandemic and the demand for cotton going up. 
So this year has been a tough year for us on cotton, hence, the Q1 that we've had. But we're very, very confident that as we go into Q4 and Q1 later this year in 2022 that we'll see that rebound. And the signs are already there for us."

Revenue and earnings were down as forecasted, though earnings were modestly above the midpoint of our guidance. We continue to expect a good second quarter and a strong full year. 
We had 2 important product launches in the quarter, Overwatch Herbicide based on our Isoflex active in Australia and Xyway fungicide in the U.S. Isoflex is 1 of 11 new active ingredients we plan to launch this decade. Both launches have exceeded our expectations and have delivered approximately $50 million of Q1 sales. 
In March, we announced an important agreement with UPL to toll manufacture Rynaxypyr insect control in India and to distribute products based on the active ingredient in selected markets. In the future, FMC will supply Rynaxypyr active to UPL for use in product formulations developed and marketed by UPL around the world. This agreement is the next step in growing our important diamide franchise and accelerating FMC's long-term plans to expand the franchise in diverse geographies and crops with differentiated formulations. 
It also reaffirms the strength of our patent portfolio that protects our diamide franchise, far beyond just the composition of matter patents. 
We returned over $135 million to shareholders in the quarter through our recently increased dividend and share repurchases. 
Our guidance for Q2 indicates an expected return to mid-single-digit growth on the top line, with slightly lower earnings growth because of higher costs compared to Q2 2020. These higher costs are principally related to increasing raw materials and logistics. Additionally, we will be spending more on SG&A and R&D compared to the abnormally low spend in Q2 2020. 
I'd like to take a moment to provide a COVID-19 update on our business. All our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and properly staffed. Our research laboratories and greenhouses also have continued to operate throughout the pandemic. While many of FMC's other employees continue to work from home, plans are in place to resume in-office operations where permitted by local authorities. 
Finally, we are all aware of the challenges India is facing with significant increases of COVID cases across that country. Last week, FMC announced it will donate 7 pressure swing absorption oxygen plants to hospitals across 5 states in India to help address the rapidly increasing demand for medical oxygen. This program focuses on rural areas where we are providing further community support. 
Turning to our Q1 results on Slide 3. We reported $1.2 billion in first quarter revenue, which reflects a 4% decrease on a reported basis and a 5% decrease organically. As planned, we saw slower sales in Brazil as we drew down channel inventories in that country as well as the shortfall in EMEA due to Brexit-related sales that occurred in Q4 2020. 
In North America, we saw very good demand based on strong fundamentals in row crops and commodity prices, offset by a shift of diamide third-party sales to Latin America. 
In Asia, double-digit sales growth in Australia, Japan and our Asian subregion drove revenue performance in that region. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $307 million, a decrease of 14% compared to the prior year period and $2 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. EBITDA margins were 25.7%, a decrease of 290 basis points compared to the prior year. 
Adjusted earnings were $1.53 per diluted share in the quarter, a decrease of 17% versus Q1 2020, but also $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the decrease in EBITDA, partially offset by lower interest expense. 
Moving now to Slide 4. Q1 revenue decreased by 4% versus prior year, driven by a 4% volume decrease and a 1% price decline. Foreign currencies were a modest tailwind in the quarter on the top line. 
Sales in Asia increased 18% year-over-year and 13% organically, driven by double-digit growth in Australia, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. We had strong Overwatch Herbicide sales for cereals, and sales of our diamides were robust for fruit and vegetable and rice applications. 
Insecticides also performed well in Indonesia, helped by our recent expanded market access in that country, and improved weather helped sales across the ASEAN subregion. 
EMEA sales were down 4% year-over-year and 8% organically. We had strong sales of diamides and other insecticides as well as fungicides, but these were more than offset by headwinds from the Brexit-related U.K. sales in Q4 that we described a quarter ago as well as discontinued registrations. 
In North America, sales decreased 8% year-over-year. Our herbicide business grew double digits, partially due to the timing of some sales that shifted from Q4 to Q1 as well as the continued strength of Authority Edge and Authority Supreme herbicides. We also had a strong launch in the U.S. of Xyway fungicide for corn and Vantacor insect control for specialty crops. These were offset primarily by a shift of diamide third-party partner sales from North America to Latin America, as one of our key partners adjusted the way it purchases from FMC globally. 
This was simply a move of purchasing location and not a change in demand. Excluding this shift, our North America sales were up low double digits. 
Moving now to Latin America. Sales decreased 22% year-over-year and 13% organically. As a reminder, we were facing a particularly difficult comparison in Latin America, where sales increased 26% year-over-year and 38% organically in Q1 2020. Brazil's cotton business was very strong for us a year ago, which did not repeat this season as cotton hectares were down 15%. We also proactively reduced channel inventory of FMC products as planned in Q1, improving our inventory situation in Brazil. 
And our Andean Zone subregion continued the momentum from 2020 with double-digit sales growth. 
Turning now to the first quarter EBITDA bridge on Slide 5. EBITDA in the quarter was down $50 million year-over-year due to a very strong Q1 2020 comparison. Volume headwinds in Latin America and EMEA were partially offset by new product launches in Asia and North America. 
In Latin America, we focused on reducing channel inventory to set ourselves up for a much stronger pricing environment in the second half of 2021. 
Cost headwinds were slightly higher than expected, while FX headwinds were far lower than in the prior 4 quarters. 
Turning now to our view of the overall market conditions for 2021. We continue to expect the global crop protection market will be up low single digits on a U.S. dollar basis. Relative to this time last year, commodity prices for many of the major crops are higher, and stock to use ratios are much improved. All regions are seeing some benefit from better crop commodity prices, while the negative impact from COVID on crop demand appeared to be modest. 
The only change to our regional forecast is that we now forecast mid-single-digit growth in the EMEA market versus low single-digit growth before. This improved view is due to the strengthening of currencies in that region relative to the U.S. dollar. 
Market growth in Asia is still expected to be in the low to mid-single digits, driven by India, Australia and ASEAN countries, while growth in the North American and Latin American markets is still projected to be in the low single digits. 
Basic crop fundamentals remain strong. However, our overall forecast for the total crop protection market remains low single-digit growth due to signs of supply chain constraints in the industry as well as modest channel inventory overhang in certain countries. Although Brazil and India are facing significant increases of COVID cases, we are not seeing signs that this is impacting their respective agricultural markets at this time. This is, however, something we are continuing to watch closely. 
Turning to Slide 6 and the review of FMC's full year 2021 and Q2 earnings outlook. FMC full year 2021 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.70 and to $7.40 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 14% at the midpoint. This is up slightly versus our prior forecast, reflecting the share count reduction from our Q1 share repurchases. Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from future share repurchases in our EPS guidance. 
Our 2021 revenue forecast remains in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020 and 8% organic growth. We believe the strength of our portfolio will allow us to deliver this organic growth, continuing a multiyear trend of above-market performance. 
EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.42 billion, representing 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Guidance for Q implies a year-over-year sales growth of 6% at the midpoint on a reported basis and 5% organically. 
We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 1% at the midpoint versus Q2 2020, and  EPS is forecasted to be up 3% year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 7 and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth, with the largest growth in Asia and a 2% contribution from higher prices. FX is now forecasted to have no impact on the top line. 
We continue to expect broad growth across all regions and a very strong second half of 2021. New products like Overwatch herbicide, Xyway fungicide and Vantacor insect control, are already making meaningful contributions. We are also planning to launch Fluindapyr fungicide in the U.S. for non-crop applications later this year. 
We expect new products to contribute $400 million in revenue this year. This includes all products launched since 2018. 
We are forecasting strong growth in each of our product categories in the year. In addition to the continued growth of Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr insect controls, we expect growth from other key insecticide brands in our portfolio, including Avatar, Hero and Talisman. 
Our herbicide portfolio is also expected to grow led by brands, including Authority, Gamit, Spotlight Plus and Overwatch. Xyway is expected to lead growth of our fungicide portfolio, building on the successful launch of Lucento fungicide a couple of years ago. 
Our EBITDA guidance reflects significant volume and pricing benefits, offset partially by increases in R&D spending, the reversal of some temporary cost savings from 2020 as well as increase in raw material and logistics costs. 
As we've stated in February, we are forecasting an increase in R&D to bring us to a level of funding that keeps all projects on a critical path to commercialization. We are taking cost control actions to limit the net cost headwind to an incremental $10 million versus what we showed in February. We also intend to offset the higher raw material costs with an additional $10 million in price increases, which will come primarily in the second half of the year. 
Moving to Slide 8, where you can see the Q2 drivers. On the revenue line, we are expecting positive contributions from all categories: volume 4%, pricing 1% and FX 1%. We're expecting solid sales growth in Asia, EMEA and Latin America. Asia growth is expected to be broad based across the region, with particular strength in India, Australia and China. Growth in EMEA will be driven by improved crop conditions for cereals and sugar beets. Latin America, growth should be supported by improved conditions in both Brazil and Mexico and the continuation of strong growth in the Andean Zone. We see good conditions in North America for row crops and a positive outlook for our new products. 
Regarding EBITDA drivers, positive contributions from volume, price and FX more than offset the increased costs, which we previously discussed. 
Turning now to Slide 9. With the guidance for Q2 and the full year on record, we would like to also show the implied forecast for the second half. We have a very strong outlook for H2, and let me outline the drivers for that growth. We forecast year-over-year revenue growth of 15% in the second half driven by 5 main elements. 
First, our expectations are strong for the U.S. and Brazil, following our weak Q4 2020 performance in those countries. Second, price increases, primarily in Brazil, with contributions from numerous other countries will help offset the FX headwind from last year and the higher costs from raw materials this year. Thirdly, new products will continue to be a major factor, Overwatch in Australia, Xyway and diamide formulations Elevest and Vantacor and Fluindapyr for non-crop applications in the U.S. and Authority NXT herbicide in India. Fourth, improved crop fundamentals. Cotton in Brazil is the most obvious to us, as growers have indicated, a 15% increase in hectares for next season. And we also expect a strong Q4 in North America and Latin America, driven by good fundamentals for soybeans and corn. And finally, fifth, improved market access and expansions into new geographies and crops. This is having a significant impact in Asia with recent initiatives in India, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam all forecast to drive high-growth rates. 
Our guidance also implies a 30% year-over-year EBITDA growth in the second half of the year. Much of that will come directly from the volume and pricing growth I just described, but we also expect to limit the raw material and supply chain cost headwinds with sustained cost discipline in other areas. 
I will now turn the call over to Andrew."

Let me start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement. FX was a modest tailwind for revenue growth in Q1 at 1% versus our expectations of a 2% headwind, as the U.S. dollar weakened against many currencies with the notable exception of the Brazilian reais. 
Interest expense for the first quarter was $32.4 million, down $8.4 million from the prior year period, with the benefit of lower LIBOR rates as well as lower foreign debt and lower term loan balances, partially offset by higher average commercial paper balances. We continue to anticipate interest expense between $130 million and $140 million for the full year. 
Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the first quarter was 13.1% as anticipated and in line with our continued expectation for a full year tax rate between 12.5% and 14.5%. 
Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt at the end of the quarter was $3.6 billion, up over $300 million from the prior quarter, with the expected seasonal build of working capital. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 3.0x at the end of the first quarter, while net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.7x. Both metrics were above our targeted full year average levels due to the seasonality of working capital. We expect that this will improve throughout the year, and we will return to target levels by year-end. 
Moving on to Slide 10 and cash flow and cash deployment. Free cash flow for the first quarter was negative $354 million. Adjusted cash from operations was similar to the prior year period, with improved working capital offset by changes in nonworking capital items and lower EBITDA. 
Capital additions were somewhat higher as we ramped up spending following deferral of projects last year due to COVID. Legacy and transformation spending was substantially lower with the completion of our SAP program. 
We continue to expect to generate full year free cash flow within a range of $530 million to $620 million, with the vast majority of this cash flow coming in the second half of the year. 
We returned $137 million to shareholders in the quarter via $62 million in dividends and $75 million of share repurchases, buying back 696,000 shares in the quarter at an average price of $107.73 per share. We continue to anticipate paying dividends approaching $250 million and repurchasing $400 million to $500 million of FMC shares this year. 
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark."

The market demand for our most recent product launches is important as it confirms the strength and value that our innovative R&D pipeline delivers to growers. 
We expect this momentum to continue to accelerate over the coming years, with launches of new active ingredients and products as well as outcomes from technology partnerships we've established in the past year. 
Finally, we remain committed to our cash deployment plan. We are on track to deliver more than $700 million to shareholders this year, building on a trend since 2018 of improving cash generation and returning excess cash to shareholders.

I'll start off, and then I'll let Andrew talk a little bit more about some of the cost actions and items that we got on the agenda in front of us. Listen, you're right. I mean, supply chain costs and raw material costs, and it's not just the cost element. It's actually availability that is causing some of that inflation that we're seeing. 
We are raising prices, and we have raised price last year. We're raising price this year. Most of it will come in the second half because of the way it's falling, although we did raise price in North America in Q1, and we didn't get as much price as we thought we would get in Latin America. 
We were very clear that we were focused on drawing down inventory, and we've very successfully done that. We continue to do that as we enter Q2, but I feel very good where the inventory levels are. That is boding well for our ability to move price in the second half. 
And as you just alluded to, the industry itself is moving because, certainly, FMC is not the only one facing these pressures. Everybody is. 
So Andrew, do you want to talk a little bit about some of the cost elements and how it's flowing through the P&L?"

Adam, as you noted, it's a modest adjustment in terms of what net hits the EBITDA bridge for cost and increased to $100 million headwind for cost on a full year versus $90 million when we gave initial guidance in February. 
The increase in raw materials and logistic costs is substantially more than that $10 million. We are taking additional cost control actions across all of our spending, whether it be in plant level spending in COGS or in SG&A and R&D, really continuing the strong discipline we've had throughout the pandemic to partially offset some of that increase in raw materials and logistics inflation. 
So certainly, the underlying increase in raw material and logistics cost is much more than the $10 million. But again, we'll be taking some very aggressive actions to continue maintaining cost discipline to offset that. 
Net-net, we look at that $100 million increase year-over-year, and directionally speaking, about $40 million to $50 million of that is really raw material and logistics cost increases. Another $30 million to $40 million of it is a return to more normal R&D spending levels. Some variability there based on how we do the exact execution of certain project expenses in that range. 
And the remainder is increases in SG&A against an artificially low 2020 when we run very extreme controls throughout the COVID pandemic."

And I'm sure I'm going to get a question, so I'll head it off. On the third-party relationships, we have 5 global relationships now, UPL being the latest one. And we have 41, 42 now local relationships. We have 12 more that we're in discussions with that will probably be put in place sometime this year. So we continue that expansion. 
And in August, we'll talk about the scale of this, how we see it growing. It's obviously very successful because we've been working on this since 2017 when we acquired the assets. It's been put in place. It's been driven regionally and globally. 
So we'll put in place a program where we'll show you how big it is, how it's growing. The bottom line, I do believe that in 2023, we will probably be at the very high end, if not above the high end of our expectations for diamides."

Listen, it's a very good question, one that we've been working on a lot over the last couple of years, which is obviously the new technologies, the new products. Let me give you some numbers to sort of put this in perspective for you.",546,"Yes. Thanks, Mark. Listen, it's a very good question, one that we've been working on a lot over the last couple of years, which is obviously the new technologies, the new products. Let me give you some numbers to sort of put this in perspective for you. 
I just said that $400 million of this year's revenue growth is coming from products that we've introduced since 2018. We usually take a 5-year look at this, but 2017 was a very strange year for us because we made a major acquisition, so we've kind of set in the clock at 2018. 
Of that $400 million, $180 million is growth that are coming from products that were launched in 2018. So it's real growth this year year-on-year. Of the $180 million, $100 million is coming from products that were launched this year, such as Vantacor, such as Xyway, such as Overwatch. 
So you can see that, think about it, this year, we're projecting an 8% growth rate. 4%, so almost half of that overall growth is coming from new products, and that's exactly the trajectory we want to see. And we expect that to continue as these major launches start to gather steam. 
So the products we've launched this year will obviously add to next year and continue for 5 years under this metric. I think it's a very important aspect that people are overlooking. I mean, we obviously focus on the diamides, and they continue to grow very well for us, will in the future as we bring on more partners. 
But you've got to remember, we're introducing brand-new products into spaces that we've never participated before, for instance, Xyway. It is a systemic fungicide for corn in the U.S. We've never had a fungicide for corn in the U.S. It's a large market, and it's one that we can now go and exploit because the technology is so different. That's the growth algorithm that we're running. 
To your second point, Mark, on market access, we have invested over the last couple of years in more basic salespeople, boots on the ground, in the field, in places like Indonesia and India, Vietnam, the Philippines. These are all, as you just said, very, very attractive markets, but they're very local markets. You have hundreds and thousands of small retailers and distributors that need to be promoted to. You only do that by having more people on the ground. So we continue to invest in that. 
Then you've heard me talk over the last few quarters about how important the growth in Asia is. Well, it's coming not just from the portfolio, it's coming from our market access expansions, which were not slowing down, even as we go through the COVID-19 pandemic. 
So it's a very good picture from a new product introduction standpoint. And don't forget, overall, new products, generally speaking, have a higher margin than products that are discontinued out of the portfolio. So as Andrew has talked about many times in our 5-year plan, we have a 300 basis improvement in EBITDA margin. Not only is that related to the investment in SAP and how we run the company, it is also related to the new products we're introducing and how that mix changes over time."

These things come and go as places get hit. We've not had our own facilities go down, but our procurement and supply chain groups are working hard behind the scenes to source alternate raw materials where somebody goes down because of a COVID impact. 
So they're there. They're very real. It's not just India. China has also had issues, not necessarily related to COVID, but other areas of manufacturing. So yes, it's something that we're very focused on. 
The supply chain groups and procurement groups work closely together. It's not something that you can predict, so the key is to make sure that your demand forecasts are as solid as they possibly can be so that you can procure forward as much as possible. 
And don't forget, our supply chains are long in nature. From the moment an active ingredient is manufactured to it getting through to a distributor or to a retailer and to a grower, that's a 6- to 8-month supply chain. So it is a very, very complex area that takes a lot of managing."

As our diamide business gets much bigger and our third-party relationships get bigger, we don't control that demand. So it is going to move on us at times, and this is just one example. It doesn't mean to say that the overall company has lost any business. In fact, it's all good growth.

With regards to the first part of the question, yes, there are some opportunities for us to replace the product that's being removed. Diamides would potentially take some of that market share. It all depends at what price point and what particular crop that is on. But yes, the team is looking at what upside there is there. 
I think from a general regulatory perspective, whether it's a fungicide, a herbicide or insecticide, they're all under regulatory scrutiny as they always have been. We just did a recent study where we looked at the insecticide overall market. So when we think about the classes of chemistry that are out there, I do think there are -- some of the older chemistries that are going to come under pressure, and that's going to give great opportunity for things like the diamides, especially diamides and mixtures for different pests, and that's where I think we're going to see significant growth with some of our competitors in terms of how we're supplying product to the partners and how they will grow. 
So I'm not really focused on whether it's a herbicide or it's insecticide. We know the regulatory environment is getting more stringent. And as I've said before, for a basic R&D producer, that's not necessarily a bad thing because with a robust pipeline like we have, we're bringing the latest technologies to marketplace, which, generally speaking, because of the environmental regulations that we have today, our better chemistries, they're more targeted, they are softer in nature, that leads itself to the second part, which is the biologicals. And our biological program is really heavily focused around fungicides. Secondary is the insecticide area. 
We don't really have anything yet in the herbicide space. But we do see that growth in our biologicals business. That biological business is now just north of $100 million in revenue. It is growing in the very high double digits, and its EBITDA margins are strong. 
And we have good products coming in, in the near future from the pipeline. So you will see us talk more and invest more in the biological space going forward."

The good news is in our European business, we do have a very diversified portfolio, and we have been growing in many of the smaller countries. I've mentioned Romania before. I've mentioned Greece. I've mentioned Turkey, which is becoming a much bigger market for us. So I think having that distributed model across many countries helps. But yes, it is delayed and it's something we're watching."

Our global marketing group and our sustainability group have various relationships throughout that food chain. 
I would say in the future, we've talked many times about our sustainability index that we use for our research programs. I think a tool such as that as we go forward is going to be important to show the environmental impact that we have on the food chain in terms of the types of products we're selling, whether it be from a water usage, in manufacture or residual levels in use, those are all important elements. 
They're not necessarily, at this point in time, driving forces for revenue, but I wouldn't disagree with you that they won't become more important discussions as we go forward. And for us, we're happy to have that conversation. Because of the strength of the pipeline and the way we're developing those products, we believe there are advantages to have those discussions around the most efficacious products that have the lowest residues and especially in the biological space because that's where I can see biologicals playing a very important role."

I think growers, as you say, are obviously in a much better place. 
I'm more concerned about ability to supply products that are needed at certain times in the marketplace. I think if prices stay like this into the next year and we start to get through the COVID crisis, and that manufacturing frees up and supply chains free up a little more, logistics become freer, then, yes, I think maybe next year, we might see FMC giving you a guidance that's slightly higher than where we are today."

Listen, on the inventory side, I can certainly tell you from FMC's perspective, we're in very good shape with all the activities that we've put in place. So I think the industry is generally getting better as well. We'll see as we exit Q2 and think about Q3 and Q4 as we enter the '21, '22 season. 
But yes, from FMC, we're in very good shape. Very happy with what the team's done. I know it's been painful for everybody involved, but it was the right thing to do. 
From a growth -- from our perspective, our market share on soy is reasonably low in Brazil. So when I talk about the second half of the year, and I said expectations in the U.S. and Brazil not only from a weak Q4 that we had, but generally speaking, from good crop fundamentals, soy is somewhere where we're growing. We're growing on insecticides for stink bug control and that's not with diamide. That's with other insecticides in our portfolio. 
A couple other brands that I mentioned here on Talisman, they are major growth products for us. So I do believe, and fundamentally, I think most people would agree, that with higher crop prices, many growers are willing to invest in the best technologies to protect those crops. And that's one of the premises we're taking forward as we think about soy in the next season coming up in '21, '22. 
I also think that there is an opportunity on fungicides. We're gaining access to a new fungicide in Brazil that will be used on soybeans. That will help us as we gain a more broader footprint there. 
And then the third piece around Brazil is sheer market access. We're inking some deals as we speak, getting ready for the next season going forward with major distributors where we're increasing our market access to those distributors to sell the product. 
So a backdrop to your question is, do we think we can do more with higher crop prices in soy in Brazil? The answer is yes, and it is one of those drivers for our strong second half."

We are seeing it developing well, actually, and our growth has been very good, especially with the diamides and some of the new fungicide applications that we put in there. 
I think a watch out that I would say and the team has made this local to me is labor constraints, especially in the California areas, getting people into the fields, into the packing stations. It's something we're watching. It's not been a disruptor yet, but we're always trying to look around the corner. But fundamental growth is good. 
I have to say that, generally speaking, with the specialty crops and fruit and vegetables around the world, we have seen a very good growth, especially in Asia. Many of the countries in Asia are improving their inputs into many of the specialty crops, whether it's chilis or pulses in India. Mexico is doing well, a lot of exports from Mexico, so the Mexican specialty crop business is doing well. 
And I'm expanding a little bit outside of North America and the horseshoe, but the reality is the markets are intertwined in terms of demand. 
So generally speaking, yes, very good, but one watch out would be labor in the U.S."

Those are in place. So yes, that's behind us at this point. 
When it comes to cotton, 2 things are happening. First of all, we're thinking forward to the '21, '22 season. We're already seeing raised prices for the next season, and that's something that we're driving, gives us a lot of confidence as to the previous question on price in Latin America. So not only are prices moving, but more importantly, hectares are increasing. '20 to '21 cotton hectares in Brazil were down about 15%, maybe a little bit more. We're actually seeing that rebound now on the back of better cotton prices, lower stock to use ratios around the world and, frankly, more people buying clothes as we come out of the pandemic and the demand for cotton going up. 
So this year has been a tough year for us on cotton, hence, the Q1 that we've had. But we're very, very confident that as we go into Q4 and Q1 later this year and 2022 that we'll see that rebound. And the signs are already there for us."

Our second quarter results, revenue up 8%, EBITDA up 2% and EPS up 5% year-over-year were slightly ahead of our guidance.

Our second quarter results, revenue up 8%, EBITDA up 2% and EPS up 5% year-over-year were slightly ahead of our guidance. These results were fundamentally driven by volume, reflecting robust demand for FMC products around the world.
Innovation continues to be a catalyst for growth. New products introduced in the last 12 months contributed $30 million in sales growth in the quarter and our plant health products, including biologicals, posted Q2 sales growth in the high teens. We continue to expect a very strong second half of 2021, driven by robust volume growth. We have lowered our full year earnings guidance due to the continued acceleration of raw material, packaging and logistics costs. We will go into this in more details later.
I'd like to take a moment to provide a COVID-19 update on our business. All our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and properly staffed. Our research laboratories and greenhouses also have continued to operate throughout the pandemic. We are resuming in-office operations work permitted by local authorities. And in June, we introduced flexible work arrangements to facilitate the return of all our staff to our headquarters in Philadelphia as well as some other locations in adherence with local guidelines.
We continue to have 0 transmission of the virus in our facilities, but I want to acknowledge that we have lost employees to the pandemic, and our employees have also lost family members. Thankfully, that number of affected employees has been small. Our thoughts are with employees that have been impacted directly by COVID-19, and we are thankful for everyone who continues to work safely at FMC.
Turning to our Q2 results on Slide 3. We reported $1.2 billion in second quarter revenue, which reflects an 8% increase on a reported basis and a 4% increase organically. Asia and Latin America posted the largest growth of 20% and 15%, respectively. Our fungicides grew over 50% in the quarter, driven by the Xyway launch in the U.S. and fungicides represented 8% of total sales in Q2 versus 5% of our sales in the prior year period.
Adjusted EBITDA was $347 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period and $2 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. EBITDA margins were 28%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of continued and accelerating cost headwinds.
Adjusted earnings were $1.81 per diluted share in the quarter, an increase of 5% versus Q2 2020 and also $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the increases in EBITDA and lower interest expense.
Moving now to Slide 4. Despite the unfavorable weather conditions in several regions, Q2 revenue increased by 8% versus the prior year, driven by a 4% volume increase and a 4% tailwind from foreign currencies. Pricing was essentially flat year-over-year.
Sales in Asia increased 20% year-over-year and 13% organically, driven by double-digit growth in India, Australia, Indonesia and Pakistan. Insecticides contributed the greatest growth, including Altacor for cotton and herbicide sales were also very strong, driven by share gains in India for soybean and sugarcane applications as well as robust sales in Australia.
In Latin America, Sales increased 15% year-over-year and 12% organically. Mexico and Colombia each posted double-digit growth, driven by strength of our products on specialty crops. We also had a shift of diamide partner sales for Latin America from North America similar to what occurred in Q1, which boosted the year-over-year growth rate.
EMEA sales increased 3% year-over-year, but declined 3% organically as FX was a significant tailwind in the period. Diamides grew well, and we saw strong sales of herbicides for cereals and sugar beat. However, this wasn't enough to offset the late start of the spring, which resulted in lost applications for the FMC portfolio that will not be regained during the season.
In North America, sales decreased 7% year-over-year and 8% organically. Similar to Q1, the year-over-year sales decline in Q2 was due to the shift of diamide partner sales from North America to other regions. Excluding revenue from our global diamide partnerships, our U.S. and Canada crop business grew greater than 20%, driven by an approximate $25 million contribution from 2 new products, Xyway fungicide and VantaCore insect control for specialty crops.
Turning now to the second quarter EBITDA bridge on Slide 5. EBITDA in the quarter was up 2% year-over-year due to the volume contribution of $42 million, largely offset by a $35 million cost headwind. The cost headwind continues to be driven by increases in raw material, packaging and logistics costs and the very modest reversal of some of the temporary cost savings from 2020. Pricing was essentially flat versus prior year.
Turning to our view of the overall market conditions for 2021. We now expect the global crop protection market will be up mid-single digits on a U.S. dollar basis, which is slightly higher than our prior forecast and the most bullish we've been on the overall market for the past few years. The reason for the change is our view that the Latin American market will now grow in the high single digits versus low single digits before. Basic crop fundamentals remain strong, especially in that region. We continue to anticipate mid-single-digit growth in the EMEA market, low to mid-single-digit growth in the Asian market and low single-digit growth in the North American market.
Turning to Slide 6, and the review of FMC's full year 2021 and Q3, Q4 earnings outlook. FMC full year 2021 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.54 to $6.94 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint. This is down $0.31 at the midpoint versus our prior forecast. Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from future potential share repurchases in our EPS guidance. Our 2021 revenue forecast remains in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020.
EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.29 billion to $1.35 billion, representing a 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. This is a $50 million reduction at the midpoint compared to our prior forecast due to continued acceleration costs for raw materials, packaging and logistics. This includes spending more to procure certain raw materials and intermediates from alternate sources where there is limited availability at our preferred suppliers.
Despite dry and cold conditions in certain parts of Brazil during Q2, we are bullish for the second half in Latin America, especially for soybeans and cotton. In Brazil, our channel inventories are at more normal levels for this point in the season following the actions we took in Q1 this year. And we already have received nearly 70% of the orders needed to deliver our full year forecast in Brazil.
Guidance for Q3 implies year-over-year sales growth of 8% at the midpoint on a reported basis and 7% organically. We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 5% at the midpoint versus Q3 2020, and EPS is forecasted to be up 7% year-over-year. Guidance for Q4 implies year-over-year sales growth of 20% at the midpoint on a reported basis with no FX impact anticipated. We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 35% at the midpoint versus Q4 2020, and EPS is forecasted to be up 46% year-over-year. It is worth noting that about half of this growth is going to be driven by the return of business we missed in Q4 2020 due to supply chain issues in North America and weather impact in Latin America.
Turning to Slide 7, and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth, a 1% contribution from higher prices and a 1% benefit from FX. We continue to expect broad growth across all regions except EMEA and a very strong second half of 2021. We have raised our forecast for 2021 revenue contribution from products launched in the last 12 months to $130 million from $100 million before. This includes launches of Overwatch herbicide, Xyway fungicide as well as VantaCore and LVS insect controls.
Our EBITDA bridge shows an increase of about $50 million in the expected impact from costs versus our May forecast. We continue our cost control actions to limit the net cost headwind. As we stated throughout the year, the R&D spending in our forecast is what is needed to keep our projects on a critical path to commercialization. But this year-over-year increase will be closer to $20 million, rather than the $30 million to $40 million we had previously indicated as we limit overall cost increases.
Relative to our prior guidance, bridge in May, we raised the anticipated volume contribution and lowered our benefit from pricing to reflect our decision to take volume with our high-margin portfolio.
Moving to Slide 8, where you see the Q3 and Q4 drivers. On the revenue line for the third quarter, we are expecting a 6% contribution from volume, 1% contribution from price and 1% benefit from FA. We had a very strong revenue outlook for Q4, driven by 5 main elements. First, we forecast a strong recovery for our U.S. and Brazil businesses following the weak Q4 2020 in those countries. This contributes about half of the total growth in the quarter.
Second, new products will be a major factor. Xyway fungicide, the diamide formulations, Elevest and Ventika, Fluindapyr fungicide for noncrop applications in the U.S., Overwatch herbicide in Australia and Authority NXT herbicide in India.
Third, strong crop fundamentals. We expect a strong Q4 in North America and Latin America, driven by good fundamentals for a variety of crops. In Brazil, this includes cotton, as growers have indicated a 15% increase in hectares for the upcoming season.
Fourth, improved market access and expansion into new geographies and crops. This is having a significant impact in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Eastern Europe and Russia.
And finally, fifth, price increases will help offset the FX headwind from last year, and the higher costs from raw materials this year. We are already holding orders for Brazil and U.S. that are at higher year-over-year prices. Much of our forecasted Q4 EBITDA growth will come directly from the volume and pricing growth I just described. Although we are seeing a large increase in cost in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, we are taking actions to reduce SG&A and R&D to offset a portion of the raw material and supply chain cost headwinds we are facing.
I will now turn the call over to Andrew."

Let me start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement. FX was a stronger-than-expected tailwind to revenue growth in the quarter at 4% versus our expectations of a 1% tailwind as the U.S. dollar weakened against all major currencies relevant to FMC.
Interest expense for the quarter was $32.6 million, down $8.1 million from the prior year period driven by the benefit of lower LIBOR rates and lower foreign debt balances. With continued low interest rates, we now expect interest expense to be between $130 million and $135 million for the full year.
Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the second quarter was 13.5% as anticipated and in line with our continued expectation for the full year tax rate. Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt at quarter end was $3.8 billion, up roughly $200 million from the prior quarter. Gross debt at trailing 12-month EBITDA was 3.2x at the end of the second quarter, while net debt to EBITDA was 2.6x. The difference between gross debt and net debt metric is much larger than usual this quarter as we had significant cash that we were not able to return to the United States prior to quarter end. We are exploring repatriation alternatives for this cash in the third quarter. Both levered metrics were above our targeted full year average leverage levels due to seasonality of working capital and will improve through the remainder of the year.
Moving on to Slide 9 and cash flow and cash deployment. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $204 million, essentially flat to the prior year period. Adjusted cash from operations was lower than the prior year period, in large part due to timing changes of certain tax payments. Inventory was higher, reflecting the accelerating cost of raw materials as well as increased inventory levels, particularly of diamide as we prepare for a very strong second half. However, the growth in inventory was offset by increased payables.
Capital additions were somewhat higher as we continue to ramp up spending following deferral projects last year due to COVID. Legacy and transformation spending was down substantially with the benefit of the completion of our SAP program.
With the reduction in our outlook for full year EBITDA, we are similarly adjusting downward our expectations for free cash flow to a range of $480 million to $570 million, with the vast majority of this cash flow coming in the fourth quarter. Our outlook for adjusted cash from operations as we can further EBITDA driven by somewhat higher-than-expected working capital due to shifts in timing of sales to the latter part of the second half of the year, which will shift some collections into the following year as well as higher inventory driven partially by elevated raw material costs. Our outlook for capital additions as well as for legacy and transformation have improved slightly.
We returned $87 million to shareholders in the quarter via $62 million in dividends and $25 million of share repurchases, buying back 212,000 shares in the quarter at an average price of $118.10 per share. Year-to-date, we've returned $224 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. For the full year, we continue to anticipate paying dividends of roughly $250 million, and now expect to repurchase a total of $350 million to $450 million of FMC shares this year. with the outlook for repurchases down slightly, reflecting the lower EBITDA guidance.
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark."

Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr have grown to be al",1753,"Thank you, Andrew. Today, we'll provide an update on the progress of our diamide growth strategy. Since we launched FMC as a pure-play agricultural science company, diamides have been a core part of our business. Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr have grown to be almost 40% of FMC sales today.
Turning to Slide 11, and some basic data on the insecticides market, which has grown by 83% from 2007 to 2019 and is approximately $17 billion in value today. Following the broad crop protection market drop in 2015, insecticides have grown 2% per year. We expect this to accelerate in the next decade to about 3.3% compound annual growth rate, as higher-value technologies take more share from older insecticides that are being phased out by regulators. We believe by 2030, the insecticide market will expand by about $7 billion versus 2019 to $24 billion in total.
Moving to Slide 12. We show the year-by-year revenue of the major insecticide active ingredient classes from 2014 through 2019 as reported by AgBio investor, and the respective share gains and losses over the period. FMC diamide Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr make up well over 80% of the entire diamides class, which includes a few other smaller active ingredients. Our diamides have grown to be about 10% to 11% of the total insecticide market, and the total diamides class has gained 2% share from 2017 to 2019 to reach 13% of the total insecticide market. Conversely, organophosphate and neonictenoids have lost overall share.
Turning to Slide 13. We show the geographic breakdown of our $1.8 billion in diamide sales in 2020. This is all Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr sales and includes FMC sales of branded products and sales to our partners. Asia makes up nearly 40% of our diamides business today with North America a little over 1/4 of the sales in EMEA and Latin America between 15% and 20% each. FMC diamides have grown well above the market in all regions since we acquired them in 2017.
On the right is the crop breakdown for our diamides. It should be no surprise that fruit and vegetables and rice make up about 50% of our current revenues. This is why the diamides are so strong in Asia, since that market is about 30% rice and 30% fruit and in vegetables.
Turning to Slide 14 and our diamides commercial strategy, which we've discussed many times over the past 2 years. We have long-term supply agreements with 5 key multinational companies, including the UPL deal we announced in March of this year. We also have 50 local agreements in various countries, and we have another 15 potential agreements currently under discussion. These agreements are helping significantly expand the market for our diamides. Our partners give us access to customers we do not currently serve. They also have access to certain active ingredients that can be formulated with our diamide to expand the market beyond what FMC has access to.
The $1.8 billion diamide revenue in 2020 was roughly 60% through our own commercial activities, which we label as FMC branded on these charts and 40% through our global and local partners. Since we acquired these products, our diamide growth has been evenly split between FMC branded business and sales to our partners, which demonstrates how complementary these 2 routes to market are. We've been very deliberate in driving our growth through our partnership model. The success of this model is shown by the fact that the company EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points from 2018 to 2020, even as these partners were growing significantly, confirming this strategy is not margin dilutive.
The other aspect of having sales to partners represent $700 million of our annual revenue can add more volatility in timing of demand. As such, revenues can be impacted by shifts in partner demand across the geographies and in time period. We have structured the contracts with partners to have extended duration. Many of the agreements go through the end of this decade and some go beyond that time frame.
Moving to Slide 15. There are several highlights of how we have grown our FMC branded portion of our diamide sales. New formulations, new registrations, label extensions and improved market access will drive growth, not only for the diamides, but for all FMC active ingredients.
Earlier this year, we launched the novel patent-pending VantaCore formulation in the U.S., which has already exceeded our original forecast. VantaCore provides a much higher concentration than prior Rynaxypyr formulation, offering improved mixing, less packaging and an improved sustainability profile. We see compelling opportunities in several crops and plan to launch VantaCore around the world, including Australia, where we have just received regulatory approval. We will continue to introduce other new mixtures and innovative formulations in all regions with 11 more launches expected by 2026.
We are also developing new product offerings for our patented precision pack and Thrive 3D systems, which are expected to launch during the next 5 years. Furthermore, we continue to expand our precision agricultural platform with additional services provided to growers and dealers through Arc Farm Intelligence.
Moving to Slide 16, where we provide an update on our registrations and label extension strategy for our FMC branded diamides. A product registration from regulators is required in every country where we wish to sell, and each specific crop to be treated must be further approved by the regulators in that country. Every product use approved by regulators equals a new slide of addressable market.
Today, we have approximately 2,700 approved uses across all products based on Rynaxypyr, and 1,100 across all products based on Cyazypyr. We currently have 600 regulatory submissions under review and another 230 that we plan to submit to regulators from 2021 to 2025. We anticipate nearly 600 of these will achieve regulatory approval in the next 5 years.
Moving to Slide 17 and the diamide patent state. Rynaxypyr is covered by 21 patent families with a total of 639 granted and pending patents. Together with Cyazypyr-active related patents, we have over 30 patent families and close to 1,000 granted and pending patents filed in 76 countries worldwide. Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr are complex molecules to produce. We have patented many of these steps and several of these intermediate processes patents run well past the expiration of the active ingredient composition of [indiscernible].
The fastest route to market for a competitor to enter the market for generic Rynaxypyr or Cyazypyr is to register their product by reliant on FMC's product data. To do so, they will also be required to demonstrate that their product has the same profile as FMC's Rynaxypyr or Cyazypyr. To meet these stringent regulatory requirements for such a difficult to manufacture molecules, the AIs will have to be made the same way we are making it, which is protected by our FMC process pattern.
Our patent portfolio includes extensive coverage of key intermediate chemicals commercial and alternative manufacturing processes, mixtures and formulations. Slides 18 and 19 show the patent time lines for the top 5 markets. Taking into account our patents and regulatory requirement, we do not expect to see sales by a legitimate generic competitor that uses the approved manufacturing process, which would rely on our Rynaxypyr product data before 2026 in Europe, Brazil, India and China, and 2027 for the U.S. Using that same approach for Cyazypyr on Slide 19, we do not expect to see sales by legitimate generic competitors until 2026 for Brazil, China and India, 2027 for Europe, and 2028 for the U.S. It is important to note that process and intermediate patents are critical as it is extremely difficult to produce these compounds without these intermediates.
Moving to Slide 20. We are confident that our patent portfolio is impossible. This is evident in a recent favorable injunction, restraining NATCO in India from making or selling any product containing Rynaxypyr. Notably, the court also ordered NATCO not to use our patented processes to make Rynaxypyr. We anticipate that this is the first of many successful enforcements of our diamide process patent. To date, we have enforced our patent and obtain preliminary injunctions or settlements against 6 infringers in India, and we have commenced litigation against 4 infringes in China.
Beyond patent enforcement, we've also had a variety of other successful court decisions that support our strategy. For example, we have obtained an injunction against the Brazilian regulators to respect our Rynaxypyr data exclusivity, which will postpone action on all generic Rynaxypyr applications filed while our data exclusivity was still in force. This effectively delays their registration approval by years.
In addition to our legal strategy, we have also adopted a comprehensive regulatory advocacy strategy that includes notifying regulators about companies that do not have permission to produce. As a result of these efforts, multiple countries have decided not to accept applications for registration of Rynaxypyr products prior to the active ingredients patent expiration and others have decided to require additional data and proof of legitirate manufacturing rights in the source country as part of the application process.
So to recap on the diamides. First, the insecticide market continues to grow, and our diamides will continue to take share. Second, our partner strategy is accelerating the growth of diamides and smoothing the transition to a post patent business later this decade. Third, our patent state is strong and will remain in place for a long time. Fourth, we are successfully defending our patents and we'll continue to enforce our IP. And fifth, diamides will continue to be a meaningful contributor to FMC's growth throughout this decade and beyond.
To conclude our prepared remarks, despite the continued headwinds from costs, we continue to deliver excellent volume growth around the world, driven by the significant success of new product introductions as well as an increasingly robust market. Our mid- to long-term growth story is firmly rooted in the strength of our current portfolio, the diamide expansion we just outlined and the significant growth we anticipate from our new product pipeline over the next decade.
As you've seen in the press release earlier this morning, we announced our target to achieve net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. This is a bold step for our company and reflects our deep commitment to sustainability.
And finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Michael Wiley for his commitment to FMC over the last 8 years and wish him great success in his next career move. I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions."

Mark, I wanted to drill in a little more on the diamide outlook. I appreciate the detailed update on the IT strategy and partnership and so forth, but would like to hear your views about the competitive landscape? What are the primary products by region or crop that you can comment on that the diamides are really down in the trends competing with? And the reason I ask is the biggest bucket is the neonics and the top 2 in that category are being banned by Europe. And I don't know whether you think that could spread to other regions. And then in that next big bucket is the organo phosphate and the #1 in there is for purifier where we think the EPA could ban that in the next 2 weeks. And so whether that could expand as well, I would like to hear your view on that. But more importantly, what are those actions mean for the competitive landscape for your diamides?"

And you're right, neonics are under pressure, organophosphate, some of them are certainly under pressure and some of the pyrethroids as well. So when you look at those major classes of chemistry, we do believe that either the diamides as they are built today and formulated today will take share in certain parts of the world from all of those 3 classes.
But more importantly, I think the way we're going to formulate and our partners are formulating these products, I think you'll also see that accelerated market share gain against those 3 classes of chemistries. And by the way, there are other chemistries out there as well that are old. Those will just happen to be the big ones.
So part of the growth is going to be that share gain. And we've already seen that. You can see that the diamides are growing strongly as some of the other technologies are declining. I don't see that slowing down. In fact, for everybody that watches this space, you can see the regulatory environment is getting tougher and tougher. That bodes well for the diamides and frankly, for the next set of insecticides that we will launch over the decade out of our new pipeline. So very strong growth expected. And yes, some of it will be against those different types of classes of products."

And then corollary to that is the pricing actions that you're taking, which, on a net basis, seemed a little bit more modest than you might have thought a few months ago. And really, looking back over the last couple of years, when I look at price, FX and cost kind of all 3, FMC, that's still on a multiyear basis, still a full negative number. So just help us think about how you would frame that on a go-forward basis and how maybe the approach to pricing for cost and FX maybe needs to evolve, if at all, beyond 2021?"

I'm going to try and tackle it with a few different angles because there's a few things that are connected here. First, when you look at what we've said on the cost side, in our February guide, we had",691,"Yes. Alan, there's a lot wrapped up in that question. I'm going to try and tackle it with a few different angles because there's a few things that are connected here. First, when you look at what we've said on the cost side, in our February guide, we had about $90 million of negative cost, and we're now up in the $150-plus million range.
As we've gone through the first half of the year, we've continued to see that many of our raw materials from not only a cost standpoint, but from an availability standpoint, which ultimately just does drive the cost have started to increase and not slow down. This started with the wave of the commodity changes that we saw due to various issues around the world, whether it's the Texas freeze or other things in China, and that is now spread into the intermediates and the fine chemicals. So we're seeing this wave continue through the business. And we took the decision with our procurement groups and the commercial groups with what we saw coming we felt it was the most prudent way to forecast the rest of the year from a higher cost perspective.
So we see the second half of the year cost is significantly higher than the first half. We had about a $55 million cost headwind in the first half of the year. We've got approximately a $96 million to $100 million headwind in the second half.
Now you have to put that in the context of what is happening in the overall marketplace in terms of volume. If you look at our volume growth, we have increased our volume expectations for the year on the back of very good demand for our portfolio, and we're seeing that pretty much across the world. I would say the only exception is Europe from what we saw in Q2. But certainly, Latin America and North America we're seeing that volume demand. And the way our portfolio is built because of the high EBITDA margins as a drop-through, we have now taken the decision that it is actually better for us to take advantage of that robust market, go and get volume rather than get price.
Now it's not to say price is not moving, it is. We have roughly a $37 million to $40 million price advantage in the second half of the year. Most of that comes in the fourth quarter as we roll into the North American and Brazilian seasons. That's where you're going to see the most price. So you put all that together, you can see we're making some strategic decisions. We know we can take volume at high margin. So we're going to do that rather than go for the price, although we are going for price in 2 parts of the world.
The other part of your question was what does that mean for 2022? Well, it's very early right now. But think of it in this context. The way FMC manages its inventory and the cost flow-through is we have essentially, a 6-month delay in the costs hitting the P&L. So the cost that we occur in the first half impact the second half of the year, the costs that we'll incur in the second half will impact the first half of 2022. I don't see costs going down in the second half of this year. That means we are likely to have similar cost structure in the first half of next year. However, if we look at the way this curve is shaping out, it may well be that the first half of next year, the costs start to come down, and we would see the benefit in the second half of next year. So it is going to be very much a year of 2 halves. To what degree, we don't know yet. We are right at the very beginning of our budget process. So we'll have more clarity as we get into the fourth quarter on that. But that's kind of how we're thinking about this from a just a high-level flow of cost into 2022."

You look at the chart, the donut chart on Slide 13 on the far right-hand side, we've given a breakdown of our diamide sales by crop. It's very different for Cyazypyr. Cyazypyr is almost 100% fruit and vegetables at this point in time. So for Cyazypyr, which is growing very quickly. It's now just north of $300 million in 2020, it's growing well this year. I think the fruit and vegetable market for Cyazypyr has a long way to go. When you think of the size of that business, not only in Asia, but in places like Mexico, where we're growing strongly, we're seeing Cyazypyr take share.
I think the other aspect that I would highlight is that a lot of our business today is not in brand-new formulated products. It is in the active ingredients that's formulated to be used. Our partners and does now are branching out with pretty sophisticated formulations that take us into new spaces. So it's not just a crop perspective, it's the pest spectrum. For instance, our Elevest formulation in the U.S., it is Rynaxypyr plus bifentrine, which is a pyrethroid. The pyrethroid gives you a very fast knockdown of insects. So you have a different mode of action, which enhances the use of Rynaxypyr.
It's those types of activities that not only FMC is doing, but many of our partners are now formulating and getting registrations for formulations that we don't have. So think of it as the fruit and vegetable market, I would say, expansion in Asia, parts of Latin America. And then I would also say, Eastern Europe, Mid East Africa for Rynaxypyr as well. So you can tell by the way we think about this. There is an awful lot of growth left in not only how we formulate the products but the geography and the crop and the pest aspect. I hope that helps a little bit, Laurent."

So you're right. we tend to focus on Brazil, but let's be clear, we have some other large pieces of business that are growing very rapidly in Latin America, and I would single out Mexico, where we're seeing extremely strong growth on all the fruit and vegetable complex as well as on corn, not just with the diamides, but with our other herbicide products as well and as we grow -- start to grow our fungicide portfolio.
Argentina is becoming a very important country for FMC. We're well north of $200 million in revenue. Our portfolio fits very well there from an insecticide and herbicide for the soy complex. So we see Argentina growing very well. And then I singled out a couple of the Andean countries as well. They're small, but they're growing very well for us, and they're high value because it's, again, a fruit and vegetable market.
For Brazil itself, I made the comment in the script that we have over 70% of the orders in hand for the -- to deliver our full year expectations in Brazil. That's probably I would guess, about 15% more than we had at this time last year. So already, we can see that the growers themselves are much more bullish on expectations. Think about the comment that I made about the cotton growers already telling us that we're going to see a reversal in cotton makers. We're going to see approximately 15% more than we saw last year. And you look at the latest forecast, it's forecasted that for the first time, Brazil will plant more than 14 million hectares of soy. That's up 3% to 4% on the prior year. We're growing our applications on soy, especially with insecticides and strangely enough, not the diamides, our other insecticides that are very good on piercing pests such as stinkbugs.
So you put all that together, we are very bullish on Latin America. The situation feels very different to last year. Now if there is a weather issue, you know what, that's going to impact everybody. It will impact us at some point. We'll deal with that as we go through the year. But the indications are right now that the weather in Brazil and Argentina should be more normal than it was last year."

There's a couple of things there, Vincent, they are not necessarily obviously joined together. For instance, the new product sales that you see, we registered that in volume where you look at our full year chart. So it's mixed in with all the regions. It's not separated out. Those new products, essentially North America, very, very strong growth in North America. We're also seeing growth in Asia and a little bit in Europe. But I would say this season with the types of products. North America, U.S. in particular, and Australia with the herbicide launch of Overwatch.
Those new products did not influence our decision to go and get volume on other parts of the portfolio. That is occurring naturally in terms of the new product introductions. And let's remember, some of those markets, in fact, most of them are markets where we're not cannibalizing ourselves. Overwatch herbicide is a brand-new market for us. It is a serial herbicide. The first one we have. So it's a brand-new market space for us. So we're not cannibalizing. And it's not really impacting the rest of the portfolio in terms of how we think about volume demand. We have requests for volume across our portfolio, whether it is pre-emergent herbicides in the U.S., whether it is getting ready for the fungicide launches in the U.S. So it's more broad-based than the new products. I wouldn't mix them up I wouldn't mix them up like that.
And then what we have extremely high incremental value. When you look at the drop-down from a volume perspective, it's very high for us right now. So that also helps us make that decision to go get the volume."

We have about $400 million of sales this year that have come from products that we've launched over the last 3 years. So that growth algorithm is very much in place, plus the fact that those products have higher margin than our general portfolio and the products that are dropping off the other end are at a much lower margin.

These results were fundamentally driven by volume, reflecting robust demand for FMC products around the world. 
Innovation continues to be a catalyst for growth. New products introduced in the last 12 months contributed $30 million in sales growth in the quarter and our plant health products, including biologicals, posted Q2 sales growth in the high teens. We continue to expect a very strong second half of 2021, driven by robust volume growth. We have lowered our full year earnings guidance due to the continued acceleration of raw material, packaging and logistics costs. We will go into this in more details later. 
I'd like to take a moment to provide a COVID-19 update on our business. All our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and properly staffed. Our research laboratories and greenhouses also have continued to operate throughout the pandemic. We are resuming in-office operations work permitted by local authorities. And in June, we introduced flexible work arrangements to facilitate the return of all our staff to our headquarters in Philadelphia as well as some other locations in adherence with local guidelines. 
We continue to have 0 transmission of the virus in our facilities, but I want to acknowledge that we have lost employees to the pandemic, and our employees have also lost family members. Thankfully, that number of affected employees has been small. Our thoughts are with employees that have been impacted directly by COVID-19, and we are thankful for everyone who continues to work safely at FMC. 
Turning to our Q2 results on Slide 3. We reported $1.2 billion in second quarter revenue, which reflects an 8% increase on a reported basis and a 4% increase organically. Asia and Latin America posted the largest growth of 20% and 15%, respectively. Our fungicides grew over 50% in the quarter, driven by the Xyway launch in the U.S., and fungicides represented 8% of total sales in Q2 versus 5% of our sales in the prior year period. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $347 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period and $2 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. EBITDA margins were 28%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of continued and accelerating cost headwinds. Adjusted earnings were $1.81 per diluted share in the quarter, an increase of 5% versus Q2 2020 and also $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the increases in EBITDA and lower interest expense. 
Moving now to Slide 4. Despite the unfavorable weather conditions in several regions, Q2 revenue increased by 8% versus the prior year, driven by a 4% volume increase and a 4% tailwind from foreign currencies. Pricing was essentially flat year-over-year. 
Sales in Asia increased 20% year-over-year and 13% organically, driven by double-digit growth in India, Australia, Indonesia and Pakistan. Insecticides contributed the greatest growth, including Altacor for cotton, and herbicide sales were also very strong, driven by share gains in India for soybean and sugarcane applications as well as robust sales in Australia. 
In Latin America, sales increased 15% year-over-year and 12% organically. Mexico and Colombia each posted double-digit growth, driven by strength of our products on specialty crops. We also had a shift of diamide partner sales to Latin America from North America, similar to what occurred in Q1, which boosted the year-over-year growth rate. 
EMEA sales increased 3% year-over-year, but declined 3% organically as FX was a significant tailwind in the period. Diamides grew well, and we saw strong sales of herbicides for cereals and sugar beets. However, this wasn't enough to offset the late start of the spring, which resulted in lost applications for the FMC portfolio that will not be regained during the season. 
In North America, sales decreased 7% year-over-year and 8% organically. Similar to Q1, the year-over-year sales decline in Q2 was due to the shift of diamide partner sales from North America to other regions. Excluding revenue from our global diamide partnerships, our U.S. and Canada crop business grew greater than 20%, driven by an approximate $25 million contribution from 2 new products, Xyway fungicide and Vantacor insect control for specialty crops. 
Turning now to the second quarter EBITDA bridge on Slide 5. EBITDA in the quarter was up 2% year-over-year due to the volume contribution of $42 million, largely offset by a $35 million cost headwind. The cost headwind continues to be driven by increases in raw material, packaging and logistic costs and the very modest reversal of some of the temporary cost savings from 2020. Pricing was essentially flat versus prior year. 
Turning to our view of the overall market conditions for 2021. We now expect the global crop protection market will be up mid-single digits on a U.S. dollar basis, which is slightly higher than our prior forecast and the most bullish we've been on the overall market for the past few years. The reason for the change is our view that the Latin American market will now grow in the high single digits versus low single digits before. Basic crop fundamentals remain strong, especially in that region. 
We continue to anticipate mid-single-digit growth in the EMEA market, low to mid-single-digit growth in the Asian market and low single-digit growth in the North American market. 
Turning to Slide 6 and the review of FMC's full year 2021 and Q3, Q4 earnings outlook. FMC full year 2021 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.54 to $6.94 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint. This is down $0.31 at the midpoint versus our prior forecast. Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from future potential share repurchases in our EPS guidance. 
Our 2021 revenue forecast remains in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020. EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.29 billion to $1.35 billion, representing a 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. This is a $50 million reduction at the midpoint compared to our prior forecast due to continued acceleration costs for raw materials, packaging and logistics. This includes spending more to procure certain raw materials and intermediates from alternate sources where there is limited availability at our preferred suppliers. 
Despite dry and cold conditions in certain parts of Brazil during Q2, we are bullish for the second half in Latin America, especially for soybeans and cotton. In Brazil, our channel inventories are at more normal levels for this point in the season following the actions we took in Q1 this year. And we already have received nearly 70% of the orders needed to deliver our full year forecast in Brazil. 
Guidance for Q3 implies year-over-year sales growth of 8% at the midpoint on a reported basis and 7% organically. We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 5% at the midpoint versus Q3 2020, and EPS is forecasted to be up 7% year-over-year. Guidance for Q4 implies year-over-year sales growth of 20% at the midpoint on a reported basis with no FX impact anticipated. We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 35% at the midpoint versus Q4 2020, and EPS is forecasted to be up 46% year-over-year. It is worth noting that about half of this growth is going to be driven by the return of business we missed in Q4 2020 due to supply chain issues in North America and weather impact in Latin America. 
Turning to Slide 7 and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth, a 1% contribution from higher prices and a 1% benefit from FX. We continue to expect broad growth across all regions except EMEA and a very strong second half of 2021. We have raised our forecast for 2021 revenue contribution from products launched in the last 12 months to $130 million from $100 million before. This includes launches of Overwatch herbicide, Xyway fungicide as well as Vantacor and Elevest insect controls. 
Our EBITDA bridge shows an increase of about $50 million in the expected impact from costs versus our May forecast. We continue our cost control actions to limit the net cost headwind. As we stated throughout the year, the R&D spending in our forecast is what is needed to keep our projects on a critical path to commercialization. But this year-over-year increase will be closer to $20 million rather than the $30 million to $40 million we had previously indicated as we limit overall cost increases. Relative to our prior guidance bridge in May, we raised the anticipated volume contribution and lowered our benefit from pricing to reflect our decision to take volume with our high-margin portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 8, where you see the Q3 and Q4 drivers. On the revenue line for the third quarter, we are expecting a 6% contribution from volume, 1% contribution from price and 1% benefit from FX. We had a very strong revenue outlook for Q4, driven by 5 main elements. First, we forecast a strong recovery for our U.S. and Brazil businesses following the weak Q4 2020 in those countries. This contributes about half of the total growth in the quarter. 
Second, new products will be a major factor. Xyway fungicide, new diamide formulations Elevest and Vantacor, Fluindapyr fungicide for noncrop applications in the U.S., Overwatch herbicide in Australia and Authority NXT herbicide in India. 
Third, strong crop fundamentals. We expect a strong Q4 in North America and Latin America, driven by good fundamentals for a variety of crops. In Brazil, this includes cotton, as growers have indicated a 15% increase in hectares for the upcoming season. 
Fourth, improved market access and expansion into new geographies and crops. This is having a significant impact in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Eastern Europe and Russia. 
And finally, fifth, price increases will help offset the FX headwind from last year and the higher costs from raw materials this year. We are already holding orders for Brazil and U.S. that are at higher year-over-year prices. Much of our forecasted Q4 EBITDA growth will come directly from the volume and pricing growth I just described. Although we are seeing a large increase in cost in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, we are taking actions to reduce SG&A and R&D to offset a portion of the raw material and supply chain cost headwinds we are facing. 
I will now turn the call over to Andrew."

Let me start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement. FX was a stronger-than-expected tailwind to revenue growth in the quarter at 4% versus our expectations of a 1% tailwind as the U.S. dollar weakened against all major currencies relevant to FMC. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $32.6 million, down $8.1 million from the prior year period driven by the benefit of lower LIBOR rates and lower foreign debt balances. With continued low interest rates, we now expect interest expense to be between $130 million and $135 million for the full year. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the second quarter was 13.5% as anticipated and in line with our continued expectation for the full year tax rate. 
Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt at quarter end was $3.8 billion, up roughly $200 million from the prior quarter. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 3.2x at the end of the second quarter, while net debt to EBITDA was 2.6x. The difference between gross debt and net debt metric is much larger than usual this quarter as we had significant cash that we were not able to return to the United States prior to quarter end. We are exploring repatriation alternatives for this cash in the third quarter. Both levered metrics were above our targeted full year average leverage levels due to seasonality of working capital and will improve through the remainder of the year. 
Moving on to Slide 9 and cash flow and cash deployment. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $204 million, essentially flat to the prior year period. Adjusted cash from operations was lower than the prior year period, in large part due to timing changes of certain tax payments. Inventory was higher, reflecting the accelerating cost of raw materials as well as increased inventory levels, particularly of diamide, as we prepare for a very strong second half. However, the growth in inventory was offset by increased payables. 
Capital additions were somewhat higher as we continue to ramp up spending following deferral of projects last year due to COVID. Legacy and transformation spending was down substantially with the benefit of the completion of our SAP program. 
With the reduction in our outlook for full year EBITDA, we are similarly adjusting downward our expectations for free cash flow to a range of $480 million to $570 million, with the vast majority of this cash flow coming in the fourth quarter. Our outlook for adjusted cash from operations has weakened further the EBITDA, driven by somewhat higher-than-expected working capital due to shifts in timing of sales to the latter part of the second half of the year, which will shift some collections into the following year, as well as higher inventory driven partially by elevated raw material costs. Our outlook for capital additions as well as for legacy and transformation have improved slightly. 
We returned $87 million to shareholders in the quarter via $62 million in dividends and $25 million of share repurchases, buying back 212,000 shares in the quarter at an average price of $118.10 per share. Year-to-date, we've returned $224 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. For the full year, we continue to anticipate paying dividends of roughly $250 million, and now expect to repurchase a total of $350 million to $450 million of FMC shares this year, with the outlook for repurchases down slightly, reflecting the lower EBITDA guidance. 
And with that, I'll hand the call back to Mark."

Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr have grown to be al",1746,"Thank you, Andrew. Today, we'll provide an update on the progress of our diamide growth strategy. Since we launched FMC as a pure-play agricultural science company, diamides have been a core part of our business. Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr have grown to be almost 40% of FMC sales today. 
Turning to Slide 11 and some basic data on the insecticides market, which has grown by 83% from 2007 to 2019 and is approximately $17 billion in value today. Following the broad crop protection market drop in 2015, insecticides have grown 2% per year. We expect this to accelerate in the next decade to about 3.3% compound annual growth rate, as higher-value technologies take more share from older insecticides that are being phased out by regulators. We believe by 2030, the insecticide market will expand by about $7 billion versus 2019 to $24 billion in total. 
Moving to Slide 12. We show the year-by-year revenue of the major insecticide active ingredient classes from 2014 through 2019, as reported by AgbioInvestor, and the respective share gains and losses over the period. FMC diamides Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr make up well over 80% of the entire diamides class, which includes a few other smaller active ingredients. Our diamides have grown to be about 10% to 11% of the total insecticide market, and the total diamides class has gained 2% share from 2017 to 2019 to reach 13% of the total insecticide market. Conversely, organophosphates and neonicotinoids have lost overall share. 
Turning to Slide 13. We show the geographic breakdown of our $1.8 billion in diamide sales in 2020. This is all Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr sales and includes FMC sales of branded products and sales to our partners. Asia makes up nearly 40% of our diamides business today with North America a little over 1/4 of the sales and EMEA and Latin America between 15% and 20% each. FMC diamides have grown well above the market in all regions since we acquired them in 2017. On the right is the crop breakdown for our diamides. It should be no surprise that fruit and vegetables and rice make up about 50% of our current revenues. This is why the diamides are so strong in Asia, since that market is about 30% rice and 30% fruit and vegetables. 
Turning to Slide 14 and our diamides commercial strategy, which we've discussed many times over the past 2 years. We have long-term supply agreements with 5 key multinational companies, including the UPL deal we announced in March of this year. We also have 50 local agreements in various countries, and we have another 15 potential agreements currently under discussion. These agreements are helping significantly expand the market for our diamides. Our partners give us access to customers we do not currently serve. They also have access to certain active ingredients that can be formulated with our diamide to expand the market beyond what FMC has access to. 
The $1.8 billion diamide revenue in 2020 was roughly 60% through our own commercial activities, which we label as FMC branded on these charts and 40% through our global and local partners. Since we acquired these products, our diamide growth has been evenly split between FMC-branded business and sales to our partners, which demonstrates how complementary these 2 routes to market are. We've been very deliberate in driving our growth through our partnership model. The success of this model is shown by the fact that the company EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points from 2018 to 2020, even as these partners were growing significantly, confirming this strategy is not margin dilutive. 
The other aspect to having sales to partners represent $700 million of our annual revenue can add more volatility in timing of demand. As such, revenues can be impacted by shifts in partner demand across the geographies and in time periods. We have structured the contracts with partners to have extended duration. Many of the agreements go through the end of this decade and some go beyond that time frame. 
Moving to Slide 15. There are several highlights of how we have grown our FMC-branded portion of our diamide sales. New formulations, new registrations, label extensions and improved market access will drive growth not only for the diamides but for all FMC active ingredients.
Earlier this year, we launched the novel patent-pending Vantacor formulation in the U.S., which has already exceeded our original forecast. Vantacor provides a much higher concentration than prior Rynaxypyr formulation, offering improved mixing, less packaging and an improved sustainability profile. We see compelling opportunities in several crops and plan to launch Vantacor around the world, including Australia, where we have just received regulatory approval. We will continue to introduce other new mixtures and innovative formulations in all regions with 11 more launches expected by 2026.
We are also developing new products' offerings for our patented PrecisionPac and 3RIVE 3D systems, which are expected to launch during the next 5 years. Furthermore, we continue to expand our precision agricultural platform with additional services provided to growers and dealers through Arc Farm Intelligence.
Moving to Slide 16, where we provide an update on our registrations and label extension strategy for our FMC-branded diamides. A product registration from regulators is required in every country where we wish to sell, and each specific crop to be treated must be further approved by the regulators in that country. Every product use approved by regulators equals a new slice of addressable market.
Today, we have approximately 2,700 approved uses across all products based on Rynaxypyr, and 1,100 across all products based on Cyazypyr. We currently have 600 regulatory submissions under review and another 230 that we plan to submit to regulators from 2021 to 2025. We anticipate nearly 600 of these will achieve regulatory approval in the next 5 years.
Moving to Slide 17 and the diamide patent state. Rynaxypyr is covered by 21 patent families with a total of 639 granted and pending patents. Together with Cyazypyr active related patents, we have over 30 patent families and close to 1,000 granted and pending patents filed in 76 countries worldwide. Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr are complex molecules to produce. We have patented many of these steps and several of these intermediate processes patents run well past the expiration of the active ingredient composition of matter patents.
The fastest route to market for a competitor to enter the market for generic Rynaxypyr or Cyazypyr is to register their product by relying on FMC's product data. To do so, they will also be required to demonstrate that their product has the same profile as FMC's Rynaxypyr or Cyazypyr. To meet these stringent regulatory requirements for such difficult-to-manufacture molecules, the AIs will have to be made the same way we are making it, which is protected by our FMC process patents. Our patent portfolio includes extensive coverage of key intermediate chemicals, commercial and alternative manufacturing processes, mixtures and formulations. 
Slides 18 and 19 show the patent time lines for the top 5 markets. Taking into account our patents and regulatory requirements, we do not expect to see sales by a legitimate generic competitor that uses the approved manufacturing process, which would rely on our Rynaxypyr product data before 2026 in Europe, Brazil, India or in China, and 2027 for the U.S. Using that same approach for Cyazypyr on Slide 19, we do not expect to see sales by legitimate generic competitors until 2026 for Brazil, China and India, 2027 for Europe, and 2028 for the U.S. It is important to note that process and intermediate patents are critical as it is extremely difficult to produce these compounds without these intermediates.
Moving to Slide 20. We are confident that our patent portfolio is impossible. This is evident in a recent favorable injunction, restraining NATCO in India from making or selling any product containing Rynaxypyr. Notably, the court also ordered NATCO not to use our patented processes to make Rynaxypyr. We anticipate that this is the first of many successful enforcements of our diamide process patents. To date, we have enforced our patents and obtained preliminary injunctions or settlements against 6 infringers in India, and we have commenced litigation against 4 infringers in China.
Beyond patent enforcement, we've also had a variety of other successful court decisions that support our strategy. For example, we have obtained an injunction against the Brazilian regulators to respect our Rynaxypyr data exclusivity, which will postpone action on all generic Rynaxypyr applications filed while our data exclusivity was still in force. This effectively delays their registration approval by years.
In addition to our legal strategy, we have also adopted a comprehensive regulatory advocacy strategy that includes notifying regulators about companies that do not have permission to produce. As a result of these efforts, multiple countries have decided not to accept applications for registration of Rynaxypyr products prior to the active ingredients' patent expiration and others have decided to require additional data and proof of legitimate manufacturing rights in the source country as part of the application process.
So to recap on the diamides. First, the insecticide market continues to grow, and our diamides will continue to take share. Second, our partner strategy is accelerating the growth of diamides and smoothing the transition to a post-patent business later this decade. Third, our patent state is strong and will remain in place for a long time. Fourth, we are successfully defending our patents and we'll continue to enforce our IP. And fifth, diamides will continue to be a meaningful contributor to FMC's growth throughout this decade and beyond.
To conclude our prepared remarks, despite the continued headwinds from costs, we continue to deliver excellent volume growth around the world, driven by the significant success of new product introductions as well as an increasingly robust market. Our mid- to long-term growth story is firmly rooted in the strength of our current portfolio, the diamide expansion we just outlined and the significant growth we anticipate from our new product pipeline over the next decade.
As you've seen in the press release earlier this morning, we announced our target to achieve net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. This is a bold step for our company and reflects our deep commitment to sustainability.
And finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Michael Wherley for his commitment to FMC over the last 8 years and wish him great success in his next career move. I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions."

Mark, I wanted to drill in a little more on the diamide outlook. I appreciate the detailed update on the IT strategy and partnership and so forth, but would like to hear your views about the competitive landscape. What are the primary products by region or crop that you can comment on that the diamides are really down in the trends competing with? 
And the reason I ask is the biggest bucket is the neonics and the top 2 in that category are being banned by Europe. And I don't know whether you think that could spread to other regions. And then in that next big bucket is the organophosphate and the #1 in there is for pyrethroids. I mean the EPA could ban that in the next 2 weeks. And so whether that could expand as well, I would like to hear your view on that. But more importantly, what are those actions mean for the competitive landscape for your diamides?"

I think you're hitting on something that I sort of touched on in the script when I said that part of the growth of the future of the diamide is going to be how that insecticide landscape changes. And you're right, neon",268,"Yes, Steve, thanks for the question. I think you're hitting on something that I sort of touched on in the script when I said that part of the growth of the future of the diamide is going to be how that insecticide landscape changes. And you're right, neonics are under pressure, organophosphates, some of them are certainly under pressure and some of the pyrethroids as well. So when you look at those major classes of chemistry, we do believe that either the diamides as they are built today and formulated today will take share in certain parts of the world from all of those 3 classes.
But more importantly, I think the way we're going to formulate and our partners are formulating these products, I think you'll also see that accelerated market share gain against those 3 classes of chemistries. And by the way, there are other chemistries out there as well that are old. Those just happened to be the big ones.
So part of the growth is going to be that share gain and we've already seen that. You can see that the diamides are growing strongly as some of the other technologies are declining. I don't see that slowing down. In fact, for everybody that watches this space, you can see the regulatory environment is getting tougher and tougher. That bodes well for the diamides and frankly for the next set of insecticides that we will launch over the decade out of our new pipeline. So very strong growth expected. And yes, some of it will be against those different types of classes of products."

And then corollary to that is the pricing actions that you're taking, which, on a net basis, seemed a little bit more modest than you might have thought a few months ago. And really, looking back over the last couple of years, when I look at price, FX and cost, kind of all 3, FMC, that, that's still on a multiyear basis still a full negative number. So just help us think about how you would frame that on a go-forward basis and how maybe the approach to pricing for cost and FX maybe needs to evolve, if at all, beyond 2021."

There's a lot wrapped up in that question. I'm going to try and tackle it with a few different angles because there's a few things that are connected here. First, when you look at what we've said on the cost side, in our February guide,",692,"Yes. Thanks, Adam. There's a lot wrapped up in that question. I'm going to try and tackle it with a few different angles because there's a few things that are connected here. First, when you look at what we've said on the cost side, in our February guide, we had about $90 million of negative cost, and we're now up in the $150-plus million range.
As we've gone through the first half of the year, we've continued to see that many of our raw materials from not only a cost standpoint, but from an availability standpoint, which ultimately does drive the cost, have started to increase and not slow down. This started with the wave of the commodity changes that we saw due to various issues around the world, whether it's the Texas freeze or other things in China, and that has now spread into the intermediates and the fine chemicals. So we're seeing this wave continue through the business. And we took the decision with our procurement groups and the commercial groups, with what we saw coming, we felt it was the most prudent way to forecast the rest of the year from a higher-cost perspective.
So we see the second half of the year cost is significantly higher than the first half. We had about a $55 million cost headwind in the first half of the year. We've got approximately a $96 million to $100 million headwind in the second half.
Now you have to put that in the context of what is happening in the overall marketplace in terms of volume. If you look at our volume growth, we have increased our volume expectations for the year on the back of very good demand for our portfolio, and we're seeing that pretty much across the world. I would say the only exception is Europe from what we saw in Q2. But certainly, in Latin America and North America, we're seeing that volume demand. And the way our portfolio is built, because of the high EBITDA margins as a drop-through, we have now taken the decision that it is actually better for us to take advantage of that robust market, go and get volume rather than get price.
Now it's not to say price is not moving, it is. We have roughly a $37 million to $40 million price advantage in the second half of the year. Most of that comes in the fourth quarter as we roll into the North American and Brazilian seasons. That's where you're going to see the most price. So when you put all that together, you can see we're making some strategic decisions. We know we can take volume at high margin. So we're going to do that rather than go for the price, although we are going for price in 2 parts of the world.
The other part of your question was what does that mean for 2022? Well, it's very early right now. But think of it in this context. The way FMC manages its inventory and the cost flow-through is we have essentially a 6-month delay in the costs hitting the P&L. So the cost that we occur in the first half impact the second half of the year, the cost that we'll incur in the second half will impact the first half of 2022. I don't see costs going down in the second half of this year. That means we are likely to have similar cost structure in the first half of next year. However, if we look at the way this curve is shaping out, it may well be that the first half of next year, the costs start to come down and we would see the benefit in the second half of next year. So it is going to be very much a year of 2 halves. To what degree? We don't know yet. We are right at the very beginning of our budget process. So we'll have more clarity as we get into the fourth quarter on that. But that's kind of how we're thinking about this from a just a high-level flow of cost into 2022."

So if you think about Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr, you look at the chart, the doughnut chart on Slide 13 on the far right-hand side, we've given a breakdown of our diamide sales by crop. It's very different for Cyazypyr. Cyazypyr is almost 100% fruit and vegetables at this point in time. So for Cyazypyr, which is growing very quickly, it's now just north of $300 million in 2020, it's growing well this year. I think the fruit and vegetable market for Cyazypyr has a long way to go. When you think of the size of that business not only in Asia but in places like Mexico, where we're growing strongly, we're seeing Cyazypyr take share.
I think the other aspect that I would highlight is that a lot of our business today is not in brand-new formulated products, it is in the active ingredients that's formulated to be used. Our partners and us now are branching out with pretty sophisticated formulations that take us into new spaces. So it's not just a crop perspective, it's a pest spectrum. For instance, our Elevest formulation in the U.S., it is Rynaxypyr plus bifenthrin, which is a pyrethroid. The pyrethroid gives you a very fast knockdown of insects. So you have a different mode of action, which enhances the use of Rynaxypyr.
It's those types of activities that not only FMC is doing, but many of our partners are now formulating and getting registrations for formulations that we don't have. So think of it as the fruit and vegetable market, I would say, expansion in Asia, parts of Latin America, and then I would also say, Eastern Europe, Mid East, Africa for Rynaxypyr as well. So you can tell by the way we think about this. There is an awful lot of growth left in not only how we formulate the products but the geography and the crop and the pest aspect. I hope that helps a little bit, Laurent."

So you're right. We tend to focus on Brazil, but let's be clear, we have some other large pieces of business that are growing very rapidly in Latin America, and I would single out Mexico, where we're seeing extremely strong growth on all the fruit and vegetable complex as well as on corn, not just with the diamides but with our herbicide products as well and as we grow -- start to grow our fungicide portfolio.
Argentina is becoming a very important country for FMC. We're well north of $200 million in revenue. Our portfolio fits very well there from an insecticide and herbicide for the soy complex. So we see Argentina growing very well. And then I singled out a couple of the Andean countries as well. They're small, but they're growing very well for us, and they're high value because it's, again, a fruit and vegetable market.
For Brazil itself, I made the comment in the script that we have over 70% of the orders in hand for the -- to deliver our full year expectations in Brazil. That's probably I would guess about 15% more than we had at this time last year. So already, we can see that the growers themselves are much more bullish on expectations. Think about the comment that I made about the cotton growers already telling us that we're going to see a reversal in cotton makers. We're going to see approximately 15% more than we saw last year. And you look at the latest forecast, it's forecasted that for the first time, Brazil will plant more than 14 million hectares of soy. That's up 3% to 4% on the prior year. We're growing our applications on soy, especially with insecticides and strangely enough, not the diamides, our other insecticides that are very good on piercing pests such as stinkbugs.
So you put all that together, we are very bullish on Latin America. The situation feels very different to last year. Now if there is a weather issue, you know what, that's going to impact everybody. It will impact us at some point. We'll deal with that as we go through the year. But the indications are right now that the weather in Brazil and Argentina should be more normal than it was last year."

Those new products, essentially North America, very, very strong growth in North America. We're also seeing growth in Asia and a little bit in Europe. But I would say this season, with the types of products, north America, U.S. in particular, and Australia with the herbicide launch of Overwatch.
Those new products did not influence our decision to go and get volume on other parts of the portfolio. That is occurring naturally in terms of the new product introductions. And let's remember, some of those markets, in fact, most of them are markets where we're not cannibalizing ourselves. Overwatch herbicide is a brand-new market for us. It is a serial herbicide. The first one we have. So it's a brand-new market space for us. So we're not cannibalizing. And it's not really impacting the rest of the portfolio in terms of how we think about volume demand. We have requests for volume across our portfolio, whether it is pre-emergent herbicides in the U.S., whether it is getting ready for the fungicide launches in the U.S. So it's more broad-based than the new products. I wouldn't mix them up like that.
And then we have extremely high incremental value. When you look at the drop-down from a volume perspective, it's very high for us right now. So that also helps us make that decision to go get the volume."

We have about $400 million of sales this year that have come from products that we've launched over the last 3 years.

We grew our revenue by 10%, EBITDA by 12%, EPS by 17% and importantly, expanded our EBITDA margins despite continuing cost pressures. 
Performance in the quarter was driven by broad-based volume growth and price increases. New products introduced in the last 12 months continue to gain momentum, and we are now forecasting sales from these products to account for more than 1/3 of our revenue growth this year. In addition, FMC's Plant Health business had an excellent quarter with 40% year-over-year growth led by biologicals. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect a strong finish to the year, driven by high-margin volume gains and accelerated pricing actions as well as a robust global market backdrop. 
I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our operations and procurement teams for their contribution to our third quarter performance. The supply chain and logistics challenges highlighted in our last earnings call continued to disrupt ag chem and other industries around the world. FMC was able to meet the strong grower demand for our products in a timely manner. Thanks to the work of these teams. 
Let me also briefly comment on COVID-19's impact on FMC. All our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and properly staffed. Our research laboratories and greenhouses continue to be fully active, and we have resumed in-office operation in many parts of the world. FMC continues to follow all guidance given by local authorities. 
Turning to our Q3 results on Slide 3. We reported $1.2 billion in third quarter revenue, which reflects a 10% increase on a reported basis and a 9% increase organically. Growth was broad-based with 11 of our top 20 countries posting double-digit growth in the quarter. We had strong growth in all product categories, led by greater than 20% growth in herbicides. This was partially offset by registration losses in EMEA and Latin America. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $293 million, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year period and $18 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. EBITDA margins were 24.6%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by mix improvement as well as operational discipline and price increases in all regions. 
Adjusted earnings were $1.43 per diluted share in the quarter, an increase of 17% versus Q3 2020. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by an increase in EBITDA with the benefit of share repurchases and lower interest expenses, largely offset by other factors. Relative to our Q3 guidance, the $0.12 beat was driven almost entirely by EBITDA. 
Moving now to Slide 4. Sales in Asia increased 20% year-over-year and 19% organically, driven by strong diamide sales across the region as well as pricing actions. In Australia, we had a successful launch of Vantacor insect control, which is the new higher concentration formulation of Rynaxypyr active. Vantacor is applied to specialty crops such as chickpeas. 
The Australian market also benefited from positive grower sentiment, favorable weather conditions and strong insect pressure. India had another growth quarter despite an erratic monsoon, which resulted in drive spells in parts of the country. India's growth was driven by diamide sales in rice as well as continued expansion of the rest of our portfolio, leveraging our strong market presence. 
In Latin America, sales increased 11% year-over-year and 9% organically, driven by double-digit growth of insecticides in Brazil and Argentina as well as pricing actions across the region. Corn, soy and cotton were the key crops driving growth in the quarter. This is a direct result of our strategy to improve market access and increase penetration of our technologies, particularly in the Brazilian soybean market. 
Chile is another good example of this as sales nearly doubled compared to this time last year as we leveraged our enhanced market presence. Plant Health products grew approximately 50% in the region led by biologicals and seed treatment. Latin America was impacted partially by registration cancellations and rationalizations of products in the quarter. 
EMEA grew revenue 12% and 10% organically, driven by strong demand for our herbicides and diamides across the whole region despite headwinds from registration cancellations. Among others, Russia, France, Germany and The U.K. grew double digits in the quarter. Demand was especially strong for herbicide applications in cereals and oilseed South Africa double-digit sales in the period compared to the previous year, driven by the continued penetration of diamides, mainly on citrus and top roots. This is a great demonstration of the untapped potential in new markets for our diamides. 
Our U.S. and Canada branded business grew greater than 20%, driven by strong demand for our diamides and 4 herbicide applications as well as pricing actions. Vantacor had a successful introduction in the U.S., where it is used to target pest in a range of crops, including soybean, corn and cotton. 
The Vantacor launch was timely and welcomed by growers who are battling extended fall pressure from the southern markets up through the middle of the country. Overall, North America sales decreased 6% year-over-year and 6% organically due to the continued shift of diamide global partner sales in the quarter from North America to other regions as we have described in previous calls. 
Moving to Slide 5. Despite continuing supply issues across the industry, FMC's third quarter revenue increased by 10% versus prior year, driven by a 9% contribution from volume. Gross prices increased 1% in the quarter as our most recent pricing actions went into effect. 
EBITDA in the third quarter was up 12% year-over-year, primarily due to broad-based volume gains. We also had a $12 million contribution in the quarter from price increases as invoiced to customers. The benefit of our pricing action was masked in the quarter by some favorable rebate and other adjustments in the prior year period that did not repeat this quarter. 
Costs continue to be a headwind. However, the total amount incurred in the third quarter was less pronounced than previously projected, mainly due to timing. We still expect second half cost to be consistent with previous guidance and FX was a $10 million tailwind in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6. Before I review FMC's full year 2021 and Q4 earnings outlook, let me share our view of the overall market conditions. We continue to expect the global crop protection market will be up mid-single digits this year on a U.S. dollar basis. Breaking this down by region, we continue to anticipate high single-digit growth in the Latin American market, mid-single-digit growth in the EMEA market, low to mid-single-digit growth in the Asian market and low single-digit growth in the North American market. 
We are raising FMC's full year 2021 earnings guidance to the range of $6.59 to $6.99 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 10% at the midpoint, reflecting the impact of share repurchases completed year-to-date. Our 2021 revenue forecast remains in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020. EBITDA remains in the range of $1.29 billion to $1.35 billion, representing 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. 
Guidance for Q4 implies year-over-year revenue growth of 19% at the midpoint on a reported basis with no FX impact anticipated. We forecast EBITDA growth of 29% at the midpoint versus Q4 2020 and EPS is forecasted to be up 41% year-over-year. Approximately 3/4 of the EBITDA growth is driven by the return of business missed in Q4 2020 due to supply chain disruptions in North America and weather impact in Latin America. 
Turning to Slide 7 and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth, a 1% price contribution from higher prices and a 1% benefit from FX. We anticipate continued strong volume growth led by Latin America, North America and Asia. 
We have increased our forecast again for revenue from products launched in 2021. These sales now expected to contribute $140 million in year-over-year growth, up from our last forecast of $130 million and our initial view of $100 million. Pricing actions in Q3 will continue to accelerate in Q4. We will continue to raise prices across all regions going into next year. 
Despite the shift of costs from Q3 to Q4, estimates of full year cost headwinds have not changed since our detailed comments on the last call. This is why our full year outlook remains unchanged. 
Moving to Slide 8 and our fourth quarter drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from strong volume gains. In Brazil, the strength of soft commodity prices, projected increases in planted areas as well as good weather conditions are all leading to a good cadence of incoming orders and give us confidence in our expectations for a strong fourth quarter. 
In the U.S., channel inventories are normal for this time of year. Our new product launches are gaining significant traction and market sentiment supports our expectations for a robust fourth quarter. As I noted earlier, we've also moved on price increases with higher prices already in effect in the Brazilian and U.S. markets. Similar actions are underway in other countries across the globe, such as Australia, Russia, France, Mexico and Argentina, and you should expect us to continue raising prices through the year-end and well into next year. 
Cost increases are consistent with our guidance for the second half. We continue to pursue cost improvement opportunities and remain vigilant with our cost controls, all without impacting our R&D pipeline or growth trajectory.
I'll now turn the call over to Andrew."

Let me start this morning with a few highlights from the income statement. FX was a modest tailwind to revenue growth in the quarter as expected, with the U.S. dollar weaker against many key currencies, most significantly in Latin America with the strengthening of the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $33.1 million, down $2.4 million from the prior year period, driven by the benefit of lower debt balances and lower LIBOR rates. We continue to expect interest expense to be between $130 million and $135 million for the full year. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the third quarter was 13.5% as anticipated and in line with our expectation for a full year tax rate between 13% and 14%. 
Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt at quarter end was $3.4 billion, down roughly $400 million from the prior quarter. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.7x at the end of the third quarter while net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.5x. Both metrics improved sequentially. Though still slightly above our targeted full year average leverage levels, we expect to be at target leverage levels at year-end. 
Moving on to Slide 9 in cash flow and cash deployment. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $300 million. Adjusted cash from operations was lower than the prior year period, largely due to our decision to build inventory to help manage continued supply chain volatility and to be prepared to fulfill strong demand in the fourth quarter and in early 2022. 
Capital additions were somewhat higher as we continue to ramp up spending following the deferral of projects last year due to COVID. Nearly 50% of this year's capital addition support capacity expansion. Legacy and transformation spending was down substantially with the benefit of the completion of our SAP program and lower legacy spending. 
We are maintaining our expectation for free cash flow in a range of $480 million to $570 million, with continued expectations for seasonally strong cash flow in the fourth quarter. We returned $262 million to shareholders in the quarter via $62 million in dividends and $200 million of share repurchases, buying back 2.1 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $95.26 per share. We have now repurchased just over 3 million shares this year, reducing our share count by nearly 2.5% since the beginning of the year. 
Year-to-date, we've returned $486 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. For the full year, we continue to anticipate paying dividends of roughly $250 million and to repurchase $350 million to $450 million of FMC shares. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

I want to provide an early look at the key dynamics underpinning our planning process for next year. We view 2022 as another year with a good macro environment. Obviously, notwithstanding the impact weather can have on any single quarter. 
We expect that soft commodity pricing momentum will carry into next year with global demand for crops remaining healthy. As a result, we are assuming the overall crop protection market will grow in the low to mid-single-digit range next year on a U.S. dollar basis. 
FMC's growth will be driven by broad-based volume gains across our portfolio. Pricing actions reflective of cost increases, continued expansion of diamide volumes in existing and new markets and further penetration of new products and expansion of our market access in underserved geographies. 
We expect cost pressures this year will persist well into 2022 as the industry grapples with global supply-demand imbalances, structural changes in China's industrial policy and energy supply, tight ocean freight capacity and labor cost inflation. 
Taking all this into consideration, our current early thinking would suggest year-over-year revenue growth of 5% to 7%, EBITDA growth of 7% to 9% and EPS growth at over 10%, in line with our long-range plan. We will share more detailed guidance for 2022 in our February call. 
To conclude our prepared remarks, the second half of the year is playing out as we forecasted. We executed very well in the quarter, not only from an external perspective in driving demand and pricing across all regions, but also importantly, internally by fulfilling that demand with product in a timely manner under challenging supply chain conditions. The only change in the second half is a timing shift of costs, and hence, we're not changing our full year guidance. The overall crop protection market fundamentals are positive, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver our fourth quarter forecast.

When we look at the market today and some of the dynamics that we've outlined in, as we look forward to 2022, why don't I take a look at the cost elements first and just what are we seeing? I think on a raw material perspective, raw materials are still staying high. But more importantly, it's not just the cost here, it's the supply side that is causing, I would say, the most sleepless nights as we go through the end of the year. 
I think we're starting to see some of the very large commodities come back a little bit, such as propylene and ethylene, which we believe will help the pricing in packaging because we're seeing tremendous accelerations in packaging costs. I don't think that's necessarily going to help with the supply side in terms of how long it takes to get packaging. That has been a big problem for us and many other people this year. 
I think the specialty chemicals continue to be disrupted. We are obviously seeing much higher prices in that area, but we're also seeing continued disruptions out of China. I mean a lot of people hear the latest news around the energy controls that we're seeing in many of the major producing provinces. We don't see that going away, particularly quickly. There are now diesel constraints in China related to the amount of fuel they have. So that's potentially going to constrict movement of goods within China that could cause us problems as we go into next year. 
And then I think the last one really is freight. We continue to see tightness in ocean freight. I noticed a couple of the big ocean freight companies have released earnings and said don't expect that to change as we go through midyear, next year into the second half of year next year. We would agree with that. We think ocean freight is going to remain tight and availability will be somewhat softy. 
So I think the environment is pretty much what we expected with the exception of the potential for further disruption in China in Q1 as we as we go through Chinese New Year, as we go through the Winter Olympic shutdowns. We are planning for all of that, obviously. We've known about that for some time, but that doesn't mean to say there won't be disruptions. 
I think my view has changed from our August call where we talked about the potential softening of raw material prices, availability in the second half of the year. I'm somewhat less confident of that now, given how we're seeing things develop. So I'm taking a little more of a conservative view on raw materials and cost and availability as we go through our planning process. 
What does that mean for us from a demand perspective? Well, as I said in the script, demand is good. I mean no mistake, ag is pretty robust around the world. Our growth was very consistent across all regions. I think we'll see that continue next year. Soft commodity prices are robust. We see good demand for fruit and vegetables and specialty crops around the world, which, frankly, is the vast majority of our portfolio. 
On the pricing front, we have been much more aggressive in moving prices in the second half of the year. They're starting to bear fruit now. I think you've got to remember that the agricultural industry is a specialty chemical industry in general, and we certainly -- we sell on value. This is not selling propylene or ethylene where prices move quickly. 
Now there are parts of the industry like the nonselective herbicides that do move quickly. They are -- tend to be more formularic, more generic. We don't participate in those markets. However, having said that, we have put mid-single-digit price increases into many countries in the world. They have been accepted and the orders are flowing at the new levels. We will take a look in Q1 pricing again, see where raw materials are, and we will continue to move price in tandem to regain the cost impacts that we've seen over the last 12 months. That's rather a long answer to what was a long question, but hopefully you get the flavor of how we're thinking."

And then don't forget, you've got the impact of the new products that we're bringing to market. we are on a track to sell about $140 million of new product launches this year from products launched this year. They tend to be at higher margins. So that takes to -- that starts to improve your margin.

What I actually said, and I think there was some confusion here. I said there were opportunities for us to take volume around the world with our high profitability products, which we were doing. We were increasing prices then, and we're not forgoing price for volumes. I just want to be perfectly clear. 
You can see that in Q3. You can certainly see it in Q4, and you'll see it next year. Price is a very important mechanism of how we move against cost and FX. We continue to utilize that, but volume is also very important to us. 
In Brazil, taking the second piece on Brazil, there are 3 main channels to market in Brazil. First of all, there are other co-ops, which are very dominant in the south, very large farmer-owned co-ops that service the marketplace. In the North and the mid, you do have some co-ops, but you also have distribution and retail. So you have large distribution and some locally owned retail. And then third is direct to growers. That occurs really where you have very large mega growers, mainly in the Matagroso area, in Bayer, especially formulated around soy, corn and cotton. 
So those are 3 pretty big defined channels. I think you're right in your assumption and your statement that there are changes occurring in the Brazilian distribution market. There's nothing that we would say would change the way we view the market. We actually sell through all 3 different routes: direct-to-grower, distribution/retail and through the co-ops. We don't see that changing and certainly in the midterm, given that the market is so large and there is so much fragmentation, especially through the distribution and retail channels that we don't see some of the changes out there impacting our ability, either: A, to grow the portfolio with the new products we're introducing; or b, to get price in Brazil."

I think both of those pieces play out. India has had a good quarter for us. We grew in India despite the fact, and I think I've put this in the script. The monsoon was very spotty in India. There were some markets, particularly the soy market, was impacted by very dry weather. 
We are moving prices all across Asia, including India. The specialty markets in India are very good for us. The diamide portfolio continues to grow well, taking share from some of the older chemistries out there that we talked about on the last call. And I would say Southeast Asia is also very strong in terms of how we're growing. 
And then last but not least, in Asia, is Australia. Australia has been a very good market for us with the launch of our new Isoflex herbicide, but also the Vantacor insecticide, the first launch was there in Australia as well. So price is pretty much across -- I only give a couple of examples of countries, but we've moved price and are moving price pretty much in every country in the world as we move through the end of the third quarter into the fourth quarter. So you should certainly see that benefit starting to play out as we move into early next year."

There's 2 main elements, and I'll talk about them both high level and Andrew, if you want to talk about one of the pieces. You can split it 50-50 essentially. We had some SG&A and R&D expense that we thought would fall in Q3 when we originally forecasted the second half of the year, and it didn't. It's going to fall in Q4. So we're seeing about half that change really due to some R&D project work as well as some SG&A expense that we thought would hit Q3. 
And then the second half is really just how some costs have flown through our income statement. And Andrew, do you want to talk about that from a -- just a pure procurement perspective?"

And it really -- it's essentially a cost mix issue in terms of what's sold and what came out of inventory this quarter versus what we had initially modeled when we gave guidance. So that cost we are seeing in our inventory and certainly in the step-up of inventory, you see year-on-year and sequentially on our balance sheet, you can see evidence of the higher cost sitting in our inventory. It just flowed through the P&L a little more slowly than we had anticipated when we gave guidance. 
That $80 million headwind, $81 million headwind for the second half still feels like the right number for us. The things that are being spent in R&D are around a lot of field trial investments, other things that are part of supporting our long-term development pipeline. SG&A spending will be a part of supporting the sales growth and then the COGS, again, it's sitting in inventory. It just hasn't flowed through yet through the P&L. So with the strong volume growth in Q4, you'll see that."

Last year, we had very dry drought weather which impacted the industry. This year, we're not seeing any of that. I think on the back of, as you just said, very good commodity prices and a lot of people concentrate on soy and corn, but you highlighted sugar is very high, $0.19 is a good number for sugar. Coffee is high. More importantly for us, cotton is high as well. 
And if you remember earlier in the year, we talked about how we were thinking about the cotton business acreage declined in the '21 to '20 season by about 15% we're expecting and that we're seeing that coming back as we said earlier in the year, so the '22, '21 season will be very robust, price is high, demand coming back after COVID. So all of that is very positive. 
I would say don't focus just on Brazil. Argentina is also a very important market for us now. It is well in excess of $200 million. I think it's our fourth largest country now in the world. We have a good portfolio on soy and cereals in Argentina. Their market is also moving in the right direction better than it did last year. 
And then the rest of the region, not to be missed for us is Mexico. Mexico is a very important country for our specialty products on specialty crops. We do a lot of business on corn, on fruit and vegetables. There is a tremendous business for us on avocados, those types of high-value commodities. Mexico is growing well. Season is going well there. The weather conditions have been good. So yes, I would say, overall, Latin America feels much more robust than it did this time last year. And that's how we felt it would play out and so far so good."

We're not going to split out on a regular basis, the -- what we sell into the partners versus what we sell ourselves. But periodically, we'll give an update on how that's playing out, but the growth is good. 
I think you highlighted 1 area, which is the new formulations, the Vantacor launch that we put in place. This is a very, very novel formulation. It is much higher concentration. Therefore, it's easier to use. It's very easy to disperse in other mixes as growers use it. We've already seen tremendous traction in the 2 countries we've launched. There'll be more countries launched next year on Vantacor. We expect that new formulation to cannibalize and grow the market for us. So some of the old Rynaxypyr formulations will disappear, and Vantacor will continue to take that business but also grow the overall market share. And then there are some other things we have planned next year for product launches. 
So diamides continue to be successful. I think a lot of people who think about the diamides focus on Rynaxypyr. We're also seeing a lot of growth on Cyazypyr. It was launched slightly behind Rynaxypyr. It has a slightly different mode of action. It covers a different crop spectrum, and we're now starting to see that product really move on the specialty crops. We're seeing a growth -- we're seeing significant growth in Europe, parts of Asia, are really the 2 markets we're focused on. So we like the prospects for Cyazypyr. It's not to say that Rynaxypyr doesn't continue to grow, it does and it will do. But I think Cyazypyr over the next couple of years will come into its own."

We did not have a good Q4 in North America last year. So really, you'll see that lapping occurring in Q4. Now I think that -- listen, the real energy in our North American business is how we're changing the portfolio. You've heard us talk in the past a lot about our pre-emergent herbicides, the authority brands, which really were a bedrock of how we grow our North American business. 
Overall, our pre-emergent business, while still growing, is shrinking in terms of parts of the portfolio. Our business is actually accelerating because of the new products we're introducing. We introduced Lucento last year, which is a more specialty fungicide. We launched Xyway another fungicide for us, a new area. It's an in-ground fungicide for corn applications where we've never participated before. So that's a market that is a very large market. We have some very unique technology with Xyway. And in its first year, it far exceeded our expectations, and we have big growth plans for 2022 season. 
And then you have the insecticide launches, Elevest and Vantacor in the U.S., which are targeted more towards the specialty crops. So the growth you're seeing in North America is nothing to do with restocking, et cetera. It is all to do with how the portfolio is shifting and new products are accelerating our growth. So we do feel very good about what we expect next year in North America. The market itself is robust. So as you're launching products into a robust market, you should get that good growth, and we're seeing that now."

It may be in different parts of the portfolio for different people, but I think we all have inherently the same fundamental issues that we're dealing with. 
Now we do have a pretty good network around the world. Our reliance on China has dropped dramatically over the last 5 to 7 years. I think today, we're at about 45% reliant on all intermediates, fine chemicals and active ingredients. That's way, way lower than it used to be for the traditional FMC Ag business when I joined way back in 2012. 
So I think that's one aspect. We have lost sales over the last 6 months in terms of looking at the portfolio and where we couldn't deliver. But I think with a strong portfolio, we did correct our inventories as we went through this year. We have built inventories and Andrew can talk about the impact on working capital there. But I think we've tended to weather it rather well, but make no mistake, I think we've left revenue out there that somebody else has probably picked up. It's not significant. It's in the tens of millions of dollars, but it's still a business that we could have had that we've missed. So we're not immune to this by any means.

And we will continue to expand that active ingredient footwork through our own footprint, through our own operations. 
We have active ingredient manufacturing in the U.S., in Puerto Rico, in Denmark, in India. Six years ago, we never had pretty much any of that. So we really have changed our strategy to be more diverse, to have more points of manufacture. We make sure that from a registration basis, which frankly is -- it is the long pole in the tent here is getting your registrations. We do when we register -- when we manufacture new products, we make sure we have 2 or sometimes 3 different sources of manufacturing point so that we have that ability to move our manufacturing around the world based upon our registrations. 
I'm not so sure we're any different to some of the other people out there. There are some people who are more dependent on China, some people who are less. I feel good about where we are today. I don't think you're ever going to get out of China. It's impossible. Just the size of the Chinese chemical industry and the specialty chemicals that come out of there, you will always be dependent on an intermediate or a fine chemical. 
The real issue for you strategically and especially for us is how do you derisk that to a point where you're more comfortable with it. And we're getting close to that. We're not quite there yet. The next couple of years, we'll move it even further. But I think we're on the right track and certainly it's been paying dividends for us."

One is your ability to supply. And then 2 is what's happening on the demand side. On the supply side, look, I think we've got used to working in an emergency mode over the last 3 or 4 years, we've had -- as somebody just said earlier, we had explosions in China that we've had to deal with, environmental policy changes in China then we've got COVID and all the freight issues and manufacturing issues related to that. 
I don't think there's been anything in the last 6-month period since we had our last call where anything is fundamentally changed from a supply perspective. It's not that there are not issues out there, there are. The energy power issue in China is certainly causing disruption, and we'll see how that plays out once we get into the winter time. 
From a demand perspective, we don't often talk about this, but I would say, certainly, in the third quarter, maybe late in the second quarter, I would say the only part of the world where we saw demand issues was Southeast Asia. There was more lockdowns in Vietnam, parts of Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand than any other part of the world. So we did see -- we did struggle getting into the marketplaces, and we saw some demand destruction, not significant. 
Brazil, not an issue. Many of the growers are well preferred for this growing season. They have a lot of personnel on site. Vaccination rates are actually pretty high in Brazil and growing constantly. So we feel better about Brazil from a COVID perspective going into the '22 season than we did going into the '21 season. So yes, disruption is there. It's not significant at this point. I would say it's at the level where we've been dealing with it, and we'll continue to deal with it."

Look, I think you're hitting on some of the conversations we're having right now as we're going through the budgeting process. But some big stopes for you. Certainly, for free cash flow growth, '22 versus '21 million first and foremost, it's driven by growing the profitability of the business. So EBITDA growth will be a big contributor. 
Working capital, yes, our long-term vision is to drive better working capital efficiency. For 2022, we're going to have to balance that a bit with having a bit more safety stock in the system because of the level of volatility that we have in the supply chain right now. And you certainly see that on our balance sheet where we ended up at September 30 of this quarter with a big increase year-on-year on inventory, which is both, as you noted, cost inflation, but also some conscious choices to hold a little extra inventory in certain product lines where we've had some volatility in the supply chain. 
So I would say at this point, we haven't worked through all the implications for 2022 of working capital yet. But I think our long-term trajectory is, yes, to continue driving improvements in working capital to contribute to free cash flow growth. 
And if you look at the other 2 lines -- the other 2 big buckets below that, on capital additions, I think we continue to have an expectation of somewhere in that $150 million to $200 million a year being the right kind of pace, particularly with a significant portion of that going to capacity expansion to support new products. And as Mark described, with our strategy to disperse our production base and have active ingredient manufacturer, in particular the new ingredients outside of China. 
And then finally, on the legacy transformation, the transformation piece, we're basically done. We finished our SAP implementation at the beginning -- at the end of last year, a final cleanup the beginning of this year. There's no big transformation spending on the horizon, and there's no fundamental driver of growth in legacy spending. They certainly year-to-year volatility and just timing and lumpiness about some of that spend, but not fundamental growth. 
Those are the key elements. I think it's premature to give any more extensive color on where free cash flow could be other than absolutely looking to continue to push growth of free cash flow and free cash conversion as we move forward with the business."

Listen, I don't think we're seeing a fundamental shift of how distribution retail or direct growers buy. I think there is an acknowledgment out there in the marketplace that, in some cases, for products that are absolutely needed, it's not just the price. It's availability. So there's certainly a desire for people to make sure that as they enter their season, they have material available doesn't mean to say that we, FMC, we're not seeing a tremendous amount of what I would say, forward buying in Q3. All the growth was related to products that went on the ground in that quarter. So think about full herbicide applications in Europe on cereals, Same thing in North America, insect pressure in North America early in the quarter was strong. So those types of things are what are driving the growth. 
It will be interesting to see how the market evolves for the U.S. as we go into the buying season, which is effectively now getting ready for the season. I do think that recognition is strong that some materials are not going to be available in the quantities that are needed and some people are going to miss out on that. So price in certain areas is always important. But in others, where it's high value and you absolutely need to protect those crops, then yes, I do see people buying to make sure that they've got product in their channel, in their warehouse when they need it. And we'll see how that develops through the fourth quarter into the first quarter. We now see similar behavior as we go into the European season, which really kicks off in Q1."

We grew our revenue by 10%, EBITDA by 12%, EPS by 17% and importantly, expanded our EBITDA margins despite continuing cost pressures.  
Performance in the quarter was driven by broad-based volume growth and price increases. New products introduced in the last 12 months continue to gain momentum, and we are now forecasting sales from these products to account for more than 1/3 of our revenue growth this year.  
In addition, FMC's Plant Health business had an excellent quarter with 40% year-over-year growth led by biologicals.  
Looking ahead, we continue to expect a strong finish to the year, driven by high-margin volume gains and accelerated pricing actions as well as a robust global market backdrop.  
I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our operations and procurement teams for their contribution to our third quarter performance. The supply chain and logistics challenges highlighted in our last earnings call continued to disrupt ag chem and other industries around the world. FMC was able to meet the strong grower demand for our products in a timely manner. Thanks to the work of these teams.  
Let me also briefly comment on COVID-19's impact on FMC. All our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and properly staffed. Our research laboratories and greenhouses continue to be fully active, and we have resumed in-office operation in many parts of the world. FMC continues to follow all guidance given by local authorities.  
Turning to our Q3 results on Slide 3. We reported $1.2 billion in third quarter revenue, which reflects a 10% increase on a reported basis and a 9% increase organically. Growth was broad-based with 11 of our top 20 countries posting double-digit growth in the quarter. We had strong growth in all product categories, led by greater than 20% growth in herbicides. This was partially offset by registration losses in EMEA and Latin America.  
Adjusted EBITDA was $293 million, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year period and $18 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. EBITDA margins were 24.6%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by mix improvement as well as operational discipline and price increases in all regions.  
Adjusted earnings were $1.43 per diluted share in the quarter, an increase of 17% versus Q3 2020. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by an increase in EBITDA with the benefit of share repurchases and lower interest expenses, largely offset by other factors. Relative to our Q3 guidance, the $0.12 beat was driven almost entirely by EBITDA.  
Moving now to Slide 4. Sales in Asia increased 20% year-over-year and 19% organically, driven by strong diamide sales across the region as well as pricing actions. 
In Australia, we had a successful launch of Vantacor insect control, which is the new higher concentration formulation of Rynaxypyr active. Vantacor is applied to specialty crops such as chickpeas.  
The Australian market also benefited from positive grower sentiment, favorable weather conditions and strong insect pressure. India had another growth quarter despite an erratic monsoon, which resulted in drive spells in parts of the country. India's growth was driven by diamide sales in rice as well as continued expansion of the rest of our portfolio, leveraging our strong market presence.  
In Latin America, sales increased 11% year-over-year and 9% organically, driven by double-digit growth of insecticides in Brazil and Argentina as well as pricing actions across the region. Corn, soy and cotton were the key crops driving growth in the quarter. This is a direct result of our strategy to improve market access and increase penetration of our technologies, particularly in the Brazilian soybean market.  
Chile is another good example of this as sales nearly doubled compared to this time last year as we leveraged our enhanced market presence. Plant Health products grew approximately 50% in the region led by biologicals and seed treatment. Latin America was impacted partially by registration cancellations and rationalizations of products in the quarter.  
EMEA grew revenue 12% and 10% organically, driven by strong demand for our herbicides and diamides across the whole region despite headwinds from registration cancellations. Among others, Russia, France, Germany and the U.K. grew double digits in the quarter. Demand was especially strong for herbicide applications in cereals and oilsee rape. 
South Africa double-digit sales in the period compared to the previous year, driven by the continued penetration of diamides, mainly on citrus and top roots. This is a great demonstration of the untapped potential in new markets for our diamides. 
Our U.S. and Canada branded business grew greater than 20%, driven by strong demand for our diamides and 4 herbicide applications as well as pricing actions. Vantacor had a successful introduction in the U.S., where it is used to target pest in a range of crops, including soybean, corn and cotton.  
The Vantacor launch was timely and welcomed by growers who are battling extended fall [indiscernible] pressure from the southern markets up through the middle of the country. Overall, North America sales decreased 6% year-over-year and 6% organically due to the continued shift of diamide global partner sales in the quarter from North America to other regions as we have described in previous calls.  
Moving to Slide 5. Despite continuing supply issues across the industry, FMC's third quarter revenue increased by 10% versus prior year, driven by a 9% contribution from volume. Gross prices increased 1% in the quarter as our most recent pricing actions went into effect.  
EBITDA in the third quarter was up 12% year-over-year, primarily due to broad-based volume gains. We also had a $12 million contribution in the quarter from price increases as invoiced to customers. The benefit of our pricing action was masked in the quarter by some favorable rebate and other adjustments in the prior year period that did not repeat this quarter.  
Costs continue to be a headwind. However, the total amount incurred in the third quarter was less pronounced than previously projected, mainly due to timing. We still expect second half cost to be consistent with previous guidance and FX was a $10 million tailwind in the quarter.  
Turning to Slide 6. Before I review FMC's full year 2021 and Q4 earnings outlook, let me share our view of the overall market conditions. We continue to expect the global crop protection market will be up mid-single digits this year on a U.S. dollar basis. Breaking this down by region, we continue to anticipate high single-digit growth in the Latin American market, mid-single-digit growth in the EMEA market, low to mid-single-digit growth in the Asian market and low single-digit growth in the North American market.  
We are raising FMC's full year 2021 earnings guidance to the range of $6.59 to $6.99 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 10% at the midpoint, reflecting the impact of share repurchases completed year-to-date. Our 2021 revenue forecast remains in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020.  
EBITDA remains in the range of $1.29 billion to $1.35 billion, representing 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.  
Guidance for Q4 implies year-over-year revenue growth of 19% at the midpoint on a reported basis with no FX impact anticipated. We forecast EBITDA growth of 29% at the midpoint versus Q4 2020 and EPS is forecasted to be up 41% year-over-year. Approximately 3/4 of the EBITDA growth is driven by the return of business missed in Q4 2020 due to supply chain disruptions in North America and weather impact in Latin America.  
Turning to Slide 7 and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth, a 1% price contribution from higher prices and a 1% benefit from FX. We anticipate continued strong volume growth led by Latin America, North America and Asia. We have increased our forecast again for revenue from products launched in 2021. These sales are now expected to contribute $140 million in year-over-year growth, up from our last forecast of $130 million and our initial view of $100 million. Pricing actions in Q3 will continue to accelerate in Q4. We will continue to raise prices across all regions going into next year.  
Despite the shift of costs from Q3 to Q4, estimates of full year cost headwinds have not changed since our detailed comments on the last call. This is why our full year outlook remains unchanged.  
Moving to Slide 8 and our fourth quarter drivers. Revenue is expected to benefit from strong volume gains. 
In Brazil, the strength of soft commodity prices, projected increases in planted areas as well as good weather conditions are all leading to a good cadence of incoming orders and give us confidence in our expectations for a strong fourth quarter.  
In the U.S., channel inventories are normal for this time of year. our new product launches are gaining significant traction and market sentiment supports our expectations for a robust fourth quarter. 
As I noted earlier, we've also moved on price increases with higher prices already in effect in the Brazilian and U.S. markets. Similar actions are underway in other countries across the globe, such as Australia, Russia, France, Mexico and Argentina, and you should expect us to continue raising prices through the year-end and well into next year.  
Cost increases are consistent with our guidance for the second half. We continue to pursue cost improvement opportunities and remain vigilant with our cost controls, all without impacting our R&D pipeline or growth trajectory. 
I'll now turn the call over to Andrew."

FX was a modest tailwind to revenue growth in the quarter as expected. With the U.S. dollar weaker against many key currencies, most significantly in Latin America with the strengthening of the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso.  
Interest expense for the quarter was $33.1 million, down $2.4 million from the prior year period, driven by the benefit of lower debt balances and lower LIBOR rates. We continue to expect interest expense to be between $130 million and $135 million for the full year.  
Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the third quarter was 13.5% as anticipated and in line with our expectation for a full year tax rate between 13% and 14%.  
Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. Gross debt at quarter end was $3.4 billion, down roughly $400 million from the prior quarter. Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.7x at the end of the third quarter while net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.5x. Both metrics improved sequentially. 
Though still slightly above our targeted full year average leverage levels, we expect to be at target leverage levels at year-end.  
Moving on to Slide 9 in cash flow and cash deployment. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $300 million. Adjusted cash from operations was lower than the prior year period, largely due to our decision to build inventory to help manage continued supply chain volatility and to be prepared to fulfill strong demand in the fourth quarter and in early 2022.  
Capital additions were somewhat higher as we continue to ramp up spending following the deferral of projects last year due to COVID. Nearly 50% of this year's capital addition support capacity expansion. Legacy and 9ransformation spending was down substantially with the benefit of the completion of our SAP program and lower legacy spending.  
We are maintaining our expectation for free cash flow in a range of $480 million to $570 million, with continued expectations for seasonally strong cash flow in the fourth quarter. We returned $262 million to shareholders in the quarter via $62 million in dividends and $200 million of share repurchases, buying back 2.1 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $95.26 per share. We have now repurchased just over 3 million shares this year, reducing our share count by nearly 2.5% since the beginning of the year.  
Year-to-date, we've returned $486 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. For the full year, we continue to anticipate paying dividends of roughly $250 million and to repurchase $350 million to $450 million of FMC shares.  
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

I want to provide an early look at the key dynamics underpinning our planning process for next year. We view 2022 as another year with a good macro environment. Obviously, notwithstanding the impact weather can have on any single quarter.  
We expect that soft commodity pricing momentum will carry into next year with global demand for crops remaining healthy. As a result, we are assuming the overall crop protection market will grow in the low to mid-single-digit range next year on a U.S. dollar basis.  
FMC's growth will be driven by broad-based volume gains across our portfolio. Pricing actions reflective of cost increases, continued expansion of diamide volumes in existing and new markets and further penetration of new products and expansion of our market access in underserved geographies. We expect cost pressures this year will persist well into 2022 as the industry grapples with global supply-demand imbalances, structural changes in China's industrial policy and energy supply, tight ocean freight capacity and labor cost inflation.  
Taking all this into consideration, our current early thinking would suggest year-over-year revenue growth of 5% to 7%, EBITDA growth of 7% to 9% and EPS growth at over 10%, in line with our long-range plan. We will share more detailed guidance for 2022 in our February call.  
To conclude our prepared remarks, the second half of the year is playing out as we forecasted. We executed very well in the quarter, not only from an external perspective in driving demand and pricing across all regions, but also importantly, internally by fulfilling that demand with product in a timely manner under challenging supply chain conditions. The only change in the second half is a timing shift of costs, and hence, we're not changing our full year guidance.  
The overall crop protection market fundamentals are positive, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver our fourth quarter forecast.

When we look at the market today and some of the dynamics that we've outlined in, certainly as we look forward to 2022, why don't I take a look at the cost elements first and just what are we seeing? I think on a",722,"Yes. Thanks, Chris. A lot to unpack there. When we look at the market today and some of the dynamics that we've outlined in, certainly as we look forward to 2022, why don't I take a look at the cost elements first and just what are we seeing? I think on a raw material perspective, raw materials are still staying high. But more importantly, it's not just the cost here, it's the supply side that is causing, I would say, the most sleepless nights as we go through the end of the year. 
I think we're starting to see some of the very large commodities come back a little bit, such as propylene and ethylene, which we believe will help the pricing in packaging because we're seeing tremendous accelerations in packaging costs. I don't think that's necessarily going to help with the supply side in terms of how long it takes to get packaging. That has been a big problem for us and many other people this year. 
I think the specialty chemicals continue to be disrupted. We are obviously seeing much higher prices in that area, but we're also seeing continued disruptions out of China. I mean a lot of people hear the latest news around the energy controls that we're seeing in many of the major producing provinces. We don't see that going away, particularly quickly. There are now diesel constraints in China related to the amount of fuel they have. So that's potentially going to constrict movement of goods within China that could cause us problems as we go into next year. 
And then I think the last one really is freight. We continue to see tightness in ocean freight. I noticed a couple of the big ocean freight companies have released earnings and said don't expect that to change as we go through midyear, next year into the second half of year next year. We would agree with that. We think ocean freight is going to remain tight and availability will be somewhat spotty. 
So I think the environment is pretty much what we expected with the exception of the potential for further disruption in China in Q1 as we  go through Chinese New Year, as we go through the Winter Olympic shutdowns. We are planning for all of that, obviously. We've known about that for some time, but that doesn't mean to say there won't be disruptions. 
I think my view has changed from our August call where we talked about the potential softening of raw material prices, availability in the second half of the year. I'm somewhat less confident of that now, given how we're seeing things develop. So I'm taking a little more of a conservative view on raw materials and cost and availability as we go through our planning process. 
What does that mean for us from a demand perspective? Well, as I said in the script, demand is good. I mean no mistake, ag is pretty robust around the world. Our growth was very consistent across all regions. I think we'll see that continue next year. Soft commodity prices are robust. We see good demand for fruit and vegetables and specialty crops around the world, which, frankly, is the vast majority of our portfolio. 
On the pricing front, we have been much more aggressive in moving prices in the second half of the year. They're starting to bear fruit now. I think you've got to remember that the agricultural industry is a specialty chemical industry in general, and we certainly -- we sell on value. This is not selling propylene or ethylene where prices move quickly. 
Now there are parts of the industry like the nonselective herbicides that do move quickly. They are -- tend to be more formularic, more generic. We don't participate in those markets. However, having said that, we have put mid-single-digit price increases into many countries in the world. They have been accepted and the orders are flowing at the new levels. We will take a look in Q1 pricing again, see where raw materials are, and we will continue to move price in tandem to regain the cost impacts that we've seen over the last 12 months. That's rather a long answer to what was a long question, but hopefully you get the flavor of how we're thinking."

And the other question I wanted to ask was following up on Chris' question. If you look into the first half of the year or even Q1, so you had where you had a bit of margin expansion in the third quarter, and you're guiding to a little bit of margin expansion in the fourth quarter. So would we expect -- do you expect the margin expansion also in Q1 and the first half of the year?"

Yes, listen, when you look at our margins, you're right, in the second half of the year, we have started to improve the margins again. We've been on that track for the last 3 years. We do know that we're going to see higher raw material costs in the first half of next year. 
However, pricing is kicking in. And then don't forget, you've got the impact of the new products that we're bringing to market. We are on a track to sell about $140 million of new product launches this year -- from products launched this year. They tend to be at higher margins. So that takes to -- that starts to improve your margin. 
Q1 this year was a low quarter for us. So yes, I would expect Q1 margins to look a little better than they did in Q1 2020 and then continue that normal trajectory that we have of improving margins as we go through the rest of the year. 
Obviously, I'll caveat that with saying whatever happens to raw materials and the pricing balance as we go through the year. Andrew, do you want to comment on the share count and the mid year?"

What I actually said, and I think there was some confusion here. I said there were opportunities for us to take volume around the world with our high profitability products, which we were doing. We were increasing prices then, and we're not forgoing price for volumes. I just want to be perfectly clear. 
You can see that in Q3. You can certainly see it in Q4, and you'll see it next year. Price is a very important mechanism of how we move against cost and FX. We continue to utilize that, but volume is also very important to us. 
In Brazil, taking the second piece on Brazil, there are 3 main channels to market in Brazil. First of all, there are other co-ops, which are very dominant in the south, very large farmer-owned co-ops that service the marketplace. In the North and the mid, you do have some co-ops, but you also have distribution and retail. So you have large distribution and some locally owned retail. And then third is direct to growers. That occurs really where you have very large mega growers, mainly in the Matagroso area, in Bayer, especially formulated around soy, corn and cotton. 
So those are 3 pretty big defined channels. I think you're right in your assumption and your statement that there are changes occurring in the Brazilian distribution market. There's nothing that we would say would change the way we view the market. We actually sell through all 3 different routes: direct-to-grower, distribution/retail and through the co-ops. We don't see that changing and certainly in the midterm, given that the market is so large and there is so much fragmentation, especially through the distribution and retail channels that we don't see some of the changes out there impacting our ability, either: A, to grow the portfolio with the new products we're introducing; or b, to get price in Brazil."

There were some markets, particularly the soy market, was impacted by very dry weather. 
We are moving prices all across Asia, including India. The specialty markets in India are very good for us. The diamide portfolio continues to grow well, taking share from some of the older chemistries out there that we talked about on the last call. And I would say Southeast Asia is also very strong in terms of how we're growing. 
And then last but not least, in Asia, is Australia. Australia has been a very good market for us with the launch of our new Isoflex herbicide, but also the Vantacor insecticide, the first launch was there in Australia as well.

So that cost we are seeing in our inventory and certainly in the step-up of inventory, you see year-on-year and sequentially on our balance sheet, you can see evidence of the higher cost sitting in our inventory. It just flowed through the P&L a little more slowly than we had anticipated when we gave guidance. 
That $80 million headwind, $81 million headwind for the second half still feels like the right number for us. The things that are being spent in R&D are around a lot of field trial investments, other things that are part of supporting our long-term development pipeline. SG&A spending will be a part of supporting the sales growth and then the COGS, again, it's sitting in inventory. It just hasn't flowed through yet through the P&L.

Last year, we had very dry drought weather which impacted the industry. This year, we're not seeing any of that. I think on the back of, as you just said, very good commodity prices and a lot of people concentrate on soy and corn, but you highlighted sugar is very high, $0.19 is a good number for sugar. Coffee is high. More importantly for us, cotton is high as well. 
And if you remember earlier in the year, we talked about how we were thinking about the cotton business acreage declined in the '21 to '20 season by about 15% we're expecting and that we're seeing that coming back as we said earlier in the year, so the '22, '21 season will be very robust, price is high, demand coming back after COVID. So all of that is very positive. 
I would say don't focus just on Brazil. Argentina is also a very important market for us now. It is well in excess of $200 million. I think it's our fourth largest country now in the world. We have a good portfolio on soy and cereals in Argentina. Their market is also moving in the right direction better than it did last year. 
And then the rest of the region, not to be missed for us is Mexico. Mexico is a very important country for our specialty products on specialty crops. We do a lot of business on corn, on fruit and vegetables. There is a tremendous business for us on avocados, those types of high-value commodities. Mexico is growing well. Season is going well there. The weather conditions have been good. So yes, I would say, overall, Latin America feels much more robust than it did this time last year.

We're not going to split out on a regular basis, the -- what we sell into the partners versus what we sell ourselves. But periodically, we'll give an update on how that's playing out, but the growth is good. 
I think you highlighted one area, which is the new formulations, the Vantacor launch that we put in place. This is a very, very novel formulation. It is much higher concentration. Therefore, it's easier to use. It's very easy to disperse in other mixes as growers use it. We've already seen tremendous traction in the 2 countries we've launched. 
There'll be more countries launched next year on Vantacor. We expect that new formulation to cannibalize and grow the market for us. So some of the old Rynaxypyr formulations will disappear, and Vantacor will continue to take that business but also grow the overall market share. And then there are some other things we have planned next year for product launches. 
So diamides continue to be successful. I think a lot of people who think about the diamides focus on Rynaxypyr. We're also seeing a lot of growth on Cyazypyr. It was launched slightly behind Rynaxypyr. It has a slightly different mode of action. It covers a different crop spectrum, and we're now starting to see that product really move on the specialty crops. We're seeing a growth -- we're seeing significant growth in Europe, parts of Asia, are really the 2 markets we're focused on. So we like the prospects for Cyazypyr. It's not to say that Rynaxypyr doesn't continue to grow, it does and it will do. But I think Cyazypyr over the next couple of years will come into its own."

Now I think that -- listen, the real energy in our North American business is how we're changing the portfolio. You've heard us talk in the past a lot about our pre-emergent herbicides, the authority brands, which really were a bedrock of how we grow our North American business. 
Overall, our pre-emergent business, while still growing, is shrinking in terms of parts of the portfolio. Our business is actually accelerating because of the new products we're introducing. We introduced Lucento last year, which is a more specialty fungicide. We launched Xyway another fungicide for us, a new area. It's an in-ground fungicide for corn applications where we've never participated before. So that's a market that is a very large market. We have some very unique technology with Xyway. And in its first year, it far exceeded our expectations, and we have big growth plans for 2022 season. 
And then you have the insecticide launches, Elevest and Vantacor in the U.S., which are targeted more towards the specialty crops. So the growth you're seeing in North America is nothing to do with restocking, et cetera. It is all to do with how the portfolio is shifting and new products are accelerating our growth. So we do feel very good about what we expect next year in North America. The market itself is robust. So as you're launching products into a robust market, you should get that good growth, and we're seeing that now."

So in other words, your volumes don't seem to be -- have been constrained all that much despite the disruptions. So just wondering, is that a fair characterization? And also just looking for more color here. Do you think you're simply doing better than the rest of the industry? Or does this reflect maybe a more -- your more balanced geographic footprint where the challenges may have been more acute in North America? Just some more color on that. And then I had a follow-up."

And every company in the space is going through the same things. We face similar disruptions. It may be in different parts of the portfolio for different people, but I think we all have inherently the same fundamental issues that we're dealing with. 
Now we do have a pretty good network around the world. Our reliance on China has dropped dramatically over the last 5 to 7 years. I think today, we're at about 45% reliant on all intermediates, fine chemicals and active ingredients. That's way, way lower than it used to be for the traditional FMC Ag business when I joined way back in 2012. 
So I think that's one aspect. We have lost sales over the last 6 months in terms of looking at the portfolio and where we couldn't deliver. But I think with a strong portfolio, we did correct our inventories as we went through this year. We have built inventories and Andrew can talk about the impact on working capital there. 
But I think we've tended to weather it rather well, but make no mistake, I think we've left revenue out there that somebody else has probably picked up. It's not significant. It's in the tens of millions of dollars, but it's still a business that we could have had that we've missed. So we're not immune to this by any means. And I expect that to continue as we go into next year.  
Do you want to talk about -- sorry."

Now the follow-up, and you touched upon this a little bit in mentioning your dependence on China being down to 45%. It seems like you've maybe gotten a head start on this maybe relative to the broader industry based on the rolling blackouts years ago and then an active ingredient plant in China being adjacent to that explosion maybe a couple a few years ago now. So just wondering on just your thinking on strategy for supply chain going forward, would -- should we expect you'll continue to diversify further? Just what is the thinking in that regard with respect to juxtapose against your strategic growth imperatives?"

Listen, we've been on a strategy for the last at least 5 years, almost 6 years since we bought the Cheminova assets back in 2015 of really diversifying our supply chain and manufacturing footprint, that continues. For the new molecules that we're adding capacity right now, we're adding capacity in Denmark and in India. And we will continue to expand that active ingredient footwork through our own footprint, through our own operations. 
We have active ingredient manufacturing in the U.S., in Puerto Rico, in Denmark, in India. Six years ago, we never had pretty much any of that. So we really have changed our strategy to be more diverse, to have more points of manufacture. We make sure that from a registration basis, which frankly is -- it is the long pole in the tent here is getting your registrations. We do when we register -- when we manufacture new products, we make sure we have 2 or sometimes 3 different sources of manufacturing point so that we have that ability to move our manufacturing around the world based upon our registrations. 
I'm not so sure we're any different to some of the other people out there. There are some people who are more dependent on China, some people who are less. I feel good about where we are today. I don't think you're ever going to get out of China. It's impossible. Just the size of the Chinese chemical industry and the specialty chemicals that come out of there, you will always be dependent on an intermediate or a fine chemical. 
The real issue for you strategically and especially for us is how do you derisk that to a point where you're more comfortable with it. And we're getting close to that. We're not quite there yet. The next couple of years, we'll move it even further. But I think we're on the right track and certainly it's been paying dividends for us."

One is your ability to supply. And then 2 is what's happening on the demand side. On the supply side, look, I think we've got used to working in an emergency mode over the last 3 or 4 years, we've had -- as somebody just said earlier, we had explosions in China that we've had to deal with, environmental policy changes in China then we've got COVID and all the freight issues and manufacturing issues related to that. 
I don't think there's been anything in the last 6-month period since we had our last call where anything is fundamentally changed from a supply perspective. It's not that there are not issues out there, there are. The energy power issue in China is certainly causing disruption, and we'll see how that plays out once we get into the winter time. 
From a demand perspective, we don't often talk about this, but I would say, certainly, in the third quarter, maybe late in the second quarter, I would say the only part of the world where we saw demand issues was Southeast Asia. There was more lockdowns in Vietnam, parts of Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand than any other part of the world. So we did see -- we did struggle getting into the marketplaces, and we saw some demand destruction, not significant. 
Brazil, not an issue. Many of the growers are well preferred for this growing season. They have a lot of personnel on site. Vaccination rates are actually pretty high in Brazil and growing constantly. So we feel better about Brazil from a COVID perspective going into the '22 season than we did going into the '21 season. So yes, disruption is there. It's not significant at this point. I would say it's at the level where we've been dealing with it, and we'll continue to deal with it."

Look, I think you're hitting on some of the conversations we're having right now as we're going through the budgeting process. But some big stopes for you. Certainly, for free cash flow growth, '22 versus '21 million first and foremost, it's driven by growing the profitability of the business. So EBITDA growth will be a big contributor. 
Working capital, yes, our long-term vision is to drive better working capital efficiency. For 2022, we're going to have to balance that a bit with having a bit more safety stock in the system because of the level of volatility that we have in the supply chain right now. And you certainly see that on our balance sheet where we ended up at September 30 of this quarter with a big increase year-on-year on inventory, which is both, as you noted, cost inflation, but also some conscious choices to hold a little extra inventory in certain product lines where we've had some volatility in the supply chain. 
So I would say at this point, we haven't worked through all the implications for 2022 of working capital yet. But I think our long-term trajectory is, yes, to continue driving improvements in working capital to contribute to free cash flow growth. 
And if you look at the other 2 lines -- the other 2 big buckets below that, on capital additions, I think we continue to have an expectation of somewhere in that $150 million to $200 million a year being the right kind of pace, particularly with a significant portion of that going to capacity expansion to support new products. And as Mark described, with our strategy to disperse our production base and have active ingredient manufacturer, in particular the new ingredients outside of China. 
And then finally, on the legacy transformation, the transformation piece, we're basically done. We finished our SAP implementation at the beginning -- at the end of last year, a final cleanup the beginning of this year. There's no big transformation spending on the horizon, and there's no fundamental driver of growth in legacy spending. They certainly year-to-year volatility and just timing and lumpiness about some of that spend, but not fundamental growth. 
Those are the key elements. I think it's premature to give any more extensive color on where free cash flow could be other than absolutely looking to continue to push growth of free cash flow and free cash conversion as we move forward with the business."

Listen, I don't think we're seeing a fundamental shift of how distribution retail or direct growers buy. I think there is an acknowledgment out there in the marketplace that, in some cases, for products that are absolutely needed, it's not just the price. It's availability. 
So there's certainly a desire for people to make sure that as they enter their season, that they have material available doesn't mean to say that we, FMC, we're not seeing a tremendous amount of what I would say, forward buying in Q3. All the growth was related to products that went on the ground in that quarter. So think about full herbicide applications in Europe on cereals, same thing in North America, insect pressure in North America early in the quarter was strong. So those types of things are what are driving the growth. 
It will be interesting to see how the market evolves for the U.S. as we go into the buying season, which is effectively now getting ready for the season. I do think that recognition is strong that some materials are not going to be available in the quantities that are needed and some people are going to miss out on that. 
So price in certain areas is always important. But in others, where it's high value and you absolutely need to protect those crops, then yes, I do see people buying to make sure that they've got product in their channel, in their warehouse when they need it. And we'll see how that develops through the fourth quarter into the first quarter. We now see similar behavior as we go into the European season, which really kicks off in Q1."
