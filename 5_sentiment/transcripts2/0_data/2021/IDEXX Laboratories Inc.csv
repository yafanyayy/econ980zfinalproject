I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results and to provide an overview of our initial financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q4, supported by expanding global demand for Companion Animal health care. Revenue increased 19% as reported and 17% organically, driven by 21% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth sustained at high levels across U.S. and international markets through the fourth quarter, reflecting continued strong clinical visit growth trends and increased utilization of diagnostics. Flow-through operating margin benefits from high CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth supported achievement of $2.01 in EPS, which included a $0.25 nonrecurring tax benefit and $0.13 in tax benefit from stock-based compensation activity. Strong CAG growth results and proactive cost controls supported delivery of outstanding full year 2020 financial performance, above our long-term goals. 
IDEXX achieved 12% full year organic revenue growth, driven by nearly 15% gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Full year operating margins reached 25.7%, an increase of 340 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis. The combination of high revenue growth and operating margin gains supported delivery of full year EPS of $6.71 per share, an increase of 31% on a comparable constant currency basis. 
Robust CAG market trends position us for continued strong financial performance in 2021. Today, we're providing our initial outlook for full year revenue growth and key financial metrics and an expanded information table shown in our press release and snapshot. Highlights include an outlook for 11.5% to 13.5% overall organic revenue growth supported by 12% to 14.5% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Our financial outlook reflects a targeted 50 to 100 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable constant currency basis, building on strong 2020 performance. These gains are projected to support 15% to 20% comparable constant currency EPS growth, aligned with our long-term goals. We'll discuss our 2021 outlook later in my comments. 
Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and recent market trends. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 17% was driven by 21% gains in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting 21% growth in the U.S. and 22% gains in international markets. Strong overall organic growth was also supported by 13% organic gains in our LPD business and approximately $10 million or 1.5% of growth benefit from our OPTI human COVID-19 test initiatives. Overall, organic growth was moderated by pandemic related pressures, which constrained water revenue growth and contributed to a 10% year-on-year decline in IDEXX VetLab instrument revenues. 
As noted, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains sustained at high levels through the fourth quarter. CAG growth dynamics remain healthy across global markets with 20% or higher CAG diagnostic recurring organic revenue gains achieved in the North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin American regions. For the full year 2020, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth increased an impressive 15% in both U.S. and international markets. High U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains continue to be aided by strong growth in clinical visits. Overall, U.S. same-store clinical visit growth reached 8% in Q4, up from 6% growth in Q3, reflecting sustained 10% growth in wellness visits and higher 10% growth in nonwellness visits. A factor continuing to support high clinical visit gains is an increase in first-time clinical patient visits, which we estimate added 1.5% to 2% to overall clinical visit growth and 2.5% to 3% to wellness visit growth in the quarter. An increased focus on health care services, including diagnostics, supported a 12% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q4, well ahead of an improved 4% growth in overall visits to veterinary clinics in the quarter. These positive market dynamics and benefits from investments in IDEXX's commercial capability, wellness program initiatives and technology to support higher standards of care drove high Q4 and full year organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities. 
IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 19% organically in Q4 led by nearly 20% organic growth in the U.S. and mid- to high teens organic growth in international markets. Reference lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth with strong gains across testing categories, including support from high levels of wellness testing in the U.S. and benefits from the expansion of IDEXX 360 program agreements in international markets. For the full year 2020, global lab revenues increased 13% organically, reflecting mid-teen organic gains in the U.S. and approximately 10% growth overall in international markets. 
IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 25% on an organic basis in Q4, reflecting high growth across U.S. and international markets. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium installed base. These dynamics supported a 19% full year growth in IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues in 2020. 
While CAG instrument placements continue to be constrained by pandemic impacts restricting sales access to vet clinics, trends have improved solidly over the second half of 2020. In Q4, CAG instrument revenues were $3 million below strong prior year levels, representing a 10% year-over-year organic revenue decline. Overall global Catalyst placements in Q4 were 13% below strong prior year levels, which included high levels of international upgrades. While overall placement levels were constrained to a degree by the pandemic, the quality of CAG instrument placements remained high. Globally, placements at new and competitive accounts were down approximately 4% compared to strong prior year levels. These results reflected 414 Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America and 1,092 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also placed 525 second Catalysts globally to support high-growth with our customers. New placements and continued high customer retention levels drove a 13% year-on-year increase in our global Catalyst installed base. We achieved 1,224 premium hematology placements in Q4, supporting a 10% year-on-year expansion in our premium hematology installed base. We also placed 671 SediVue analyzers, bringing our global SediVue installed base to nearly 10,700 instruments, up 20% year-on-year. 
Rapid assay revenue increased 20% organically in Q4 driven by high-growth in the U.S., aligned with broader gains in demand for diagnostic testing, including robust gains in clinical wellness business. For the full year 2020, rapid assay organic revenue growth was 9%, reflecting strong volume gains for canine, 4Dx, feline and specialty testing. Overall, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven, augmented by consistent net price gains of 2% to 3%. We're planning for similar levels of net price improvement in CAG recurring revenues in 2021. 
In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 1% organically overall in the fourth quarter. Double-digit gains in recurring service revenues and solid growth in new software system placements were moderated by lower diagnostic imaging system placement levels. For the full year 2020, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 3% organically as strong gains in software services were offset by pandemic-related pressure on new imaging system placements. 
Turning to our other business segments. Water business revenues posted modest organic growth in Q4 as solid gains in compliance testing were offset by pandemic-related pressure on noncompliance-related activity. These impacts contributed to a 2% organic decline in full year 2020 Water revenues. While recent trends in our Water business have improved relatively, we're planning for uneven demand in noncompliance testing in 2021 as we continue to work through pandemic-related impacts. 
Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue increased 13% organically in Q4 driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region. Better-than-expected LPD results reflected high demand for diagnostic testing programs for African Swine Fever and gains in core swine testing volumes in China supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine herds. These gains offset lower herd health screening levels in export markets compared to strong prior year results. For the full year, LPD revenues increased 11% organically. Looking ahead to 2021, we expect to see constraints on LPD growth rates as we lap the benefits of the 2020 step-up in revenues from expanded African Swine Fever testing programs. 
Turning to the P&L. Operating profit results were very strong in Q4 reflecting flow-through from high CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains. As a reminder, prior year operating profit results were impacted by $13 million in CEO transition charges. Normalizing for these impacts, operating profits increased 43% year-on-year in Q4 on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting 460 basis points of comparable operating margin improvement. Gross profit increased 24% in the fourth quarter. Gross margins increased 210 basis points on a reported basis and 270 basis points on a constant currency basis. These results reflected productivity gains in our lab operations supported by high organic lab revenue growth as well as favorable net mix impacts from strong consumable sales and lower instrument revenues and benefits from moderate net price gains. Operating expenses in Q4 increased 4% on a reported basis and 10% on a comparable constant currency basis, excluding impacts from the 2019 CEO transition charges. 
Relatively accelerated operating expense growth reflected higher incentive compensation and health care costs as well as increased investment in R&D and enhancement of our global CAG commercial capability. We anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of OpEx growth moving forward as we support our strong global growth momentum. For the full year 2020, operating margins reached 0.7%, up 270 basis points as reported and 340 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting high CAG diagnostic revenue growth and benefit from cost controls. As highlighted in our initial guidance for 2021, we're targeting to build on this strong performance as we advance high-return investments aligned with our long-term growth strategy. 
The EPS in Q4 was $2.01 per share, including $0.25 per share in nonrecurring tax benefit and $0.13 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. For the full year 2020, EPS was $6.71, up 31% on a comparable constant currency basis. Full year EPS results also included $39 million or $0.45 per share and tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, which provided 590 basis points of effective tax rate benefit and $22 million or 330 basis points of effective tax rate benefit from the nonrecurring tax item. 
In terms of other factors impacting our reported results, foreign exchange effects have turned favorable given the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar. In Q4, FX added nearly 2% to revenue growth and $1 million to operating profit net of Q4 hedge losses of approximately $2 million. For the full year 2020, foreign exchange rates decreased EPS by $0.06 per share, net of FX hedge gains of $1 million. Free cash flow was $541 million for 2020. Free cash flow conversion was 93% of net income or 97% adjusted for our investments at our Westbrook headquarter expansion and German lab relocation which are now complete. 
Our balance sheet is in a very strong position. We ended 2020 with leverage ratios of 1.1x gross and 0.64x net of cash with $384 million in cash and no borrowings outstanding on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We didn't allocate capital to share repurchases in the fourth quarter but we have reinitiated share repurchases in Q1, reflecting confidence in our long-term growth strategy. 
Turning to our 2021 outlook. As noted, we've included a table in our press release and snapshot reflecting our initial outlook for revenue growth and other key financial metrics, recognizing that it remains a relatively dynamic environment in terms of financial forecasting. Our initial overall organic revenue growth outlook of 11.5% to 13.5% is centered on an estimated organic growth range of 12% to 14.5% for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue. As a benchmark, this recurring revenue growth outlook aligns with projections for 2% to 5% same-store U.S. clinical visit growth for the full year 2021, building on strong '20 momentum and a premium of IDEXX U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth to clinical visit growth of approximately 900 to 1,000 basis points, which is consistent with our strong growth trends heading into the pandemic. 
Our growth outlook range reflects our plans to drive continued high CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth globally while also recognizing each year-on-year comparisons to very strong 2020 growth levels in the second half of the year. In terms of overall organic growth, we factored in an estimated 1% overall growth benefit from higher CAG diagnostic capital instrument revenues, including net growth benefits from the ProCyte One launch this year. These positive impacts are expected to be moderated by tougher comparisons in our LPD business and continued COVID-related growth pressures in certain areas such as water noncompliance testing demand. Please note that given the lapping of prior year COVID impacts, there will likely be significant variability in year-on-year revenue growth rates by quarter with expectations for higher revenue growth in the first half of 2021. 
In terms of key financial metrics, as noted, we're targeting 50 to 100 basis points of annual comparable constant currency operating margin improvement in 2021. This is reflected in a reported operating margin outlook for 2021 of 27.3% to 27.8%. We're planning for continued solid momentum from gross margin gains with some moderation and benefits related to product mix impacts and increased lab staffing to support high-volume growth. Overall, we anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of OpEx growth moving forward as we support our strong growth trends. We also expect some relative year-on-year increases in costs in certain areas such as employee health care costs, claims and travel costs as pandemic-related restrictions are eased. Our outlook incorporates projection for foreign exchange to be a net positive factor in 2021 at recent exchange rates. At the exchange rate shown in our press release, we estimate FX will provide a positive 1.5% to 2% revenue growth impact in 2021 and approximately $0.14 of EPS benefit net of established hedge positions. We've included an outlook for net interest expense that assumes maintenance of a relatively consistent net leverage ratio in 2021. Given reduced share repurchase activity in 2020, we're projecting more limited year-on-year EPS growth benefit from reductions in average shares outstanding. Our 2021 outlook includes an estimated $0.09 to $0.11 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity compared to a much higher-than-anticipated $0.45 per share benefit in 2020. Our 2021 estimates reflect known option expirations and any established 10b5-1 plans. 
In terms of managing our 2021 financial performance, our focus will be on delivering strong full year results while advancing our long-term growth strategy prudently in a dynamic environment. Given the strong momentum in our CAG business, we're inclined to lean in towards high-return organic growth-oriented investments while delivering continued improvement in operating margins, aligned with our long-term goals. 
That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments."

IDEXX had a strong finish to 2020, driven by exceptional CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. Strong CAG market trends continued through Q4, enabling us to deliver outstanding full year performance with 12% overall organic growth, significant expansion of our operating margins, 31% EPS growth on a comparable constant currency basis and 55% return on invested capital. While managing through pandemic impacts, we deepened our connection with our customers, strengthened our global commercial capability and advanced key elements of our innovation agenda. These steps position us well to build on our business momentum in 2021. 
Today, I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing in our markets and some of the dynamics that are supporting the impressive growth rates we've achieved in our core business. I'll also provide an update on some of our key growth initiatives in areas of emphasis this year. Finally, I'll discuss how we plan to manage the business, aligned with our initial financial outlook in what remains a dynamic macro environment. 
Let's begin with an update on market trends. We continue to see strong growth trends in Companion Animal health care reflected in high-growth in same-store clinical visits in the U.S., higher growth in new patients and an accelerated expansion of care. We also saw sustained solid market recovery across international markets despite pandemic impacts. As Brian noted, clinical visits were up 8% overall in the U.S. in Q4, led by wellness visit growth of 10% and strong nonwellness, same-store growth of 7%. For the full year, clinical visit growth was approximately 3%, consistent with the growth we have seen in recent years, though with wide variations by quarter due to pandemic effects. 
Solid U.S. market growth trends have continued into early 2021. Market feedback from veterinarians remains consistent. Clinics are very busy with sustained high levels of demand supported by higher growth in new patients. Our market data tracking in the U.S. indicates a 10% increase in new clinical patients in 2020 versus 2019 growth of 3%, which contributed an estimated 1.5% to 2% of incremental overall same-store clinical visit growth in Q4. There continues to be evidence reinforcing robust growth in the pet population. As an indicator, we've seen a 70% year-over-year growth in IDEXX progesterone test revenue in the second half of 2020 in the U.S. as well as a significant step-up in new clinical patients with first-time pet parents. 
New patient growth has been augmented by the accelerated expansion of care. Overall revenue generated during clinical visits grew 15% per practice in the U.S. in Q4, driving 12% total revenue growth per practice. Diagnostics revenue is growing even faster at approximately 17.5% per practice in Q4 in the U.S. supporting full year 2020 same-store diagnostics revenue per practice increase of 12%, reflecting a significant step-up in growth in the second half of the year. 
We saw a clear trend of veterinarians performing more diagnostics in 2020 with average diagnostics revenue per clinical visit with diagnostics up 5% for the year. There are a number of potential drivers for this, which we've noted in recent calls. Pet owners are spending more time with pets during the pandemic. They may be more attuned to their health conditions and care. Curbside checking procedures may also be helping as pet owners preapprove diagnostic test runs as required prior to the visit, helping veterinarians and their staff to provide higher standards of care. And veterinarians continue to pivot the focus on delivering medical services as their core value proposition. 
We leveraged the strong market backdrop into even faster growth for our business, enabled by our commercial capabilities, clinical innovations and customer-friendly marketing programs. For the full year in 2020, the CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth premium compared to clinical visit growth expanded to approximately 1,200 basis points in the U.S., up from the 900 to 1,000 basis point range heading into the pandemic. This is a healthy backdrop for our business in 2021. 
We're planning to support high growth in our CAG business, recognizing there continues to be significant unknown dynamics in the marketplace and the economy as we advance to the next phase of pandemic management. We believe our initial revenue growth outlook of 11.5% to 13.5% overall organic growth and 12% to 14.5% for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth represents a reasonable planning range in this context. There is considerable momentum in the market to continue expanding utilization of pet health care, and our strategy is to work with our veterinary partners through an expanded commercial presence to raise the standard of care through adoption of our testing innovations. 
A great example of our innovation focus is ProCyte One, our next-generation hematology point-of-care instrument which is now in its final stages before product launch. ProCyte One will support a global commercial strategy by unlocking broader opportunity and reach to the customer, especially internationally. Veterinarians want chemistry and hematology diagnostics together, and they are busier than ever making diagnostic solutions delivered with a best-in-class experience, highly relevant. Field trial customers are thrilled with ProCyte One streamlined functionality in a compact footprint. 
With IDEXX 360, access to in-house hematology is easy and affordable, and our paper run and auto replenishment consumables model makes inventory and cash flow management hassle-free. Customer experience trials are proceeding well, and we anticipate beginning analyzer shipments in North America late Q1 but maybe early Q2 as we complete customer experience trials. We will fall with an international rollout beginning in Q2. Our expectation is to build volume throughout 2021. 
Presale efforts led by our commercial and marketing organizations are raising awareness of our new hematology analyzer as well as the increased appreciation of our existing world-class hematology portfolio. This is generating interest in clinic hematology solutions and driving strong hematology placements. 
Another key area of innovation leverage is urinalysis. Our commercial teams continue to raise awareness about our SediVue's enhanced capabilities now with advanced bacteria detection. Determining whether bacteria are present or not is often the most important part of sediment analysis. Bacterial UTIs are, for example, a common diagnosis that is painful for pets and could be stressful for pet owners. With SediVue's advanced bacteria detection kit, veterinarians have accessed the real-time bacteria detection of the practice, providing early visibility to the absence or presence of bacteria. Customers highly value diagnostic solutions that help them practice better medicine, in this case, allowing them to make more informed decisions within the patient window. We also saw strong interest in our SediVue platform in international markets in 2020, driving a greater than 50% increase year-over-year in our installed base outside of North America. Innovations delivered through our technology for life strategy continued to drive greater adoption for our SediVue platform. 
Innovation can take many forms. And our digital cytology offering is an example of a new personalized service enabled through imaging technology and our global team of over 100 veterinary clinical pathologists. We are pleased with the exceptional feedback and world-class customer satisfaction ratings, point-of-care digital cytology following its launch in Q1 of 2020. Customers are realizing efficiency and clinical benefits in the integrated 24/7/365 service by opening additional appointments in their schedules and enabling same-day treatment plans. Patient results are integrated with major practice management systems with VetConnect PLUS as well as being available on any iPhone or Android mobile device with the VetConnect PLUS app. It's a great example of how we uniquely support in an integrated way customer clinical and workflow needs. 
Most of the point-of-care digital cytology placements have been part of a program and almost 1/3 were combined with premium IDEXX VetLab analyzers. Many placements were important factors in attracting new business for our reference labs. With some customers, we have seen instrument placements accelerate cytology utilization and support strong revenue growth in that category. We'll continue to watch these trends closely as placements expand and more practices fully adopt the instruments into their daily workflow. 
Now let's transition to an update on our commercial accomplishments and initiatives. Our outstanding results couldn't be accomplished without disciplined commercial execution, which we have highlighted in the past as an essential pillar in our organic growth strategy. We see high returns in investments that allow us to spend more time with customers in person or virtually. As we've noted on the last call, leveraging a long history of U.S. expansions, we have made excellent progress with efforts to significantly expand our commercial footprint in 3 international country markets. We are on track to complete the expansion and have all new talent hired, trained and onboarded in the first half of this year. 
We completed our latest U.S. sales force expansion about a year ago now, and the team has ramped productivity, building customer relationships and tenure against customer access pressured from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our team's performance was exceptional, and instrument placement levels continued to improve sequentially in Q4. They remain somewhat constrained due to the restricted access to clinics and veterinary practice priorities focused on supporting high patient demand. In North America, overall premium instrument placements reached prior year levels, and Catalyst placements were up 14% year-over-year in Q4, including strong second Catalyst placements. These results were achieved while access to practices in-person visits by our customer account managers sustained at Q3 levels or 50% of in-person visits. 
In international markets, we had high levels of new and competitive Catalyst placements, almost reaching prior year levels and second Catalyst placements more than doubled prior year levels despite a modest pullback in customer account manager in-person visits in Europe. 
IDEXX 360 continues to gain significant traction in major international markets, supporting customer acquisition and placements of full VetLab suites as well as increased reference lab usage to support customer volume commitments. While we expect that sales professionals' access to veterinary clinics will likely continue to be challenged until social distancing policies and measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 are relaxed, we are very pleased with our high level of commercial execution. Our expanded global commercial resources positions us well to pursue the vast opportunities we see in international markets and advance initiatives like preventive care in the U.S. 
We continue to see tremendous customer interest in establishing and expanding preventive care as an important category of pet health care practice. The IDEXX preventive care program has never been more timely as practices implement a customer-centric preventive care program to support the high levels of wellness visit growth and the growth of puppies and kittens we see in the market. Veterinarians view preventive care as a means to both deliver better pet health care and build healthy relationships with new and existing pet owners. Program enrollments in Q4 were approximately 300 newly enrolled customers, more in line with pre-COVID run rates, bringing our total enrolled practice levels to now over 4,800. 
Our software portfolio also had an exceptional year with a record-breaking number of PIMS placements globally, and over 20% growth in North America for the full year. The expansion of our PIMS installed base and cloud-based subscription customers supported strong double-digit growth in our software and services recurring revenues. Our cloud-based solutions, in general, continue to enjoy excellent momentum. For example, we now have over 5,300 customers utilizing our IDEXX Web PACS offering, an 18% increase year-over-year. We continue to center our software strategy on our customer workflow and clinical needs. And the COVID-19 pandemic has only increased the need for cloud-based mobile-centric solutions that deliver deep data insights and tools to further elevate patient care and enable practice efficiency. Investing in high-quality workflow solutions will continue to be an area of focus for us. 
Next, I'd like to highlight the remarkable operational accomplishments of our supply chain and reference lab teams, supporting our customers in an uninterrupted fashion while keeping up with 20%-plus organic growth in our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues in the second half of 2020. Take our reference lab business, for example. Throughout 2020, not only has the team focused on keeping approximately 2,800 on-site reference lab employees at 80 global lab sites safe but did this while sharing continuity and a positive customer experience in an operating environment where transportation and logistics networks were at times highly challenged. And they didn't miss a beat opening our new Court Westland facility. It has been open since May and is operating exceptionally well. Notably, it is achieving record number of lab assessments for our European business. 
Before I conclude today's remarks, I want to highlight our efforts to make positive and lasting impacts on the communities we serve. As we announced on the last call, we recently established the IDEXX Foundation, a donor-advised charitable fund to support activities aligned with our purpose. Our mission is to create positive lasting impact for people, animals and the environment through inclusive and outcomes-focused initiatives. An area of focus that support the advancement of diversity in the veterinary profession by providing access to learning opportunities, I'm proud to share our inaugural, multiyear engagement with Tuskegee College of Veterinary Medicine, which has been recognized as the most diverse veterinary medical school in the U.S. and has educated more than 70% of the nation's African-American veterinarians. The IDEXX Tuskegee Scholars' Fund will support 9 fully funded scholarships as well as wellbeing and mental health support programs for veterinary students. We are excited about this important initiative in support of our purpose and mission. 
Before we turn to Q&A, I wish to express my gratitude and thanks to our employees for a superb year in pursuit of our purpose. 2020 was a year like we've never experienced, a disruptive year that challenged all levels of the organization. We maintained the operating rhythm in the business while responding with agility as circumstances required. The team's resilience is a testament to the purpose-driven and innovative culture at IDEXX. The organization stayed focused on serving our customers in an exceptional way while achieving a new high for employee engagement. I couldn't be prouder and more grateful for the teamwork, collaboration and professionalism that resulted in record performance in the face of unknowable challenges. 
And that concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for some questions."

If you think about what you guys said about clinical visit growth next year, other parts of the revenue bridge, things of diagnostics utilization, they're more in line with 2020 as a whole but still a little bit of a step-down sequentially just from what we're seeing in 3Q 2020, 4Q 2020, with clinical visits being up mid- to high single digits. So I'm just wondering, when we think about those components of the bridge, of the revenue bridge for next year, are you baking any conservatism in the second half? Or does this reflect a little bit of your views of something like we would refer to pre-COVID landscape, especially once the vaccines are rolled out and you go back to normal? I guess my question is sort of what are your thoughts on these COVID tailwinds we've seen in the second half of this year and how that continues next year and beyond."

And I think you're highlighting the key question, which is sort of the  comparison in the second half, there was a step-up in the growth rate and driven by a number of factors, more pets, more testing, some pent-up demand that they've carried over from the early COVID impact. So I think we're just recognizing that there will be some year-over-year compare dynamics that go on that we'll learn more about as we go into the year.

So we've noted things like international commercial expansion as an area that we want to lean in. We want to continue to support our R&D agenda, and so the number of areas that are all aligned with our organic growth strategy that we're intending to support it, and that's reflected in our intent to have moderate operating margin gains on top of very strong performance.

I would just think at a high level, the premium would be more in your control with the increased commercial investments, the innovation driving utilizations versus that and trying to sort of guesstimate how the underlying clinical visit shakes out.

So if you think about the preventive care program that we have 4,800-plus customers enroll in that, that's a great example of a driver of medical services and, in turn, diagnostics usage. So our programs are geared towards driving education and adoption of both wellness and nonwellness type care and testing. So we think we're very aligned, and we think it's a trend that we can sustain, and that's the plan to be able to do that. 
So I think that's the last question. I want to thank everybody for calling in. I know we have some employees who are also on the call. And I just want to express my gratitude for their extraordinary performance during these challenging times. We run the company in a way that takes a long-term view of the opportunities ahead of us while still delivering today. I couldn't be more appreciative of the IDEXX team and the purpose, which animates our work. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you."

I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results and to provide an overview of our initial financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q4, supported by expanding global demand for Companion Animal health care. Revenue increased 19% as reported and 17% organically, driven by 21% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. 
CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth sustained at high levels across U.S. and international markets through the fourth quarter, reflecting continued strong clinical visit growth trends and increased utilization of diagnostics. 
Flow-through operating margin benefits from high CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth supported achievement of $2.01 in EPS, which included a $0.25 nonrecurring tax benefit and $0.13 in tax benefit from stock-based compensation activity. Strong CAG growth results and proactive cost controls supported delivery of outstanding full year 2020 financial performance, above our long-term goals. 
IDEXX achieved 12% full year organic revenue growth, driven by nearly 15% gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Full year operating margins reached 25.7%, an increase of 340 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis. The combination of high revenue growth and operating margin gains supported delivery of full year EPS of $6.71 per share, an increase of 31% on a comparable constant currency basis. 
Robust CAG market trends position us for continued strong financial performance in 2021. Today, we're providing our initial outlook for full year revenue growth and key financial metrics and an expanded information table shown in our press release and snapshot. Highlights include an outlook for 11.5% to 13.5% overall organic revenue growth, supported by 12% to 14.5% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. 
Our financial outlook reflects a target of 50 to 100 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable constant currency basis, building on strong 2020 performance. These gains are projected to support 15% to 20% comparable constant currency EPS growth, aligned with our long-term goals. We'll discuss our 2021 outlook later in my comments. 
Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and recent market trends. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 17% was driven by 21% gains in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting 21% growth in the U.S. and 22% gains in international markets. 
Strong overall organic growth was also supported by 13% organic gains in our LPD business and approximately $10 million or 1.5% of growth benefit from our OPTI human COVID-19 test initiatives. Overall, organic growth was moderated by pandemic related pressures, which constrained water revenue growth and contributed to a 10% year-on-year decline in IDEXX VetLab instrument revenues. 
As noted, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains sustained at high levels through the fourth quarter. CAG growth dynamics remain healthy across global markets with 20% or higher CAG diagnostic recurring organic revenue gains achieved in the North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin American regions. 
For the full year 2020, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth increased an impressive 15% in both U.S. and international markets. High U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains continue to be aided by strong growth in clinical visits. Overall, U.S. same-store clinical visit growth reached 8% in Q4, up from 6% growth in Q3, reflecting sustained 10% growth in wellness visits and higher 10% growth in non-wellness visits. 
A factor continuing to support high clinical visit gains is an increase in first-time clinical patient visits, which we estimate added 1.5% to 2% to overall clinical visit growth and 2.5% to 3% to wellness visit growth in the quarter. An increased focus on health care services, including diagnostics, supported a 12% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q4, well ahead of an improved 4% growth in overall visits to veterinary clinics in the quarter. 
These positive market dynamics and benefits from investments in IDEXX's commercial capability, wellness program initiatives and technology to support higher standards of care drove high Q4 and full year organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities. 
IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 19% organically in Q4 led by nearly 20% organic growth in the U.S. and mid- to high teens organic growth in international markets. Reference lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth with strong gains across testing categories, including support from high levels of wellness testing in the U.S. and benefits from the expansion of IDEXX 360 program agreements in international markets. For the full year 2020, global lab revenues increased 13% organically, reflecting mid-teen organic gains in the U.S. and approximately 10% growth overall in international markets. 
IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 25% on an organic basis in Q4, reflecting high growth across U.S. and international markets. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium installed base. These dynamics supported a 19% full year growth in IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues in 2020. 
While CAG instrument placements continue to be constrained by pandemic impacts restricting sales access to vet clinics, trends have improved solidly over the second half of 2020. In Q4, CAG instrument revenues were $3 million below strong prior year levels, representing a 10% year-over-year organic revenue decline. 
Overall global Catalyst placements in Q4 were 13% below strong prior year levels, which included high levels of international upgrades. While overall placement levels were constrained to a degree by the pandemic, the quality of CAG instrument placements remained high. Globally, placements at new and competitive accounts were down approximately 4% compared to strong prior year levels. 
These results reflected 414 Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America and 1,092 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also placed 525 second Catalysts globally to support high growth with our customers. New placements and continued high customer retention levels drove a 13% year-on-year increase in our global Catalyst installed base. We achieved 1,224 premium hematology placements in Q4, supporting a 10% year-on-year expansion in our premium hematology installed base. We also placed 671 SediVue analyzers, bringing our global SediVue installed base to nearly 10,700 instruments, up 20% year-on-year. 
Rapid assay revenue increased 20% organically in Q4 driven by high-growth in the U.S., aligned with broader gains in demand for diagnostic testing, including robust gains in clinical wellness business. For the full year 2020, rapid assay organic revenue growth was 9%, reflecting strong volume gains for canine, 4Dx, feline and specialty testing. Overall, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven, augmented by consistent net price gains of 2% to 3%. We're planning for similar levels of net price improvement in CAG recurring revenues in 2021. 
In other areas of our CAG business. Our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 1% organically overall in the fourth quarter. Double-digit gains in recurring service revenues and solid growth in new software system placements were moderated by lower diagnostic imaging system placement levels. For the full year 2020, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 3% organically as strong gains in software services were offset by pandemic-related pressure on new imaging system placements. 
Turning to our other business segments. Water business revenues posted modest organic growth in Q4 as solid gains in compliance testing were offset by pandemic-related pressure on noncompliance-related activity. These impacts contributed to a 2% organic decline in full year 2020 Water revenues. While recent trends in our Water business have improved relatively, we're planning for uneven demand in noncompliance testing in 2021 as we continue to work through pandemic-related impacts. 
Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue increased 13% organically in Q4 driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region. Better-than-expected LPD results reflected high demand for diagnostic testing programs for African Swine Fever and gains in core swine testing volumes in China, supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine herds. 
These gains offset lower herd health screening levels in export markets compared to strong prior year results. For the full year, LPD revenues increased 11% organically. Looking ahead to 2021, we expect to see constraints on LPD growth rates as we lap the benefits of the 2020 step-up in revenues from expanded African Swine Fever testing programs. 
Turning to the P&L. Operating profit results were very strong in Q4, reflecting flow-through from high CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains. As a reminder, prior year operating profit results were impacted by $13 million in CEO transition charges. Normalizing for these impacts, operating profits increased 43% year-on-year in Q4 on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting 460 basis points of comparable operating margin improvement. 
Gross profit increased 24% in the fourth quarter. Gross margins increased 210 basis points on a reported basis and 270 basis points on a constant currency basis. These results reflected productivity gains in our lab operations supported by high organic lab revenue growth as well as favorable net mix impacts from strong consumable sales and lower instrument revenues and benefits from moderate net price gains. Operating expenses in Q4 increased 4% on a reported basis and 10% on a comparable constant currency basis, excluding impacts from the 2019 CEO transition charges. 
Relatively accelerated operating expense growth reflected higher incentive compensation and health care costs as well as increased investment in R&D and enhancement of our global CAG commercial capability. We anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of OpEx growth moving forward as we support our strong global growth momentum. For the full year 2020, operating margins reached 25.7%, up 270 basis points as reported and 340 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting high CAG diagnostic revenue growth and benefit from cost controls. As highlighted in our initial guidance for 2021, we're targeting to build on this strong performance as we advance high-return investments aligned with our long-term growth strategy. 
The EPS in Q4 was $2.01 per share, including $0.25 per share in nonrecurring tax benefit and $0.13 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. For the full year 2020, EPS was $6.71, up 31% on a comparable constant currency basis. Full year EPS results also included $39 million or $0.45 per share and tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, which provided 590 basis points of effective tax rate benefit and $22 million or 330 basis points of effective tax rate benefit from the nonrecurring tax item. 
In terms of other factors impacting our reported results. Foreign exchange effects have turned favorable given the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar. In Q4, FX added nearly 2% to revenue growth and $1 million to operating profit, net of Q4 hedge losses of approximately $2 million. For the full year 2020, foreign exchange rates decreased EPS by $0.06 per share, net of FX hedge gains of $1 million. Free cash flow was $541 million for 2020. Free cash flow conversion was 93% of net income or 97% adjusted for our investments at our Westbrook headquarter expansion and German lab relocation, which are now complete. 
Our balance sheet is in a very strong position. We ended 2020 with leverage ratios of 1.1x gross and 0.64x net of cash with $384 million in cash and no borrowings outstanding on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We didn't allocate capital to share repurchases in the fourth quarter but we have reinitiated share repurchases in Q1, reflecting confidence in our long-term growth strategy. 
Turning to our 2021 outlook. As noted, we've included a table in our press release and snapshot reflecting our initial outlook for revenue growth and other key financial metrics, recognizing that it remains a relatively dynamic environment in terms of financial forecasting. Our initial overall organic revenue growth outlook of 11.5% to 13.5% is centered on an estimated organic growth range of 12% to 14.5% for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue. 
As a benchmark, this recurring revenue growth outlook aligns with projections for 2% to 5% same-store U.S. clinical visit growth for the full year 2021, building on strong '20 momentum and a premium of IDEXX U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth to clinical visit growth of approximately 900 to 1,000 basis points, which is consistent with our strong growth trends heading into the pandemic. 
Our growth outlook range reflects our plans to drive continued high CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth globally while also recognizing each year-on-year comparisons to very strong 2020 growth levels in the second half of the year. In terms of overall organic growth, we factored in an estimated 1% overall growth benefit from higher CAG diagnostic capital instrument revenues, including net growth benefits from the ProCyte One launch this year. These positive impacts are expected to be moderated by tougher comparisons in our LPD business and continued COVID-related growth pressures in certain areas such as water noncompliance testing demand. 
Please note that given the lapping of prior year COVID impacts, there will likely be significant variability in year-on-year revenue growth rates by quarter with expectations for higher revenue growth in the first half of 2021. 
In terms of key financial metrics. As noted, we're targeting 50 to 100 basis points of annual comparable constant currency operating margin improvement in 2021. This is reflected in a reported operating margin outlook for 2021 of 27.3% to 27.8%. We're planning for continued solid momentum from gross margin gains with some moderation and benefits related to product mix impacts and increased lab staffing to support high-volume growth. Overall, we anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of OpEx growth moving forward as we support our strong growth trends. 
We also expect some relative year-on-year increases in costs in certain areas such as employee health care costs, claims and travel costs as pandemic-related restrictions are eased. Our outlook incorporates projection for foreign exchange to be a net positive factor in 2021 at recent exchange rates. At the exchange rate shown in our press release, we estimate FX will provide a positive 1.5% to 2% revenue growth impact in 2021 and approximately $0.14 of EPS benefit, net of established hedge positions. We've included an outlook for net interest expense that assumes maintenance of a relatively consistent net leverage ratio in 2021. 
Given reduced share repurchase activity in 2020, we're projecting more limited year-on-year EPS growth benefit from reductions in average shares outstanding. Our 2021 outlook includes an estimated $0.09 to $0.11 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity compared to a much higher-than-anticipated $0.45 per share benefit in 2020. Our 2021 estimates reflect known option expirations and any established 10b5-1 plans. 
In terms of managing our 2021 financial performance. Our focus will be on delivering strong full year results while advancing our long-term growth strategy prudently in a dynamic environment. Given the strong momentum in our CAG business, we're inclined to lean in towards high-return organic growth-oriented investments while delivering continued improvement in operating margins, aligned with our long-term goals. 
That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments."

IDEXX had a strong finish to 2020, driven by exceptional CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. Strong CAG market trends continued through Q4, enabling us to deliver outstanding full year performance with 12% overall organic growth, significant expansion of our operating margins, 31% EPS growth on a comparable constant currency basis and 55% return on invested capital. While managing through pandemic impacts, we deepened our connection with our customers, strengthened our global commercial capability and advanced key elements of our innovation agenda. These steps position us well to build on our business momentum in 2021. 
Today, I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing in our markets and some of the dynamics that are supporting the impressive growth rates we've achieved in our core business. I'll also provide an update on some of our key growth initiatives in areas of emphasis this year. Finally, I'll discuss how we plan to manage the business, aligned with our initial financial outlook in what remains a dynamic macro environment. 
Let's begin with an update on market trends. We continue to see strong growth trends in Companion Animal health care reflected in high-growth in same-store clinical visits in the U.S., higher growth in new patients and an accelerated expansion of care. We also saw sustained solid market recovery across international markets despite pandemic impacts. As Brian noted, clinical visits were up 8% overall in the U.S. in Q4, led by wellness visit growth of 10% and strong nonwellness, same-store growth of 7%. For the full year, clinical visit growth was approximately 3%, consistent with the growth we have seen in recent years, though with wide variations by quarter due to pandemic effects. 
Solid U.S. market growth trends have continued into early 2021. Market feedback from veterinarians remains consistent. Clinics are very busy with sustained high levels of demand supported by higher growth in new patients. Our market data tracking in the U.S. indicates a 10% increase in new clinical patients in 2020 versus 2019 growth of 3%, which contributed an estimated 1.5% to 2% of incremental overall same-store clinical visit growth in Q4. 
There continues to be evidence reinforcing robust growth in the pet population. As an indicator, we've seen a 70% year-over-year growth in IDEXX progesterone test revenue in the second half of 2020 in the U.S. as well as a significant step-up in new clinical patients with first-time pet parents. 
New patient growth has been augmented by the accelerated expansion of care. Overall revenue generated during clinical visits grew 15% per practice in the U.S. in Q4, driving 12% total revenue growth per practice. Diagnostics revenue is growing even faster at approximately 17.5% per practice in Q4 in the U.S., supporting full year 2020 same-store diagnostics revenue per practice increase of 12%, reflecting a significant step-up in growth in the second half of the year. 
We saw a clear trend of veterinarians performing more diagnostics in 2020 with average diagnostics revenue per clinical visit with diagnostics, up 5% for the year. There are a number of potential drivers for this, which we've noted in recent calls. Pet owners are spending more time with pets during the pandemic. They may be more attuned to their health conditions and care. Curbside check-in procedures may also be helping as pet owners preapprove diagnostic test runs as required prior to the visit, helping veterinarians and their staff to provide higher standards of care. And veterinarians continue to pivot the focus on delivering medical services as their core value proposition. 
We leveraged the strong market backdrop into even faster growth for our business, enabled by our commercial capabilities, clinical innovations and customer-friendly marketing programs. For the full year in 2020, the CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth premium compared to clinical visit growth expanded to approximately 1,200 basis points in the U.S., up from the 900 to 1,000 basis point range heading into the pandemic. This is a healthy backdrop for our business in 2021. 
We're planning to support high growth in our CAG business, recognizing there continues to be significant unknown dynamics in the marketplace and the economy as we advance to the next phase of pandemic management. We believe our initial revenue growth outlook of 11.5% to 13.5% overall organic growth and 12% to 14.5% for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth represents a reasonable planning range in this context. 
There is considerable momentum in the market to continue expanding utilization of pet health care, and our strategy is to work with our veterinary partners through an expanded commercial presence to raise the standard of care through adoption of our testing innovations. 
A great example of our innovation focus is ProCyte One, our next-generation hematology point-of-care instrument, which is now in its final stages before product launch. ProCyte One will support our global commercial strategy by unlocking broader opportunity and reach to the customer, especially internationally. Veterinarians want chemistry and hematology diagnostics together, and they are busier than ever making diagnostic solutions delivered with a best-in-class experience, highly relevant. Field trial customers are thrilled with ProCyte One streamlined functionality in a compact footprint. 
With IDEXX 360, access to in-house hematology is easy and affordable, and our paper run and auto replenishment consumables model makes inventory and cash flow management hassle-free. Customer experience trials are proceeding well, and we anticipate beginning analyzer shipments in North America late Q1 but maybe early Q2 as we complete customer experience trials. We will fall with an international rollout beginning in Q2. Our expectation is to build volume throughout 2021. 
Presale efforts led by our commercial and marketing organizations are raising awareness of our new hematology analyzer as well as the increased appreciation of our existing world-class hematology portfolio. This is generating interest in in-clinic hematology solutions and driving strong hematology placements. 
Another key area of innovation leverage is urinalysis. Our commercial teams continue to raise awareness about our SediVue's enhanced capabilities now with advanced bacteria detection. Determining whether bacteria are present or not is often the most important part of sediment analysis. Bacterial UTIs are, for example, a common diagnosis that is painful for pets and could be stressful for pet owners. With SediVue's advanced bacteria detection kit, veterinarians have access to real-time bacteria detection of the practice, providing early visibility to the absence or presence of bacteria. 
Customers highly value diagnostic solutions that help them practice better medicine, in this case, allowing them to make more informed decisions within the patient window. We also saw strong interest in our SediVue platform in international markets in 2020, driving a greater than 50% increase year-over-year in our installed base outside of North America. Innovations delivered through our technology for life strategy continued to drive greater adoption for our SediVue platform. 
Innovation can take many forms. And our digital cytology offering is an example of a new personalized service enabled through imaging technology and our global team of over 100 veterinary clinical pathologists. We are pleased with the exceptional feedback and world-class customer satisfaction ratings, point-of-care digital cytology following its launch in Q1 of 2020. Customers are realizing efficiency and clinical benefits in the integrated 24/7/365 service by opening additional appointments in their schedules and enabling same-day treatment plans. 
Patient results are integrated with major practice management systems with VetConnect PLUS as well as being available on any iPhone or Android mobile device with the VetConnect PLUS app. It's a great example of how we uniquely support in an integrated way customer clinical and workflow needs. 
Most of the point-of-care digital cytology placements have been part of a program and almost 1/3 were combined with premium IDEXX VetLab analyzers. Many placements were important factors in attracting new business for our reference labs. With some customers, we have seen instrument placements accelerate cytology utilization and support strong revenue growth in that category. We'll continue to watch these trends closely as placements expand and more practices fully adopt the instruments into their daily workflow. 
Now let's transition to an update on our commercial accomplishments and initiatives. Our outstanding results couldn't be accomplished without disciplined commercial execution, which we have highlighted in the past as an essential pillar in our organic growth strategy. We see high returns in investments that allow us to spend more time with customers in person or virtually. 
As we've noted on the last call, leveraging a long history of U.S. expansions, we have made excellent progress with efforts to significantly expand our commercial footprint in 3 international country markets. We are on track to complete the expansion and have all new talent hired, trained and onboarded in the first half of this year. 
We completed our latest U.S. sales force expansion about a year ago now, and the team has ramped productivity, building customer relationships and tenure against customer access pressured from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our team's performance was exceptional, and instrument placement levels continued to improve sequentially in Q4. 
They remain somewhat constrained due to the restricted access to clinics and veterinary practice priorities focused on supporting high patient demand. In North America, overall premium instrument placements reached prior year levels, and Catalyst placements were up 14% year-over-year in Q4, including strong second Catalyst placements. These results were achieved while access to practices in-person visits by our customer account managers sustained at Q3 levels or 50% of in-person visits. 
In international markets, we had high levels of new and competitive Catalyst placements, almost reaching prior year levels and second Catalyst placements more than doubled prior year levels despite a modest pullback in customer account manager in-person visits in Europe. 
IDEXX 360 continues to gain significant traction in major international markets, supporting customer acquisition and placements of full VetLab suites as well as increased reference lab usage to support customer volume commitments. While we expect that sales professionals' access to veterinary clinics will likely continue to be challenged until social distancing policies and measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 are relaxed, we are very pleased with our high level of commercial execution. 
Our expanded global commercial resources positions us well to pursue the vast opportunities we see in international markets and advance initiatives like preventive care in the U.S. We continue to see tremendous customer interest in establishing and expanding preventive care as an important category of pet health care practice. 
The IDEXX preventive care program has never been more timely as practices implement a customer-centric preventive care program to support the high levels of wellness visit growth and the growth of puppies and kittens we see in the market. Veterinarians view preventive care as a means to both deliver better pet health care and build healthy relationships with new and existing pet owners. Program enrollments in Q4 were approximately 300 newly enrolled customers, more in line with pre-COVID run rates, bringing our total enrolled practice levels to now over 4,800. 
Our software portfolio also had an exceptional year with a record-breaking number of PIMS placements globally, and over 20% growth in North America for the full year. The expansion of our PIMS installed base and cloud-based subscription customers supported strong double-digit growth in our software and services recurring revenues. Our cloud-based solutions, in general, continue to enjoy excellent momentum. 
For example, we now have over 5,300 customers utilizing our IDEXX Web PACS offering, an 18% increase year-over-year. We continue to center our software strategy on our customer workflow and clinical needs. And the COVID-19 pandemic has only increased the need for cloud-based mobile-centric solutions that deliver deep data insights and tools to further elevate patient care and enable practice efficiency. Investing in high-quality workflow solutions will continue to be an area of focus for us. 
Next, I'd like to highlight the remarkable operational accomplishments of our supply chain and reference lab teams, supporting our customers in an uninterrupted fashion while keeping up with 20%-plus organic growth in our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues in the second half of 2020. Take our reference lab business, for example. Throughout 2020, not only has the team focused on keeping approximately 2,800 on-site reference lab employees at 80 global lab sites safe, but did this while sharing continuity and a positive customer experience in an operating environment where transportation and logistics networks were, at times, highly challenged. And they didn't miss a beat opening our new Court Westheimer facility. It has been open since May and is operating exceptionally well. Notably, it is achieving record number of lab assessments for our European business. 
Before I conclude today's remarks, I want to highlight our efforts to make positive and lasting impacts on the communities we serve. As we announced on the last call, we recently established the IDEXX Foundation, a donor-advised charitable fund to support activities aligned with our purpose. Our mission is to create positive lasting impact for people, animals and the environment through inclusive and outcomes-focused initiatives. 
An area of focus that support the advancement of diversity in the veterinary profession by providing access to learning opportunities. I'm proud to share our inaugural, multiyear engagement with Tuskegee College of Veterinary Medicine, which has been recognized as the most diverse veterinary medical school in the U.S. and has educated more than 70% of the nation's African-American veterinarians. 
The IDEXX Tuskegee Scholars Fund will support 9 fully funded scholarships as well as wellbeing and mental health support programs for veterinary students. We are excited about this important initiative in support of our purpose and mission. 
Before we turn to Q&A, I wish to express my gratitude and thanks to our employees for a superb year in pursuit of our purpose. 2020 was a year like we've never experienced, a disruptive year that challenged all levels of the organization. We maintained the operating rhythm in the business while responding with agility as circumstances required.

I want to start with your comments on the guide and sort of the outlook going forward because I think that's where we had the most feedback from investors and where most of the attention is. If you think about what you guys said about clinical visit growth next year, other parts of the revenue bridge, things of diagnostics utilization, they're more in line with 2020 as a whole but still a little bit of a step-down sequentially just from what we're seeing in 3Q 2020, 4Q 2020, with clinical visits being up mid- to high single digits. 
So I'm just wondering, when we think about those components of the bridge, of the revenue bridge for next year, are you baking any conservatism in the second half? Or does this reflect a little bit of your views of something like we would refer to pre-COVID landscape, especially once the vaccines are rolled out and you go back to normal? I guess my question is sort of what are your thoughts on these COVID tailwinds we've seen in the second half of this year and how that continues next year and beyond."

I think for -- we do feel good about the momentum entering the first half. I think we'll have relatively stronger growth in the first half. And I think you're highlighting the key question, which is sort of the comparison in the second half. There was a step-up in the growth rate and driven by a number of factors, more pets, more testing, some pent-up demand that they've carried over from the early COVID impact. So I think we're just recognizing that there will be some year-over-year compare dynamics that go on that we'll learn more about as we go into the year.

Just in terms of dynamics going into 2021, we do anticipate some investments in areas like lab capacity. We're trying to keep up with the very strong growth that we've seen. I'd point out that 2020 was an unusual year in that we -- early on, when we really didn't know how this was going to play out, we erred on the side, I would say, of caution and just been very tight with our costs controls last year and wanted to ensure that we had a healthy business model and asked people to make sacrifices. There were a lot that went into that. 
And so we're trying to reflect that we've got year-over-year compares here to a year that we had a high level of cost control. And we're going to have some investments that are coming back across the business. And we expect to try to highlight there's going to be things like health care costs and perhaps travel costs and things like that, that come back later in the year and as well as just trying to reengage and investing in areas that we held the line on in 2020 and had very high growth. So we've noted things like international commercial expansion as an area that we want to lean in. 
We want to continue to support our R&D agenda, and so the number of areas that are all aligned with our organic growth strategy that we're intending to support it, and that's reflected in our intent to have moderate operating margin gains on top of very strong performance.

So you're guiding to an acceleration in the CAG recurring at 13.25 midpoint, and you've been around 11 to 12, but it seems that the acceleration per your commentary is a function of greater expectations around clinical visits versus your premium to the clinical, right? With your premium to the clinical, you expect around that 900 bp to 1,000 bp premium. And so can you talk to that dynamic, guys? I would just think at a high level, the premium would be more in your control with the increased commercial investments, the innovation driving utilizations versus that and trying to sort of guesstimate how the underlying clinical visit shakes out.

So I know you've got a lot of initiatives that you've talked about to continue to grow the business. But have you changed what you're emphasizing or how you're approaching the vet, just given what we learned about the kind of pet owner and willingness to spend over the last year or so?"

So just to answer, so that 10% was new pet clinical growth versus new total pet growth in the marketplace, and we think that, that's a healthy dynamic because they initially come into the practice as puppies and kittens.

So just to answer, so that 10% was new pet clinical growth versus new total pet growth in the marketplace, and we think that, that's a healthy dynamic because they initially come into the practice as puppies and kittens. They make their initial checkup, which includes diagnostic tests. And to speak to your second point, the 2 are really related. If we do our job well with preventive care programs and other programs that those puppies and kittens as they become dogs and cats continue to get care on an annual basis or twice a year. So we think it's a healthy dynamic and plays into our strengths, both as a commercial and marketing strategy. The programs we actually have in place are ideally suited to drive that. So if you think about the preventive care program that we have 4,800-plus customers enroll in that, that's a great example of a driver of medical services and in turn, diagnostics usage. So our programs are geared towards driving education and adoption of both wellness and nonwellness type care and testing. So we think we're very aligned, and we think it's a trend that we can sustain, and that's the plan to be able to do that. 
So I think that's the last question. I want to thank everybody for calling in. I know we have some employees who are also on the call. And I just want to express my gratitude for their extraordinary performance during these challenging times. We run the company in a way that takes a long-term view of the opportunities ahead of us while still delivering today. I couldn't be more appreciative of the IDEXX team and the purpose, which animates our work. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you."

I'm pleased to take you through our first quarter results and to provide an update on our financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q1, driven by continued strong global mome",2310,"Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our first quarter results and to provide an update on our financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q1, driven by continued strong global momentum in our CAG business. Revenue increased 24% as reported and 21% organically, supported by 23% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued high gains across U.S. and international markets. Operating profit gains were particularly strong in Q1, reflecting flow through benefits from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth and favorable comparisons to relatively higher prior year pre covet operating expense levels. These dynamics, and a higher-than-expected $0.17 per share and stock-based compensation tax benefit, enabled delivery of $2.35 in earnings per share, an increase of 73% on a comparable basis. 
Our strong start to the year has increased our confidence in achieving high revenue and profit gains in 2021. We're raising our full year revenue outlook range by $40 million to $3.105 billion to $3.160 billion, or reported revenue growth of 14.5% to 16.5%. The this reflects an updated outlook for 13% to 15% overall organic revenue growth, 1.5% higher than our initial outlook. 
We're raising our organic growth outlook for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues to 14.5% to 16%, 2% higher at midpoint than our initial 2021 growth projections. Our full year financial outlook now reflects a targeted 150 to 200 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable basis. These gains are projected to support EPS of $7.88 to $8.18 per share, reflecting 21% to 26% comparable EPS growth. We're planning to deliver these strong profit gains while advancing investments in our innovation and commercial capability to enable long-term accelerated global market development in our core CAG business. 
We'll update our -- we'll discuss our updated 2020 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results and recent market trends. 
First quarter organic revenue growth of 21% was driven by 23% gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting 21% growth in the U.S. and 28% growth in international markets, including some benefits from the lapping of prior year cohort impacts in late March. Strong CAG gains also reflected 27% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues. Overall, Q1 organic revenue gains were supported by 9% growth in our LPD business, reflecting strong demand for African swine fever testing in China as well as by approximately 1% of growth benefit from our OPTI human COVID-19 PCR test initiative. The key driver of our financial model, CAG diagnostic recurring revenues expanded at high-growth rates across regions through the quarter. First quarter results were largely consistent with the very strong 2-year growth trends we saw in the second half of 2020. 
On a 2-year basis, CAG diagnostic recurring revenues increased at a 17% average annual organic growth rate. We'll be highlighting 2-year growth trends selectively in the coming quarters as we calibrate the effect of year-on-year lapping of 2020 COVID impacts on our growth results. High CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains were aided by continued high-growth in clinical visits. Overall U.S. clinical visit growth was 12% in Q1, including some benefits from the lapping of prior year COVID impacts in late March. On a 2-year basis, same-store clinical visit growth increased at an average 6% annual rate, slightly higher than our second half 2020 trends. The IDEXX U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was 900 basis points in the first quarter or approximately 1,000 to 1,100 basis points adjusted for equivalent day effects. Q1 U.S. clinic visit growth reflected a sustained strong 9% growth in nonwellness visits and an increased 16% growth in wellness visits. These gains were supported by relatively higher benefits from growth in new patients, which we estimated added approximately 3% to overall clinical visit growth and 4% to wellness visit growth in the quarter. 
Continued focus on expanded pet health care services, including increases in the utilization of diagnostics, supported a 15% same-store increase and overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q1 and a 21% same-store increase in diagnostic revenues per practice, well ahead of 5% growth in overall visits to veterinary clinics in the quarter. 
Positive market dynamics, benefits from IDEXX commercial initiatives and technology to support higher standards of care and continued very high customer retention rates drove strong Q1 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX Global reference lab gains revenues increased 22% organically in Q1 and reflecting 20% plus organic gains in U.S. and international markets. Our international reference lab gains benefited from strong growth in Europe, supported by our new German core lab capability our expanded commercial presence and growth in IDEXX 360 program agreements. Global reference lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth, with strong gains across testing categories.
IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 26% on an organic basis in the first quarter, reflecting continued 20%-plus growth in the U.S. and 30% plus organic gains in international markets. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. 
CAG instrument placements increased significantly in Q1 compared to constrained prior year levels as clinics look ahead to supporting high-growth of demand for diagnostics globally. Total premium placements increased 32%, reflecting 26% gains in North America and 36% growth in international markets. The quality of CAG instrument placements was excellent, reflected in 302 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 27%, and 805 new and competitive placements in international markets, a year-on-year increase of [ 15% ]. We also benefited from 464 second catalyst placements driven by continued strong demand from high-volume customers. These new placements and high customer retention levels supported a 13% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst installed base. We achieved 956 premium hematology placements, including our initial shipments of ProCyte One, supporting a 10% growth in our global premium hematology base compared to Q1 of 2020. We also placed 577 SediVues, including strong placement levels at international markets, leveraging IDEXX 360 agreements, which supported a 21% year-on-year global increase in our premium urine sediment installed base. We're very encouraged by the momentum we're driving and expanding our in clinic installed base as we prepare for continued improvement in sales access to veterinary clinics globally and advance the global launch of ProCyte One. 
Rapid assay revenues also expanded at a strong 20% organic growth rate in Q1, reflecting mid-teen gains in the U.S., supported by high demand for wellness testing and accelerated growth in international markets. Of note, retention rates for U.S. rapid assay customers reached 97% in Q1, the highest level seen since the initiation of our U.S. Go Direct efforts in 2014. 
Overall, high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven across our modalities, with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 9% organically overall. Double-digit gains in recurring software and digital imaging service revenues and solid growth in new software system placements were moderated by lower diagnostic imaging instrument revenue levels, impacted by a year-on-year reduction in earlier generation instrument platform sales. 
Turning to our other business segments. Water business revenues declined 3% organically in Q1 compared to strong prior year results, which included an estimated $2 million or 8% growth benefit from accelerated stocking orders. Adjusting for these impacts, water revenues increased solidly year-on-year as we continue to see relative improvement in noncompliance related testing volumes that have been constrained during the pandemic. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue increased 9% organically in Q1, driven by growth in our Asia Pacific region. 
Q1 results saw approximately $2 million of favorability from shipment timing, which largely offset favorable shipment timing impacts of Q1 of 2020. LPD results benefited from strong demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever and growth in core swine testing volumes in China, supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine Hertz. These gains more than offset lower herd health screening levels compared to strong prior year results. 
We expect to see some pressure in our LPD revenue growth rate moving forward particularly in the second half of this year as we begin to lap the benefits from high prior year demand for our African swine fever testing programs and see increased levels of local competition in China. 
Turning to the P&L. We had strong profit flow-through in Q1 as we benefited from high CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains and comparisons to relatively higher pre-COVID operating expense levels in the first quarter of 2020. Overall, operating margins expanded 830 basis points year-on-year on a comparable basis, driving an increase in operating profits of 72% as reported and 65% on a comparable basis. Gross profit increased 31% in Q1. Gross margins increased 320 basis points on a comparable basis, reflecting productivity improvement in our lab operations, supported by higher organic revenue growth, favorable impacts from strong consumable sales and benefits from moderate [indiscernible]. We're planning for gross margin gains to moderate over the balance of this year as we lap tightly controlled prior year spending levels at increased reference lab staffing to support high revenue growth and service levels. Operating expenses in Q1 increased 4% as reported and 3% on a comparable basis. As noted, operating expense growth was moderated by comparisons to higher prior year pre-COVID spending levels, including much higher prior year first quarter travel, trade show and sales meeting costs. Our 2020 financial outlook includes expectations for an increased rate of OpEx growth moving forward as we lap comparisons to control prior OpEx levels and invest to support our strong global growth momentum through enhancements to our commercial and innovation capability. 
We're also planning for year-on-year increases in costs in key areas such as employee health care claims and travel costs, as we work through the year and pandemic related restrictions are eased. Q1 EPS was $2.35 per share, including benefits of $15 million or $0.17 per share related to share-based compensation activity. 
On a comparable basis, Q1 EPS increased 73%. Foreign exchange added $10 million to operating profits and $0.09 to EPS in Q1, net of approximately $2 million in hedge losses. Free cash flow was $104 million in Q1. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 99%, including benefits from delayed capital spending and extension of tax payments. 
For the full year, we're maintaining a consistent outlook for free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90% of net income. Our balance sheet remains in a very strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.0x gross and 0.6x net of cash, with $350 million in cash and no borrowings and our $1 billion revolving credit facility. 
We reinitiated share repurchases in Q1, allocating $154 million of capital to repurchase 305,000 shares. 
Turning to our '21 full year outlook. We're increasing our projected ranges for overall revenue growth to 14.5% to 16.5% as reported. This reflects a 150 basis point increase in our projected organic revenue growth range, offset by approximately $5 million in refinements to our FX assumptions, which now point to a positive 1.5% full year growth benefit this year at the rate shared in our press release. 
Our updated organic -- overall organic revenue growth outlook of 13% to 15% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 14.5% to 16% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. As noted, we've raised the CAG Dx recurring revenue growth outlook by 2% at midpoint to reflect our strong Q1 results, trends that point towards a sustained high rate of U.S. clinic visit growth, and confidence in our global CAG commercial execution, which is driving strong momentum in our international regions. 
As a benchmark, our updated recurring revenue growth outlook aligns with the higher end of our earlier projections for 2% to 5% same-store U.S. clinical visit growth for the full year 2021 and an expected premium of IDEXX U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth to clinic visit growth of approximately 900 to 1,000 basis points. The increase in our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook, which results in over $50 million of operational revenue upside, is being moderated by relatively more conservative full year projections for IDEXX human COVID testing. We estimate that we'll see approximately $10 million in lower human COVID revenues year-on-year in the second half of 2021 as we lap the benefits of our prior initiatives and plan for moderation in testing levels. We've also moderated our outlook for LPD growth to reflect increased local competition in China, including in our African swine fever testing business. 
Combined, these effects result in a 0.5% headwind compared to our earlier overall organic growth outlook. Given the lapping of prior COVID impacts, there will likely be significant variability in year-on-year revenue growth rates by quarter, with continued expectations for higher revenue growth in the first half of 2021. 
In terms of key financial metrics, as noted, we're now targeting 150 to 200 basis points of annual comparable operating margin improvement in 2021, up 100 basis points from our initial outlook. This is reflected in a reported operating margin outlook for 2021 of 28.3% to 28.8%. Our EPS outlook incorporates updated projections for foreign exchange, which we now estimate will provide $0.15 of positive EPS benefit in 2021, net of established hedge positions. Our full year outlook also includes an updated estimate of $0.19 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, $0.09 per share higher than our initial projections. 
We provided details on our updated estimates and the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. That concludes our financial review. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments."

IDEXX had an excellent start to 2021, driven by continued strong market trends in our core CAG business and strong execution. This resulted in 21% quarterly organic revenue growth in the first quarter and high profit flow through. Supported by 23% organic growth for CAG diagnostics recurring revenues. There were strong gains across all our market segments. 
 
Our business performance reinforces the tremendous long-term opportunity we see to develop the global market for companion animal health care and gives us confidence to raise our 2021 outlook to deliver 14.5% to 16% organic growth for CAG diagnostics recurring revenues and 21% to 26% gains in comparable EPS growth. 
 
Today, I'll provide provide an update on the trends we're seeing in our companion animal markets and our approach to drive accelerated market growth, leveraging IDEXX innovation to raise the standard of patient care. I'll also provide an update on our product and commercial initiatives that will enable us to [Audio Gap] companion market momentum. This is reflected, for example, in the U.S. market data showing higher growth in clinical visits and continued high-growth in services, supported by expanded utilization of diagnostics. 
 
As Brian highlighted, we saw continued high U.S. clinic visit growth, up 12% in the quarter, with nonwellness visits up 9% and wellness visits up 16%. And with strong growth seen across practices of all sizes. New patients continue to be a significant contributor to clinical visit gains. We estimate that new clinical patients added approximately 3% to overall clinical growth versus Q1 2020, up from 1% to 2% in the second half of 2020. And and we continue to see record levels in progesterone testing, evidence of a continued step-up in breeder activity. The growth in puppies and kids and continued evidence of the deepening of the pet owner bond, augmented by the growth in new pet parents can provide long-term tailwinds for our business. 
 
As a benchmark, we estimate that the average annual diagnostic revenue per senior or geriatric pet, is double the amount we see per pet for puppies and [ kids. ] If we do our job well with programs like Preventive Care, we can help to drive twice the level of annual visits in young well [ pads ] and continue to expand diagnostics usage through live stages, thereby helping advance standards of care. In looking at our U.S. market data, we've seen an acceleration in the utilization of diagnostics. In our earnings snapshot, we shared annual data for the percentage of 2020 clinical visits, including blood work. The percentage of clinical visits with blood work increased approximately 15% to 18% percent in 2020, double the historical rate of annual increase. Interestingly, the highest increases were in customer deciles doing more testing. With gains across wellness and non-wellness blood work utilization, reinforcing the point that even the highest users of diagnostics have significant potential for further growth. 
An increased focus on services, and adoption of higher standards of care in areas like diagnostics are driving very strong overall growth in veterinary clinics. In the first quarter, same-store total practice revenues increased 15% and versus the same quarter last year, reflecting a 19% growth in clinical revenue per practice and 21% growth in Diagnostics revenues. Clearly, our customers are extremely busy. It's not surprising that they are looking for help from partners like IDEX to support their high levels of business growth through our customer-centric solutions offering. We're particularly pleased with our commercial execution to support these customer needs, evidenced by 32% year-over-year growth in premium instrument placements globally, including strong growth in placements at new and competitive accounts. 
A key area of focus has been leveraging our integrated direct go-to-market model to accelerate international growth. We achieved 28% CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth internationally in Q1, with strong gains across all our major regions, while driving a 36% year-over-year increase in premium instrument placements outside of North America despite continued restrictions in sales access to clinics. IDEXX 360 continues to gain traction internationally, resulting in higher growth with customers, leveraging IDEXX technology across modalities. IDEXX 360 is helping to accelerate growth in our international reference labs in key markets like Europe, supported by our state of the art, new core lab in Corn Westin, Germany, and our expanded commercial presence. 
The international commercial expansion efforts we've highlighted continued to progress per plan, with the goal of completing onboarding of new sales teams in key markets in the first half of 2021. The outstanding growth momentum and long-term potential for IDEX in international markets reinforces the high-return from investments in our global commercial capability. Advancing international commercial expansions will continue to be a key strategy. Innovation is another key pillar in our growth strategy. In late March, we reached an exciting milestone when we began shipments of our next-generation hematology analyzer, ProCyte One. I'm very proud of the extended team. Including our Westbrook, Maine, based instrument manufacturing personnel for delivering this world-class analyzer on schedule during a pandemic to the delight of our customers. Our first sales and installations were to U.S. clinics have participated in our customer experience trials, which is a testament to their highly positive experience with the analyzer. ProCyte One's exceptional simplicity and accuracy give our customers confidence in running the analyzer and in the patient results. 
This is helping to gain efficiencies and practices in this truly a best-in-class experience. Prussian also represents the next step for IDEX in providing leading-edge technology, integrated with information management, which enables clinical decision support and supports a wide range of veterinarian partners in providing the highest levels of care. We expect ProCyte One to drive CAD growth as chemistry and hematology testing go hand-in-hand and it's part of the IDEXX 360 program to help drive reference lab usage. This quarter, our commercial focus for ProCyte One is on shipments and the clinics that took advantage of our presales program, while concurrently manufacturing and building volume to support our sales ramp through 2021, including the international rollout expected to begin in late Q2, early Q3. The [indiscernible] instrument is another investment in innovation that supports our customers at the point-of-care by providing workflow benefits, accurate reading of diagnostic results on the [indiscernible] platform and smart service connectivity. Our veterinary partners are busier than ever. So providing ease of information management within the practice is a key benefit to help them save precious time while maintaining accurate records. Snap Pro provides a tool to address these needs and has helped drive recent growth internationally for our rapid assay business. We see high engagement from international customers who are actively using Snap Pro and are connected to smart service, with growth and retention rates consistent with trends across U.S. customers. We're also making excellent progress in expanding our installed base in key geographic markets like Europe, which helped to drive 20% organic growth in global rapid assay revenues in the first quarter. 
Our innovation agenda is also driving favorable business performance for our software portfolio, which had another excellent quarter. Record-breaking worldwide PIMS placements in the quarter grew 43% versus Q1 of last year, with 2 out of every 3 PIMS placements driven by cloud based technology. IDEXX Webtech saw double-digit growth in subscribers, including improvements in customer retention levels to over 96%. We received consistent price from subscribers about usability, value and support of the web pack system. Important feedback as we look to expand this product into new markets. These integrated offerings together create a diversified technology stack that provides multiple customer benefits to help manage the growing productivity demands of veterinary clinics in a high-growth market. Through our PIMS tools -- through our pims and tools like smart flow, our focus is on improving clinic workflow by seamlessly connecting data between devices to streamline every step from patient admission to discharge. By bringing AI capability to tools like [indiscernible], our platforms enable faster procedures, while leveraging data to deliver insights and reduce efforts by clinic staff. Extending to the client, our communication applications are more compelling than ever, with clinics managing a significant portion of visits CRBSI. Connected software is critical for clinics in creating capacity to meet the increasing demands for veterinary services. IDEXX is uniquely positioned to serve customer needs in this area, enhancing our value proposition and differentiation. In terms of other key initiatives, we continue to promote the advancement of preventive care and annual wellness testing through the IDEXX Preventive Care program. In addition to increasing the standard of patient care, preventive care programs can help veterinarians improve practice capacity, do more predictable schedule and level loading of practice staff. In the first quarter, the commercial team executed over 200 new enrollments, bringing total enrollments to over 5,000, which is an exciting milestone as we are more than halfway to our goal of 10,000 enrolled customers in the U.S. by 2024. As our customers enter the wellness testing season, and wellness visits accelerate in the market, we are focused on continuing to capture the underdeveloped market opportunity in vector borne disease testing. There are significant long-term opportunities to expand vector board disease testing, in particular, given the current prevalence of heartworm only testing in the U.S., shifting this balance to a full vector board disease screening using 40x Plus not only enhances the standard of care, it represents a material opportunity for clinics to drive additional revenue. This focus and strong underlying market trends helped to deliver double-digit revenue growth across all regions, led by increases in utilization of 40x plus and feline retrovirus tests. 
As we look ahead, we're very excited about the opportunity to leverage our commercial capability, innovation and partnerships with our customers to build on our strong growth trends. A key area of focus for us is to continue to invest in the infrastructure necessary to meet high levels of growth, while maintaining top-notch service levels and prioritizing support for our workforce. Our employees and customers have shown high levels of adaptability and resiliency during continued COVID-related restrictions, and we look forward to a post-COVID-19 environment. 
We anticipate more flexibility in the future and leveraging new ways of working together with our colleagues and customers. I'd like to add that I'm extremely proud of the way that the IDEXX team is executing. We are on track for a strong 2021. That concludes my opening remarks, and we now have time for some questions."

And so we're just trying to highlight, as we move forward, we're going to see some of those comparison effects, moderate the margin gains, the gross margin gains, and we'll see relatively higher OpEx growth. Again, it's a benchmark. Just in Q1, we had over $7 million of cost reduction year-on-year from things like lower sales meeting costs and T&E, which is about 7% of OpEx growth. So moving forward, we won't have those kind of favorability. So we're just trying to highlight that. And we're also trying to highlight that we're advancing investment in the business. So maybe Jay can talk a bit about that."

We've identified the hematology opportunity is very significant for the company. Keep in mind, a lot of our international markets are hematology first markets. So what that means if they have a choice in terms of if it's one instrument or none, they tend to choose hematology and they test with hematology even before chemistry, even when they have both. So in terms of the opportunity itself, as I earlier described it's almost 100,000 placement opportunities, 2/3 plus of which is internationally. But even more importantly, if I pivot just a higher level comment, it's an important part of our overall in clinic solution. We tend to sell chemistry and hematology, increasingly SediVue together. So having this type of solution, which from a performance and cost profile standpoint, hits the sweet spot of the market, is obviously very attractive to us. The other thing that I would point out is that, increasingly, the IDEXX 360 program is just getting terrific traction internationally. And as part of that, the capital placement piece is the anchor. And there's pull-through on reference labs and rapid assay in terms of delivering the underlying volume commitment.

I'm pleased to take you through our first quarter results and to provide an update on our financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q1, driven by continued strong global mome",2310,"Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our first quarter results and to provide an update on our financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q1, driven by continued strong global momentum in our CAG business. Revenue increased 24% as reported and 21% organically, supported by 23% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued high gains across U.S. and international markets. Operating profit gains were particularly strong in Q1, reflecting flow through benefits from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth and favorable comparisons to relatively higher prior year pre-COVID operating expense levels. These dynamics, and a higher-than-expected $0.17 per share in stock-based compensation tax benefit, enabled delivery of $2.35 in earnings per share, an increase of 73% on a comparable basis. 
Our strong start to the year has increased our confidence in achieving high revenue and profit gains in 2021. We're raising our full year revenue outlook range by $40 million to $3.105 billion to $3.160 billion, or reported revenue growth of 14.5% to 16.5%. The this reflects an updated outlook for 13% to 15% overall organic revenue growth, 1.5% higher than our initial outlook. 
We're raising our organic growth outlook for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues from 14.5% to 16%, 2% higher at midpoint than our initial 2021 growth projections. Our full year financial outlook now reflects a targeted 150 to 200 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable basis. These gains are projected to support EPS of $7.88 to $8.18 per share, reflecting 21% to 26% comparable EPS growth. We're planning to deliver these strong profit gains while advancing investments in our innovation and commercial capability to enable long-term accelerated global market development in our core CAG business. 
We'll update our -- we'll discuss our updated 2020 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results and recent market trends. 
First quarter organic revenue growth of 21% was driven by 23% gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting 21% growth in the U.S. and 28% growth in international markets, including some benefits from the lapping of prior year COVID impacts in late March. Strong CAG gains also reflected 27% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues. Overall, Q1 organic revenue gains were supported by 9% growth in our LPD business, reflecting strong demand for African swine fever testing in China as well as by approximately 1% of growth benefit from our OPTI human COVID-19 PCR test initiative. The key driver of our financial model, CAG diagnostic recurring revenues expanded at high-growth rates across regions through the quarter. First quarter results were largely consistent with the very strong 2-year growth trends we saw in the second half of 2020. 
On a 2-year basis, CAG diagnostic recurring revenues increased at a 17% average annual organic growth rate. We'll be highlighting 2-year growth trends selectively in the coming quarters as we calibrate the effect of year-on-year lapping of 2020 COVID impacts on our growth results. High CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains were aided by continued high-growth in clinical visits. Overall U.S. clinical visit growth was 12% in Q1, including some benefits from the lapping of prior year COVID impacts in late March. On a 2-year basis, same-store clinical visit growth increased at an average 6% annual rate, slightly higher than our second half 2020 trends. The IDEXX U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was 900 basis points in the first quarter or approximately 1,000 to 1,100 basis points adjusted for equivalent day effects. Q1 U.S. clinic visit growth reflected a sustained strong 9% growth in nonwellness visits and an increased 16% growth in wellness visits. These gains were supported by relatively higher benefits from growth in new patients, which we estimated added approximately 3% to overall clinical visit growth and 4% to wellness visit growth in the quarter. 
Continued focus on expanded pet health care services, including increases in the utilization of diagnostics, supported a 15% same-store increase and overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q1 and a 21% same-store increase in diagnostic revenues per practice, well ahead of 5% growth in overall visits to veterinary clinics in the quarter. 
Positive market dynamics, benefits from IDEXX commercial initiatives and technology to support higher standards of care and continued very high customer retention rates drove strong Q1 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX Global Reference Lab gains revenues increased 22% organically in Q1 and reflecting 20% plus organic gains in U.S. and international markets. Our international reference lab gains benefited from strong growth in Europe, supported by our new German core lab capability, our expanded commercial presence and growth in IDEXX 360 program agreements. Global Reference Lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth, with strong gains across testing categories. 
IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 26% on an organic basis in the first quarter, reflecting continued 20%-plus growth in the U.S. and 30% plus organic gains in international markets. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. 
CAG instrument placements increased significantly in Q1 compared to constrained prior year levels as clinics look ahead to supporting high-growth of demand for diagnostics globally. Total premium placements increased 32%, reflecting 26% gains in North America and 36% growth in international markets. The quality of CAG instrument placements was excellent, reflected in 302 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 27%, and 805 new and competitive placements in international markets, a year-on-year increase of 15%. We also benefited from 464 second catalyst placements driven by continued strong demand from high-volume customers. These new placements and high customer retention levels supported a 13% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst installed base. We achieved 956 premium hematology placements, including our initial shipments of ProCyte One, supporting a 10% growth in our global premium hematology base compared to Q1 of 2020. We also placed 577 SediVues, including strong placement levels at international markets, leveraging IDEXX 360 agreements, which supported a 21% year-on-year global increase in our premium urine sediment installed base. We're very encouraged by the momentum we're driving and expanding our in clinic installed base as we prepare for continued improvement in sales access to veterinary clinics globally and advance the global launch of ProCyte One. 
Rapid assay revenues also expanded at a strong 20% organic growth rate in Q1, reflecting mid-teen gains in the U.S., supported by high demand for wellness testing and accelerated growth in international markets. Of note, retention rates for U.S. rapid assay customers reached 97% in Q1, the highest level seen since the initiation of our U.S. Go Direct efforts in 2014. 
Overall, high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven across our modalities, with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 9% organically overall. Double-digit gains in recurring software and digital imaging service revenues and solid growth in new software system placements were moderated by lower diagnostic imaging instrument revenue levels, impacted by a year-on-year reduction in earlier generation instrument platform sales. 
Turning to our other business segments. Water business revenues declined 3% organically in Q1 compared to strong prior year results, which included an estimated $2 million or 8% growth benefit from accelerated stocking orders. Adjusting for these impacts, water revenues increased solidly year-on-year as we continue to see relative improvement in noncompliance related testing volumes that have been constrained during the pandemic. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue increased 9% organically in Q1, driven by growth in our Asia Pacific region. 
Q1 results saw approximately $2 million of favorability from shipment timing, which largely offset favorable shipment timing impacts of Q1 of 2020. LPD results benefited from strong demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever and growth in core swine testing volumes in China, supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine Hertz. These gains more than offset lower herd health screening levels compared to strong prior year results. 
We expect to see some pressure in our LPD revenue growth rate moving forward particularly in the second half of this year as we begin to lap the benefits from high prior year demand for our African swine fever testing programs and see increased levels of local competition in China. 
Turning to the P&L. We had strong profit flow-through in Q1 as we benefited from high CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains and comparisons to relatively higher pre-COVID operating expense levels in the first quarter of 2020. Overall, operating margins expanded 830 basis points year-on-year on a comparable basis, driving an increase in operating profits of 72% as reported and 65% on a comparable basis. Gross profit increased 31% in Q1. Gross margins increased 320 basis points on a comparable basis, reflecting productivity improvement in our lab operations, supported by higher organic revenue growth, favorable impacts from strong consumable sales and benefits from moderate net price gains. 
We're planning for gross margin gains to moderate over the balance of this year as we lap tightly controlled prior year spending levels at increased reference lab staffing to support high revenue growth and service levels. Operating expenses in Q1 increased 4% as reported and 3% on a comparable basis. As noted, operating expense growth was moderated by comparisons to higher prior year pre-COVID spending levels, including much higher prior year first quarter travel, trade show and sales meeting costs. Our 2020 financial outlook includes expectations for an increased rate of OpEx growth moving forward as we lap comparisons to control prior OpEx levels and invest to support our strong global growth momentum through enhancements to our commercial and innovation capability. 
We're also planning for year-on-year increases in costs in key areas such as employee health care claims and travel costs, as we work through the year and pandemic related restrictions are eased. Q1 EPS was $2.35 per share, including benefits of $15 million or $0.17 per share related to share-based compensation activity. 
On a comparable basis, Q1 EPS increased 73%. Foreign exchange added $10 million to operating profits and $0.09 to EPS in Q1, net of approximately $2 million in hedge losses. Free cash flow was $104 million in Q1. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 99%, including benefits from delayed capital spending and extension of tax payments. 
For the full year, we're maintaining a consistent outlook for free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90% of net income. Our balance sheet remains in a very strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.0x gross and 0.6x net of cash, with $350 million in cash and no borrowings and our $1 billion revolving credit facility. 
We reinitiated share repurchases in Q1, allocating $154 million of capital to repurchase 305,000 shares. 
Turning to our '21 full year outlook. We're increasing our projected ranges for overall revenue growth to 14.5% to 16.5% as reported. This reflects a 150 basis point increase in our projected organic revenue growth range, offset by approximately $5 million in refinements to our FX assumptions, which now point to a positive 1.5% full year growth benefit this year at the rate shared in our press release. 
Our updated organic -- overall organic revenue growth outlook of 13% to 15% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 14.5% to 16% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. As noted, we've raised the CAG Dx recurring revenue growth outlook by 2% at midpoint to reflect our strong Q1 results, trends that point towards a sustained high rate of U.S. clinic visit growth, and confidence in our global CAG commercial execution, which is driving strong momentum in our international regions. 
As a benchmark, our updated recurring revenue growth outlook aligns with the higher end of our earlier projections for 2% to 5% same-store U.S. clinical visit growth for the full year 2021 and an expected premium of IDEXX U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth to clinic visit growth of approximately 900 to 1,000 basis points. The increase in our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook, which results in over $50 million of operational revenue upside, is being moderated by relatively more conservative full year projections for IDEXX human COVID testing. We estimate that we'll see approximately $10 million in lower human COVID revenues year-on-year in the second half of 2021 as we lap the benefits of our prior initiatives and plan for moderation in testing levels. We've also moderated our outlook for LPD growth to reflect increased local competition in China, including in our African swine fever testing business. 
Combined, these effects result in a 0.5% headwind compared to our earlier overall organic growth outlook. Given the lapping of prior year COVID impacts, there will likely be significant variability in year-on-year revenue growth rates by quarter, with continued expectations for higher revenue growth in the first half of 2021. 
In terms of key financial metrics, as noted, we're now targeting 150 to 200 basis points of annual comparable operating margin improvement in 2021, up 100 basis points from our initial outlook. This is reflected in our reported operating margin outlook for 2021 of 28.3% to 28.8%. Our EPS outlook incorporates updated projections for foreign exchange, which we now estimate will provide $0.15 of positive EPS benefit in 2021, net of established hedge positions. Our full year outlook also includes an updated estimate of $0.19 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, $0.09 per share higher than our initial projections. 
We provided details on our updated estimates and the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments."

IDEXX had an excellent start to 2021, driven by continued strong market trends in our core CAG business and strong execution. This resulted in 21% quarterly organic revenue growth in the first quarter and high profit flow through. Supported by 23% organic growth for CAG diagnostics recurring revenues. There were strong gains across all our market segments. 
Our business performance reinforces the tremendous long-term opportunity we see to develop the global market for companion animal health care and gives us confidence to raise our 2021 outlook to deliver 14.5% to 16% organic growth for CAG diagnostics recurring revenues and 21% to 26% gains in comparable EPS growth. 
Today, I'll provide provide an update on the trends we're seeing in our companion animal markets and our approach to drive accelerated market growth, leveraging IDEXX innovation to raise the standard of patient care. I'll also provide an update on our product and commercial initiatives that will enable us to capitalize on market tailwinds and position the company to deliver continued strong financial returns. Let's begin with an update on market trends. Companion animal health care continues to see strong global market momentum. This is reflected, for example, in the U.S. market data showing higher growth in clinical visits and continued high-growth in services, supported by expanded utilization of diagnostics. 
As Brian highlighted, we saw continued high U.S. clinic visit growth, up 12% in the quarter, with nonwellness visits up 9% and wellness visits up 16%. And with strong growth seen across practices of all sizes. New patients continue to be a significant contributor to clinical visit gains. We estimate that new clinical patients added approximately 3% to overall clinical growth versus Q1 2020, up from 1% to 2% in the second half of 2020. And and we continue to see record levels in progesterone testing, evidence of a continued step-up in breeder activity. The growth in puppies and kids and continued evidence of the deepening of the pet owner bond, augmented by the growth in new pet parents can provide long-term tailwinds for our business. 
As a benchmark, we estimate that the average annual diagnostic revenue per senior or geriatric pet, is double the amount we see per pet for puppies and kittens. If we do our job well with programs like Preventive Care, we can help to drive twice the level of annual visits in young well pets and continue to expand diagnostics usage through live stages, thereby helping advance standards of care. In looking at our U.S. market data, we've seen an acceleration in the utilization of diagnostics. In our earnings snapshot, we shared annual data for the percentage of 2020 clinical visits, including blood work. The percentage of clinical visits with blood work increased approximately 1% to 18% percent in 2020, double the historical rate of annual increase. Interestingly, the highest increases were in customer deciles doing more testing. With gains across wellness and nonwellness blood work utilization, reinforcing the point that even the highest users of diagnostics have significant potential for further growth. 
An increased focus on services, and adoption of higher standards of care in areas like diagnostics are driving very strong overall growth in veterinary clinics. In the first quarter, same-store total practice revenues increased 15% and versus the same quarter last year, reflecting a 19% growth in clinical revenue per practice and 21% growth in Diagnostics revenues. Clearly, our customers are extremely busy. It's not surprising that they are looking for help from partners like IDEXX to support their high levels of business growth through our customer-centric solutions offering. We're particularly pleased with our commercial execution to support these customer needs, evidenced by 32% year-over-year growth in premium instrument placements globally, including strong growth in placements at new and competitive accounts. 
A key area of focus has been leveraging our integrated direct go-to-market model to accelerate international growth. We achieved 28% CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth internationally in Q1, with strong gains across all our major regions, while driving a 36% year-over-year increase in premium instrument placements outside of North America despite continued restrictions in sales access to clinics. IDEXX 360 continues to gain traction internationally, resulting in higher growth with customers, leveraging IDEXX technology across modalities. IDEXX 360 is helping to accelerate growth in our international reference labs in key markets like Europe, supported by our state of the art, new core lab in Kornwestheim, Germany, and our expanded commercial presence. 
The international commercial expansion efforts we've highlighted continued to progress per plan, with the goal of completing onboarding of new sales teams in key markets in the first half of 2021. The outstanding growth momentum and long-term potential for IDEXX in international markets reinforces the high-return from investments in our global commercial capability. Advancing international commercial expansions will continue to be a key strategy. Innovation is another key pillar in our growth strategy. In late March, we reached an exciting milestone when we began shipments of our next-generation hematology analyzer, ProCyte One. I'm very proud of the extended team. Including our Westbrook, Maine, based instrument manufacturing personnel for delivering this world-class analyzer on schedule during a pandemic to the delight of our customers. Our first sales and installations were to U.S. clinics that participated in our customer experience trials, which is a testament to their highly positive experience with the analyzer. ProCyte One's exceptional simplicity and accuracy give our customers confidence in running the analyzer and in the patient results. 
This is helping to gain efficiencies and practices in this truly a best-in-class experience. ProCyte One also represents the next step for IDEXX in providing leading-edge technology, integrated with information management, which enables clinical decision support and supports a wide range of veterinarian partners in providing the highest levels of care. We expect ProCyte One to drive CAG growth as chemistry and hematology testing go hand-in-hand and it's part of the IDEXX 360 program to help drive Reference Lab usage. This quarter, our commercial focus for ProCyte One is on shipments to the clinics that took advantage of our presales program while concurrently manufacturing and building volume to support our sales ramp through 2021, including the international rollout expected to begin in late Q2, early Q3. 
The SNAP Pro instrument is another investment in innovation that supports our customers at the point-of-care by providing workflow benefits, accurate reading of diagnostic results on the SNAP platform and SmartService connectivity. Our veterinary partners are busier than ever. So providing ease of information management within the practice is a key benefit to help them save precious time while maintaining accurate records. SNAP Pro provides a tool to address these needs and has helped drive recent growth internationally for our rapid assay business. We see high engagement from international customers who are actively using SNAP Pro and are connected to SmartService, with growth and retention rates consistent with trends across U.S. customers. We're also making excellent progress in expanding our installed base in key geographic markets like Europe, which helped to drive 20% organic growth in global rapid assay revenues in the first quarter. 
Our innovation agenda is also driving favorable business performance for our software portfolio, which had another excellent quarter. Record-breaking worldwide PIMS placements in the quarter grew 43% versus Q1 of last year, with 2 out of every 3 PIMS placements driven by cloud based technology. IDEXX Web PACS saw double-digit growth in subscribers, including improvements in customer retention levels to over 96%. We received consistent price from subscribers about usability, value and support of the web PAC system. Important feedback as we look to expand this product into new markets. 
These integrated offerings together create a diversified technology stack that provides multiple customer benefits to help manage the growing productivity demands of veterinary clinics in a high-growth market. Through our PIMS tools -- through our PIMS and tools like SmartFlow, our focus is on improving clinic workflow by seamlessly connecting data between devices to streamline every step from patient admission to discharge. By bringing AI capability to tools like Web PACS, our platforms enable faster procedures, while leveraging data to deliver insights and reduce efforts by clinic staff. Extending to the client, our communication applications are more compelling than ever, with clinics managing a significant portion of visits curbside. 
Connected software is critical for clinics in creating capacity to meet the increasing demands for veterinary services. IDEXX is uniquely positioned to serve customer needs in this area, enhancing our value proposition and differentiation. In terms of other key initiatives, we continue to promote the advancement of preventive care and annual wellness testing through the IDEXX Preventive Care program. In addition to increasing the standard of patient care, preventive care programs can help veterinarians improve practice capacity, do more predictable schedule and level loading of practice staff. In the first quarter, the commercial team executed over 200 new enrollments, bringing total enrollments to over 5,000, which is an exciting milestone as we are more than halfway to our goal of 10,000 enrolled customers in the U.S. by 2024. As our customers enter the wellness testing season, and wellness visits accelerate in the market, we are focused on continuing to capture the underdeveloped market opportunity in vector borne disease testing. There are significant long-term opportunities to expand vector board disease testing, in particular, given the current prevalence of heartworm only testing in the U.S., shifting this balance to a full vector born disease screening using 40x Plus not only enhances the standard of care, it represents a material opportunity for clinics to drive additional revenue. This focus and strong underlying market trends helped to deliver double-digit revenue growth across all regions, led by increases in utilization of 40x Plus and feline retrovirus tests. 
As we look ahead, we're very excited about the opportunity to leverage our commercial capability, innovation and partnerships with our customers to build on our strong growth trends. A key area of focus for us is to continue to invest in the infrastructure necessary to meet high levels of growth, while maintaining top-notch service levels and prioritizing support for our workforce. Our employees and customers have shown high levels of adaptability and resiliency during continued COVID-related restrictions, and we look forward to a post-COVID-19 environment. 
We anticipate more flexibility in the future and leveraging new ways of working together with our colleagues and customers. I'd like to add that I'm extremely proud of the way that the IDEXX team is executing. We are on track for a strong 2021. That concludes my opening remarks, and we now have time for some questions."

So if you recall, we had $25 million of OpEx savings that we highlighted last second quarter, another $5 million of savings from lower health care costs. We really, in the early stages of the pandemic, tried to be very mindful of how we're controlling labor costs in areas like the labs. And so we're just trying to highlight, as we move forward, we're going to see some of those comparison effects, moderate the margin gains, the gross margin gains, and we'll see relatively higher OpEx growth. Again, it's a benchmark. Just in Q1, we had over $7 million of cost reduction year-on-year from things like lower sales meeting costs and T&E, which is about 7% of OpEx growth.

We saw higher levels of contribution from frequency and utilization and those have sustained. If there was one thing that improved a bit in Q1, which we highlighted in the comments, was the new patient contribution to clinical visit growth was up about 100 basis points. So I think some of the building effect of the new puppies and kittens helped. But adjusting for that, the 2-year growth rates were largely consistent with Q4. It was more consistency than change. We're entering a period now where we'll have the COVID compares. The growth rate numbers are a little tougher to follow so we're trying to highlight some of the 2-year trends.

We're going to be up against some compares here, but I think, on balance, we feel very good about the trends, and if anything, they improved a bit in Q1. 
And as a benchmark, we do try to highlight that U.S. clinical visit growth and premium dynamic that you mentioned, and our initial estimates were 2% to 5% for the full year for clinical visit growth, that's a 1-year basis, and the 900 to 1,000 basis point premium.

It's been a very successful rollout, very successful customer experience trials, and not easy to do, by the way, in the middle of pandemic. This is complex -- the instrument, and it has a world-class user interface and performs at a very high level from just an accuracy standpoint. We've identified the hematology opportunity is very significant for the company. Keep in mind, a lot of our international markets are hematology first markets. So what that means if they have a choice in terms of -- if it's one instrument or none, they tend to choose hematology and they test with hematology even before chemistry, even when they have both. So in terms of the opportunity itself, as I earlier described it's almost 100,000 placement opportunities, 2/3 plus of which is internationally. 
But even more importantly, if I pivot just a higher level comment, it's an important part of our overall in-clinic solution. We tend to sell chemistry and hematology, increasingly SediVue together. So having this type of solution, which from a performance and cost profile standpoint, hits the sweet spot of the market, is obviously very attractive to us. The other thing that I would point out is that, increasingly, the IDEXX 360 program is just getting terrific traction internationally. And as part of that, the capital placement piece is the anchor. And there's pull-through on reference labs and rapid assay in terms of delivering the underlying volume commitment. So we're excited by the overall CAG Diagnostics opportunity that ProCyte One represents. It's going to have, we think, a very long tail, both duration as well as overall volume opportunity.

And our belief is that the fecal antigen tests that we offer at the Reference Lab is best-in-class. It detects up to 2x as much than traditional benefits like O&P.

And then you can develop an algorithm that protects eggs as part of the parasites or worms. But at the end of the day, they have to be available, that you have to be able to visually see them. The benefit in being able to detect through antigen testing is you are able to see them in the prepatent period, which is between 4 and 6 weeks earlier than physically when the eggs are available. So you get better detection piece. So we like our solutions. We think our customers appreciate fecal antigen at the reference labs, and that's where we continue to support them."

I'm pleased to take you through our first quarter results and to provide an update on our financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q1, driven by continued strong global mome",2309,"Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our first quarter results and to provide an update on our financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q1, driven by continued strong global momentum in our CAG business. Revenue increased 24% as reported and 21% organically, supported by 23% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued high gains across U.S. and international markets. Operating profit gains were particularly strong in Q1, reflecting flow through benefits from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth and favorable comparisons to relatively higher prior year pre-COVID operating expense levels. These dynamics, and a higher-than-expected $0.17 per share in stock-based compensation tax benefit, enabled delivery of $2.35 in earnings per share, an increase of 73% on a comparable basis. 
Our strong start to the year has increased our confidence in achieving high revenue and profit gains in 2021. We're raising our full year revenue outlook range by $40 million to $3.105 billion to $3.160 billion, or reported revenue growth of 14.5% to 16.5%. The this reflects an updated outlook for 13% to 15% overall organic revenue growth, 1.5% higher than our initial outlook. 
We're raising our organic growth outlook for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues from 14.5% to 16%, 2% higher at midpoint than our initial 2021 growth projections. Our full year financial outlook now reflects a targeted 150 to 200 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable basis. These gains are projected to support EPS of $7.88 to $8.18 per share, reflecting 21% to 26% comparable EPS growth. We're planning to deliver these strong profit gains while advancing investments in our innovation and commercial capability to enable long-term accelerated global market development in our core CAG business. 
We'll update our -- we'll discuss our updated 2020 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results and recent market trends. 
First quarter organic revenue growth of 21% was driven by 23% gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting 21% growth in the U.S. and 28% growth in international markets, including some benefits from the lapping of prior year COVID impacts in late March. Strong CAG gains also reflected 27% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues. Overall, Q1 organic revenue gains were supported by 9% growth in our LPD business, reflecting strong demand for African swine fever testing in China as well as by approximately 1% of growth benefit from our OPTI human COVID-19 PCR test initiative. The key driver of our financial model, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues expanded at high-growth rates across regions through the quarter. First quarter results were largely consistent with the very strong 2-year growth trends we saw in the second half of 2020. 
On a 2-year basis, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased at a 17% average annual organic growth rate. We'll be highlighting 2-year growth trends selectively in the coming quarters as we calibrate the effect of year-on-year lapping of 2020 COVID impacts on our growth results. High CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains were aided by continued high-growth in clinical visits. Overall U.S. clinical visit growth was 12% in Q1, including some benefits from the lapping of prior year COVID impacts in late March. On a 2-year basis, same-store clinical visit growth increased at an average 6% annual rate, slightly higher than our second half 2020 trends. The IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was 900 basis points in the first quarter or approximately 1,000 to 1,100 basis points adjusted for equivalent day effects. Q1 U.S. clinic visit growth reflected a sustained strong 9% growth in nonwellness visits and an increased 16% growth in wellness visits. These gains were supported by relatively higher benefits from growth in new patients, which we estimated added approximately 3% to overall clinical visit growth and 4% to wellness visit growth in the quarter. 
Continued focus on expanded pet health care services, including increases in the utilization of diagnostics, supported a 15% same-store increase and overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q1 and a 21% same-store increase in diagnostic revenues per practice, well ahead of 5% growth in overall visits to veterinary clinics in the quarter. 
Positive market dynamics, benefits from IDEXX commercial initiatives and technology to support higher standards of care and continued very high customer retention rates drove strong Q1 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX Global Reference Lab gains revenues increased 22% organically in Q1, reflecting 20% plus organic gains in U.S. and international markets. Our international reference lab gains benefited from strong growth in Europe, supported by our new German core lab capability, our expanded commercial presence and growth in IDEXX 360 program agreements. Global Reference Lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth, with strong gains across testing categories. 
IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 26% on an organic basis in the first quarter, reflecting continued 20%-plus growth in the U.S. and 30% plus organic gains in international markets. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. 
CAG instrument placements increased significantly in Q1 compared to constrained prior year levels as clinics look ahead to supporting high-growth in demand for diagnostics globally. Total premium placements increased 32%, reflecting 26% gains in North America and 36% growth in international markets. The quality of CAG instrument placements was excellent, reflected in 302 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 27%, and 805 new and competitive placements in international markets, a year-on-year increase of 15%. We also benefited from 464 second catalyst placements driven by continued strong demand from high-volume customers. These new placements and high customer retention levels supported a 13% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst installed base. We achieved 956 premium hematology placements, including our initial shipments of ProCyte One, supporting a 10% growth in our global premium hematology base compared to Q1 of 2020. We also placed 577 SediVues, including strong placement levels at international markets, leveraging IDEXX 360 agreements, which supported a 21% year-on-year global increase in our premium urine sediment installed base. We're very encouraged by the momentum we're driving and expanding our in clinic installed base as we prepare for continued improvement in sales access to veterinary clinics globally and advance the global launch of ProCyte One. 
Rapid assay revenues also expanded at a strong 20% organic growth rate in Q1, reflecting mid-teen gains in the U.S., supported by high demand for wellness testing and accelerated growth in international markets. Of note, retention rates for U.S. rapid assay customers reached 97% in Q1, the highest level seen since the initiation of our U.S. Go Direct efforts in 2014. 
Overall, high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven across our modalities, with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 9% organically overall. Double-digit gains in recurring software and digital imaging service revenues and solid growth in new software system placements were moderated by lower diagnostic imaging instrument revenue levels, impacted by a year-on-year reduction in earlier generation instrument platform sales. 
Turning to our other business segments. Water business revenues declined 3% organically in Q1 compared to strong prior year results, which included an estimated $2 million or 8% growth benefit from accelerated stocking orders. Adjusting for these impacts, water revenues increased solidly year-on-year as we continue to see relative improvement in noncompliance related testing volumes that have been constrained during the pandemic. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue increased 9% organically in Q1, driven by growth in our Asia Pacific region. 
Q1 results saw approximately $2 million of favorability from shipment timing, which largely offset favorable shipment timing impacts of Q1 of 2020. LPD results benefited from strong demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever and growth in core swine testing volumes in China, supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine herds. These gains more than offset lower herd health screening levels compared to strong prior year results. 
We expect to see some pressure in our LPD revenue growth rate moving forward particularly in the second half of this year as we begin to lap the benefits from high prior year demand for our African swine fever testing programs and see increased levels of local competition in China. 
Turning to the P&L. We had strong profit flow-through in Q1 as we benefited from high CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains and comparisons to relatively higher pre-COVID operating expense levels in the first quarter of 2020. Overall, operating margins expanded 830 basis points year-on-year on a comparable basis, driving an increase in operating profits of 72% as reported and 65% on a comparable basis. Gross profit increased 31% in Q1. Gross margins increased 320 basis points on a comparable basis, reflecting productivity improvement in our lab operations, supported by higher organic revenue growth, favorable impacts from strong consumable sales and benefits from moderate net price gains. 
We're planning for gross margin gains to moderate over the balance of this year as we lap tightly controlled prior year spending levels at increased reference lab staffing to support high revenue growth and service levels. Operating expenses in Q1 increased 4% as reported and 3% on a comparable basis. As noted, operating expense growth was moderated by comparisons to higher prior year pre-COVID spending levels, including much higher prior year first quarter travel, trade show and sales meeting costs. Our 2020 financial outlook includes expectations for an increased rate of OpEx growth moving forward as we lap comparisons to control prior OpEx levels and invest to support our strong global growth momentum through enhancements to our commercial and innovation capability. 
We're also planning for year-on-year increases in costs in key areas such as employee health care claims and travel costs, as we work through the year and pandemic related restrictions are eased. Q1 EPS was $2.35 per share, including benefits of $15 million or $0.17 per share related to share-based compensation activity. 
On a comparable basis, Q1 EPS increased 73%. Foreign exchange added $10 million to operating profits and $0.09 to EPS in Q1, net of approximately $2 million in hedge losses. Free cash flow was $104 million in Q1. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 99%, including benefits from delayed capital spending and extension of tax payments. 
For the full year, we're maintaining a consistent outlook for free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90% of net income. Our balance sheet remains in a very strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.0x gross and 0.6x net of cash, with $350 million in cash and no borrowings and our $1 billion revolving credit facility. 
We reinitiated share repurchases in Q1, allocating $154 million of capital to repurchase 305,000 shares. 
Turning to our '21 full year outlook. We're increasing our projected ranges for overall revenue growth to 14.5% to 16.5% as reported. This reflects a 150 basis point increase in our projected organic revenue growth range, offset by approximately $5 million in refinements to our FX assumptions, which now point to a positive 1.5% full year growth benefit this year at the rate shared in our press release. 
Our updated organic -- overall organic revenue growth outlook of 13% to 15% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 14.5% to 16% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. As noted, we've raised the CAG Dx recurring revenue growth outlook by 2% at midpoint to reflect our strong Q1 results, trends that point towards a sustained high rate of U.S. clinic visit growth, and confidence in our global CAG commercial execution, which is driving strong momentum in our international regions. 
As a benchmark, our updated recurring revenue growth outlook aligns with the higher end of our earlier projections for 2% to 5% same-store U.S. clinical visit growth for the full year 2021 and an expected premium of IDEXX U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth to clinic visit growth of approximately 900 to 1,000 basis points. The increase in our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook, which results in over $50 million of operational revenue upside, is being moderated by relatively more conservative full year projections for IDEXX human COVID testing. We estimate that we'll see approximately $10 million in lower human COVID revenues year-on-year in the second half of 2021 as we lap the benefits of our prior initiatives and plan for moderation in testing levels. We've also moderated our outlook for LPD growth to reflect increased local competition in China, including in our African swine fever testing business. 
Combined, these effects result in a 0.5% headwind compared to our earlier overall organic growth outlook. Given the lapping of prior year COVID impacts, there will likely be significant variability in year-on-year revenue growth rates by quarter, with continued expectations for higher revenue growth in the first half of 2021. 
In terms of key financial metrics, as noted, we're now targeting 150 to 200 basis points of annual comparable operating margin improvement in 2021, up 100 basis points from our initial outlook. This is reflected in our reported operating margin outlook for 2021 of 28.3% to 28.8%. Our EPS outlook incorporates updated projections for foreign exchange, which we now estimate will provide $0.15 of positive EPS benefit in 2021, net of established hedge positions. Our full year outlook also includes an updated estimate of $0.19 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, $0.09 per share higher than our initial projections. 
We provided details on our updated estimates and the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments."

IDEXX had an excellent start to 2021, driven by continued strong market trends in our core CAG business and strong execution. This resulted in 21% quarterly organic revenue growth in the first quarter and high profit flow",1764,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX had an excellent start to 2021, driven by continued strong market trends in our core CAG business and strong execution. This resulted in 21% quarterly organic revenue growth in the first quarter and high profit flow through. Supported by 23% organic growth for CAG diagnostics recurring revenues. There were strong gains across all our market segments. 
Our business performance reinforces the tremendous long-term opportunity we see to develop the global market for companion animal health care and gives us confidence to raise our 2021 outlook to deliver 14.5% to 16% organic growth for CAG diagnostics recurring revenues and 21% to 26% gains in comparable EPS growth. 
Today, I'll provide provide an update on the trends we're seeing in our companion animal markets and our approach to drive accelerated market growth, leveraging IDEXX innovation to raise the standard of patient care. I'll also provide an update on our product and commercial initiatives that will enable us to capitalize on market tailwinds and position the company to deliver continued strong financial returns. Let's begin with an update on market trends. Companion animal health care continues to see strong global market momentum. This is reflected, for example, in the U.S. market data showing higher growth in clinical visits and continued high-growth in services, supported by expanded utilization of diagnostics. 
As Brian highlighted, we saw continued high U.S. clinic visit growth, up 12% in the quarter, with nonwellness visits up 9% and wellness visits up 16%,  with strong growth seen across practices of all sizes. New patients continue to be a significant contributor to clinical visit gains. We estimate that new clinical patients added approximately 3% to overall clinical growth versus Q1 2020, up from 1% to 2% in the second half of 2020. And and we continue to see record levels in progesterone testing, evidence of a continued step-up in breeder activity. The growth in puppies and kids and continued evidence of the deepening of the pet owner bond, augmented by the growth in new pet parents can provide long-term tailwinds for our business. 
As a benchmark, we estimate that the average annual diagnostic revenue per senior or geriatric pet, is double the amount we see per pet for puppies and kittens. If we do our job well with programs like Preventive Care, we can help to drive twice the level of annual visits in young well pets and continue to expand diagnostics usage through life stages, thereby helping advance standards of care. In looking at our U.S. market data, we've seen an acceleration in the utilization of diagnostics. In our earnings snapshot, we shared annual data for the percentage of 2020 clinical visits, including blood work. The percentage of clinical visits with blood work increased approximately 1% to 18% percent in 2020, double the historical rate of annual increase. Interestingly, the highest increases were in customer deciles doing more testing. With gains across wellness and nonwellness blood work utilization, reinforcing the point that even the highest users of diagnostics have significant potential for further growth. 
An increased focus on services, and adoption of higher standards of care in areas like diagnostics are driving very strong overall growth in veterinary clinics. In the first quarter, same-store total practice revenues increased 15% versus the same quarter last year, reflecting a 19% growth in clinical revenue per practice and 21% growth in Diagnostics revenues. Clearly, our customers are extremely busy. It's not surprising that they are looking for help from partners like IDEXX to support their high levels of business growth through our customer-centric solutions offering. We're particularly pleased with our commercial execution to support these customer needs, evidenced by 32% year-over-year growth in premium instrument placements globally, including strong growth in placements at new and competitive accounts. 
A key area of focus has been leveraging our integrated direct go-to-market model to accelerate international growth. We achieved 28% CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth internationally in Q1, with strong gains across all our major regions, while driving a 36% year-over-year increase in premium instrument placements outside of North America despite continued restrictions in sales access to clinics. IDEXX 360 continues to gain traction internationally, resulting in higher growth with customers, leveraging IDEXX technology across modalities. IDEXX 360 is helping to accelerate growth in our international reference labs in key markets like Europe, supported by our state of the art, new core lab in Kornwestheim, Germany, and our expanded commercial presence. 
The international commercial expansion efforts we've highlighted continued to progress per plan, with the goal of completing onboarding of new sales teams in key markets in the first half of 2021. The outstanding growth momentum and long-term potential for IDEXX in international markets reinforces the high-return from investments in our global commercial capability. Advancing international commercial expansions will continue to be a key strategy. Innovation is another key pillar in our growth strategy. In late March, we reached an exciting milestone when we began shipments of our next-generation hematology analyzer, ProCyte One. I'm very proud of the extended team. Including our Westbrook, Maine, based instrument manufacturing personnel for delivering this world-class analyzer on schedule during a pandemic to the delight of our customers. Our first sales and installations were to U.S. clinics that participated in our customer experience trials, which is a testament to their highly positive experience with the analyzer. ProCyte One's exceptional simplicity and accuracy give our customers confidence in running the analyzer and in the patient results. 
This is helping to gain efficiencies and practices in this truly a best-in-class experience. ProCyte One also represents the next step for IDEXX in providing leading-edge technology, integrated with information management, which enables clinical decision support and supports a wide range of veterinarian partners in providing the highest levels of care. We expect ProCyte One to drive CAG growth as chemistry and hematology testing go hand-in-hand and it's part of the IDEXX 360 program to help drive Reference Lab usage. This quarter, our commercial focus for ProCyte One is on shipments to the clinics that took advantage of our presales program while concurrently manufacturing and building volume to support our sales ramp through 2021, including the international rollout expected to begin in late Q2, early Q3. 
The SNAP Pro instrument is another investment in innovation that supports our customers at the point-of-care by providing workflow benefits, accurate reading of diagnostic results on the SNAP platform and SmartService connectivity. Our veterinary partners are busier than ever. So providing ease of information management within the practice is a key benefit to help them save precious time while maintaining accurate records. SNAP Pro provides a tool to address these needs and has helped drive recent growth internationally for our rapid assay business. We see high engagement from international customers who are actively using SNAP Pro and are connected to SmartService, with growth and retention rates consistent with trends across U.S. customers. We're also making excellent progress in expanding our installed base in key geographic markets like Europe, which helped to drive 20% organic growth in global rapid assay revenues in the first quarter. 
Our innovation agenda is also driving favorable business performance for our software portfolio, which had another excellent quarter. Record-breaking worldwide PIMS placements in the quarter grew 43% versus Q1 of last year, with 2 out of every 3 PIMS placements driven by cloud based technology. IDEXX Web PACS saw double-digit growth in subscribers, including improvements in customer retention levels to over 96%. We received consistent price from subscribers about usability, value and support of the web PAC system. Important feedback as we look to expand this product into new markets. 
These integrated offerings together create a diversified technology stack that provides multiple customer benefits to help manage the growing productivity demands of veterinary clinics in a high-growth market. Through our PIMS tools -- through our PIMS and tools like SmartFlow, our focus is on improving clinic workflow by seamlessly connecting data between devices to streamline every step from patient admission to discharge. By bringing AI capability to tools like Web PACS, our platforms enable faster procedures, while leveraging data to deliver insights and reduce efforts by clinic staff. Extending to the client, our communication applications are more compelling than ever, with clinics managing a significant portion of visits curbside. 
Connected software is critical for clinics in creating capacity to meet the increasing demands for veterinary services. IDEXX is uniquely positioned to serve customer needs in this area, enhancing our value proposition and differentiation. In terms of other key initiatives, we continue to promote the advancement of preventive care and annual wellness testing through the IDEXX Preventive Care program. In addition to increasing the standard of patient care, preventive care programs can help veterinarians improve practice capacity, do more predictable schedule and level loading of practice staff. In the first quarter, the commercial team executed over 200 new enrollments, bringing total enrollments to over 5,000, which is an exciting milestone as we are more than halfway to our goal of 10,000 enrolled customers in the U.S. by 2024. As our customers enter the wellness testing season, and wellness visits accelerate in the market, we are focused on continuing to capture the underdeveloped market opportunity in vector borne disease testing. There are significant long-term opportunities to expand vector board disease testing, in particular, given the current prevalence of heartworm only testing in the U.S., shifting this balance to a full vector born disease screening using 40x Plus not only enhances the standard of care, it represents a material opportunity for clinics to drive additional revenue. This focus and strong underlying market trends helped to deliver double-digit revenue growth across all regions, led by increases in utilization of 40x Plus and feline retrovirus tests. 
As we look ahead, we're very excited about the opportunity to leverage our commercial capability, innovation and partnerships with our customers to build on our strong growth trends. A key area of focus for us is to continue to invest in the infrastructure necessary to meet high levels of growth, while maintaining top-notch service levels and prioritizing support for our workforce. Our employees and customers have shown high levels of adaptability and resiliency during continued COVID-related restrictions, and we look forward to a post-COVID-19 environment. 
We anticipate more flexibility in the future and leveraging new ways of working together with our colleagues and customers. I'd like to add that I'm extremely proud of the way that the IDEXX team is executing. We are on track for a strong 2021. That concludes my opening remarks, and we now have time for some questions."

So if you recall, we had $25 million of OpEx savings that we highlighted last second quarter, another $5 million of savings from lower health care costs. We really, in the early stages of the pandemic, tried to be very mindful of how we're controlling labor costs in areas like the labs. And so we're just trying to highlight, as we move forward, we're going to see some of those comparison effects, moderate the margin gains, the gross margin gains, and we'll see relatively higher OpEx growth. Again, it's a benchmark. Just in Q1, we had over $7 million of cost reduction year-on-year from things like lower sales meeting costs and T&E, which is about 7% of OpEx growth. So moving forward, we won't have those kind of favorability. So we're just trying to highlight that. And we're also trying to highlight that we're advancing investment in the business.

We saw higher levels of contribution from frequency and utilization and those have sustained. If there was one thing that improved a bit in Q1, which we highlighted in the comments, was the new patient contribution to clinical visit growth was up about 100 basis points. So I think some of the building effect of the new puppies and kittens helped. But adjusting for that, the 2-year growth rates were largely consistent with Q4. It was more consistency than change. We're entering a period now where we'll have the COVID compares. The growth rate numbers are a little tougher to follow so we're trying to highlight some of the 2-year trends. And I think we're encouraged that the 2-year trends are holding up well, and that's factored into our outlook for the balance of the year."

So we tend to place those together. There's -- as part of IDEXX 360, there's pull-through in terms of the Reference Labs and rapid assay, not just in the U.S. now, but internationally.

We're going to be up against some compares here, but I think, on balance, we feel very good about the trends, and if anything, they improved a bit in Q1. 
And as a benchmark, we do try to highlight that U.S. clinical visit growth and premium dynamic that you mentioned, and our initial estimates were 2% to 5% for the full year for clinical visit growth, that's a 1-year basis, and the 900 to 1,000 basis point premium.

It's been a very successful rollout, very successful customer experience trials, and not easy to do, by the way, in the middle of a pandemic. This is complex -- the instrument, and it has a world-class user interface and performs at a very high level from just an accuracy standpoint. We've identified the hematology opportunity is very significant for the company. Keep in mind, a lot of our international markets are hematology first markets. So what that means if they have a choice in terms of -- if it's one instrument or none, they tend to choose hematology and they test with hematology even before chemistry, even when they have both. So in terms of the opportunity itself, as I earlier described it's almost 100,000 placement opportunities, 2/3 plus of which is internationally. 
But even more importantly, if I pivot just a higher level comment, it's an important part of our overall in-clinic solution. We tend to sell chemistry and hematology, increasingly SediVue together. So having this type of solution, which from a performance and cost profile standpoint, hits the sweet spot of the market, is obviously very attractive to us. The other thing that I would point out is that, increasingly, the IDEXX 360 program is just getting terrific traction internationally. And as part of that, the capital placement piece is the anchor. And there's pull-through on reference labs and rapid assay in terms of delivering the underlying volume commitments. So we're excited by the overall CAG Diagnostics opportunity that ProCyte One represents. It's going to have, we think, a very long tail, both duration as well as overall volume opportunity.

And our belief is that the fecal antigen tests that we offer at the Reference Lab is best-in-class. It detects up to 2x as much than traditional benefits like O&P.

And then you can develop an algorithm that protects eggs as part of the parasites or worms. But at the end of the day, they have to be available, that you have to be able to visually see them. The benefit in being able to detect through antigen testing is you are able to see them in the prepatent period, which is between 4 and 6 weeks earlier than physically when the eggs are available. So you get better detection piece. So we like our solutions. We think our customers appreciate fecal antigen at the reference labs, and that's where we continue to support them."

I'm pleased to take you through our second quarter results and to provide an update on our full year financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered another quarter of outstanding financial results supported by continued strong global momentum in our companion animal business. Revenue increased 30% as reported and 25% organically, supported by 26% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued high gains across U.S. and international regions. 
As we work through comparisons to prior year COVID impacts, we'll be highlighting select 2-year average annual revenue growth metrics to calibrate our business trends. In the second quarter, average annual 2-year organic growth for CAG diagnostic recurring revenues was 16%, in line with the strong 2-year growth trends in Q4 and Q1. 
Operating profit increased 30% on a comparable basis in the second quarter, reflecting benefits from high revenue growth and moderate operating margin gains.

High operating profit gains enabled delivery of $2.34 in earnings per share, an increase of 33% on a comparable basis. 
Continued strong momentum in our CAG business has us on track to deliver high revenue and profit gains in 2021. We're raising our full year revenue growth outlook range by $55 million at midpoint to $3.170 billion to $3.205 billion. This reflects an outlook for reported revenue growth of 17% to 18.5%, including favorable impacts from FX changes and benefits from our recent acquisitions. 
Our updated full year outlook is for 14.5% to 16% overall organic revenue growth and 16% to 17.5% growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. These organic growth ranges are 1% to 1.5% higher than our last outlook, reflecting expectations for sustained strong performance in our CAG business globally. 
Our full year financial outlook reflects a targeted 175 to 225 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable basis, up 25 basis points from our last outlook, as we advance increased investments in our CAG innovation and commercial capabilities. We're increasing our EPS outlook to $8.20 to $8.36 per share of $0.25 per share at midpoint reflecting 25% to 27% full year comparable EPS growth. We'll discuss our updated 2021 financial outlook later in my comments. 
Let's begin with a review of our second quarter results and recent sector trends. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 25% was driven by 27% CAG revenue gains and 27% growth in our water business, benefited from the lapping of prior year pandemic impacts. As noted, CAG diagnostic recurring revenues increased 26% organically, reflecting 24% growth in the U.S. and 30% growth in international regions. On a 2-year basis, average annual CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 16% overall, reflecting 16% gains in the U.S. and 18% growth in international. Strong CAG results were also supported by 78% organic growth in CAG diagnostic instrument revenues compared to constrained prior year levels. 
Q2 growth in U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenues was aided by high year-on-year gains in U.S. clinical business, benefiting in part from comparisons to lower visit levels in April and May of 2020. U.S. clinical visit growth was 13% overall in Q2 with strong gains across nonwellness and wellness visit categories. On an average 2-year basis, same-store clinical visit growth increased at a 4.8% annual rate, down modestly from strong Q1 results. The IDEXX U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was approximately 1,100 basis points in the second quarter, up moderately and on track with our full year outlook. 
Expanding pet health care services, including continued solid increases in the utilization of diagnostics, supported a 16% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q2. Diagnostic revenue per practice increased 15% on a 1-year basis and 12% on an average 2-year basis in Q2. 
Looking ahead to the second half of 2021. As noted on our last call, we expect to see lower levels of 1 year growth in U.S. clinical visits and CAG diagnostic revenue gains as we lap the significant step-up in demand we saw in the second half of 2020. These dynamics are factored into our revenue guidance, which projects sustained strong tier growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues in H2. IDEXX innovation and commercial initiatives continue to build on positive health care demand trends, driving high Q2 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 25% organically in Q2, reflecting 20% plus organic gains in the U.S. and approximately 30% growth in international regions. 
Our international reference lab gains continue to benefit from strong growth in Europe, supported by our new German core lab capability, our expanded commercial presence and growth in IDEXX 360 program agreements. Global reference lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth with strong gains across testing categories. 
IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 26% on an organic basis in the second quarter, also reflecting continued 20% plus growth in the U.S. and approximately 30% organic gains in international. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. CAG instrument placements increased significantly in Q2 compared to constrained prior year levels. Total premium placements reached 3,756 units, up over 400 units from strong Q1 results and double the placement levels seen last year. 
The quality of CAG instrument placements remains excellent, reflected in 308 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 87% year-on-year and 938 new and competitive placements in international regions, up 75%. We also benefited from 571 second catalyst placements driven by continued strong demand from high-volume customers. These new placements and high customer retention levels supported a 14% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst installed base. 
We achieved 1,119 premium hematology placements, including hundreds of ProCyte One installs as we advance our global rollout schedule. This supported 11% growth in our global premium hematology installed base compared to Q2 of 2020. We also placed 662 SediVues, including strong placement levels in international regions under IDEXX 360 agreements, which supported a year-on-year global increase in our premium urine sediment installed base by 24%. 
We're looking forward to building on this momentum as we gain increased direct access at veterinary clinics globally and supports strong demand for diagnostic testing. 
Rapid assay revenues also expanded at a strong 28% organic growth rate in Q2, reflecting 20% plus gains in the U.S., supported by high demand for wellness testing and accelerated 30%-plus growth in international geographies. Of note, core vector-borne disease retention rates for U.S. rapid assay reached 97% in the quarter. aligned with sustained high IDEXX retention rates across our major modalities. High CAG diagnostic revenue growth remains primarily volume driven across our modalities with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%. 
In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 26% organically and 33% as reported, including initial benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition. We saw high growth in diagnostic imaging system placements driven by favorable customer response to our entry-level Image view DR30 platform with approximately 80% of placements at competitive accounts. We also continue to see 20%-plus growth in recurring digital service revenues, including expansion of web pack subscriptions, aligned with our expanding cloud-based capability. In our veterinary software services business, we posted double-digit organic revenue gains driven by growth in Cornerstone and EO placements and strong growth in recurring services. 
As Jay will discuss, we expanded our cloud-based software capability through our recently announced acquisition of ezyVet, which closed in June. We estimate ezyVet will contribute approximately $15 million to full year 2021 revenues which is factored into our updated outlook. 
Turning to our other business segments. Water business revenues increased 27% organically in Q2 compared to 16% declines in last year's second quarter driven by early pandemic-related impacts. We continue to see a solid recovery in demand for water testing as economies reopen, including recovery in noncompliance-related testing volumes that have been more constrained during the pandemic. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue decreased 2% organically in Q2. Growth results were constrained by the lapping of high prior year demand in key areas such as African swine fever testing. Revenue growth was also impacted by relatively lower herd health screening levels reflecting reduced exports, including effects from restrictions on live animal imports into China. We're planning on reduced LPD revenues year-on-year in the second half of 2021 as we continue to lap the benefits from high prior year demand for our ASF programs and manage through expected pressure on our China LPD business, from rebuilding swine birds, low port prices and changing government requirements related to livestock infectious disease programs. 
Turning to the P&L. We had another quarter of strong profit gains in Q2, driven primarily by benefits from high year-on-year CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains. We're now starting to work through comparisons to control cost levels in the prior year that were implemented as part of our pandemic contingency management efforts. Despite these dynamics, our strong revenue growth supported a solid 110 basis point expansion of our operating margins on a comparable basis, helping to drive an increase in operating profits of 34% as reported and 30% on a comparable basis. Gross profit increased 29% in Q2, driven by higher revenue gains. Gross margins decreased modestly on a comparable basis, reflecting mix impacts from higher instrument revenue and moderated lab gross margin gains as we lap tightly controlled prior cost levels in key areas such as lab operations. 
Gross margin gains continue to benefit from strong CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth, including positive impacts from moderate price gains. We're planning for constrained gross margin gains over the balance of this year as we continue to tightly controlled prior year spending levels and see impacts from increases in reference lab staffing and capacity aligned with supporting high revenue growth. 
Operating expenses in Q2 increased 24% as reported and 20% on a comparable basis. In Q2 of 2020, we advanced approximately $25 million of cost reductions related to plan levels, including temporary reductions in salary and benefits and also saw significant cost reductions in other areas such as employee health care cost accruals. The higher operating expense cost growth in Q2 reflects lapping these dynamics as well as the advancement of investments in our global commercial and innovation capability aligned with our accelerated revenue growth profile. We anticipate operating expense growth will be higher than revenue growth in the second half of 2021 as these investments and the integration of the ezyVet acquisition advance. We also expect to see relative increases in costs such as employee health care claims and travel as pandemic-related restrictions are eased. 
Q2 EPS was $2.34 per share, including benefits of $6 million or $0.07 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable basis, Q2 EPS increased 33%. Foreign exchange added $8 million to operating profits and $0.07 to EPS in Q2, net of $3 million in hedge losses. Free cash flow was $211 million in the quarter and $316 million for the first half of 2021. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 95%, including benefits from delayed capital spending and extension of tax payments last year. We're increasing our outlook for full year 2021 capital spending to $150 million to $160 million to reflect additional investments to support manufacturing and distribution growth capacity, including approximately $20 million in real estate purchases. With this higher level of projected spending, we're updating our free cash flow conversion outlook for the full year to approximately 80% of net income. 
Our balance sheet remains in a very strong position. We ended the quarter with debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratios of 0.9x gross and 0.7x net of cash with $232 million in cash and no borrowings on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We allocated $188 million in capital to repurchase 341,000 shares in the quarter. 
Turning to our 2021 full year outlook. We're increasing our projected range for overall revenue to $3.170 billion to $3.205 billion. At midpoint, this reflects approximately $30 million in organic operational improvement, approximately $10 million benefit from updated FX assumptions and approximately $15 million in increased full year revenue benefit from acquisitions. Our updated revenue outlook is 17% to 18.5% as reported, including approximately 2% of full year growth benefit from FX at approximately 0.5% benefit from acquisitions. 
Our updated overall organic revenue growth outlook of 14.5% to 16% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 16% to 17.5% for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue. The high end of our CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook range reflects 2-year average annual growth rates in line with strong H1 performance levels. As noted on a 1-year growth basis, we expect to see moderation in H2 from very high year-on-year growth rates seen in the first half of this year. As we work through the acceleration -- comparison to the acceleration of growth that we saw in the second half of 2020, including fulfillment of pent-up demand in last year's third quarter. 
Other elements of our revenue growth outlook include expectations for lower year-on-year LPD revenues in the second half and for a reduction in human COVID testing revenues year-on-year as we lap the benefits of our prior year initiatives and planned for lower human PCR testing levels. 
In terms of key financial metrics, we're increasing our reported operating margin outlook for 2021 to 28.6% to 29.1%, reflecting increased expectations for 175 to 225 basis points or full year annual -- full year comparable operating margin improvement. 
Our EPS outlook incorporates updated projections for foreign exchange, which we now estimate will provide $0.17 of positive full year EPS benefit net of established hedge positions. Our full year outlook also includes an updated estimate of $0.25 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, $0.06 per share higher than our prior projections. We provided details on our updated estimates on the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. 
That concludes our financial view. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments."

Today, we're pleased to report another quarter of strong results, supported by continued favorable trends in our core CAG business and excellent execution by the IDEXX team. As noted, we delivered 25% organic revenue growth in the second quarter, supported by high organic CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth. There were strong gains across all CAG business segments and testing modalities, representing a continuation of the accelerated growth trends we've seen since the second half of 2020. Strong sector growth and outstanding execution by the IDEXX team gives us confidence to raise our 2021 financial outlook as we continue to invest towards our significant long-term growth opportunity. 
Today, I'll provide a brief update on the trends we're seeing in key regions in our companion animal sector and discuss the status of our initiatives to strengthen our international commercial capabilities. I'll also share an update on our ProCyte One launch and growing software portfolio, including the ezyVet acquisition, which will better position us to capitalize on favorable tailwinds, further enhance practice productivity and raise the standard of patient care. 
Let me start with an update on sector trends. Global sector trends remained favorable in the second quarter, reflected, for example, in sustained high U.S. clinical visit models that support continued strong increases in veterinary service revenues, including diagnostics. As Brian noted, U.S. clinical visits increased 13% in the quarter and 4.8% on a 2-year average annual basis, with continued strong gains across wellness and nonwellness categories. This growth was supported by a growing pet population and veterinarians focus on medical services, which are sustained even as pandemic restrictions have eased. These solid trends were seen across all global regions in Q2. Our strong commercial execution is building on this momentum, reflecting in IDEXX CAG diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth of 26% on a 1-year basis, and 16% on a 2-year average annual basis. 
Within the clinic, veterinarians and the teams continue to rise to the challenge of increased demand, working hard to keep up with industry growth while also delivering excellent patient care to ever more engaged pet parents. IDEXX is well positioned to provide them the tools and services necessary to meet these demands, supporting 15% diagnostics revenue growth per practice and even faster growth for IDEXX revenues. 
Overall, we feel very positive about the strong sector backdrop. Our strategy to bring testing and information management and innovations to the practice and our team's level of execution, which is reflected in our raised full year revenue outlook. 
In terms of execution, our commercial team continues to deliver exceptional results despite continued constrained clinic access. It replacement showed increased momentum in the second quarter with over 3,750 total premium placements, up solidly from a strong Q1, helping to drive 14% growth in our premium worldwide installed base for the quarter. This included double-digit growth in premium chemistry, hematology and urinalysis installed bases as well as continued excellent growth in new and competitive accounts. Veterinary customers are extremely busy due to high visit volumes. And they're investing in IDEXX instruments, diagnostics and tools to support practice growth, patient care and staff productivity. 
Our digital cytology solution is an excellent example of this point. An innovative service that extends the capability and reach of the practice by providing cytology testing results in the U.S. with a report authored by expert pathologists another 2 hours at any time during the day or week, 365 days a year, veterinarians are able to provide a higher standard of care to their patients, improve staff and clinical productivity and drive appropriate testing and practice revenues. 
Validating this medical value proposition, we saw strong customer interest in orders for a digital cytology solution in Q2. We also continue to advance key programs like IDEXX Preventive Care that help clinics raised the standard of care aligned with higher levels of pet owner engagement. In Q2, we executed 150 new preventive care enrollments as we continue to advance towards our goal of 10,000 engaged customers in the U.S. by 2024. 
In terms of customer access, we continue to operate in a hybrid model, with access to limited but improving in both the U.S. and international regions. In the U.S., approximately 60% of customer visits were in person in Q2, whereas it was approximately 50% in Europe. This has impacted our ability to deliver outstanding results as both new innovations and our excellent relationships we have with customers have driven significant growth across all regions. The deep customer relationships with our sales professionals have only been reinforced and strengthened by the best-in-class support we provided to customers throughout the pandemic. 
Of note, we're particularly pleased with our high levels of execution in regions like Europe, where we are expanding the successful go-to-market approaches we've applied in the U.S. This was reflected in 400 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts outside of North America, with half of these placements under IDEXX 360 agreements. The expansion of the IDEXX 360 program is also supporting sustained strong gains in lab revenues in Europe, accelerating new account acquisition and helping to inspire faster customer growth at IDEXX 360 customers. 
A key focus of our strategy in this context is on developing the long-term international revenue opportunity through an expansion of our direct commercial presence. We've completed the commercial expansions first announced in Q3 of last year, which were focused on 3 countries: Germany, France and South Korea. By almost doubling our commercial footprint in these countries, we have appreciably increased the frequency and intensity of our calling activities with existing customers and competitive accounts. Our experience is that when we do this, our customers grow faster as they adopt our innovations. And so do we. 
Three additional countries have been targeted at the next stage for expansion over the remainder of 2021 and into 2022. We're excited to share with you our broader commercial approach at the upcoming Investor Day. 
Our expanding global commercial capability will support the adoption of key innovations like ProCyte One, following our first U.S. shipments in late March, ProCyte One's international launch began in June with installations and presale customers in France, Germany, U.K. and in Southern Europe. Many of our international geographies are hematology-focused, meaning customers prioritize CBC for patient health assessment. Not surprisingly, we've seen an extremely positive reaction to the ProCyte One introduction in international regions. Customers applied its simplicity and small footprint while still delivering the excellent accuracy, usability and reliability profile veterinarians and their staff price so highly. Additionally, we expect a multiplier impact for ProCyte One as chemistry and hematology testing go hand in hand with the additional potential to inspire Reference Lab and Rapid Assay business when placed as part of the IDEXX 360 program. 
Speaking of Rapid Assay, we're very pleased with the strong momentum we continue to drive in this business globally. We achieved 20% plus organic growth in the U.S. in Q2. And while raising customer retention levels to 97% supported by innovations like SNAP Pro, we now have over 80% of SNAP 4Dx customer volume engaged on this platform, which enhances insight and supports practice workflow. SNAP Pro is also helping to achieve accelerated growth in international regions. In Europe, after installing a clinics first SNAP Pro, we see a significant expansion in testing volumes. We look forward to building on the strong momentum supported by continued IDEXX innovation. 
We're also excited with the progress we're advancing in our cloud-based software capability. We had another excellent quarter of new software installations with Cornerstone and NEO placements growing 21%, while cloud-based offerings continue to represent the majority of PIMS placements. As we continue to expand our installed base,  we also continue to drive expansion of profitable recurring services, such as credit card processing, which grew at strong double-digit rates organically. Software solutions have taken on significant importance to the effective management of the veterinary Practices have never been busier, and IDEXX integrated, easy-to-use software solutions support patient care and workflow, staff productivity and communications amongst the care team and with the client. Moreover, IDEXX diagnostic solutions are seamlessly integrated into both our and third-party solutions, enabling practices to capture and invoice the full range of activities that veterinarian caliber. We know that IDEXX customers who use all of our solutions have a higher customer experience and tend to test more and grow faster. 
Relating to the growing importance of practice software solutions, cloud-based technologies have the potential to make important contributions to the overall software experience of the veterinary clinic. For example, practice owners are free from the challenges of supporting on-premise IT solutions that include frequent hardware update. Moreover, providers of cloud-based solutions like IDEXX can provide frequent seamless updates in an environment that offers security advantages. Our software capabilities were augmented in Q2 with the acquisition of ezyVet, a fast-growing, innovative practice information management system that is native cloud-based used by advanced general practices as well as specialty, emergency and large corporate groups worldwide. This acquisition complements our PIMS portfolio by providing additional options to practice with more complex needs and enterprise functionality. Customers appreciate ezyVet software for its easy use and rich features. In fact, ezyVet is the #1 rated full future practice management solution with 94% customer satisfaction according to CAPTERRA, an industry standard business software customer review site. 
Bringing ezyVet into the IDEXX family also grows our cloud development talent enabling us to capitalize on the evolving nature of the veterinary clinic software product. 
With that, I'd like to welcome the ezyVet team to IDEXX. We look forward to working together with you to continue to develop best-in-class software products. We're also excited about the progress we're driving in our diagnostic imaging business. We saw very strong growth in digital imaging placements in Q2 and strong growth in our backlog, reflecting a continued appreciation of our focus on providing a full range of premier low-dose imaging solutions. Growth in these placements also supports the expansion of recurring services, including cloud-based services like web pack. Our Web pack subscriptions grew at high teens rates with much faster growth in premium and unlimited subscription tiers, reflecting the high value and diagnostic insight clinicians drive from IDEXX software solutions. 
Overall, we're very pleased with our business momentum and optimistic as we continue to respond to the reopening of economies globally. In terms of IDEXX' specific plans, we're excited to advance plans to bring more IDEXX back to the office safely and in ways that ensure business continuity. We anticipate maintaining a more hybrid working environment and appreciate our employees flexibility, and adapted to new ways of working while continuing to deliver high growth, provide top-notch customer service and support our world-class product portfolio. 
Before I wrap up my remarks, I'd like to publicly welcome a new leader to IDEXX. As Dr. Martin Smith will be joining my leadership team in August as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. Martin brings 30-plus years of experience in the life sciences industry, most recently as Chief Technology Officer at Sativa and Pall Corporation, both subsidiaries of Danaher. He's a strong track record of driving R&D strategy in concert with enterprise strategic initiatives, commercial efforts, and we look forward to at leading our world-class R&D organization. Welcome, Martin. 
With that, I'd like to add that I'm extremely proud of the way the entire IDEXX team is executing as we are on track for another strong year in 2021 with financial performance aligned with our long-term goals. Our growth and performance reflect a consistent business strategy focused on opportunity development within our core businesses and our employees continue to execute against this strategy daily. 
I look forward to sharing more on our strategy and long-term potential at our upcoming Investor Day on Thursday, August 12. The event remains virtual due to the evolving nature of COVID-19 and we invite you to register on the Investor Relations section of our website. Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Brian McKeon, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President and General Manager for Point of Care Diagnostics and Worldwide Operations; Mike Lee, Executive Vice President and GM for Reference Laboratories and Information Management, Jim Polacek, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Kerry Bennett, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Advanced Analytics and Michael Schrock, Senior Vice President of Veterinary Software and Services. The event will last approximately 3 hours and will conclude with a Q&A session. 
That concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for questions."

We've talked about the commercial investments, particularly in areas like international and our R&D organization. We're leaning into the positive growth. And overall, we think that will create an environment where we've got sustained higher OpEx growth year-on-year and it will be above the revenue growth, which is now up against tougher compares.

It's pretty much in line with what we saw in Q1 and Q4. And so that's very encouraging. I think we're benefiting from continued solid market trends at the clinic level and the visit number was down a bit Q4 to Q1, but the diagnostic revenue growth on a 1-year and a 2-year stack basis sustained at very good rates. So all indications are demand is holding up very well, and that's informing our full year outlook. The higher end of our outlook ranges for the 2-year trends to continue in the second half for CAG Dx recurring and we obviously have a range because there may be some other dynamics that -- we don't anticipate that go on, and we're going to learn more as we're working through, hopefully, the economies continue to open, but I think we're very encouraged by the strong trends."

So we continue to invest in innovation. We'll talk at Investor Day about our approach and the framework in terms of how we think about it, but it involves platforms and instruments and assays. And obviously, software as we've talked about, but also innovation in terms of just business models and our reference lab network. So that's alive and well and continues to be a real focus area for us. 
In terms of your questions around regional differences and testing utilization, as indicated, we've seen really strong growth across the board. The the U.S. and North America has much higher use of diagnostics, and that's something that we think, over time, we can drive increase the market adoption internationally with the TAM is about 2x from a potential opportunity standpoint relative to the U.S., and that's a function of more than just commercial expansion. It's a function of really putting in place the reference lab network like we've done in Cord West time, the centers of excellence and broader set of solutions that customers value so much. You do see some, I would say, modest differences just by country in terms of how they're reacting to the pandemic. So we've seen a little bit lower in-person visits in Europe relative to the U.S. U.S. is about 60%. Europe, for example, was 50%. But our ability to continue to support our customers and customers transacting business hasn't really changed as a result of that.

Having said that, I think what our customers would like to say, given how busy they are is more efficient visit. So at 1 point, maybe they have time for 45 minutes or an hour, and now they'd like to be able to get them the same amount of work in conversation in 20 minutes or 25 minutes. So we think there's great opportunity there to help them and increase productivity on both sides of the partnership."

I'm pleased to take you through our second quarter results and to provide an update on our full year financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered another quarter of outstanding financial results supported by",2373,"Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our second quarter results and to provide an update on our full year financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered another quarter of outstanding financial results supported by continued strong global momentum in our companion animal business. Revenue increased 30% as reported and 25% organically, supported by 26% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued high gains across U.S. and international regions.  
As we work through comparisons to prior year COVID impacts, we'll be highlighting select 2-year average annual revenue growth metrics to calibrate our business trends. In the second quarter, average annual 2-year organic growth for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues was 16%, in line with the strong 2-year growth trends in Q4 and Q1.  
Operating profit increased 30% on a comparable basis in the second quarter, reflecting benefits from high revenue growth and moderate operating margin gains as we begin to lap the tight cost controls introduced during the initial stages of the pandemic in 2020. High operating profit gains enabled delivery of $2.34 in earnings per share, an increase of 33% on a comparable basis.  
Continued strong momentum in our CAG business has us on track to deliver high revenue and profit gains in 2021. We're raising our full year revenue growth outlook range by $55 million at midpoint to $3.170 billion to $3.205 billion. This reflects an outlook for reported revenue growth of 17% to 18.5%, including favorable impacts from FX changes and benefits from our recent acquisitions.  
Our updated full year outlook is for 14.5% to 16% overall organic revenue growth and 16% to 17.5% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. These organic growth ranges are 1% to 1.5% higher than our last outlook, reflecting expectations for sustained strong performance in our CAG business globally.  
Our full year financial outlook reflects a targeted 175 to 225 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable basis, up 25 basis points from our last outlook, as we advance increased investments in our CAG innovation and commercial capabilities. We're increasing our EPS outlook to $8.20 to $8.36 per share of $0.25 per share at midpoint reflecting 25% to 27% full year comparable EPS growth.  
We'll discuss our updated 2021 financial outlook later in my comments.  
Let's begin with a review of our second quarter results and recent sector trends. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 25% was driven by 27% CAG revenue gains and 27% growth in our water business, benefited from the lapping of prior year pandemic impacts. As noted, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 26% organically, reflecting 24% growth in the U.S. and 30% growth in international regions. On a 2-year basis, average annual CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 16% overall, reflecting 16% gains in the U.S. and 18% growth in international. Strong CAG results were also supported by 78% organic growth in CAG diagnostic instrument revenues compared to constrained prior year levels.  
Q2 growth in U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues was aided by high year-on-year gains in U.S. clinical business, benefiting in part from comparisons to lower visit levels in April and May of 2020. U.S. clinical visit growth was 13% overall in Q2 with strong gains across nonwellness and wellness visit categories. On an average 2-year basis, same-store clinical visit growth increased at a 4.8% annual rate, down modestly from strong Q1 results. The IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was approximately 1,100 basis points in the second quarter, up moderately and on track with our full year outlook.  
Expanding pet health care services, including continued solid increases in the utilization of diagnostics, supported a 16% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q2. Diagnostic revenue per practice increased 15% on a 1-year basis and 12% on an average 2-year basis in Q2.  
Looking ahead to the second half of 2021. As noted on our last call, we expect to see lower levels of 1 year growth in U.S. clinical visits and CAG Diagnostic revenue gains as we lap the significant step-up in demand we saw in the second half of 2020. These dynamics are factored into our revenue guidance, which projects sustained strong tier growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in H2. 
IDEXX innovation and commercial initiatives continue to build on positive health care demand trends, driving high Q2 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 25% organically in Q2, reflecting 20% plus organic gains in the U.S. and approximately 30% growth in international regions.  
Our international reference lab gains continue to benefit from strong growth in Europe, supported by our new German core lab capability, our expanded commercial presence and growth in IDEXX 360 program agreements. Global reference lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth with strong gains across testing categories.  
IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 26% on an organic basis in the second quarter, also reflecting continued 20% plus growth in the U.S. and approximately 30% organic gains in international. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. CAG instrument placements increased significantly in Q2 compared to constrained prior year levels. Total premium placements reached 3,756 units, up over 400 units from strong Q1 results and double the placement levels seen last year.  
The quality of CAG instrument placements remains excellent, reflected in 308 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 87% year-on-year and 938 new and competitive placements in international regions, up 75%. We also benefited from 571 second catalyst placements driven by continued strong demand from high-volume customers. These new placements and high customer retention levels supported a 14% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst installed base.  
We achieved 1,119 premium hematology placements, including hundreds of ProCyte One installs as we advance our global rollout schedule. This supported 11% growth in our global premium hematology installed base compared to Q2 of 2020. We also placed 662 SediVues, including strong placement levels in international regions under IDEXX 360 agreements, which supported a year-on-year global increase in our premium urine sediment installed base by 24%.  
We're looking forward to building on this momentum as we gain increased direct access at veterinary clinics globally and supports strong demand for diagnostic testing.  
Rapid assay revenues also expanded at a strong 28% organic growth rate in Q2, reflecting 20% plus gains in the U.S., supported by high demand for wellness testing and accelerated 30%-plus growth in international geographies. Of note, core vector-borne disease retention rates for U.S. rapid assay reached 97% in the quarter, aligned with sustained high IDEXX retention rates across our major modalities. High CAG Diagnostic revenue growth remains primarily volume driven across our modalities with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%.  
In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 26% organically and 33% as reported, including initial benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition. We saw high growth in diagnostic imaging system placements driven by favorable customer response to our entry-level ImageVue DR30 platform with approximately 80% of placements at competitive accounts.
We also continue to see 20%-plus growth in recurring digital service revenues, including expansion of web pack subscriptions, aligned with our expanding cloud-based capability. In our veterinary software services business, we posted double-digit organic revenue gains driven by growth in Cornerstone and Neo placements and strong growth in recurring services.  
As Jay will discuss, we expanded our cloud-based software capability through our recently announced acquisition of ezyVet, which closed in June. We estimate ezyVet will contribute approximately $15 million to full year 2021 revenues which is factored into our updated outlook.  
Turning to our other business segments. Water business revenues increased 27% organically in Q2 compared to 16% declines in last year's second quarter driven by early pandemic-related impacts. We continue to see a solid recovery in demand for Water Testing as economies reopen, including recovery in noncompliance-related testing volumes that have been more constrained during the pandemic. 
Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue decreased 2% organically in Q2. 
Growth results were constrained by the lapping of high prior year demand in key areas such as African swine fever testing. 
Revenue growth was also impacted by relatively lower herd health screening levels reflecting reduced exports, including effects from restrictions on live animal imports into China. 
We're planning on reduced LPD revenues year-on-year in the second half of 2021 as we continue to lap the benefits from high prior year demand for our ASF programs and manage through expected pressure on our China LPD business, from rebuilding swine herds, low port prices and changing government requirements related to livestock infectious disease programs.  
Turning to the P&L. We had another quarter of strong profit gains in Q2, driven primarily by benefits from high year-on-year CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains. We're now starting to work through comparisons to control cost levels in the prior year that were implemented as part of our pandemic contingency management efforts. 
Despite these dynamics, our strong revenue growth supported a solid 110 basis point expansion of our operating margins on a comparable basis, helping to drive an increase in operating profits of 34% as reported and 30% on a comparable basis. Gross profit increased 29% in Q2, driven by higher revenue gains. 
Gross margins decreased modestly on a comparable basis, reflecting mix impacts from higher instrument revenue and moderated lab gross margin gains as we lap tightly controlled prior year cost levels in key areas such as lab operations.  
Gross margin gains continue to benefit from strong CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, including positive impacts from moderate price gains. We're planning for constrained gross margin gains over the balance of this year as we continue to tightly controlled prior year spending levels and see impacts from increases in reference lab staffing and capacity aligned with supporting high revenue growth.  
Operating expenses in Q2 increased 24% as reported and 20% on a comparable basis. In Q2 of 2020, we advanced approximately $25 million of cost reductions related to plan levels, including temporary reductions in salary and benefits and also saw significant cost reductions in other areas such as employee health care cost accruals. The higher operating expense cost growth in Q2 reflects lapping these dynamics as well as the advancement of investments in our global commercial and innovation capability aligned with our accelerated revenue growth profile. 
We anticipate operating expense growth will be higher than revenue growth in the second half of 2021 as these investments and the integration of the ezyVet acquisition advance. We also expect to see relative increases in costs such as employee health care claims and travel as pandemic-related restrictions are eased.  
Q2 EPS was $2.34 per share, including benefits of $6 million or $0.07 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable basis, Q2 EPS increased 33%. Foreign exchange added $8 million to operating profits and $0.07 to EPS in Q2, net of $3 million in hedge losses. 
Free cash flow was $211 million in the quarter and $316 million for the first half of 2021. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 95%, including benefits from delayed capital spending and extension of tax payments last year. 
We're increasing our outlook for full year 2021 capital spending to $150 million to $160 million to reflect additional investments to support manufacturing and distribution growth capacity, including approximately $20 million in real estate purchases.  
With this higher level of projected spending, we're updating our free cash flow conversion outlook for the full year to approximately 80% of net income.  
Our balance sheet remains in a very strong position. We ended the quarter with debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratios of 0.9x gross and 0.7x net of cash with $232 million in cash and no borrowings on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We allocated $188 million in capital to repurchase 341,000 shares in the quarter.  
Turning to our 2021 full year outlook. We're increasing our projected range for overall revenue to $3.170 billion to $3.205 billion. At midpoint, this reflects approximately $30 million in organic operational improvement, approximately $10 million benefit from updated FX assumptions and approximately $15 million in increased full year revenue benefit from acquisitions. Our updated revenue outlook is 17% to 18.5% as reported, including approximately 2% of full year growth benefit from FX at approximately 0.5% benefit from acquisitions.  
Our updated overall organic revenue growth outlook of 14.5% to 16% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 16% to 17.5% for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue. The high end of our CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook range reflects 2-year average annual growth rates in line with strong H1 performance levels. As noted on a 1-year growth basis, we expect to see moderation in H2 from very high year-on-year growth rates seen in the first half of this year. As we work through the acceleration -- comparison to the acceleration of growth that we saw in the second half of 2020, including fulfillment of pent-up demand in last year's third quarter.  
Other elements of our revenue growth outlook include expectations for lower year-on-year LPD revenues in the second half and for a reduction in human COVID testing revenues year-on-year as we lap the benefits of our prior year initiatives and planned for lower human PCR testing levels.  
In terms of key financial metrics, we're increasing our reported operating margin outlook for 2021 to 28.6% to 29.1%, reflecting increased expectations for 175 to 225 basis points or full year annual -- full year comparable operating margin improvement.  
Our EPS outlook incorporates updated projections for foreign exchange, which we now estimate will provide $0.17 of positive full year EPS benefit net of established hedge positions. 
Our full year outlook also includes an updated estimate of $0.25 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, $0.06 per share higher than our prior projections. We provided details on our updated estimates of the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot.  
That concludes our financial view. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments."

Today, we're pleased to report another quarter of strong results, supported by continued favorable trends in our core CAG business and excellent execution by the IDEXX team. As noted, we delivered 25% organic revenue growth in the second quarter, supported by high organic CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth. There were strong gains across all CAG business segments and testing modalities, representing a continuation of the accelerated growth trends we've seen since the second half of 2020. 
Strong sector growth and outstanding execution by the IDEXX team gives us confidence to raise our 2021 financial outlook as we continue to invest towards our significant long-term growth opportunity.  
Today, I'll provide a brief update on the trends we're seeing in key regions in our companion animal sector and discuss the status of our initiatives to strengthen our international commercial capabilities. I'll also share an update on our ProCyte One launch and growing software portfolio, including the ezyVet acquisition, which will better position us to capitalize on favorable tailwinds, further enhance practice productivity and raise the standard of patient care.  
Let me start with an update on sector trends. Global sector trends remained favorable in the second quarter, reflected, for example, in sustained high U.S. clinical visit models that support continued strong increases in veterinary service revenues, including diagnostics. As Brian noted, U.S. clinical visits increased 13% in the quarter and 4.8% on a 2-year average annual basis, with continued strong gains across wellness and nonwellness categories. 
This growth was supported by a growing pet population and veterinarians focus on medical services, which are sustained even as pandemic restrictions have eased. These solid trends were seen across all global regions in Q2. Our strong commercial execution is building on this momentum, reflecting in IDEXX CAG diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth of 26% on a 1-year basis, and 16% on a 2-year average annual basis. 
Within the clinic, veterinarians and the teams continue to rise to the challenge of increased demand, working hard to keep up with industry growth while also delivering excellent patient care to ever more engaged pet parents. IDEXX is well positioned to provide them the tools and services necessary to meet these demands, supporting 15% diagnostics revenue growth per practice and even faster growth for IDEXX revenues. 
Overall, we feel very positive about the strong sector backdrop. Our strategy to bring testing and information management and innovations to the practice and our team's level of execution, which is reflected in our raised full year revenue outlook. 
In terms of execution, our commercial team continues to deliver exceptional results despite continued constrained clinic access. 
Instrument placement showed increased momentum in the second quarter with over 3,750 total premium placements, up solidly from a strong Q1, helping to drive 14% growth in our premium worldwide installed base for the quarter. This included double-digit growth in premium chemistry, hematology and urinalysis installed bases as well as continued excellent growth in new and competitive accounts. Veterinary customers are extremely busy due to high visit volumes. And they're investing in IDEXX instruments, diagnostics and tools to support practice growth, patient care and staff productivity. 
Our digital cytology solution is an excellent example of this point. An innovative service that extends the capability and reach of the practice by providing cytology testing results in the U.S. with a report authored by expert pathologists another 2 hours at any time during the day or week, 365 days a year, veterinarians are able to provide a higher standard of care to their patients, improve staff and clinical productivity and drive appropriate testing and practice revenues. 
Validating this medical value proposition, we saw strong customer interest in orders for a digital cytology solution in Q2. We also continue to advance key programs like IDEXX Preventive Care that help clinics raise the standard of care aligned with higher levels of pet owner engagement. In Q2, we executed 150 new preventive care enrollments as we continue to advance towards our goal of 10,000 engaged customers in the U.S. by 2024. 
In terms of customer access, we continue to operate in a hybrid model, with access still limited but improving in both the U.S. and international regions. In the U.S., approximately 60% of customer visits were in person in Q2, whereas it was approximately 50% in Europe. This has impacted our ability to deliver outstanding results as both new innovations and our excellent relationships we have with customers have driven significant growth across all regions. The deep customer relationships with our sales professionals have only been reinforced and strengthened by the best-in-class support we provided to customers throughout the pandemic. 
Of note, we're particularly pleased with our high levels of execution in regions like Europe, where we are expanding the successful go-to-market approaches we've applied in the U.S. This was reflected in 400 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts outside of North America, with half of these placements under IDEXX 360 agreements. The expansion of the IDEXX 360 program is also supporting sustained strong gains in lab revenues in Europe, accelerating new account acquisition and helping to inspire faster customer growth at IDEXX 360 customers. 
A key focus of our strategy in this context is on developing the long-term international revenue opportunity through an expansion of our direct commercial presence. We've completed the commercial expansions first announced in Q3 of last year, which were focused on 3 countries: Germany, France and South Korea. By almost doubling our commercial footprint in these countries, we have appreciably increased the frequency and intensity of our calling activities with existing customers and competitive accounts. Our experience is that when we do this, our customers grow faster as they adopt our innovations. And so do we. 
Three additional countries have been targeted at the next stage for expansion over the remainder of 2021 and into 2022. We're excited to share with you our broader commercial approach at the upcoming Investor Day. 
Our expanding global commercial capability will support the adoption of key innovations like ProCyte One, following our first U.S. shipments in late March, ProCyte One's international launch began in June with installations and presale customers in France, Germany, U.K. and in Southern Europe. Many of our international geographies are hematology-focused, meaning customers prioritize CBC for patient health assessment. Not surprisingly, we've seen an extremely positive reaction to the ProCyte One introduction in international regions. Customers applied its simplicity and small footprint while still delivering the excellent accuracy, usability and reliability profile veterinarians and their staff price so highly. Additionally, we expect a multiplier impact for ProCyte One as chemistry and hematology testing go hand-in-hand with the additional potential to inspire Reference Lab and Rapid Assay business when placed as part of the IDEXX 360 program. 
Speaking of Rapid Assay, we're very pleased with the strong momentum we continue to drive in this business globally. We achieved 20% plus organic growth in the U.S. in Q2, while raising customer retention levels to 97% supported by innovations like SNAP Pro, we now have over 80% of SNAP 4Dx customer volume engaged on this platform, which enhances insight and supports practice workflow. SNAP Pro is also helping to achieve accelerated growth in international regions. In Europe, after installing a clinics first SNAP Pro, we see a significant expansion in testing volumes. We look forward to building on the strong momentum supported by continued IDEXX innovation. 
We're also excited with the progress we're advancing in our cloud-based software capability. We had another excellent quarter of new software installations with Cornerstone and Neo placements growing 21%, while cloud-based offerings continue to represent the majority of PIMS placements. As we continue to expand our installed base, we also continue to drive expansion of profitable recurring services, such as credit card processing, which grew at strong double-digit rates organically. 
Software solutions have taken on significant importance to the effective management of the veterinary practice. Practices have never been busier, and IDEXX integrated, easy-to-use software solutions support patient care and workflow, staff productivity and communications amongst the care team and with the client. 
Moreover, IDEXX diagnostic solutions are seamlessly integrated into both our and third-party solutions, enabling practices to capture and invoice the full range of activities that veterinarian deliver. We know that IDEXX customers who use all of our solutions have a higher customer experience and tend to test more and grow faster. 
Relating to the growing importance of practice software solutions, cloud-based technologies have the potential to make important contributions to the overall software experience of the veterinary clinic. For example, practice owners are free from the challenges of supporting on-premise IT solutions that include frequent hardware update. 
Moreover, providers of cloud-based solutions like IDEXX can provide frequent seamless updates in an environment that offers security advantages. 
Our software capabilities were augmented in Q2 with the acquisition of ezyVet, a fast-growing, innovative practice information management system that is native cloud-based used by advanced general practices as well as specialty, emergency and large corporate groups worldwide. This acquisition complements our PIMS portfolio by providing additional options to practices with more complex needs and enterprise functionality. Customers appreciate ezyVet software for its easy use and rich features. In fact, ezyVet is the #1 rated full-feature practice management solution with 94% customer satisfaction according to Capterra, an industry standard business software customer review site. 
Bringing ezyVet into the IDEXX family also grows our cloud development talent enabling us to capitalize on the evolving nature of the veterinary clinic software product. 
With that, I'd like to welcome the ezyVet team to IDEXX. We look forward to working together with you to continue to develop best-in-class software products. 
We're also excited about the progress we're driving in our diagnostic imaging business. We saw very strong growth in digital imaging placements in Q2 and strong growth in our backlog, reflecting a continued appreciation of our focus on providing a full range of premier low-dose imaging solutions. 
Growth in these placements also supports the expansion of recurring services, including cloud-based services like Web PACS. Our Web PACS subscriptions grew at high teens rates with much faster growth in premium and unlimited subscription tiers, reflecting the high value and diagnostic insight clinicians drive from IDEXX software solutions. 
Overall, we're very pleased with our business momentum and optimistic as we continue to respond to the reopening of economies globally. In terms of IDEXX' specific plans, we're excited to advance plans to bring more IDEXX back to the office safely and in ways that ensure business continuity. We anticipate maintaining a more hybrid working environment and appreciate our employees flexibility, and adapt into new ways of working while continuing to deliver high growth, provide top-notch customer service and support our world-class product portfolio. 
Before I wrap up my remarks, I'd like to publicly welcome a new leader to IDEXX. As Dr. Martin Smith will be joining my leadership team in August as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. Martin brings 30-plus years of experience in the life sciences industry, most recently as Chief Technology Officer at Cytiva and Pall Corporation, both subsidiaries of Danaher. He's a strong track record of driving R&D strategy in concert with enterprise strategic initiatives, commercial efforts. And we look forward to Martin leading our world-class R&D organization. Welcome, Martin. 
With that, I'd like to add that I'm extremely proud of the way the entire IDEXX team is executing as we are on track for another strong year in 2021 with financial performance aligned with our long-term goals. Our growth and performance reflect a consistent business strategy focused on opportunity development within our core businesses and our employees continue to execute against this strategy daily. 
I look forward to sharing more on our strategy and long-term potential at our upcoming Investor Day on Thursday, August 12. The event remains virtual due to the evolving nature of COVID-19 and we invite you to register on the Investor Relations section of our website. Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Brian McKeon, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President and General Manager for Point of Care Diagnostics and Worldwide Operations; Mike Lane, Executive Vice President and GM for Reference Laboratories and Information Management; Jim Polewaczyk, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Kerry Bennett, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Advanced Analytics and Michael Schreck, Senior Vice President of Veterinary Software and Services.

Could you walk us through the cadence of that and how we expect that to come back? And is that really just tied to going back to prior ways of doing business pre-COVID? Is that some incremental spend on top of that? So what are the investment areas, how that should roll in, in the second half?

On OpEx, we're transitioning into a period now where we're comparing to more controlled cost levels from the prior year. I think you saw that in the second quarter where the comparable OpEx was up 20%. And we are starting to see some costs come back, things like health care accruals were up in the second quarter. We expect that to continue. And as the pandemic conditions hopefully continue to get eased, we expect to see some T&E come back. 
As well, we're advancing investments. We've talked about the commercial investments, particularly in areas like international and our R&D organization. We're leaning into the positive growth. And overall, we think that will create an environment where we've got sustained higher OpEx growth year-on-year and it will be above the revenue growth, which is now up against tougher compares. So that's really the dynamic that we're working through. I think it's all very healthy. We think we're on track for a very good full year performance in terms of margin improvement and look forward to building off that going forward. But second half, we'll be working through those dynamics."

So really welcome the opportunity to reengage what they consider to be trusted advisers and partners in the field. And they -- more and more, they're looking to IDEXX to be able to provide the analyzers and software solutions that really help them from the standpoint of not just increasing patient care, which has always been the case, but also really driving staff productivity and communications within the practice and with their clients. 
Overall, very, very positive. And we think that there's really an exceptional long-term opportunity, not just in hematology with ProCyte One, but the entire in clinic that lab suite because, as you know, hematology and chemistry are also very often in the vast majority of cases used together."

It's pretty much in line with what we saw in Q1 and Q4. And so that's very encouraging. I think we're benefiting from continued solid market trends at the clinic level and the visit number was down a bit Q4 to Q1, but the diagnostic revenue growth on a 1-year and a 2-year stack basis sustained at very good rates. So all indications are demand is holding up very well, and that's informing our full year outlook. The higher end of our outlook ranges for the 2-year trends to continue in the second half for CAG Dx recurring and we obviously have a range because there may be some other dynamics that -- we don't anticipate that go on, and we're going to learn more as we're working through, hopefully, the economies continue to open, but I think we're very encouraged by the strong trends."

We've obviously seen some very healthy pet ownership and standard of care trends over these past several quarters. Is this making you think any differently about R&D and the type of tests that you're developing, something that perhaps don't make economic sense for the better pet owner previously, but makes sense just given the higher willingness to pay? 
And then the second question is, outside of the U.S., talk a bit about the regional differences you're seeing in both visits and testing utilization as countries are exiting the pandemic. Are there countries where you're seeing better worse trends? And how do you see that evolving through the year?"

We -- our investment appetite for innovation has always been very high. We think that innovation at the end of the day, produces differentiation and solves really challenging customer problems both clinically and from a business standpoint. So if you look at 2020 last year, we came out with 7 I think, significant product and service introductions. 
And they were all extremely well received by our customers and adopted. So we continue to invest in innovation. We'll talk at Investor Day about our approach and the framework in terms of how we think about it, but it involves platforms and instruments and assays. And obviously, software as we've talked about, but also innovation in terms of just business models and our reference lab network. So that's alive and well and continues to be a real focus area for us. 
In terms of your questions around regional differences and testing utilization, as indicated, we've seen really strong growth across the board. The U.S. and North America has much higher use of diagnostics, and that's something that we think, over time, we can drive increase market adoption internationally with the TAM is about 2x from a potential opportunity standpoint relative to the U.S., and that's a function of more than just commercial expansion. It's a function of really putting in place reference lab network like we've done in Kornwestheim, the centers of excellence and broader set of solutions that customers value so much. 
You do see some, and I would say, modest differences just by country in terms of how they're reacting to the pandemic. So we've seen a little bit lower in-person visits in Europe relative to the U.S. U.S. is about 60%. Europe, for example, was 50%. But the -- our ability to continue to support our customers and customers transacting business hasn't really changed as a result of that. I think they've adopted well to the changing environment, and they're seeing a lot of traffic just like we're seeing in the U.S."

We're pleased to share another quarter of excellent financial results for IDEXX, driven by continued strong global momentum in our Companion Animal business. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 12% as reported and 10% organic",2058,"Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to share another quarter of excellent financial results for IDEXX, driven by continued strong global momentum in our Companion Animal business. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 12% as reported and 10% organically compared to high prior year growth levels. Third quarter results reflected 11.5% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues, with double-digit gains across U.S. and international markets. 2-year average annual organic growth for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue sustained at 16%, reflecting mid- to high teens 2-year average gains across our major modalities. We also achieved a record third quarter level of premium instrument placements with strong global gains across our major platforms. High revenue growth and sustained operating margins compared to high prior year levels supported delivery of $2.03 in earnings per share, an increase of 12% on a comparable basis. Momentum in our CAG business has us on track to deliver 15.5% to 16% organic revenue growth, 200 to 225 basis points in comparable operating margin gains and 26% to 27% comparable EPS growth in 2021 at the higher end of our previous guidance ranges. 
We'll walk through the details of our updated full year outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our third quarter results and recent sector trends. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by 13% CAG revenue gains and 13% growth in our water business. These gains were moderated by a 23% organic decline in LPD revenues compared to high prior year levels, which benefited from the ramping of African swine fever testing in China as well as by a $3 million year-on-year decline in human COVID PCR testing. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 11.5% organically compared to strong prior year growth levels, reflecting 10% gains in the U.S. and 14% growth in international regions. On a 2-year basis, average annual CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 16% overall, reflecting 16% gains in both U.S. and international regions. Strong CAG results were also supported by 15% organic growth in veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging revenues in addition to benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition and 33% year-on-year growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues. We continue to achieve very high levels of supply chain reliability across our business, reflecting outstanding performance by our operating teams, enabling us to support continued high levels of growth in customer service. 
Continued strong U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth was supported by year-on-year gains in U.S. clinical business. U.S. clinical visit growth was 2% overall in Q3, with solid gains across wellness and non wellness categories. This compared to strong 7% gains in the third quarter of 2020, which included benefits from pent-up clinical demand, including very high-growth in wellness testing. On a 2-year basis, U.S. same-store clinical visit growth increased at a 4.4% average annual rate, sustaining above annual clinic visit growth trends heading into the pandemic. The IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was approximately 850 basis points on a 1-year basis compared to very strong prior year growth levels for diagnostic testing, which supported a 1,500 basis point growth premium last year. On an average 2-year basis, which helps to calibrate for year-on-year pandemic dynamics, the growth premium was approximately 1,200 basis points in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2 year trends in the first half of the year. Expanding pet health care services, including continued solid increases in the utilization of diagnostics, supported a 7% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q3. Diagnostic revenues per practice increased 7% on a 1-year basis and 13% on an average 2-year basis, consistent with recent 2-year growth trends. 
IDEXX innovation and commercial engagement continues to build on positive health care demand trends, driving high Q3 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX reference live revenues increased 10% organically in Q3, with similar year-on-year gains in U.S. and international regions. Global reference lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth with strong gains across testing categories. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 14% organically in the third quarter, reflecting double-digit gains in the U.S. and continued high-growth in international regions. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. IDEXX achieved a third quarter record of 4,307 premium CAG instrument placements, up over 1,100 units or 36% from constrained prior year levels, reflecting strong gains across U.S. and international regions. We saw strong global placement gains across our platforms with Catalyst up 22%; premium hematology, up 62%; and SediVue, up 30%. The quality of CAG instrument placements remains excellent, reflected in 344 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 14% year-on-year and 1,003 new and competitive placements in international regions,
We also benefited from 571 second Catalyst placements driven by continued strong demand from high-volume customers. The global rollout of ProCyte One continues to support strong overall placement momentum with the majority of our ProCyte One placements in new and competitive accounts. New instrument placements and continued very high customer retention levels supported a 14% year-on-year growth in our global premium installed base, setting a foundation for continued high growth in IDEXX VetLab recurring diagnostic revenues. 
Rapid assay revenues expanded 9% organically in Q3 compared to strong prior year demand levels that included benefits from pent-up demand for wellness testing. Growth in Vector board disease testing drove solid year-on-year volume games in the U.S. and global growth continues to benefit from double-digit gains in international regions. High CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume driven across our modalities with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 15% organically and 33% as reported, including benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition. Strong growth in veterinary software services was supported by double-digit comparable gains in PIMS placements and continued strong growth in related recurring services. We also saw continued high growth in diagnostic imaging system placements driven by our entry-level Image View DR30 platform with nearly 80% of placements at competitive accounts. We continue to see 20%-plus growth in recurring digital service revenues, including expansion of Web PACS subscriptions, aligned with our expanding cloud-based capability. 
Turning to other business segments. Water revenue increased 13% organically in Q3 compared to 4% organic declines in last year's third quarter as this business continues to track back towards pre-COVID growth levels. Business growth was supported by solid gains across compliance and noncompliance testing categories. Lifecycle poultry and dairy revenue decreased organically 23% in Q3 compared to 18% organic growth levels in Q3 of 2020. Overall dynamics in our China LPD and related export testing businesses offset growth in other global regions. As expected, Q3 revenue growth was constrained by the lapping of high prior year demand for African swine fever testing and lower herd health screening levels. We're now seeing additional constraints on China LPD testing demand, reflecting relaxation of local African swine fever disease management approaches in China and as we work through impacts from low pork prices and changing government regulations related to livestock infectious disease testing programs. Reflecting these factors, we're planning for continued lower LPD revenues overall in upcoming quarters, which is factored into our 2021 financial outlook. 
Turning to the P&L. Sustained high revenue growth supported double-digit comparable operating profit and EPS gains. Operating profit increased 32% as reported, including benefits from lapping of a $27.5 million G&A charge related to an ongoing litigation matter, which is excluded from our comparable growth metrics. On a comparable basis, operating profits expanded 12% and operating margins increased 20 basis points compared to high prior year levels, which included benefits from pandemic-related cost controls. Gross profit increased 12% in Q3, reflecting strong revenue gains. Gross margins decreased modestly on a comparable basis as benefits from continued high recurring CAG diagnostic revenue growth and moderate net price gains were offset by business mix impacts from high CAG instrument revenue growth and lower LPD and human PCR revenues. We also saw some gross margin impact from investments in our lab business to support high growth and customer service levels. Operating expenses decreased 2% as reported and increased 10% on a comparable basis in Q3. As expected, we saw a higher level of comparable OpEx growth as we advance investments in our global commercial innovation capability and onboard the ezyVet acquisition. Q2 -- Q3 EPS was $2.03 per share, including benefits of $4 million or $0.05 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable basis, Q3 EPS increased 12%. Foreign exchange added $2 million to operating profits and $0.02 to EPS in Q3 net of $2 million in hedge losses. 
Free cash flow was $354 million in Q3 and $458 million for the first 9 months of 2021. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 88%. We increased our 2021 full year outlook for free cash flow conversion to 80% to 85% of net income, reflecting a refined capital spending estimate of approximately $150 million, including approximately $20 million in real estate purchases. As we advance plans for 2022, we expect an increase in capital spending levels to support additions to our manufacturing and distribution capacity aligned with our high-growth profile. Our balance sheet remains at a strong position. We ended the quarter with debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratios of 0.8x gross and 0.7x net of cash with $145 million in cash and no borrowings on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We allocated $184 million in capital to repurchase 275,000 shares in the quarter. 
Turning to our 2021 full year outlook. We're updating our projected range for overall revenue to $3.185 billion to $3.200 billion. Based on our continued strong momentum in Q2 -- Q3, we're increasing the lower end of our organic growth outlook by 1% and maintaining the higher end of our growth outlook aligned with sustained high 2-year annual growth trends for CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Operationally, this results in an increase of $10 million in our full year revenue outlook at midpoint. These improvements are offset by a $5 million FX headwind compared to our last outlook related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our updated reported revenue growth outlook is 17.5% to 18%, including approximately 1.5% of full year growth benefit from FX and 0.5% of growth benefit from acquisitions. Our updated overall organic growth outlook of 15.5% to 16% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 17% to 17.5% for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue. Other elements of our revenue growth outlook include continued expectations for lower year-on-year LPD revenues in the second half and for a reduction in human COVID testing revenues year-on-year. In terms of key financial metrics, we've refined our reported operating margin outlook for 2021 to 28.8% to 29%, reflecting expectations for 200 to 225 basis points of full year comparable operating margin improvement at the high end of our last guidance range. We're planning for moderately lower operating margins in Q4 compared to high prior year levels driven by mix impacts and advancement of commercial and innovation investments and target project spending aligned with our high-growth profile. We're raising our EPS guidance range by $0.06 at midpoint to $8.30 to $8.38, reflecting 26% to 27% full year comparable EPS growth. We now estimate FX will provide $0.16 of positive full year EPS benefit, $0.01 lower than earlier estimates, net of established hedge positions. We've also refined our overall effective tax estimate to 19%, including an updated estimate of $0.29 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. As we complete 2021, we're advancing our plans for 2022 aligned with sustaining our strong revenue growth. We're confident we can maintain our excellent supply chain performance to support continued high growth and managing the inflationary impacts in our business while building on our strong 2021 profit results. We look forward to providing specifics on our 2022 financial outlook on our Q4 earnings call. 
That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments."

We're pleased to report another quarter of excellent results for IDEXX, driven by sustained momentum in our CAG business. We delivered double-digit organic revenue growth overall, supported by 11.5% organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth compared to very strong prior year growth levels. 2-year average annual organic growth rates across testing modalities were in line with growth in the first half of 2021, with clinical visit trends sustaining above pre-pandemic levels. These strong trends are evidence that veterinary practices worldwide continue to focus on elevating standards of care by leveraging IDEXX's advanced product and service platforms. The IDEXX team is doing an outstanding job supporting continued high growth in customer service levels, putting us on track towards 2021 financial performance at the high end of our previous outlook and above our long-term goals. 
Today, I'll highlight key areas of progress in our product and commercial initiatives that position us to deliver continued high growth and strong financial returns. Let's begin with a brief update on sector trends. Positive Companion Animal health care trends continued in the third quarter, building on the accelerated demand levels achieved throughout the pandemic. U.S. clinical visit growth was 2% in Q3 compared to strong 7% prior year third quarter growth levels, which included benefits from pent-up demand. To normalize for prior year pandemic dynamics, we are monitoring 2-year average annual growth rates, which were 4.4% in Q3, continuing above the pre-pandemic levels of 2% to 3%. Wellness clinical visit growth of 6% on a 2-year basis points, the continued adoption of a preventive approach to pet health care, the sustained underlying momentum reflects the continued strengthening of the pet [indiscernible], the benefit of stepped-up growth in the pet population beginning early during the COVID-19 pandemic through early 2021 and sustained focus in the veterinary clinic on medical services. Around the world, veterinarians passion for their work combined with pet owner desire for excellent care have driven this focus on services as they remain extremely busy. 
U.S. practice revenue growth in the third quarter advanced a healthy 7% versus the prior year and an even more impressive 9% on a 2-year basis, supported by 2-year average growth of 11% in clinical revenue and 13% in diagnostic revenue. Customers are clearly attracted to IDEXX's broad portfolio of products and services to support elevated levels of demand while also growing their practices. These positive dynamics are also true in our international regions. IDEXX's growth is sustaining at an even stronger rate reflected in the 16% 2-year average annual growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues in Q3, a premium of nearly 1,200 basis points above 2-year average clinical visit growth rates. High levels of execution and consistently strong sector trends reinforce our confidence in sustaining strong growth momentum as we finish the year and build our plans for 2022. Outstanding commercial execution has been a key driver of our business performance, and our team continues to support our customers at a high level. This is evidenced by 36% year-on-year growth in premium instrument placements in Q3, a record number of third quarter placements for the company. High growth across our Catalyst, ProCyte and SediVue platform supported a 14% overall year-over-year increase in our premium installed base. Veterinarians are using IDEXX's diagnostic tools to build capacity and improve efficiency within the clinic to support future growth, which is also reflected in high levels of second Catalyst placements and continued strong 16% gains in Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts. Our strong global instrument placement momentum has long-term benefits and gives us further confidence that future consumable streams will also support continued strong growth. These results were achieved despite continued constraints on direct access to customers. Time for our customers is a scarce and valuable resource. 
In-person sales trends remain at approximately 60% in the U.S. and slightly lower in Europe at over 50%. Despite these constraints, our teams are in high levels of connection to our customers to deliver exceptional results by leveraging their trusted long-term relationships as highly relevant partners. We continue to enhance our commercial capabilities, the roll-in country level expansions of our field sales force to build on these results and to address the significant opportunities ahead of us. We've completed our expansions in Germany, France and South Korea and are seeing significant positive traction in instrument placements and CAG recurring revenue growth in these countries as a result. In addition, we are expanding our footprint in 3 additional countries, as noted on our last call, with hiring, onboarding and training tracking well to our plans in those areas. We expect to be live in all second wave countries by the end of Q1 of next year. In addition to our commercial footprint, we made progress in the past quarter in expanding our service footprint and capabilities in order to better support international business and customers. This included targeted investments to expand our European reference hub network and enhance our telemedicine service. These capabilities will support our long-term growth goals by ensuring we meet our customers' needs with a broad network and comprehensive portfolio of services, complementing our world-class reference lab facility in Corn Westime, Germany. These advancements support high growth across our testing modalities as customers continue to take advantage of the flexibility offered by our customer-centric programs, such as IDEXX 360, to grow their businesses and elevate standards of care around the world. 
Innovative products like ProCyte One, are helping to build on this momentum. We've seen a very strong response to ProCyte One, having delivered over 1,000 units worldwide in flash and on track for the approximately 4,000 annual worldwide premium hematology placement pace we shared during Investor Day. Feedback from customers of all sizes have been overwhelmingly positive as they rave about ProCyte One's easy use, well maintenance profile and excellent performance. Our growth trajectory now reflects launches in all 4 of our major regions with a select number of country launches remaining in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2022. ProCyte One provides a great opportunity for increased engagement with customers, supporting strong adoption of this new platform globally and a broader expansion of our business relationships. As an example, almost 95% of worldwide ProCyte One placements and nearly 100% in North America have either included a Catalyst One or have been placed at a customer that already has a Catalyst One, demonstrating the strong multiplier effect of this innovative product. 
Our Rapid Assay business is another area, which provides an opportunity to expand relationships with customers around the globe. Rapid Assay revenues grew solidly in Q3 compared to a very strong prior year, and 14% on a 2-year basis with comparable gains in the U.S. and internationally. Vector board disease testing, a critical component to the Rapid Assay business and a wellness testing in the U.S. more broadly, was the primary driver of this growth as tick-borne disease becomes more prevalent in regions around the U.S. This testing growth continues to be supported by the SNAP Pro instrument, which helps drive engagement and loyalty through enhanced insight, accuracy and practice workflow benefits. Double-digit growth in the SNAP Pro installed base in the U.S. and internationally and recent innovations like critical decision support, which aids increasingly busy veterinarians in making critical decisions when faced with a positive test, have helped drive excellent 97% customer retention levels within the Rapid Assay business. Our innovation strategy is also reflected in the expansion of our cloud-based software capabilities, which benefited from the Q2 acquisition of ezyVet. The integration of ezyVet into our software portfolio is proceeding to plan with high customer enthusiasm. ezyVet acquisition helped drive 33% reported growth of veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue in the third quarter, which was further supported by strong 15% organic growth in our core software and digital imaging products. This growth reflects solid double-digit year-over-year gains in our profitable recurring revenue software products. It also demonstrates the benefit of a growing installed base of PIMS in industry-leading low-dose diagnostic imaging products. Cloud-based offerings represent the majority of PIMS placements at over 80% as cloud-based offerings provide performance, quality and life cycle cost advantages. And within Diagnostic Imaging, recent updates to the Web PACS product include additional features important to specialty practices and deeper, more seamless integrations with PIMS systems. With a growing installed base and very high retention levels, IDEXX Web PACS has become an important part of our enterprise software ecosystem, product enhancements like this and others aimed at making clinical workflow and customer communications easier and more efficient are an impactful example of how our Technology for Life approach is supporting busy practices. 
Our commercial sales force and marketing teams continued to balance product sales with advancing the IDEXX Preventive Care program, which provides a structure and incentive for our customers, continue driving wellness testing and raising the standard of care. Enrollment in this program in the third quarter, despite constrained in-person discussions with customers, sustained at a rate similar to the second quarter as we executed approximately 150 new preventive care enrollments and continue to track towards our goal of 10,000 engaged customers in the U.S. by 2024. In addition to strong commercial execution, our consistent growth trajectory also reflects resiliency and agility in our supply chain. This has enabled us to weather the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and meet the strong demand within our sector. IDEXX benefits from a number of factors related to our business, including strong long-term supplier relationships, near shoring and product standardization and inventory buffers. These factors and their proactive approach managing frontline operational processes have allowed us to achieve 99% customer product availability through the pandemic, resulting in high customer satisfaction and increased retention. We believe we are well prepared to support sustained high growth and service levels in our business going forward, where there may be relatively higher cost in certain areas to support our growth plans. We are confident we can manage these impacts effectively through our operational capability and focus while building on our strong financial performance. 
Overall, we feel very positive about our continued strong business momentum as we engage with and support veterinarians around the world who are advancing the care standard. Looking forward, we are proceeding with plans for sustained high growth aligned with our long-term growth potential as current momentum positions us well to support investments in the infrastructure, solutions and commercial capabilities necessary to achieve the significant opportunity ahead of us while delivering continued strong financial performance. Finally, I'd like to thank our employees and our customers for their perseverance and flexibility during these dynamic times. I'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished together and look forward to continued excellence in the future. 
That concludes my remarks, and we now have time for questions."

And we think, in part, what's driving that is less pent-up demand and more practices really investing in their practices because they're busy. They're looking for technology that can support productivity and obviously, greater patient flow. With respect to ProCyte One, you'll recall, we launched in the U.S. in late Q1 and then internationally, in late Q2. We see a very rapid uptake. The majority of the ProCyte One -- the vast majority of the ProCyte One either have gone into competitive accounts with Catalyst or into existing Catalyst accounts. So it's a real customer pleaser. I think it's delivered on all aspects of the brand and product promise, easy use, performance, great cost profile. Keep in mind, it's also part of our paper run and auto replenishment model. So it's -- we're excited about the opportunity. If you recall from Investor Day, we identified almost 100,000 placement opportunities globally, 2/3 plus of that internationally. We're just in the early days of getting started on that. It's a very promising outlook for hematology. With respect to SediVue, we continue to make excellent progress in SediVue. Obviously, interim replacements were high, 30% plus. We saw a nice uptake in the U.S., a nice sequential progress internationally."

So I think that is the bigger trend that aligns with the higher end of our revenue growth outlook and that's informing our posture heading into next year that we're really planning for sustained strong growth. We're investing towards that, ensuring that we have high service levels. So in terms of broader trends, I think Jay can provide some color, but I think the clinical visit trend was moderated a bit from the first half on a 2-year basis. We may be seeing some plateauing of the incremental growth benefit we saw from the step-up in new pets, although the pet population has expanded and sustained, and perhaps, it might be reflective of clinic just being quite busy.

A number of practices have been able to really improve -- mix of workflow improvements and adjust capacity just by adding things like exams and things like that. From the standpoint of what we can do, as a company, there's a number of really, I think, positive opportunities for us. Obviously, we provide technologies, analyzers tools, software that practices can invest in, that help them perform both in a higher medical or clinical level, but also more productively, whether it's communications or internally or with pet owners or really improving staff productivity. I think evidence of that is in the very significant step-up in instrument placements that we've seen and very fast growth in software at PIMS systems and ancillary systems that work with PIMS."

We're pleased to share another quarter of excellent financial results for IDEXX, driven by continued strong global momentum in our Companion Animal business.

We're pleased to share another quarter of excellent financial results for IDEXX, driven by continued strong global momentum in our Companion Animal business. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 12% as reported and 10% organically compared to high prior year growth levels. Third quarter results reflected 11.5% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues, with double-digit gains across U.S. and international markets. 2-year average annual organic growth for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue sustained at 16%, reflecting mid- to high teens 2-year average gains across our major modalities. We also achieved a record third quarter level of premium instrument placements with strong global gains across our major platforms. High revenue growth and sustained operating margins compared to high prior year levels supported delivery of $2.03 in earnings per share, an increase of 12% on a comparable basis. Momentum in our CAG business has us on track to deliver 15.5% to 16% organic revenue growth, 200 to 225 basis points in comparable operating margin gains and 26% to 27% comparable EPS growth in 2021 at the higher end of our previous guidance ranges. 
We'll walk through the details of our updated full year outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our third quarter results and recent sector trends. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by 13% CAG revenue gains and 13% growth in our water business. These gains were moderated by a 23% organic decline in LPD revenues compared to high prior year levels, which benefited from the ramping of African swine fever testing in China as well as by a $3 million year-on-year decline in human COVID PCR testing. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 11.5% organically compared to strong prior year growth levels, reflecting 10% gains in the U.S. and 14% growth in international regions. On a 2-year basis, average annual CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 16% overall, reflecting 16% gains in both U.S. and international regions. Strong CAG results were also supported by 15% organic growth in veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging revenues in addition to benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition and 33% year-on-year growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues. We continue to achieve very high levels of supply chain reliability across our business, reflecting outstanding performance by our operating teams, enabling us to support continued high levels of growth in customer service. 
Continued strong U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth was supported by year-on-year gains in U.S. clinical business. U.S. clinical visit growth was 2% overall in Q3, with solid gains across wellness and non-wellness categories. This compared to strong 7% gains in the third quarter of 2020, which included benefits from pent-up clinical demand, including very high-growth in wellness testing. On a 2-year basis, U.S. same-store clinical visit growth increased at a 4.4% average annual rate, sustaining above annual clinic visit growth trends heading into the pandemic. The IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was approximately 850 basis points on a 1-year basis compared to very strong prior year growth levels for diagnostic testing, which supported a 1,500 basis point growth premium last year. On an average 2-year basis, which helps to calibrate for year-on-year pandemic dynamics, the growth premium was approximately 1,200 basis points in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2 year trends in the first half of the year. Expanding pet health care services, including continued solid increases in the utilization of diagnostics, supported a 7% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q3. Diagnostic revenues per practice increased 7% on a 1-year basis and 13% on an average 2-year basis, consistent with recent 2-year growth trends. 
IDEXX innovation and commercial engagement continues to build on positive health care demand trends, driving high Q3 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX Reference Lab revenues increased 10% organically in Q3, with similar year-on-year gains in U.S. and international regions. Global Reference Lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth with strong gains across testing categories. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 14% organically in the third quarter, reflecting double-digit gains in the U.S. and continued high-growth in international regions. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. IDEXX achieved a third quarter record of 4,307 premium CAG instrument placements, up over 1,100 units or 36% from constrained prior year levels, reflecting strong gains across U.S. and international regions. We saw strong global placement gains across our platforms with Catalyst up 22%; premium hematology, up 62%; and SediVue, up 30%. The quality of CAG instrument placements remains excellent, reflected in 344 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 14% year-on-year and 1,003 new and competitive placements in international regions, up 17%.
We also benefited from 571 second Catalyst placements driven by continued strong demand from high-volume customers. The global rollout of ProCyte One continues to support strong overall placement momentum with the majority of our ProCyte One placements in new and competitive accounts. New instrument placements and continued very high customer retention levels supported a 14% year-on-year growth in our global premium installed base, setting a foundation for continued high growth in IDEXX VetLab recurring diagnostic revenues. 
Rapid Assay revenues expanded 9% organically in Q3 compared to strong prior year demand levels that included benefits from pent-up demand for wellness testing. Growth in vector-borne disease testing drove solid year-on-year volume games in the U.S. and global growth continues to benefit from double-digit gains in international regions. High CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven across our modalities with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 15% organically and 33% as reported, including benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition. Strong growth in veterinary software services was supported by double-digit comparable gains in PIMS placements and continued strong growth in related recurring services. We also saw continued high growth in diagnostic imaging system placements driven by our entry-level ImageVue DR30 platform with nearly 80% of placements at competitive accounts. We continue to see 20%-plus growth in recurring digital service revenues, including expansion of Web PACS subscriptions, aligned with our expanding cloud-based capability. 
Turning to other business segments. Water revenue increased 13% organically in Q3 compared to 4% organic declines in last year's third quarter as this business continues to track back towards pre-COVID growth levels. Business growth was supported by solid gains across compliance and noncompliance testing categories. Life cycle poultry and dairy revenue decreased organically 23% in Q3 compared to 18% organic growth levels in Q3 of 2020. Overall dynamics in our China LPD and related export testing businesses offset growth in other global regions. As expected, Q3 revenue growth was constrained by the lapping of high prior year demand for African swine fever testing and lower herd health screening levels. We're now seeing additional constraints on China LPD testing demand, reflecting relaxation of local African swine fever disease management approaches in China and as we work through impacts from low pork prices and changing government regulations related to livestock infectious disease testing programs. Reflecting these factors, we're planning for continued lower LPD revenues overall in upcoming quarters, which is factored into our 2021 financial outlook. 
Turning to the P&L. Sustained high revenue growth supported double-digit comparable operating profit and EPS gains. Operating profit increased 32% as reported, including benefits from lapping of a $27.5 million G&A charge related to an ongoing litigation matter, which is excluded from our comparable growth metrics. On a comparable basis, operating profits expanded 12% and operating margins increased 20 basis points compared to high prior year levels, which included benefits from pandemic-related cost controls. Gross profit increased 12% in Q3, reflecting strong revenue gains. Gross margins decreased modestly on a comparable basis as benefits from continued high recurring CAG diagnostic revenue growth and moderate net price gains were offset by business mix impacts from high CAG instrument revenue growth and lower LPD and human PCR revenues. We also saw some gross margin impact from investments in our lab business to support high growth and customer service levels. Operating expenses decreased 2% as reported and increased 10% on a comparable basis in Q3. As expected, we saw a higher level of comparable OpEx growth as we advance investments in our global commercial innovation capability and onboard the ezyVet acquisition. Q2 -- Q3 EPS was $2.03 per share, including benefits of $4 million or $0.05 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable basis, Q3 EPS increased 12%. Foreign exchange added $2 million to operating profits and $0.02 to EPS in Q3 net of $2 million in hedge losses. 
Free cash flow was $354 million in Q3 and $458 million for the first 9 months of 2021. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 88%. We increased our 2021 full year outlook for free cash flow conversion to 80% to 85% of net income, reflecting a refined capital spending estimate of approximately $150 million, including approximately $20 million in real estate purchases. As we advance plans for 2022, we expect an increase in capital spending levels to support additions to our manufacturing and distribution capacity aligned with our high-growth profile. Our balance sheet remains at a strong position. We ended the quarter with debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratios of 0.8x gross and 0.7x net of cash with $145 million in cash and no borrowings on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We allocated $184 million in capital to repurchase 275,000 shares in the quarter. 
Turning to our 2021 full year outlook. We're updating our projected range for overall revenue to $3.185 billion to $3.200 billion. Based on our continued strong momentum in Q2 -- Q3, we're increasing the lower end of our organic growth outlook by 1% and maintaining the higher end of our growth outlook aligned with sustained high 2-year annual growth trends for CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Operationally, this results in an increase of $10 million in our full year revenue outlook at midpoint. These improvements are offset by a $5 million FX headwind compared to our last outlook related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our updated reported revenue growth outlook is 17.5% to 18%, including approximately 1.5% of full year growth benefit from FX and 0.5% of growth benefit from acquisitions. Our updated overall organic growth outlook of 15.5% to 16% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 17% to 17.5% for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue. Other elements of our revenue growth outlook include continued expectations for lower year-on-year LPD revenues in the second half and for a reduction in human COVID testing revenues year-on-year. In terms of key financial metrics, we've refined our reported operating margin outlook for 2021 to 28.8% to 29%, reflecting expectations for 200 to 225 basis points of full year comparable operating margin improvement at the high end of our last guidance range. We're planning for moderately lower operating margins in Q4 compared to high prior year levels driven by mix impacts and advancement of commercial and innovation investments and target project spending aligned with our high-growth profile. We're raising our EPS guidance range by $0.06 at midpoint to $8.30 to $8.38, reflecting 26% to 27% full year comparable EPS growth. We now estimate FX will provide $0.16 of positive full year EPS benefit, $0.01 lower than earlier estimates, net of established hedge positions. We've also refined our overall effective tax estimate to 19%, including an updated estimate of $0.29 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. As we complete 2021, we're advancing our plans for 2022 aligned with sustaining our strong revenue growth. We're confident we can maintain our excellent supply chain performance to support continued high growth and managing the inflationary impacts in our business while building on our strong 2021 profit results. We look forward to providing specifics on our 2022 financial outlook on our Q4 earnings call. 
That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments."

We're pleased to report another quarter of excellent results for IDEXX, driven by sustained momentum in our CAG business. We delivered double-digit organic revenue growth overall, supported by 11.5% organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth compared to very strong prior year growth levels. 2-year average annual organic growth rates across testing modalities were in line with growth in the first half of 2021, with clinical visit trends sustaining above pre-pandemic levels. These strong trends are evidence that veterinary practices worldwide continue to focus on elevating standards of care by leveraging IDEXX's advanced product and service platforms. The IDEXX team is doing an outstanding job supporting continued high growth in customer service levels, putting us on track towards 2021 financial performance at the high end of our previous outlook and above our long-term goals. 
Today, I'll highlight key areas of progress in our product and commercial initiatives that position us to deliver continued high growth and strong financial returns. Let's begin with a brief update on sector trends. Positive Companion Animal health care trends continued in the third quarter, building on the accelerated demand levels achieved throughout the pandemic. U.S. clinical visit growth was 2% in Q3 compared to strong 7% prior year third quarter growth levels, which included benefits from pent-up demand. To normalize for prior year pandemic dynamics, we are monitoring 2-year average annual growth rates, which were 4.4% in Q3, continuing above the pre-pandemic levels of 2% to 3%. Wellness clinical visit growth of 6% on a 2-year basis points, the continued adoption of a preventive approach to pet health care, the sustained underlying momentum reflects the continued strengthening of the pet-owner bond, the benefit of stepped-up growth in the pet population beginning early during the COVID-19 pandemic through early 2021 and sustained focus in the veterinary clinic and medical services. Around the world, veterinarians passion for their work combined with pet owner desire for excellent care have driven this focus on services as they remain extremely busy. 
U.S. practice revenue growth in the third quarter advanced a healthy 7% versus the prior year and an even more impressive 9% on a 2-year basis, supported by 2-year average growth of 11% in clinical revenue and 13% in diagnostic revenue. Customers are clearly attracted to IDEXX's broad portfolio of products and services to support elevated levels of demand while also growing their practices. These positive dynamics are also true in our international regions. IDEXX's growth is sustaining at an even stronger rate reflected in the 16% 2-year average annual growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues in Q3, a premium of nearly 1,200 basis points above 2-year average clinical visit growth rates. High levels of execution and consistently strong sector trends reinforce our confidence in sustaining strong growth momentum as we finish the year and build our plans for 2022. Outstanding commercial execution has been a key driver of our business performance, and our team continues to support our customers at a high level. This is evidenced by 36% year-on-year growth in premium instrument placements in Q3, a record number of third quarter placements for the company. High growth across our Catalyst, ProCyte and SediVue platform supported a 14% overall year-over-year increase in our premium installed base. Veterinarians are using IDEXX's diagnostic tools to build capacity and improve efficiency within the clinic to support future growth, which is also reflected in high levels of second Catalyst placements and continued strong 16% gains in Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts. Our strong global instrument placement momentum has long-term benefits and gives us further confidence that future consumable streams will also support continued strong growth. These results were achieved despite continued constraints on direct access to customers. Time for our customers is a scarce and valuable resource. 
In-person sales trends remain at approximately 60% in the U.S. and slightly lower in Europe at over 50%. Despite these constraints, our teams are in high levels of connection to our customers to deliver exceptional results by leveraging their trusted long-term relationships as highly relevant partners. We continue to enhance our commercial capabilities, the roll-in country level expansions of our field sales force to build on these results and to address the significant opportunities ahead of us. We've completed our expansions in Germany, France and South Korea and are seeing significant positive traction in instrument placements and CAG recurring revenue growth in these countries as a result. In addition, we are expanding our footprint in 3 additional countries, as noted on our last call, with hiring, onboarding and training tracking well to our plans in those areas. We expect to be live in all second wave countries by the end of Q1 of next year. In addition to our commercial footprint, we made progress in the past quarter in expanding our service footprint and capabilities in order to better support international business and customers. This included targeted investments to expand our European reference lab network and enhance our telemedicine service. These capabilities will support our long-term growth goals by ensuring we meet our customers' needs with a broad network and comprehensive portfolio of services, complementing our world-class reference lab facility in Kornwestheim, Germany. These advancements support high growth across our testing modalities as customers continue to take advantage of the flexibility offered by our customer-centric programs, such as IDEXX 360, to grow their businesses and elevate standards of care around the world. 
Innovative products like ProCyte One, are helping to build on this momentum. We've seen a very strong response to ProCyte One, having delivered over 1,000 units worldwide since launch and on track for the approximately 4,000 annual worldwide premium hematology placement pace we shared during Investor Day. Feedback from customers of all sizes have been overwhelmingly positive as they rave about ProCyte One's easy use, well maintenance profile and excellent performance. Our growth trajectory now reflects launches in all 4 of our major regions with a select number of country launches remaining in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2022. ProCyte One provides a great opportunity for increased engagement with customers, supporting strong adoption of this new platform globally and a broader expansion of our business relationships. As an example, almost 95% of worldwide ProCyte One placements and nearly 100% in North America have either included a Catalyst One or have been placed at a customer that already has a Catalyst One, demonstrating the strong multiplier effect of this innovative product. 
Our Rapid Assay business is another area, which provides an opportunity to expand relationships with customers around the globe. Rapid Assay test revenues grew solidly in Q3 compared to a very strong prior year, and 14% on a 2-year basis with comparable gains in the U.S. and internationally. Vector-borne disease testing, a critical component to the Rapid Assay business and a wellness testing in the U.S. more broadly, was the primary driver of this growth as tick-borne disease becomes more prevalent in regions around the U.S. This testing growth continues to be supported by the SNAP Pro instrument, which helps drive engagement and loyalty through enhanced insight, accuracy and practice workflow benefits. Double-digit growth in the SNAP Pro installed base in the U.S. and internationally and recent innovations like critical decision support, which aids increasingly busy veterinarians in making critical decisions when faced with a positive test, have helped drive excellent 97% customer retention levels within the Rapid Assay business. Our innovation strategy is also reflected in the expansion of our cloud-based software capabilities, which benefited from the Q2 acquisition of ezyVet. The integration of ezyVet into our software portfolio is proceeding to plan with high customer enthusiasm. ezyVet acquisition helped drive 33% reported growth of veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue in the third quarter, which was further supported by strong 15% organic growth in our core software and digital imaging products. This growth reflects solid double-digit year-over-year gains in our profitable recurring revenue software products. It also demonstrates the benefit of a growing installed base of PIMS in industry-leading low-dose diagnostic imaging products. Cloud-based offerings represent the majority of PIMS placements at over 80% as cloud-based offerings provide performance, quality and life cycle cost advantages. And within Diagnostic Imaging, recent updates to the Web PACS product include additional features important to specialty practices and deeper, more seamless integrations with PIMS systems. With a growing installed base and very high retention levels, IDEXX Web PACS has become an important part of our enterprise software ecosystem, product enhancements like this and others aimed at making clinical workflow and customer communications easier and more efficient are an impactful example of how our Technology for Life approach is supporting busy practices. 
Our commercial sales force and marketing teams continued to balance product sales with advancing the IDEXX Preventive Care program, which provides a structure and incentive for our customers, continue driving wellness testing and raising the standard of care. Enrollments in this program in the third quarter, despite constrained in-person discussions with customers, sustained at a rate similar to the second quarter as we executed approximately 150 new preventive care enrollments and continue to track towards our goal of 10,000 engaged customers in the U.S. by 2024. In addition to strong commercial execution, our consistent growth trajectory also reflects resiliency and agility in our supply chain. This has enabled us to weather the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and meet the strong demand within our sector. IDEXX benefits from a number of factors related to our business, including strong long-term supplier relationships, nearshoring and product standardization and inventory buffers. These factors and their proactive approach managing frontline operational processes have allowed us to achieve 99% customer product availability through the pandemic, resulting in high customer satisfaction and increased retention. We believe we are well prepared to support sustained high growth and service levels in our business going forward, where there may be relatively higher cost in certain areas to support our growth plans, we are confident we can manage these impacts effectively through our operational capability and focus while building on our strong financial performance. 
Overall, we feel very positive about our continued strong business momentum as we engage with and support veterinarians around the world who are advancing the care standard. Looking forward, we are proceeding with plans for sustained high growth aligned with our long-term growth potential as current momentum positions us well to support investments in the infrastructure, solutions and commercial capabilities necessary to achieve the significant opportunity ahead of us while delivering continued strong financial performance. Finally, I'd like to thank our employees and our customers for their perseverance and flexibility during these dynamic times. I'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished together and look forward to continued excellence in the future. 
That concludes my remarks, and we now have time for questions."

And we think, in part, what's driving that is less pent-up demand and more practices really investing in their practices because they're busy. They're looking for technology that can support productivity and obviously, greater patient flow. With respect to ProCyte One, you'll recall, we launched in the U.S. in late Q1 and then internationally, in late Q2. We see a very rapid uptake. The majority of the ProCyte One -- the vast majority of the ProCyte One either have gone into competitive accounts with Catalyst or into existing Catalyst accounts. So it's a real customer pleaser. I think it's delivered on all aspects of the brand and product promise, easy use, performance, great cost profile. Keep in mind, it's also part of our paper run and auto replenishment model. So it's -- we're excited about the opportunity. If you recall from Investor Day, we identified almost 100,000 placement opportunities globally, 2/3 plus of that internationally. We're just in the early days of getting started on that. It's a very promising outlook for hematology. With respect to SediVue, we continue to make excellent progress in SediVue. Obviously, interim replacements were high, 30% plus. We saw a nice uptake in the U.S., a nice sequential progress internationally."

So I think that is the bigger trend that aligns with the higher end of our revenue growth outlook and that's informing our posture heading into next year that we're really planning for sustained strong growth. We're investing towards that, ensuring that we have high service levels. So in terms of broader trends, I think Jay can provide some color, but I think the clinical visit trend was moderated a bit from the first half on a 2-year basis. We may be seeing some plateauing of the incremental growth benefit we saw from the step-up in new pets, although the pet population has expanded and sustained, and perhaps, it might be reflective of clinics just being quite busy.

A number of practices have been able to really improve -- mix of workflow improvements and adjust capacity just by adding things like exam rooms and things like that. From the standpoint of what we can do, as a company, there's a number of really, I think, positive opportunities for us. Obviously, we provide technologies, analyzers tools, software that practices can invest in, that help them perform both in a higher medical or clinical level, but also more productively, whether it's communications or internally or with pet owners or really improving staff productivity. I think evidence of that is in the very significant step-up in instrument placements that we've seen and very fast growth in software at PIMS systems and ancillary systems that work with PIMS."

We're pleased to share another quarter of excellent financial results for IDEXX, driven by continued strong global momentum in our Companion Animal business.

We're pleased to share another quarter of excellent financial results for IDEXX, driven by continued strong global momentum in our Companion Animal business. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 12% as reported and 10% organically compared to high prior year growth levels. Third quarter results reflected 11.5% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues, with double-digit gains across U.S. and international markets. 2-year average annual organic growth for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue sustained at 16%, reflecting mid- to high teens 2-year average gains across our major modalities.
We also achieved a record third quarter level of premium instrument placements with strong global gains across our major platforms. High revenue growth and sustained operating margins compared to high prior year levels supported delivery of $2.03 in earnings per share, an increase of 12% on a comparable basis. Momentum in our CAG business has us on track to deliver 15.5% to 16% organic revenue growth, 200 to 225 basis points in comparable operating margin gains and 26% to 27% comparable EPS growth in 2021 at the higher end of our previous guidance ranges. 
We'll walk through the details of our updated full year outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our third quarter results and recent sector trends. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by 13% CAG revenue gains and 13% growth in our water business. These gains were moderated by a 23% organic decline in LPD revenues compared to high prior year levels, which benefited from the ramping of African swine fever testing in China as well as by a $3 million year-on-year decline in human COVID PCR testing.
CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 11.5% organically compared to strong prior year growth levels, reflecting 10% gains in the U.S. and 14% growth in international regions. On a 2-year basis, average annual CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 16% overall, reflecting 16% gains in both U.S. and international regions. Strong CAG results were also supported by 15% organic growth in veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging revenues in addition to benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition and 33% year-on-year growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues. We continue to achieve very high levels of supply chain reliability across our business, reflecting outstanding performance by our operating teams, enabling us to support continued high levels of growth in customer service. 
Continued strong U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth was supported by year-on-year gains in U.S. clinical visits. U.S. clinical visit growth was 2% overall in Q3, with solid gains across wellness and non-wellness categories. This compared to strong 7% gains in the third quarter of 2020, which included benefits from pent-up clinical demand, including very high-growth in wellness testing. On a 2-year basis, U.S. same-store clinical visit growth increased at a 4.4% average annual rate, sustaining above annual clinic visit growth trends heading into the pandemic.
The IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was approximately 850 basis points on a 1-year basis compared to very strong prior year growth levels for diagnostic testing, which supported a 1,500 basis point growth premium last year. On an average 2-year basis, which helps to calibrate for year-on-year pandemic dynamics, the growth premium was approximately 1,200 basis points in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2 year trends in the first half of the year. Expanding pet health care services, including continued solid increases in the utilization of diagnostics, supported a 7% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q3. Diagnostic revenues per practice increased 7% on a 1-year basis and 13% on an average 2-year basis, consistent with recent 2-year growth trends. 
IDEXX innovation and commercial engagement continues to build on positive health care demand trends, driving high Q3 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX Reference Lab revenues increased 10% organically in Q3, with similar year-on-year gains in U.S. and international regions. Global Reference Lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth with strong gains across testing categories.
IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 14% organically in the third quarter, reflecting double-digit gains in the U.S. and continued high-growth in international regions. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. IDEXX achieved a third quarter record of 4,307 premium CAG instrument placements, up over 1,100 units or 36% from constrained prior year levels, reflecting strong gains across U.S. and international regions. We saw strong global placement gains across our platforms with Catalyst up 22%; premium hematology, up 62%; and SediVue, up 30%. The quality of CAG instrument placements remains excellent, reflected in 344 Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 14% year-on-year and 1,003 new and competitive placements in international regions, up 17%.
We also benefited from 571 second Catalyst placements driven by continued stronger demand from high-volume customers. The global rollout of ProCyte One continues to support strong overall placement momentum with the majority of our ProCyte One placements in new and competitive accounts. New instrument placements and continued very high customer retention levels supported a 14% year-on-year growth in our global premium installed base, setting a foundation for continued high growth in IDEXX VetLab recurring diagnostic revenues. 
Rapid Assay revenues expanded 9% organically in Q3 compared to strong prior year demand levels that included benefits from pent-up demand for wellness testing. Growth in vector-borne disease testing drove solid year-on-year volume games in the U.S. and global growth continues to benefit from double-digit gains in international regions. High CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven across our modalities with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%.
In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 15% organically and 33% as reported, including benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition. Strong growth in veterinary software services was supported by double-digit comparable gains in PIMS placements and continued strong growth in related recurring services. We also saw continued high growth in diagnostic imaging system placements driven by our entry-level ImageVue DR30 platform with nearly 80% of placements at competitive accounts. We continue to see 20%-plus growth in recurring digital service revenues, including expansion of Web PACS subscriptions, aligned with our expanding cloud-based capability. 
Turning to other business segments. Water revenue increased 13% organically in Q3 compared to 4% organic declines in last year's third quarter as this business continues to track back towards pre-COVID growth levels. Business growth was supported by solid gains across compliance and noncompliance testing categories. Life cycle poultry and dairy revenue decreased organically 23% in Q3 compared to 18% organic growth levels in Q3 of 2020. Overall dynamics in our China LPD and related export testing businesses offset growth in other global regions.
As expected, Q3 revenue growth was constrained by the lapping of high prior year demand for African swine fever testing and lower herd health screening levels. We're now seeing additional constraints on China LPD testing demand, reflecting relaxation of local African swine fever disease management approaches in China and as we work through impacts from low pork prices and changing government regulations related to livestock infectious disease testing programs. Reflecting these factors, we're planning for continued lower LPD revenues overall in upcoming quarters, which is factored into our 2021 financial outlook. 
Turning to the P&L. Sustained high revenue growth supported double-digit comparable operating profit and EPS gains. Operating profit increased 32% as reported, including benefits from lapping of a $27.5 million G&A charge related to an ongoing litigation matter, which is excluded from our comparable growth metrics. On a comparable basis, operating profits expanded 12% and operating margins increased 20 basis points compared to high prior year levels, which included benefits from pandemic-related cost controls.
Gross profit increased 12% in Q3, reflecting strong revenue gains. Gross margins decreased modestly on a comparable basis as benefits from continued high recurring CAG diagnostic revenue growth and moderate net price gains were offset by business mix impacts from high CAG instrument revenue growth and lower LPD and human PCR revenues. We also saw some gross margin impact from investments in our lab business to support high growth and customer service levels. Operating expenses decreased 2% as reported and increased 10% on a comparable basis in Q3.
As expected, we saw a higher level of comparable OpEx growth as we advance investments in our global commercial innovation capability and onboard the ezyVet acquisition. Q2 -- Q3 EPS was $2.03 per share, including benefits of $4 million or $0.05 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable basis, Q3 EPS increased 12%. Foreign exchange added $2 million to operating profits and $0.02 to EPS in Q3 net of $2 million in hedge losses. 
Free cash flow was $354 million in Q3 and $458 million for the first 9 months of 2021. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 88%. We increased our 2021 full year outlook for free cash flow conversion to 80% to 85% of net income, reflecting a refined capital spending estimate of approximately $150 million, including approximately $20 million in real estate purchases.
As we advance plans for 2022, we expect an increase in capital spending levels to support additions to our manufacturing and distribution capacity aligned with our high-growth profile. Our balance sheet remains at a strong position. We ended the quarter with debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratios of 0.8x gross and 0.7x net of cash with $145 million in cash and no borrowings on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We allocated $184 million in capital to repurchase 275,000 shares in the quarter. 
Turning to our 2021 full year outlook. We're updating our projected range for overall revenue to $3.185 billion to $3.200 billion. Based on our continued strong momentum in Q2 -- Q3, we're increasing the lower end of our organic growth outlook by 1% and maintaining the higher end of our growth outlook aligned with sustained high 2-year annual growth trends for CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Operationally, this results in an increase of $10 million in our full year revenue outlook at midpoint. These improvements are offset by a $5 million FX headwind compared to our last outlook related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our updated reported revenue growth outlook is 17.5% to 18%, including approximately 1.5% of full year growth benefit from FX and 0.5% of growth benefit from acquisitions.
Our updated overall organic growth outlook of 15.5% to 16% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 17% to 17.5% for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue. Other elements of our revenue growth outlook include continued expectations for lower year-on-year LPD revenues in the second half and for a reduction in human COVID testing revenues year-on-year. In terms of key financial metrics, we've refined our reported operating margin outlook for 2021 to 28.8% to 29%, reflecting expectations for 200 to 225 basis points of full year comparable operating margin improvement at the high end of our last guidance range. We're planning for moderately lower operating margins in Q4 compared to high prior year levels driven by mix impacts and advancement of commercial and innovation investments and target project spending aligned with our high-growth profile.
We're raising our EPS guidance range by $0.06 at midpoint to $8.30 to $8.38, reflecting 26% to 27% full year comparable EPS growth. We now estimate FX will provide $0.16 of positive full year EPS benefit, $0.01 lower than earlier estimates, net of established hedge positions. We've also refined our overall effective tax estimate to 19%, including an updated estimate of $0.29 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. As we complete 2021, we're advancing our plans for 2022 aligned with sustaining our strong revenue growth. We're confident we can maintain our excellent supply chain performance to support continued high growth and managing the inflationary impacts in our business while building on our strong 2021 profit results. We look forward to providing specifics on our 2022 financial outlook on our Q4 earnings call. 
That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments."

We're pleased to report another quarter of excellent results for IDEXX, driven by sustained momentum in our CAG business. We delivered double-digit organic revenue growth overall, supported by 11.5% organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth compared to very strong prior year growth levels. 2-year average annual organic growth rates across testing modalities were in line with growth in the first half of 2021, with clinical visit trends sustaining above pre-pandemic levels. These strong trends are evidence that veterinary practices worldwide continue to focus on elevating standards of care by leveraging IDEXX's advanced product and service platforms. The IDEXX team is doing an outstanding job supporting continued high growth in customer service levels, putting us on track towards 2021 financial performance at the high end of our previous outlook and above our long-term goals. 
Today, I'll highlight key areas of progress in our product and commercial initiatives that position us to deliver continued high growth and strong financial returns. Let's begin with a brief update on sector trends. Positive Companion Animal health care trends continued in the third quarter, building on the accelerated demand levels achieved throughout the pandemic. U.S. clinical visit growth was 2% in Q3 compared to strong 7% prior year third quarter growth levels, which included benefits from pent-up demand.
To normalize for prior year pandemic dynamics, we are monitoring 2-year average annual growth rates, which were 4.4% in Q3, continuing above the pre-pandemic levels of 2% to 3%. Wellness clinical visit growth of 6% on a 2-year basis points, the continued adoption of a preventive approach to pet health care, the sustained underlying momentum reflects the continued strengthening of the pet-owner bond, the benefit of stepped-up growth in the pet population beginning early during the COVID-19 pandemic through early 2021 and sustained focus in the veterinary clinic and medical services. Around the world, veterinarians passion for their work combined with pet owner desire for excellent care have driven this focus on services as they remain extremely busy. 
U.S. practice revenue growth in the third quarter advanced a healthy 7% versus the prior year and an even more impressive 9% on a 2-year basis, supported by 2-year average growth of 11% in clinical revenue and 13% in diagnostic revenue. Customers are clearly attracted to IDEXX's broad portfolio of products and services to support elevated levels of demand while also growing their practices. These positive dynamics are also true in our international regions. IDEXX's growth is sustaining at an even stronger rate reflected in the 16% 2-year average annual growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues in Q3, a premium of nearly 1,200 basis points above 2-year average clinical visit growth rates. High levels of execution and consistently strong sector trends reinforce our confidence in sustaining strong growth momentum as we finish the year and build our plans for 2022. Outstanding commercial execution has been a key driver of our business performance, and our team continues to support our customers at a high level.
This is evidenced by 36% year-on-year growth in premium instrument placements in Q3, a record number of third quarter placements for the company. High growth across our Catalyst, ProCyte and SediVue platform supported a 14% overall year-over-year increase in our premium installed base. Veterinarians are using IDEXX's diagnostic tools to build capacity and improve efficiency within the clinic to support future growth, which is also reflected in high levels of second Catalyst placements and continued strong 16% gains in Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts. Our strong global instrument placement momentum has long-term benefits and gives us further confidence that future consumable streams will also support continued strong growth. These results were achieved despite continued constraints on direct access to customers. Time for our customers is a scarce and valuable resource. 
In-person sales trends remain at approximately 60% in the U.S. and slightly lower in Europe at over 50%. Despite these constraints, our teams are in high levels of connection to our customers to deliver exceptional results by leveraging their trusted long-term relationships as highly relevant partners. We continue to enhance our commercial capabilities, the roll-in country level expansions of our field sales force to build on these results and to address the significant opportunities ahead of us.
We've completed our expansions in Germany, France and South Korea and are seeing significant positive traction in instrument placements and CAG recurring revenue growth in these countries as a result. In addition, we are expanding our footprint in 3 additional countries, as noted on our last call, with hiring, onboarding and training tracking well to our plans in those areas. We expect to be live in all second wave countries by the end of Q1 of next year.
In addition to our commercial footprint, we made progress in the past quarter in expanding our service footprint and capabilities in order to better support international business and customers. This included targeted investments to expand our European reference lab network and enhance our telemedicine service. These capabilities will support our long-term growth goals by ensuring we meet our customers' needs with a broad network and comprehensive portfolio of services, complementing our world-class reference lab facility in Kornwestheim, Germany. These advancements support high growth across our testing modalities as customers continue to take advantage of the flexibility offered by our customer-centric programs, such as IDEXX 360, to grow their businesses and elevate standards of care around the world. 
Innovative products like ProCyte One, are helping to build on this momentum. We've seen a very strong response to ProCyte One, having delivered over 1,000 units worldwide since launch and on track for the approximately 4,000 annual worldwide premium hematology placement pace we shared during Investor Day. Feedback from customers of all sizes have been overwhelmingly positive as they rave about ProCyte One's easy use, well maintenance profile and excellent performance.
Our growth trajectory now reflects launches in all 4 of our major regions with a select number of country launches remaining in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2022. ProCyte One provides a great opportunity for increased engagement with customers, supporting strong adoption of this new platform globally and a broader expansion of our business relationships. As an example, almost 95% of worldwide ProCyte One placements and nearly 100% in North America have either included a Catalyst One or have been placed at a customer that already has a Catalyst One, demonstrating the strong multiplier effect of this innovative product. 
Our Rapid Assay business is another area, which provides an opportunity to expand relationships with customers around the globe. Rapid Assay test revenues grew solidly in Q3 compared to a very strong prior year, and 14% on a 2-year basis with comparable gains in the U.S. and internationally. Vector-borne disease testing, a critical component to the Rapid Assay business and a wellness testing in the U.S. more broadly, was the primary driver of this growth as tick-borne disease becomes more prevalent in regions around the U.S. This testing growth continues to be supported by the SNAP Pro instrument, which helps drive engagement and loyalty through enhanced insight, accuracy and practice workflow benefits. Double-digit growth in the SNAP Pro installed base in the U.S. and internationally and recent innovations like critical decision support, which aids increasingly busy veterinarians in making critical decisions when faced with a positive test, have helped drive excellent 97% customer retention levels within the Rapid Assay business.
Our innovation strategy is also reflected in the expansion of our cloud-based software capabilities, which benefited from the Q2 acquisition of ezyVet. The integration of ezyVet into our software portfolio is proceeding to plan with high customer enthusiasm. ezyVet acquisition helped drive 33% reported growth of veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue in the third quarter, which was further supported by strong 15% organic growth in our core software and digital imaging products.
This growth reflects solid double-digit year-over-year gains in our profitable recurring revenue software products. It also demonstrates the benefit of a growing installed base of PIMS in industry-leading low-dose diagnostic imaging products. Cloud-based offerings represent the majority of PIMS placements at over 80% as cloud-based offerings provide performance, quality and life cycle cost advantages. And within Diagnostic Imaging, recent updates to the Web PACS product include additional features important to specialty practices and deeper, more seamless integrations with PIMS systems. With a growing installed base and very high retention levels, IDEXX Web PACS has become an important part of our enterprise software ecosystem. Product enhancements like this and others aimed at making clinical workflow and customer communications easier and more efficient are an impactful example of how our Technology for Life approach is supporting busy practices. 
Our commercial sales force and marketing teams continued to balance product sales with advancing the IDEXX Preventive Care program, which provides a structure and incentive for our customers, continue driving wellness testing and raising the standard of care. Enrollments in this program in the third quarter, despite constrained in-person discussions with customers, sustained at a rate similar to the second quarter as we executed approximately 150 new preventive care enrollments and continue to track towards our goal of 10,000 engaged customers in the U.S. by 2024.
In addition to strong commercial execution, our consistent growth trajectory also reflects resiliency and agility in our supply chain. This has enabled us to weather the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and meet the strong demand within our sector. IDEXX benefits from a number of factors related to our business, including strong long-term supplier relationships, nearshoring and product standardization and inventory buffers. These factors and their proactive approach managing frontline operational processes have allowed us to achieve 99% customer product availability through the pandemic, resulting in high customer satisfaction and increased retention.
We believe we are well prepared to support sustained high growth and service levels in our business going forward. While there may be relatively higher cost in certain areas to support our growth plans, we are confident we can manage these impacts effectively through our operational capability and focus while building on our strong financial performance. 
Overall, we feel very positive about our continued strong business momentum as we engage with and support veterinarians around the world who are advancing the care standard. Looking forward, we are proceeding with plans for sustained high growth aligned with our long-term growth potential as current momentum positions us well to support investments in the infrastructure, solutions and commercial capabilities necessary to achieve the significant opportunity ahead of us while delivering continued strong financial performance. Finally, I'd like to thank our employees and our customers for their perseverance and flexibility during these dynamic times. I'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished together and look forward to continued excellence in the future. 
That concludes my remarks, and we now have time for questions."

The -- Q3 was a record placement really across all our premium instruments, hematology, chemistry, SediVue. And we think, in part, what's driving that is less pent-up demand and more practices really investing in their practices because they're busy. They're looking for technology that can support productivity and obviously, greater patient flow. With respect to ProCyte One, you'll recall, we launched in the U.S. in late Q1 and then internationally, in late Q2. We see a very rapid uptake. The majority of the ProCyte One -- the vast majority of the ProCyte One either have gone into competitive accounts with Catalyst or into existing Catalyst accounts. So it's a real customer pleaser.
I think it's delivered on all aspects of the brand and product promise, easy use, performance, great cost profile. Keep in mind, it's also part of our paper run and auto replenishment model. So it's -- we're excited about the opportunity. If you recall from Investor Day, we identified almost 100,000 placement opportunities globally, 2/3 plus of that internationally. We're just in the early days of getting started on that. It's a very promising outlook for hematology. With respect to SediVue, we continue to make excellent progress in SediVue. Obviously, interim replacements were high, 30% plus. We saw a nice uptake in the U.S., a nice sequential progress internationally."

So I think that is the bigger trend that aligns with the higher end of our revenue growth outlook and that's informing our posture heading into next year that we're really planning for sustained strong growth. We're investing towards that, ensuring that we have high service levels.
So in terms of broader trends, I think Jay can provide some color, but I think the clinical visit trend was moderated a bit from the first half on a 2-year basis. We may be seeing some plateauing of the incremental growth benefit we saw from the step-up in new pets, although the pet population has expanded and sustained, and perhaps, it might be reflective of clinics just being quite busy.

And then if you take a look at how we've translated that in our own business, 60% globally CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, U.S. and internationally, those are 2-year figures. We've seen nice growth across all modalities, whether you look at the 1 year or 2 year. And I think our execution as a company has been excellent.

A number of practices have been able to really improve -- mix of workflow improvements and adjust capacity just by adding things like exam rooms and things like that. From the standpoint of what we can do, as a company, there's a number of really, I think, positive opportunities for us. Obviously, we provide technologies, analyzers tools, software that practices can invest in, that help them perform both in a higher medical or clinical level, but also more productively, whether it's communications or internally or with pet owners or really improving staff productivity. I think evidence of that is in the very significant step-up in instrument placements that we've seen and very fast growth in software at PIMS systems and ancillary systems that work with PIMS."

And we continue to provide a lot of training, including CE training virtually and the webinars to our customers so that they can get the training they need when they have some free windows at moments. So we try to be obviously respectful, but very efficient when we call on practices. And because I think most practice and practice owners consider as highly relevant to their success, they at large measure provide time when we meet with them and I think we had good results."

We're pleased to share another quarter of excellent financial results for IDEXX, driven by continued strong global momentum in our Companion Animal business.

We're pleased to share another quarter of excellent financial results for IDEXX, driven by continued strong global momentum in our Companion Animal business. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 12% as reported and 10% organically compared to high prior year growth levels. Third quarter results reflected 11.5% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues, with double-digit gains across U.S. and international markets. 2-year average annual organic growth for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue sustained at 16%, reflecting mid- to high teens 2-year average gains across our major modalities.
We also achieved a record third quarter level of premium instrument placements with strong global gains across our major platforms. High revenue growth and sustained operating margins compared to high prior year levels supported delivery of $2.03 in earnings per share, an increase of 12% on a comparable basis. Momentum in our CAG business has us on track to deliver 15.5% to 16% organic revenue growth, 200 to 225 basis points in comparable operating margin gains and 26% to 27% comparable EPS growth in 2021 at the higher end of our previous guidance ranges. 
We'll walk through the details of our updated full year outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our third quarter results and recent sector trends. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by 13% CAG revenue gains and 13% growth in our water business. These gains were moderated by a 23% organic decline in LPD revenues compared to high prior year levels, which benefited from the ramping of African swine fever testing in China as well as by a $3 million year-on-year decline in human COVID PCR testing.
CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 11.5% organically compared to strong prior year growth levels, reflecting 10% gains in the U.S. and 14% growth in international regions. On a 2-year basis, average annual CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 16% overall, reflecting 16% gains in both U.S. and international regions. Strong CAG results were also supported by 15% organic growth in veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging revenues in addition to benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition and 33% year-on-year growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues. We continue to achieve very high levels of supply chain reliability across our business, reflecting outstanding performance by our operating teams, enabling us to support continued high levels of growth in customer service. 
Continued strong U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth was supported by year-on-year gains in U.S. clinical visits. U.S. clinical visit growth was 2% overall in Q3, with solid gains across wellness and non-wellness categories. This compared to strong 7% gains in the third quarter of 2020, which included benefits from pent-up clinical demand, including very high growth in wellness testing. On a 2-year basis, U.S. same-store clinical visit growth increased at a 4.4% average annual rate, sustaining above annual clinic visit growth trends heading into the pandemic.
The IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was approximately 850 basis points on a 1-year basis compared to very strong prior year growth levels for diagnostic testing, which supported a 1,500 basis point growth premium last year. On an average 2-year basis, which helps to calibrate for year-on-year pandemic dynamics, the growth premium was approximately 1,200 basis points in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2-year trends in the first half of the year. Expanding pet health care services, including continued solid increases in the utilization of diagnostics, supported a 7% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q3. Diagnostic revenues per practice increased 7% on a 1-year basis and 13% on an average 2-year basis, consistent with recent 2-year growth trends. 
IDEXX innovation and commercial engagement continues to build on positive health care demand trends, driving high Q3 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX Reference Lab revenues increased 10% organically in Q3, with similar year-on-year gains in U.S. and international regions. Global Reference Lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth with strong gains across testing categories.
IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 14% organically in the third quarter, reflecting double-digit gains in the U.S. and continued high growth in international regions. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. IDEXX achieved a third quarter record of 4,307 premium CAG instrument placements, up over 1,100 units or 36% from constrained prior year levels, reflecting strong gains across U.S. and international regions. We saw strong global placement gains across our platforms with Catalyst up 22%; premium hematology, up 62%; and SediVue, up 30%. The quality of CAG instrument placements remains excellent, reflected in 344 Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 14% year-on-year and 1,003 new and competitive placements in international regions, up 17%.
We also benefited from 571 second Catalyst placements driven by continued stronger demand from high-volume customers. The global rollout of ProCyte One continues to support strong overall placement momentum with the majority of our ProCyte One placements in new and competitive accounts. New instrument placements and continued very high customer retention levels supported a 14% year-on-year growth in our global premium installed base, setting a foundation for continued high growth in IDEXX VetLab recurring diagnostic revenues. 
Rapid Assay revenues expanded 9% organically in Q3 compared to strong prior year demand levels that included benefits from pent-up demand for wellness testing. Growth in vector-borne disease testing drove solid year-on-year volume games in the U.S. and global growth continues to benefit from double-digit gains in international regions. High CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven across our modalities with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%.
In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 15% organically and 33% as reported, including benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition. Strong growth in veterinary software services was supported by double-digit comparable gains in PIMS placements and continued strong growth in related recurring services. We also saw continued high growth in diagnostic imaging system placements driven by our entry-level ImageVue DR30 platform with nearly 80% of placements at competitive accounts. We continue to see 20%-plus growth in recurring digital service revenues, including expansion of Web PACS subscriptions, aligned with our expanding cloud-based capability. 
Turning to other business segments. Water revenue increased 13% organically in Q3 compared to 4% organic declines in last year's third quarter as this business continues to track back towards pre-COVID growth levels. Business growth was supported by solid gains across compliance and noncompliance testing categories. Life cycle poultry and dairy revenue decreased organically 23% in Q3 compared to 18% organic growth levels in Q3 of 2020. Overall dynamics in our China LPD and related export testing businesses offset growth in other global regions.
As expected, Q3 revenue growth was constrained by the lapping of high prior year demand for African swine fever testing and lower herd health screening levels. We're now seeing additional constraints on China LPD testing demand, reflecting relaxation of local African swine fever disease management approaches in China and as we work through impacts from low pork prices and changing government regulations related to livestock infectious disease testing programs. Reflecting these factors, we're planning for continued lower LPD revenues overall in upcoming quarters, which is factored into our 2021 financial outlook. 
Turning to the P&L. Sustained high revenue growth supported double-digit comparable operating profit and EPS gains. Operating profit increased 32% as reported, including benefits from lapping of a $27.5 million G&A charge related to an ongoing litigation matter, which is excluded from our comparable growth metrics. On a comparable basis, operating profits expanded 12% and operating margins increased 20 basis points compared to high prior year levels, which included benefits from pandemic-related cost controls.
Gross profit increased 12% in Q3, reflecting strong revenue gains. Gross margins decreased modestly on a comparable basis as benefits from continued high recurring CAG diagnostic revenue growth and moderate net price gains were offset by business mix impacts from high CAG instrument revenue growth and lower LPD and human PCR revenues. We also saw some gross margin impact from investments in our lab business to support high growth and customer service levels. Operating expenses decreased 2% as reported and increased 10% on a comparable basis in Q3.
As expected, we saw a higher level of comparable OpEx growth as we advance investments in our global commercial innovation capability and onboard the ezyVet acquisition. Q2 -- Q3 EPS was $2.03 per share, including benefits of $4 million or $0.05 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable basis, Q3 EPS increased 12%. Foreign exchange added $2 million to operating profits and $0.02 to EPS in Q3 net of $2 million in hedge losses. 
Free cash flow was $354 million in Q3 and $458 million for the first 9 months of 2021. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 88%. We increased our 2021 full year outlook for free cash flow conversion to 80% to 85% of net income, reflecting a refined capital spending estimate of approximately $150 million, including approximately $20 million in real estate purchases.
As we advance plans for 2022, we expect an increase in capital spending levels to support additions to our manufacturing and distribution capacity aligned with our high-growth profile. Our balance sheet remains at a strong position. We ended the quarter with debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratios of 0.8x gross and 0.7x net of cash with $145 million in cash and no borrowings on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We allocated $184 million in capital to repurchase 275,000 shares in the quarter. 
Turning to our 2021 full year outlook. We're updating our projected range for overall revenue to $3.185 billion to $3.200 billion. Based on our continued strong momentum in Q2 -- Q3, we're increasing the lower end of our organic growth outlook by 1% and maintaining the higher end of our growth outlook aligned with sustained high 2-year annual growth trends for CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Operationally, this results in an increase of $10 million in our full year revenue outlook at midpoint. These improvements are offset by a $5 million FX headwind compared to our last outlook related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our updated reported revenue growth outlook is 17.5% to 18%, including approximately 1.5% of full year growth benefit from FX and 0.5% of growth benefit from acquisitions.
Our updated overall organic growth outlook of 15.5% to 16% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 17% to 17.5% for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue. Other elements of our revenue growth outlook include continued expectations for lower year-on-year LPD revenues in the second half and for a reduction in human COVID testing revenues year-on-year. In terms of key financial metrics, we've refined our reported operating margin outlook for 2021 to 28.8% to 29%, reflecting expectations for 200 to 225 basis points of full year comparable operating margin improvement at the high end of our last guidance range. We're planning for moderately lower operating margins in Q4 compared to high prior year levels driven by mix impacts and advancement of commercial and innovation investments and target project spending aligned with our high-growth profile.
We're raising our EPS guidance range by $0.06 at midpoint to $8.30 to $8.38, reflecting 26% to 27% full year comparable EPS growth. We now estimate FX will provide $0.16 of positive full year EPS benefit, $0.01 lower than earlier estimates, net of established hedge positions. We've also refined our overall effective tax estimate to 19%, including an updated estimate of $0.29 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. As we complete 2021, we're advancing our plans for 2022 aligned with sustaining our strong revenue growth. We're confident we can maintain our excellent supply chain performance to support continued high growth and managing the inflationary impacts in our business while building on our strong 2021 profit results. We look forward to providing specifics on our 2022 financial outlook on our Q4 earnings call. 
That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments."

We're pleased to report another quarter of excellent results for IDEXX, driven by sustained momentum in our CAG business. We delivered double-digit organic revenue growth overall, supported by 11.5% organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth compared to very strong prior year growth levels. 2-year average annual organic growth rates across testing modalities were in line with growth in the first half of 2021, with clinical visit trends sustaining above pre-pandemic levels. These strong trends are evidence that veterinary practices worldwide continue to focus on elevating standards of care by leveraging IDEXX's advanced product and service platforms. The IDEXX team is doing an outstanding job supporting continued high growth in customer service levels, putting us on track towards 2021 financial performance at the high end of our previous outlook and above our long-term goals. 
Today, I'll highlight key areas of progress in our product and commercial initiatives that position us to deliver continued high growth and strong financial returns. Let's begin with a brief update on sector trends. Positive Companion Animal health care trends continued in the third quarter, building on the accelerated demand levels achieved throughout the pandemic. U.S. clinical visit growth was 2% in Q3 compared to strong 7% prior year third quarter growth levels, which included benefits from pent-up demand.
To normalize for prior year pandemic dynamics, we are monitoring 2-year average annual growth rates, which were 4.4% in Q3, continuing above the pre-pandemic levels of 2% to 3%. Wellness clinical visit growth of 6% on a 2-year basis points, the continued adoption of a preventive approach to pet health care, the sustained underlying momentum reflects the continued strengthening of the pet-owner bond, the benefit of stepped-up growth in the pet population beginning early during the COVID-19 pandemic through early 2021 and sustained focus in the veterinary clinic and medical services. Around the world, veterinarians passion for their work combined with pet owner desire for excellent care have driven this focus on services as they remain extremely busy. 
U.S. practice revenue growth in the third quarter advanced a healthy 7% versus the prior year and an even more impressive 9% on a 2-year basis, supported by 2-year average growth of 11% in clinical revenue and 13% in diagnostic revenue. Customers are clearly attracted to IDEXX's broad portfolio of products and services to support elevated levels of demand while also growing their practices. These positive dynamics are also true in our international regions. IDEXX's growth is sustaining at an even stronger rate reflected in the 16% 2-year average annual growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues in Q3, a premium of nearly 1,200 basis points above 2-year average clinical visit growth rates. High levels of execution and consistently strong sector trends reinforce our confidence in sustaining strong growth momentum as we finish the year and build our plans for 2022. Outstanding commercial execution has been a key driver of our business performance, and our team continues to support our customers at a high level.
This is evidenced by 36% year-on-year growth in premium instrument placements in Q3, a record number of third quarter placements for the company. High growth across our Catalyst, ProCyte and SediVue platform supported a 14% overall year-over-year increase in our premium installed base. Veterinarians are using IDEXX's diagnostic tools to build capacity and improve efficiency within the clinic to support future growth, which is also reflected in high levels of second Catalyst placements and continued strong 16% gains in Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts. Our strong global instrument placement momentum has long-term benefits and gives us further confidence that future consumable streams will also support continued strong growth. These results were achieved despite continued constraints on direct access to customers. Time for our customers is a scarce and valuable resource. 
In-person sales trends remain at approximately 60% in the U.S. and slightly lower in Europe at over 50%. Despite these constraints, our teams are in high levels of connection to our customers to deliver exceptional results by leveraging their trusted long-term relationships as highly relevant partners. We continue to enhance our commercial capabilities, the roll-in country level expansions of our field sales force to build on these results and to address the significant opportunities ahead of us.
We've completed our expansions in Germany, France and South Korea and are seeing significant positive traction in instrument placements and CAG recurring revenue growth in these countries as a result. In addition, we are expanding our footprint in 3 additional countries, as noted on our last call, with hiring, onboarding and training tracking well to our plans in those areas. We expect to be live in all second wave countries by the end of Q1 of next year.
In addition to our commercial footprint, we made progress in the past quarter in expanding our service footprint and capabilities in order to better support international business and customers. This included targeted investments to expand our European reference lab network and enhance our telemedicine service. These capabilities will support our long-term growth goals by ensuring we meet our customers' needs with a broad network and comprehensive portfolio of services, complementing our world-class reference lab facility in Kornwestheim, Germany. These advancements support high growth across our testing modalities as customers continue to take advantage of the flexibility offered by our customer-centric programs, such as IDEXX 360, to grow their businesses and elevate standards of care around the world. 
Innovative products like ProCyte One, are helping to build on this momentum. We've seen a very strong response to ProCyte One, having delivered over 1,000 units worldwide since launch and on track for the approximately 4,000 annual worldwide premium hematology placement pace we shared during Investor Day. Feedback from customers of all sizes have been overwhelmingly positive as they rave about ProCyte One's easy use, well maintenance profile and excellent performance.
Our growth trajectory now reflects launches in all 4 of our major regions with a select number of country launches remaining in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2022. ProCyte One provides a great opportunity for increased engagement with customers, supporting strong adoption of this new platform globally and a broader expansion of our business relationships. As an example, almost 95% of worldwide ProCyte One placements and nearly 100% in North America have either included a Catalyst One or have been placed at a customer that already has a Catalyst One, demonstrating the strong multiplier effect of this innovative product. 
Our Rapid Assay business is another area, which provides an opportunity to expand relationships with customers around the globe. Rapid Assay test revenues grew solidly in Q3 compared to a very strong prior year, and 14% on a 2-year basis with comparable gains in the U.S. and internationally. Vector-borne disease testing, a critical component to the Rapid Assay business and a wellness testing in the U.S. more broadly, was the primary driver of this growth as tick-borne disease becomes more prevalent in regions around the U.S. This testing growth continues to be supported by the SNAP Pro instrument, which helps drive engagement and loyalty through enhanced insight, accuracy and practice workflow benefits. Double-digit growth in the SNAP Pro installed base in the U.S. and internationally and recent innovations like critical decision support, which aids increasingly busy veterinarians in making critical decisions when faced with a positive test, have helped drive excellent 97% customer retention levels within the Rapid Assay business.
Our innovation strategy is also reflected in the expansion of our cloud-based software capabilities, which benefited from the Q2 acquisition of ezyVet. The integration of ezyVet into our software portfolio is proceeding to plan with high customer enthusiasm. ezyVet acquisition helped drive 33% reported growth of veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue in the third quarter, which was further supported by strong 15% organic growth in our core software and digital imaging products.
This growth reflects solid double-digit year-over-year gains in our profitable recurring revenue software products. It also demonstrates the benefit of a growing installed base of PIMS in industry-leading low-dose diagnostic imaging products. Cloud-based offerings represent the majority of PIMS placements at over 80% as cloud-based offerings provide performance, quality and life cycle cost advantages. And within Diagnostic Imaging, recent updates to the Web PACS product include additional features important to specialty practices and deeper, more seamless integrations with PIMS systems. With a growing installed base and very high retention levels, IDEXX Web PACS has become an important part of our enterprise software ecosystem. Product enhancements like this and others aimed at making clinical workflow and customer communications easier and more efficient are an impactful example of how our Technology for Life approach is supporting busy practices. 
Our commercial sales force and marketing teams continued to balance product sales with advancing the IDEXX Preventive Care program, which provides a structure and incentive for our customers, continue driving wellness testing and raising the standard of care. Enrollments in this program in the third quarter, despite constrained in-person discussions with customers, sustained at a rate similar to the second quarter as we executed approximately 150 new preventive care enrollments and continue to track towards our goal of 10,000 engaged customers in the U.S. by 2024.
In addition to strong commercial execution, our consistent growth trajectory also reflects resiliency and agility in our supply chain. This has enabled us to weather the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and meet the strong demand within our sector. IDEXX benefits from a number of factors related to our business, including strong long-term supplier relationships, nearshoring and product standardization and inventory buffers. These factors and their proactive approach managing frontline operational processes have allowed us to achieve 99% customer product availability through the pandemic, resulting in high customer satisfaction and increased retention.
We believe we are well prepared to support sustained high growth and service levels in our business going forward. While there may be relatively higher cost in certain areas to support our growth plans, we are confident we can manage these impacts effectively through our operational capability and focus while building on our strong financial performance. 
Overall, we feel very positive about our continued strong business momentum as we engage with and support veterinarians around the world who are advancing the care standard. Looking forward, we are proceeding with plans for sustained high growth aligned with our long-term growth potential as current momentum positions us well to support investments in the infrastructure, solutions and commercial capabilities necessary to achieve the significant opportunity ahead of us while delivering continued strong financial performance. Finally, I'd like to thank our employees and our customers for their perseverance and flexibility during these dynamic times. I'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished together and look forward to continued excellence in the future. 
That concludes my remarks, and we now have time for questions."

The -- Q3 was a record placement really across all our premium instruments, hematology, chemistry, SediVue. And we think, in part, what's driving that is less pent-up demand and more practices really investing in their practices because they're busy. They're looking for technology that can support productivity and obviously, greater patient flow. With respect to ProCyte One, you'll recall, we launched in the U.S. in late Q1 and then internationally, in late Q2. We see a very rapid uptake. The majority of the ProCyte One -- the vast majority of the ProCyte One either have gone into competitive accounts with Catalyst or into existing Catalyst accounts. So it's a real customer pleaser.
I think it's delivered on all aspects of the brand and product promise, easy use, performance, great cost profile. Keep in mind, it's also part of our paper run and auto replenishment model. So it's -- we're excited about the opportunity. If you recall from Investor Day, we identified almost 100,000 placement opportunities globally, 2/3 plus of that internationally. We're just in the early days of getting started on that. It's a very promising outlook for hematology. With respect to SediVue, we continue to make excellent progress in SediVue. Obviously, interim replacements were high, 30% plus. We saw a nice uptake in the U.S., a nice sequential progress internationally."

So I think that is the bigger trend that aligns with the higher end of our revenue growth outlook and that's informing our posture heading into next year that we're really planning for sustained strong growth. We're investing towards that, ensuring that we have high service levels.
So in terms of broader trends, I think Jay can provide some color, but I think the clinical visit trend was moderated a bit from the first half on a 2-year basis. We may be seeing some plateauing of the incremental growth benefit we saw from the step-up in new pets, although the pet population has expanded and sustained, and perhaps, it might be reflective of clinics just being quite busy.

We've seen nice growth across all modalities, whether you look at the 1 year or 2 year. And I think our execution as a company has been excellent.

A number of practices have been able to really improve -- mix of workflow improvements and adjust capacity just by adding things like exam rooms and things like that. From the standpoint of what we can do, as a company, there's a number of really, I think, positive opportunities for us. Obviously, we provide technologies, analyzers tools, software that practices can invest in, that help them perform both in a higher medical or clinical level, but also more productively, whether it's communications or internally or with pet owners or really improving staff productivity. I think evidence of that is in the very significant step-up in instrument placements that we've seen and very fast growth in software at PIMS systems and ancillary systems that work with PIMS."
