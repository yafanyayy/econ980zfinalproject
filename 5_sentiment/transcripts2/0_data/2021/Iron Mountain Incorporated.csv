Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well. As we close out a year, which has been marked by a first quarter, delivering near record growth to a remaining year",2725,"Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well. As we close out a year, which has been marked by a first quarter, delivering near record growth to a remaining year where we had to manage headwinds from COVID. I want to take a few minutes to reflect on where we've been and where we're going. First, I want to pause and acknowledge that we continue to fight COVID-19, and we maintain making the safety of our employees, their families and our customers our first priority. Whilst we are optimistic of the positive impact the rollout of vaccines will have, we continue to believe that 2021 will look similar to 2020, albeit in reverse in terms of the macroeconomic landscape. However, 2020 was also a year where there was much to celebrate, which came out of the creativity and resiliency demonstrated by our teams. I couldn't be more proud of my fellow mountaineers around the world in terms of the way we responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a phrase, we managed the crisis, the crisis didn't manage us. We continue to serve our customers where throughout the depths of the crisis, more than 96% of our facilities remained open. We maintained our focus on Project Summit, where we increased our targeted sustained annual cost savings from $200 million to $375 million and have already achieved over $200 million on an annual run rate by the end of 2020. We accelerated our growth in data center with 58.5 megawatts of new leases announced in 2020 versus 16.9 megawatts in 2019. We continued our investment in new products and innovation with a focus on supporting our customers' remote workforces. These services-led to growth in our digital solutions year-on-year of 8%, excluding FX. And we continue to see good returns from our global strategic accounts organization and maintained our focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit to be one more in tune with accelerating our revenue growth through new services and solutions. This continued focus on expanding our service offerings to our customer base of 225,000 customers in organizations in spite of COVID, has allowed us to guide to organic revenue growth of 2% to 6% in 2021, the highest level of growth in the past decade. 
This significant investment in innovation and new product development is supported by our purpose to be our customers' most trusted partner for protecting and unlocking the value of what matters most to them in innovative and socially responsible ways. Our strategy is highlighted by an important balance between accelerating growth, driven by developing end-to-end solutions to help our customers unlock value from their content as well as sustaining growth in physical storage and data center. In other words, being both the lock and the key to many of our customers' physical and digital data assets. 
The strategy is underpinned by our high-performance, customer-obsessed culture and our strong customer connection with not only 225,000 customers, but over 950 of the world's largest 1,000 companies. It is not simply investment in products that has given us accelerated revenue growth but a deliberate focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit. This shift in culture is marked by a singular focus on our customers as our north star; an acceleration in our commitments around diversity and inclusion, not just because it is just, but also because it is a key to our strategic success in being a more creative and dynamic organization, which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs; and an increase in our commitments to carbon neutrality. 2020 stars continue to secure renewable energy to meet the power needs of 100% of our data centers, even with the rapid increase in bookings in new facilities operating. 
Some examples of our laser focus on how we have responded to our customers' needs in more creative ways, included processing unemployment benefits to get them into the hands of people in need during the crisis and setting up 12 digital mail rooms around the globe for customers who didn't know how they were going to stay connected with their remote workforce. In a phrase, we helped our customers when they needed it most. What that all means to me is that we came out of 2020 stronger than ever, a company with a new sense of momentum that will fuel both our top and bottom line growth. 
For the next few minutes, allow me to illustrate for you what I mean by momentum. If resilience was the word for 2020, growth is the word for 2021. We're already seeing evidence of this growth in data centers, for example, and expect this to continue. As we have discussed before, we are also seeing good growth in digital solutions as well as physical storage, both from the continued durability of our records management business, together with an expanding consumer business and believe this growth should continue. This change in revenue growth trajectory is a direct result of the investments we have made in new product areas, coupled with changes we have made in our commercial engine. One of the fundamental changes we have made in our commercial approach is that we have invested in creating more time for our salespeople to engage differently with our strategic customers. This extra time with customers has allowed us to uncover new revenue opportunities, not just for additional physical storage and new data center customers but for digital services, which provides both greater visibility for doc data as well as driving much more value from data borne both physically and digitally. 
As a result, you can see both from our performance last year as well as the guidance we have provided today for 2021, our company is more and more seen by our customers as a partner who, yes, protects and manages all their physical and digital assets but also gives our customers the key to integrating their information, unlocking its value as well as accelerating their own digital transformation journey. For 70 years, we've offered protection for the assets our customers value most. We now more and more catalog, index, govern and manage complete information across physical and digital domains, securely storing what customers need, disposing of what they down and helping them unearth the insights that drive business transformation. 
Let's now explore some exciting growth opportunities ahead of us. These are areas where we see great opportunities for growth as we position ourselves to unlock greater value for our customers and include data centers, fine arts and entertainment services, consumer storage, secure IT asset disposition or SITAD, small and medium business, content service platform, or CSP, think of this as electronic content management or ECM on steroids and secure offline storage for a highly secure air gap data storage for cost-effective protection against ransom attacks. Let's go into a little bit more detail about a couple of these areas. In data center, we have built a strong global platform with 15 operating facilities across 3 continents since 2017, and we just announced an agreement which once closed will mark our entry into the very fast-growing Indian market through our investment in web works. The total addressable market for our data centers globally is $20 billion and is growing at over 10% for co-location or retail customers in over 40% for the hyperscale segment. 
If you look at fine art storage and entertainment services, it's roughly a $2 billion market for both together. Just 2 months ago, the LA Times wrote an article about our entertainment services business. They called us the Fort Knox of Hollywood. The article highlighted how we are driving a different level of growth in that business through not just storage but how we facilitate more opportunities for the studios and artists in distributing their assets to viewers and listeners. In consumer, we've grown the business in 1 year from about 2 million cubic feet of storage to more than 7 million cubic feet of storage, so 3x as big in just 12 months. The total addressable market for consumer storage is more than $35 billion, and it is growing at about 5% to 6% per year. I'd note that our segment focus is on valet storage, where our logistics expertise gives us a strong competitive advantage as well as being a nice submarket, which represents a significant opportunity for future growth. Our SITAD business has an addressable market of $10 billion, and we have seen strong growth in this business over the course of 2020. More importantly, we have found that our strong heritage around data security and chain of custody is proving a differentiator as we recently took on the global responsibility for SITAD on behalf of 2 large financial institutions. So hopefully, this helps you appreciate why we are so excited about the growth opportunities as we look to 2021 and beyond. Taken together, the 7 areas I highlighted earlier represent a significant market opportunity for us. 
Let me put some context around that. If you look back to 2015, the total addressable market we competed in was $10 billion. And on average, those markets had low growth rates. Over the last 5 years, as we've listened to customers, built expertise and developed new products and solutions, the addressable market we now compete in is over $80 billion, yes, $80 billion. Additionally, those products and services that we've developed expertise in are growing at a 13% organic growth rate. So not only has the addressable market for expanded service has grown by over 8x, but these new areas have double-digit industry growth rates, which helps facilitate our entry. Let me now shift gears and briefly review our performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2020. 
At a high level, we couldn't have been more pleased with the way our mountaineers navigated the challenging environment in 2020 brought on by COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, we were laser-focused on execution and controlling those factors that we could, leading to outperformance against our own internal expectations through the last 3 quarters of 2020. This resulted in continued strength in total storage rental revenue, which grew nearly 4% on a constant currency basis and 2.4% organically. While service revenue declines continued to offset the solid storage growth, we grew adjusted EBITDA 1.3% when adjusting for currency, and our margin expanded 110 basis points in 2020. This, all in spite of total revenue being down $115 million due to service activity declines. 
I want to thank our teams across the globe who stayed focused in the face of so many obvious distractions. Our success is a reflection of our mountaineers' dedication, and most importantly, I have been inspired by the way our teams looked after both the physical and the mental health of each other as they navigated the threats from COVID, both at work and at home. 
Turning now to our physical storage business. Total global organic volume was essentially flat compared to the third quarter. Contributing to this was a 1.9 million cubic foot increase in consumer and adjacent businesses, offset by a similar decrease in records and information management volume. For the full year, total global organic volume was flat, which is a good outcome considering the environment in which we were operating. This year, we expect total global organic volume to be flat to slightly up. Looking more specifically at RIM organic volume, this was down 1.9 million cubic feet sequentially. For the full year, organic volume declined 1.1%. In our global digital solutions business in 2020, we were actually able to grow service revenue 8% year-over-year, excluding FX. Despite the pandemic, our team grew revenue. This goes back to the different mindset I mentioned earlier. We see a further acceleration in our digital Solutions business going into 2021 and expect to exceed $300 million in revenue for the year. 
Turning now to our global data center segment. The team had a phenomenal year, blowing its leasing targets out of the water quarter after quarter. For the full year, we leased more than 58 megawatts remember, our target coming into 2020 was 15 to 20 megawatts. I want to underscore that, that success was not just the result of leasing to hyperscalers. We had very good commercial momentum in our core enterprise retail colocation business, which represented 12 megawatts of the 58 megawatts or close to 40% of our bookings, excluding Frankfurt. We attracted 73 new logos to our platform during 2020, adding to our broad and diverse base of more than 1,300 data center customers. This should enable us to strengthen our network ecosystem and increase the stickiness of our deployments. We also had a busy year in terms of development with more than 10 megawatts commissioned across multiple data centers and geographies increasing our leasable megawatts to 130. Our team is actively adding to our development pipeline to ensure we have the right capacity in the right markets to meet robust customer demand, and we are excited for the opportunities we see ahead of us in 2021, where we expect to end the year with over 170 leasable megawatts. One of those opportunities is further expanding our data center footprint into new fast-growing markets. As I mentioned earlier, this morning, we announced entering into an agreement for a strategic JV with Webworks, which once closed, would expand our reach to India, including Mumbai, Pune and Delhi. The data center market in India is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years, and India is the second largest telecommunications market in the world. We are excited to be an early mover into an emerging market where the demand is high and the supply is low. 
Turning to Project Summit. We generated adjusted EBITDA benefits of $165 million in 2020, consistent with our most recent expectations and significantly ahead of our initial estimates of $80 million, reflecting strong execution in swift and decisive actions activity -- actions on early initiatives. This gives us an exit rate of annual savings of over $200 million heading into 2021. As you will hear from Barry in more detail, we are fully on track to recognize the estimated $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefiting this year, and we are expecting  -- and we are excited for the tangible benefits we will experience this year as we continue to enhance our technology and processes. Before I wrap up, I'd like to provide a little more detail about our continued commitment to cut our carbon emissions I referenced earlier. We were one of the first 100 or so corporations worldwide to have an ambitious carbon reduction goal approved by the science-based targets initiative as being aligned with the Paris Climate Accord. Already in 2019, we reported that our goal to cut 25% was more than doubled by delivering a 52% reduction 6 years sooner than our 2025 commitment. As we did this whilst growing our global data center business, one of the most energy-intensive industries in the world. We continue to flex our innovation muscle around energy consumption as well as having introduced the Green Power Pass to our customers. This is the first solution of its kind and allows us to pass the benefits of 100% renewable energy data center platform to our customers for them to use to meet their sustainability targets. We are confident based upon the momentum we are building in this area that we can achieve 100% carbon neutrality well before 2050 in spite of our rapidly growing data center business. 
To summarize, I've never been more optimistic about our opportunities for growth at any other time in our history, even with the anticipated continued headwinds due to COVID impacting our traditional service areas. And I've never been more proud of how we've behaved as an organization over the course of 2020 and through the pandemic. We went above and beyond for our customers and our teams and embrace new collaboration tools and change how we work. Our mountaineers truly lived our values day in and day out. I'm excited to be on this journey with you all, and I can't wait to see the future together. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics. For the full year, revenue of $4.1 billion d",1622,"Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our full year and fourth quarter results. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics. For the full year, revenue of $4.1 billion declined 2.7% on a reported basis, which includes a 100 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined 3.3%. Organic service revenue declined 12.8%, reflecting the continued COVID impact on our activity levels. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.4%, driven by more than 2 points of revenue management. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.3% year-on-year to $1.48 billion. Reflecting the team's strong progress with Project Summit and revenue management, EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points to 35.6%, representing the best margin performance in the company's history. Importantly, we see opportunity for profitability to continue to expand over time. AFFO increased 2.4% to $888 million or $3.07 on a per share basis. 
Before I go into more detail, let me draw your attention to Slide 13 of our earnings presentation. We have made some refinements to our non-GAAP measures, spurred by feedback from the investment community that some of our non-GAAP measures are difficult to compare to peers. This includes changes to how we account for unconsolidated ventures, stock-based compensation and a portion of growth capital. To ensure comparability and transparency, we have provided our results on both the former and new methodology. Of course, the prior method will be comparable to current consensus estimates. For example, under our former methodology, full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $1.45 billion, which compares to the current consensus of $1.446 billion. More detail is available in our earnings slides and on our Investor Relations website. 
Now turning to our results for the quarter, which are based on our updated non-GAAP definitions. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion declined 1.8%, which includes a 40 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined 3.4%. Organic service revenue declined 12.1%. Overall, we continue to see service declines moderate with the fourth quarter reflecting a modest improvement in service trends. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7%, driven by revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA was $374 million under both our new and former definition. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as revenue trends, both in storage and service were better than planned. Fourth quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix, offset by COVID-driven impacts to the business. AFFO was $191 million or $0.66 on a per share basis, in line with our prior projections. AFFO reflects an increase in recurring CapEx that have been deferred earlier in the year in higher cash taxes. 
Turning to segment performance. In the fourth quarter, our global RIM business had strong storage revenue growth, driven by volume growth in our faster-growing markets and revenue management. This was offset by declines in service revenue, albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year, leading to total organic revenue decline of 3.6%. In our shred business, the combination of lower tonnage and an 8% decline in paper price versus last year resulted in a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. While there's been a slight step-up in the index prices in January, recycled paper prices have remained low. At recent levels, we anticipate paper prices will result in EBITDA headwind of slightly over $10 million in 2021. We are pleased with the continued momentum in our consumer storage business as it becomes a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points, driven by revenue management and Project Summit. 
In the fourth quarter, we continue to see fixed cost deleverage as we ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level to fully support our customers. We also had a step-up in facility expense as we invested in maintenance that we had delayed over the prior 2 quarters. Taking a look at headline numbers for our global data center business, full year bookings came in at 58.5 megawatts, excluding the full building lease in Frankfurt, we leased 31.5 megawatts, representing bookings growth of 26%. Total revenue grew 9% year-over-year. We are pleased with our data center performance for the year and expect to continue to see an improving trajectory, thanks to the strong commercial success. In 2021, we expect to lease 25 to 30 megawatts, which at the midpoint would result in more than 20% annual bookings growth. We feel good about the state of our pipeline, both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail colocation. We project full year revenue growth in the range of low double digits to approaching mid-teens. With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility to revenue. For the first quarter, we expect growth rates similar to the fourth quarter as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commence in the second quarter and beyond. 
Turning to Project Summit. As a reminder, we expect total program benefits of $375 million of which we delivered $165 million in 2020. We expect an additional $150 million benefit in 2021 with the balance in 2022. This quarter, the team delivered $52 million of adjusted EBITDA benefit. As to capital expenditures, in the fourth quarter, we invested $163 million, bringing the full year to $446 million, in line with our prior expectations. In 2021, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million, consisting of approximately $410 million of growth CapEx, of which we plan to allocate approximately $300 million to data center development. We expect $140 million of recurring CapEx. 
Turning to capital recycling. In the fourth quarter, our program generated approximately $451 million of proceeds, which includes the Frankfurt data center joint venture we mentioned last quarter. For the full year, our capital recycling program generated approximately $475 million. I would like to call out the sale-leaseback transaction we announced in December, in which we sold a portfolio of 13 industrial facilities, generating gross proceeds of $358 million. This portfolio was sold at a cap rate slightly below 4.5%. This was a compelling opportunity for us to monetize a small portion of our owned industrial assets while effectively maintaining long-term control of the facilities through an initial 10-year lease with multiple renewal options, among other favorable terms. On a leverage-neutral basis, this transaction freed up approximately $260 million of investable capital that we intend to redeploy into faster-growing areas, including our data center business. We plan to make these investments in 2021, so our year-end net debt balance reflects these proceeds. With a highly favorable market backdrop in our strong data center development pipeline, we are planning to continue to recycle industrial assets. In 2021, we are planning for $125 million of recycling. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At year-end, we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity. We ended the year with net lease-adjusted leverage of 5.3x, down from 5.7x at year-end 2019. The pro forma, excluding the investable proceeds from our leaseback, leverage would have been slightly under 5.5x. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5x. For 2021, we expect to end the year within our target range near the high end. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April. As we have said before, we are fully committed to our dividend at this sustainable level. Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid-60s as a percentage of AFFO. 
Now to give you more details as to our outlook for 2021, we are pleased to reinstitute financial guidance reflecting the strength of our business, our team's strong execution and improved visibility. For the full year 2021, we currently expect revenue of $4.325 billion to $4.475 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.575 billion to $1.625 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents revenue growth of 6% and EBITDA growth of 8%. At the midpoint, our guidance implies about 75 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement year-on-year. We expect AFFO to be in the range of $945 million to $995 million or $3.25 to $3.42 per share. At the midpoint, this represents 9% growth for both metrics. Our guidance assumes global physical volume will be flat to slightly positive, revenue management will be a significant benefit in 2021. And I will note the majority of those actions have already been taken as we speak to you today, and nearly all of them will be in place by the end of the quarter as we are seeing in digital solutions, combined with a slight recovery in our service activity across the year. In terms of EBITDA, our expectations include the benefit from revenue management and top line growth as well as Project Summit savings. Partially offsetting those benefits is a prudent outlook for inflation, a step-up in cost from prior COVID-driven discretion, rent from our sale-leaseback transactions and innovation spend. While we do not typically guide quarterly, with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the first quarter. On a dollar basis, we expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be consistent to slightly up from the fourth quarter results. 
In summary, our team is executing well. Visibility is improving, and our pipeline across the business has been strengthening over the last several months. We feel well-positioned as we move into 2021. I am confident in the team's ability to continue to build on our momentum. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

I think this year, most of the growth will be around the digital services, which I highlighted. So I said last year, we did 8%, and we see a further acceleration in that growth rate going into this year. And on SITAD, you'll continue to see -- it's a relatively small portion of the business. But as I said, to give you some idea of the scale, those 2 global contracts that we've signed early in this year to serve financial service institutions. Those 2 combined are probably in the order of about 15% year-on-year growth. So it's pretty high levels of growth on what it traditionally was smaller parts of our business. But over time, over the next -- what you can expect is over the next year or 2, we'll start guiding more and more to those individual pieces of business. But if you think about it, what this all means is more on a consolidated basis, it gives us the confidence on guiding to say that we said that 2% to 6% growth in terms of top line range. And if you take the midpoint of 4%, it just gives us much more confidence as we go forward that we can really start driving bottom line growth, not just through margin expansion, but through top line growth because of the resiliency and the attractiveness of these new segments."

If I take the total revenue guide, which is 4% to 8%, that's a little over $250 million at the midpoint or slightly over 6%. We're expecting data center, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, to be up kind of double digits, approaching mid-teens. So that's, call it, $40 million of pure revenue growth, be it a small amount of FX on that number since you asked about that. And then turning to the global RIM business, we're projecting $200-plus million of total growth. Now that's assuming revenue management of the normal levels that we've been experiencing, 2% to 3%, maybe even a little bit closer to the high end as we continue to roll that out. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, certainly, the vast majority of those actions will be in place by the end of the quarter. We're certainly expecting COVID with COVID for planning to flat to slightly up volume. And Bill mentioned the digital solutions, which would be probably in the vicinity as much as $50 million of year-on-year benefit, and that results in a very slight service activity recovery for the balance of our services. On the adjacent businesses, we're continuing to see the business improve, but I'd say we're being a little bit conservative and prudent with respect to the COVID impact as we continue to see those underlying markets recover. I will note that we did see, for the second quarter in a row and very nice volume out of our adjacent businesses, and that's the entertainment services business continuing to see improving trends. Bill, anything you'd like to add there?"

So coming on the Webworks JV that we announced this morning, it's a great question. So we're super excited about India. I mean, personally, I've been to India, I don't know how many times over the last 3 years, specifically looking for a data center -- the right data center entry because it's been on our radar screen for quite some time. And with Webworks, we found a very good partner that already has presence in Mumbai, Pune and Delhi, which are 3 of the key regions, and they have a road map to expand that to Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai. So which we really think gives us a very good platform because Delhi is not a single location. In terms of the way why we chose Webworks is that first of all, the team, it's entrepreneurial brothers that actually built the company. And they have always had a very strong focus on telecommunications interconnects. And in fact, that's how they started their business. So we think that actually, they've built a good ecosystem around the locations that they already have. They understand the market and the business extremely well. So we're also buying into effectively a management team. And as we alluded to in our press release is that the way the JV is structured is we start in a minority, and they have about 4 megawatts that are actually running as we sit here today in those 3 locations. They have both brownfield expansion capacity as well as land for further greenfield expansion. And the $150 million that we announced will be put in over time on a cost basis as we build out that expansion. So you can think of it as a way that we paid a slight premium for our entry to get the initial 4 megawatts and the management team. And then that $150 million that goes in over the next 2 or 3 years will lead to us to have a majority ownership, and that will be on a cost basis, that money is put in. So we'll effectively slide down towards a cost that is approaching the actual cost to build the facility. So we're really excited about the market. It is the second largest telecommunications market in the world. It has probably about 10% of data center running in India has Northern Virginia. So -- and it's just a very fast-growing market. We've got a great management team that comes along as part of the deal, and we have a clear road map to expand and build a truly Indian footprint."

We, as you know, see recycling of industrial assets is highly attractive as we see the valuations as really good at these levels. And together with our development pipeline and data center, among others, it's a really good move for us to invest in faster-growing opportunities. The way I think about it is industrial assets continue to increase in terms of valuation. So the level of recycling that we've assumed in the plan this year would kind of be a mid-single-digit percent of purely the industrial asset base. So we've got a -- and that is obviously a base that continues to expand in terms of value in light of what's going on in asset prices out there. So over time, I think planning for something in this level annually is not a bad place to plan, if I were you. And I would also note that if we continue to see opportunities on both sides. On the industrial side as well as incremental opportunities in development pipeline, we would not be afraid to continue to recycle even at a little bit higher level. But for the year, we're planning $125 million. Thanks for the question."

I think it's an important topic in wage inflation just a -- even absent of the $15 minimum wage in terms of our frontline staff, especially our couriers. We've been in that I would say, a highly competitive environment for the last 4 or 5 years, at least, with a boom of e-commerce. So for us, the $15 minimum wage is less of an issue. Most, if not all, of our workers are kind of north of that. The bigger issue for us is, quite frankly, the pressure on e-commerce for similar types of jobs. That being said, we've been able to manage our churn pretty well. And the one thing I've spent it personally, a fair amount of time traveling around the country as well as in Europe and in Mexico, speaking to our frontline staff. Many of whom we had to furlough during the depths of the crisis, just to take the temperature. And their connection to the company, their loyalty, the gratitude in terms of the way our leadership teams have managed the crisis and also trying to support them and their families both mentally, health-wise and monetarily has been highly appreciated. So I think I still remain very confident that mountaineers are really -- mountaineers look after each other. But the inflation that you're referring to is less for us driven by the minimum wage, and it's more driven by just the boom in e-commerce, but it's a good point."

I think the other thing what I would say is just another proof point, then I'll say how we're compete. Is that if you look at our -- especially on the sales side, but also on the operations side of our data centers, most, if not all of these folks come from leading, what I would call, pure-play data center companies. And so you could almost say, to me, it's not -- you measure the success of your offering in 2 dimensions. One is do customers buy it, right, which is the 58.5 megawatts this year of leasing activity or new leases signed, I think, is a pretty good proof point. On the other side is, are people willing to bet their career and their livelihood by coming to join you who are specialists in the field? And I have to say that Mark Kidd, who leads that business has done a remarkable job in terms of attracting, really, I would say, top-tier focused data center talent. 
Now in terms of the synergies between the business, which goes into the secret sauce, which you alluded to, it's still 40 -- about 40% of our colo leads come from our traditional records management sales force. And you're seeing that even more and more now that we set up strategic accounts. So I don't go to a strategic account meeting where they -- a strategic account executive pull me along where we're not speaking about data center opportunities. I mean, just last week, Barry and I were with the #2 executive of a global bank, and he brought up data center even before we could. We, Barry and I, with one of our strategic account executives. So it's a -- people definitely see the connection. The decades, this is our 70th year, the decades of trust that we've had with financial service institutions, hence the reason why the likes of Goldman Sachs and Crédit Suisse have trusted us with their colocation installs. So definitely, the trust is a big factor. And the team seems to be really getting great traction in the market."

From an EBITDA standpoint, the stock comp year-to-year is very similar. I will note, like most companies, we have a performance element in our grant. So it's conceivable that depending upon where performance is, those grants could go higher or lower. So I would be planning for that to be very modestly up year-on-year. On the nonventure as it relates to how that impacts EBITDA there's 2 things there. As you know, that's our consumer joint venture, where we have a higher ownership, but the business -- and while the businesses performing better year-on-year as our plan, it still is in a loss position. So that will be a little bit more of a headwind, and then we'll add on the Frankfurt joint venture, where we own 20%, as you know, and that starts up, as we've mentioned before, the lease commences midyear and ramps over time as the client gets into the lease. So that -- I would say the unconsolidated ventures portion is fairly similar year-on-year, slight improvement. So net to EBITDA, very similar to the 2020 level of the add-back that you see in the documents. A EPS and FFO would flow similarly to EBITDA. And then from an AFFO standpoint, you'll note that there's less impact there than EBITDA since we were already adding back stock comp, so that has no change to AFFO. And the portion of growth capital is essentially at the same level. And I already mentioned the unconsolidated joint venture. So an add-back of kind of a high single-digit million dollar benefit to AFFO year-on-year, not unlike what we had again in 2020. Good question. Thanks for the question."

But some of our historically fastest-growing and largest verticals are sending them in at slower rates. So we continue to see that, what I call the second derivative drag on volume coming in slower than boxes aging out at their normal kind of 15-year life span.

So let me kind of start about how we think about the JVs or we use India as an example. So India is a country that we're pretty comfortable, and that's why specific to India, at least a couple of times a year. But I would say, 5 years ago, I started going there with a focus on finding the right data center entry. Even though we have a little less than 2,000 people working on the records management side in India. So it's a market we know is, for us, it was important to find the right -- not just physical opportunity for entry, the right footprint, but also the right team that we could build on. And with Webworks, we found that. I think from a Webworks standpoint, they also appreciate it is that we are not a financial sponsor or we're not a newbie in the Indian market. So they see how we operate in India already today. Culturally, we're attuned to the challenges that they have and are very supportive of their journey. And so that -- and this case, Deutsche Bank ran the process. But I think 1 of the reasons why we wanted was the relationship we were able to build with the entrepreneurs in the way we operate. So that, to me, is part of our secret sauce is that we are a company that is in 56 countries around the world, over 20,000 mountaineers around the world so that we can make those connections. And then also, it's not lost on these entrepreneurs in this particular case, that we were actually refusing data center demand. We had a number of customers that were asking for capacity in India, and quite frankly, we just couldn't deliver for them so that we can bring that network to bear. 
I think if you kind of think more broadly on build-to-suit, as we build on our reputation with some of the large hyperscale players, so as we announced the Frankfurt started off not as a build-to-suit, but ended up being a build-to-suit effectively because we had that interesting data center asset and it was hyperscaler that needed the whole 27 megawatts. So the design and engineering got modified to satisfy them. And that was one reason why we put it into the type of joint venture structure that we did because it turned out to be a completely stabilized asset from day 1, if you will. That has also led us to have -- we haven't done any at this point, but there's more and more that are approaching us to look at build-to-suit opportunities. And quite frankly, where we just look at the returns. If the campus supports that and it allows us to actually further expand or even upgrade the capacity of a campus by bringing in more power on the back of a build-to-suit opportunity, then we absolutely entertain it. So the last thing I would say is that we are starting to see more pipeline and whether or not we execute on that is interesting is that when I was talking about the Frankfurt situation is that the customer there admitted to me that he really does see us as 1 of this handful of suppliers that he looks to when he's needing third party capacity. So just naturally, we are starting to see those kind of opportunities. Whether or not we actually execute on them. It really is going to depend on the types of returns in the specific campus opportunity."

After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials will contain forward-looking statements, including statements about our 2021 and longer-term expectations. As you know, all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliation to these measures as required by Reg G and our supplemental financial information. 
With that, Bill, would you please begin?"

Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well.

Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well. 
As we close out a year, which has been marked by a first quarter, delivering near record growth growth to a remaining year where we had to manage headwinds from COVID. I want to take a few minutes to reflect on where we've been and where we're going. First, I want to pause and acknowledge that we continue to fight COVID-19, and we maintain making the safety of our employees, their families and our customers our first priority. Whilst we are optimistic of the positive impact the rollout of vaccines will have, we continue to believe that 2021 will look similar to 2020, albeit in reverse in terms of the macroeconomic landscape. 
However, 2020 was also a year where there was much to celebrate, which came out of the creativity and resiliency demonstrated by our teams. I couldn't be more proud of my fellow mountaineers around the world in terms of the way we responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a phrase, we managed the crisis, the crisis didn't manage us. We continue to serve our customers where throughout the depths of the crisis, more than 96% of our facilities remained open. We maintained our focus on Project Summit, where we increased our targeted sustained annual cost savings from $200 million to $375 million, and have already achieved over $200 million on an annual run rate by the end of 2020. 
We accelerated our growth in data center with 58.5 megawatts of new leases announced in 2020 versus 16.9 megawatts in 2019. We continued our investment in new products and innovation with a focus on supporting our customers' remote workforces. These services led to growth in our digital solutions year-on-year of 8%, excluding FX. And we continue to see good returns from our global strategic accounts organization and maintained our focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit to be one more in-tune with accelerating our revenue growth through new services and solutions. This continued focus on expanding our service offerings to our customer base of 225,000 customers and organizations, in spite of COVID, has allowed us to guide to organic revenue growth of 2% to 6% in 2021, the highest level of growth in the past decade. 
This significant investment in innovation and new product development is supported by our purpose to be our customers' most trusted partner for protecting and unlocking the value of what matters most to them in innovative and socially responsible ways. Our strategy is highlighted by an important balance between accelerating growth, driven by developing end-to-end solutions to help our customers unlock value from their content as well as sustaining growth in physical storage and data center. In other words, being both the lock and the key to many of our customers' physical and digital data assets. 
The strategy is underpinned by our high-performance, customer-obsessed culture and our strong customer connection with not only 225,000 customers, but over 950 of the world's largest 1,000 companies. It is not simply investment in products that has given us accelerated revenue growth but a deliberate focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit. This shift in culture is marked by a singular focus on our customers as our north star; an acceleration in our commitments around diversity and inclusion, not just because it is just, but also because it is a key to our strategic success in being a more creative and dynamic organization, which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs; and an increase in our commitments to carbon neutrality. 2020 stars continue to secure renewable energy to meet the power needs of 100% of our data centers, even with the rapid increase in bookings in new facilities operating. 
Some examples of our laser focus on how we have responded to our customers' needs in more creative ways, included processing unemployment benefits to get them into the hands of people in need during the crisis and setting up 12 digital mail rooms around the globe for customers who didn't know how they were going to stay connected with their remote workforce. In a phrase, we helped our customers when they needed it most. What that all means to me is that we came out of 2020 stronger than ever, a company with a new sense of momentum that will fuel both our top and bottom line growth. 
For the next few minutes, allow me to illustrate for you what I mean by momentum. If resilience was the word for 2020, growth is the word for 2021. We're already seeing evidence of this growth in data centers, for example, and expect this to continue. As we have discussed before, we are also seeing good growth in digital solutions as well as physical storage, both from the continued durability of our records management business, together with an expanding consumer business and believe this growth should continue. This change in revenue growth trajectory is a direct result of the investments we have made in new product areas, coupled with changes we have made in our commercial engine. One of the fundamental changes we have made in our commercial approach is that we have invested in creating more time for our salespeople to engage differently with our strategic customers. This extra time with customers has allowed us to uncover new revenue opportunities, not just for additional physical storage and new data center customers, but for digital services, which provides both greater visibility for doc data as well as driving much more value from data borne both physically and digitally. 
As a result, you can see, both from our performance last year as well as the guidance we have provided today for 2021, our company is more and more seen by our customers as a partner who, yes, protects and manages all their physical and digital assets, but also gives our customers the key to integrating their information, unlocking its value as well as accelerating their own digital transformation journey. For 70 years, we've offered protection for the assets our customers value most. We now more and more catalog, index, govern and manage complete information across physical and digital domains, securely storing what customers need, disposing of what they down and helping them unearth the insights that drive business transformation. 
Let's now explore some exciting growth opportunities ahead of us. These are areas where we see great opportunities for growth as we position ourselves to unlock greater value for our customers and include data centers, fine arts and entertainment services, consumer storage, secure IT asset disposition or SITAD, small and medium business, content service platform, or CSP, think of this as electronic content management or ECM on steroids and secure offline storage for a highly secure air gap data storage for cost-effective protection against ransom attacks. 
Let's go into a little bit more detail about a couple of these areas. In data center, we have built a strong global platform with 15 operating facilities across 3 continents since 2017. And we just announced an agreement, which once closed, will mark our entry into the very fast-growing Indian market through our investment in Web Werks. The total addressable market for our data centers globally is $20 billion, and is growing at over 10% for co-location or retail customers in over 40% for the hyperscale segment. 
If you look at fine art storage and entertainment services, it's roughly a $2 billion market for both together. Just 2 months ago, the L.A. Times wrote an article about our entertainment services business. They called us the Fort Knox of Hollywood. The article highlighted how we are driving a different level of growth in that business through not just storage, but how we facilitate more opportunities for the studios and artists in distributing their assets to viewers and listeners. 
In consumer, we've grown the business in 1 year from about 2 million cubic feet of storage to more than 7 million cubic feet of storage, so 3x as big in just 12 months. The total addressable market for consumer storage is more than $35 billion, and it is growing at about 5% to 6% per year. I'd note that our segment focus is on valet storage, where our logistics expertise gives us a strong competitive advantage as well as being a nice submarket, which represents a significant opportunity for future growth. 
Our SITAD business has an addressable market of $10 billion, and we have seen strong growth in this business over the course of 2020. More importantly, we have found that our strong heritage around data security and chain of custody is proving a differentiator as we recently took on the global responsibility for SITAD on behalf of 2 large financial institutions. So hopefully, this helps you appreciate why we are so excited about the growth opportunities as we look to 2021 and beyond. Taken together, the 7 areas I highlighted earlier represent a significant market opportunity for us. 
Let me put some context around that. If you look back to 2015, the total addressable market we competed in was $10 billion. And on average, those markets had low growth rates. Over the last 5 years, as we've listened to customers, built expertise and developed new products and solutions, the addressable market we now compete in is over $80 billion, yes, $80 billion. Additionally, those products and services that we've developed expertise in are growing at a 13% organic growth rate. So not only has the addressable market for expanded service has grown by over 8x, but these new areas have double-digit industry growth rates, which helps facilitate our entry. Let me now shift gears and briefly review our performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2020. 
At a high level, we couldn't have been more pleased with the way our mountaineers navigated the challenging environment in 2020 brought on by COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, we were laser-focused on execution and controlling those factors that we could, leading to outperformance against our own internal expectations through the last 3 quarters of 2020. This resulted in continued strength in total storage rental revenue, which grew nearly 4% on a constant currency basis and 2.4% organically. While service revenue declines continued to offset the solid storage growth, we grew adjusted EBITDA 1.3% when adjusting for currency, and our margin expanded 110 basis points in 2020. This, all in spite of total revenue being down $115 million due to service activity declines. 
I want to thank our teams across the globe who stayed focused in the face of so many obvious distractions. Our success is a reflection of our mountaineers' dedication, and most importantly, I have been inspired by the way our teams looked after both the physical and the mental health of each other as they navigated the threats from COVID, both at work and at home. 
Turning now to our physical storage business. Total global organic volume was essentially flat compared to the third quarter. Contributing to this was a 1.9 million cubic foot increase in consumer and adjacent businesses, offset by a similar decrease in records and information management volume. For the full year, total global organic volume was flat, which is a good outcome considering the environment in which we were operating. This year, we expect total global organic volume to be flat to slightly up. Looking more specifically at RIM organic volume, this was down 1.9 million cubic feet sequentially. For the full year, organic volume declined 1.1%. In our Global Digital Solutions business in 2020, we were actually able to grow service revenue 8% year-over-year, excluding FX. Despite the pandemic, our team grew revenue. This goes back to the different mindset I mentioned earlier. We see a further acceleration in our digital solutions business going into 2021 and expect to exceed $300 million in revenue for the year. 
Turning now to our Global Data Center segment. The team had a phenomenal year, blowing its leasing targets out of the water quarter after quarter. For the full year, we leased more than 58 megawatts remember, our target coming into 2020 was 15 to 20 megawatts. I want to underscore that, that success was not just the result of leasing to hyperscalers. We had very good commercial momentum in our core enterprise retail colocation business, which represented 12 megawatts of the 58 megawatts or close to 40% of our bookings, excluding Frankfurt. We attracted 73 new logos to our platform during 2020, adding to our broad and diverse base of more than 1,300 data center customers. This should enable us to strengthen our network ecosystem and increase the stickiness of our deployments. 
We also had a busy year in terms of development with more than 10 megawatts commissioned across multiple data centers and geographies increasing our leasable megawatts to 130. Our team is actively adding to our development pipeline to ensure we have the right capacity in the right markets to meet robust customer demand, and we are excited for the opportunities we see ahead of us in 2021, where we expect to end the year with over 170 leasable megawatts. One of those opportunities is further expanding our data center footprint into new fast-growing markets. As I mentioned earlier, this morning, we announced entering into an agreement for a strategic JV with Web Werks, which once closed, would expand our reach to India, including Mumbai, Pune and Delhi. The data center market in India is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years, and India is the second largest telecommunications market in the world. We are excited to be an early mover into an emerging market where the demand is high and the supply is low. 
Turning to Project Summit. We generated adjusted EBITDA benefits of $165 million in 2020, consistent with our most recent expectations and significantly ahead of our initial estimates of $80 million, reflecting strong execution in swift and decisive actions activity -- actions on early initiatives. This gives us an exit rate of annual savings of over $200 million heading into 2021. As you will hear from Barry in more detail, we are fully on track to recognize the estimated $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefiting this year, and we are expecting  -- and we are excited for the tangible benefits we will experience this year as we continue to enhance our technology and processes. 
Before I wrap up, I'd like to provide a little more detail about our continued commitment to cut our carbon emissions I referenced earlier. We were one of the first 100 or so corporations worldwide to have an ambitious carbon reduction goal approved by the science-based targets initiative as being aligned with the Paris Climate Accord. Already in 2019, we reported that our goal to cut 25% was more than doubled by delivering a 52% reduction 6 years sooner than our 2025 commitment. As we did this whilst growing our global data center business, one of the most energy-intensive industries in the world. We continue to flex our innovation muscle around energy consumption as well as having introduced the Green Power Pass to our customers. This is the first solution of its kind and allows us to pass the benefits of 100% renewable energy data center platform to our customers for them to use to meet their sustainability targets. We are confident based upon the momentum we are building in this area that we can achieve 100% carbon neutrality well before 2050 in spite of our rapidly growing data center business. 
To summarize, I've never been more optimistic about our opportunities for growth at any other time in our history, even with the anticipated continued headwinds due to COVID impacting our traditional service areas. And I've never been more proud of how we've behaved as an organization over the course of 2020 and through the pandemic. We went above and beyond for our customers and our teams and embrace new collaboration tools and change how we work. Our mountaineers truly lived our values day in and day out. I'm excited to be on this journey with you all, and I can't wait to see the future together. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics.

In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics. For the full year, revenue of $4.1 billion declined 2.7% on a reported basis, which includes a 100 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined 3.3%. Organic service revenue declined 12.8%, reflecting the continued COVID impact on our activity levels. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.4%, driven by more than 2 points of revenue management. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.3% year-on-year to $1.48 billion. Reflecting the team's strong progress with Project Summit and revenue management, EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points to 35.6%, representing the best margin performance in the company's history. Importantly, we see opportunity for profitability to continue to expand over time. AFFO increased 2.4% to $888 million or $3.07 on a per share basis. 
Before I go into more detail, let me draw your attention to Slide 13 of our earnings presentation. We have made some refinements to our non-GAAP measures, spurred by feedback from the investment community that some of our non-GAAP measures are difficult to compare to peers. This includes changes to how we account for unconsolidated ventures, stock-based compensation and a portion of growth capital. To ensure comparability and transparency, we have provided our results on both the former and new methodology. Of course, the prior method will be comparable to current consensus estimates. For example, under our former methodology, full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $1.45 billion, which compares to the current consensus of $1.446 billion. More detail is available in our earnings slides and on our Investor Relations website. 
Now turning to our results for the quarter, which are based on our updated non-GAAP definitions. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion declined 1.8%, which includes a 40 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined 3.4%. Organic service revenue declined 12.1%. Overall, we continue to see service declines moderate with the fourth quarter reflecting a modest improvement in service trends. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7%, driven by revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA was $374 million under both our new and former definition. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as revenue trends, both in storage and service, were better than planned. Fourth quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix, offset by COVID-driven impacts to the business. AFFO was $191 million or $0.66 on a per share basis, in line with our prior projections. AFFO reflects an increase in recurring CapEx that have been deferred earlier in the year in higher cash taxes. 
Turning to segment performance. In the fourth quarter, our global RIM business had strong storage revenue growth, driven by volume growth in our faster-growing markets and revenue management. This was offset by declines in service revenue, albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year, leading to total organic revenue decline of 3.6%. In our shred business, the combination of lower tonnage and an 8% decline in paper price versus last year resulted in a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. While there's been a slight step-up in the index prices in January, recycled paper prices have remained low. At recent levels, we anticipate paper prices will result in EBITDA headwind of slightly over $10 million in 2021. We are pleased with the continued momentum in our consumer storage business as it becomes a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points, driven by revenue management and Project Summit. 
In the fourth quarter, we continue to see fixed cost deleverage as we ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level to fully support our customers. We also had a step-up in facility expense as we invested in maintenance that we had delayed over the prior 2 quarters. Taking a look at headline numbers for our Global Data Center business, full year bookings came in at 58.5 megawatts. Excluding the full building lease in Frankfurt, we leased 31.5 megawatts, representing bookings growth of 26%. Total revenue grew 9% year-over-year. 
We are pleased with our data center performance for the year and expect to continue to see an improving trajectory, thanks to the strong commercial success. In 2021, we expect to lease 25 to 30 megawatts, which, at the midpoint, would result in more than 20% annual bookings growth. We feel good about the state of our pipeline, both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail colocation. We project full year revenue growth in the range of low double digits to approaching mid-teens. With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility to revenue. For the first quarter, we expect growth rates similar to the fourth quarter as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commence in the second quarter and beyond. 
Turning to Project Summit. As a reminder, we expect total program benefits of $375 million, of which we delivered $165 million in 2020. We expect an additional $150 million benefit in 2021 with the balance in 2022. This quarter, the team delivered $52 million of adjusted EBITDA benefit. As to capital expenditures, in the fourth quarter, we invested $163 million, bringing the full year to $446 million, in line with our prior expectations. In 2021, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million, consisting of approximately $410 million of growth CapEx, of which we plan to allocate approximately $300 million to data center development. We expect $140 million of recurring CapEx. 
Turning to capital recycling. In the fourth quarter, our program generated approximately $451 million of proceeds, which includes the Frankfurt data center joint venture we mentioned last quarter. For the full year, our capital recycling program generated approximately $475 million. I would like to call out the sale-leaseback transaction we announced in December, in which we sold a portfolio of 13 industrial facilities, generating gross proceeds of $358 million. This portfolio was sold at a cap rate slightly below 4.5%. This was a compelling opportunity for us to monetize a small portion of our owned industrial assets while effectively maintaining long-term control of the facilities through an initial 10-year lease with multiple renewal options, among other favorable terms. 
On a leverage-neutral basis, this transaction freed up approximately $260 million of investable capital that we intend to redeploy into faster-growing areas, including our data center business. We plan to make these investments in 2021, so our year-end net debt balance reflects these proceeds. With a highly favorable market backdrop in our strong data center development pipeline, we are planning to continue to recycle industrial assets. In 2021, we are planning for $125 million of recycling. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At year-end, we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity. We ended the year with net lease-adjusted leverage of 5.3x, down from 5.7x at year-end 2019. The pro forma, excluding the investable proceeds from our leaseback, leverage would have been slightly under 5.5x. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5x. For 2021, we expect to end the year within our target range near the high end. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April. As we have said before, we are fully committed to our dividend at this sustainable level. Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid-60s as a percentage of AFFO. 
Now to give you more details as to our outlook for 2021, we are pleased to reinstitute financial guidance reflecting the strength of our business, our team's strong execution and improved visibility. For the full year 2021, we currently expect revenue of $4.325 billion to $4.475 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.575 billion to $1.625 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents revenue growth of 6% and EBITDA growth of 8%. At the midpoint, our guidance implies about 75 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement year-on-year. We expect AFFO to be in the range of $945 million to $995 million or $3.25 to $3.42 per share. At the midpoint, this represents 9% growth for both metrics. Our guidance assumes global physical volume will be flat to slightly positive, revenue management will be a significant benefit in 2021. 
And I will note the majority of those actions have already been taken as we speak to you today, and nearly all of them will be in place by the end of the quarter as we are seeing in digital solutions, combined with a slight recovery in our service activity across the year. In terms of EBITDA, our expectations include the benefit from revenue management and top line growth as well as Project Summit savings. Partially offsetting those benefits is a prudent outlook for inflation, a step-up in cost from prior COVID-driven discretion, rent from our sale-leaseback transactions and innovation spend. While we do not typically guide quarterly, with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the first quarter. On a dollar basis, we expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be consistent to slightly up from the fourth quarter results. 
In summary, our team is executing well, visibility is improving, and our pipeline across the business has been strengthening over the last several months. We feel well-positioned as we move into 2021. I am confident in the team's ability to continue to build on our momentum. 
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

I think this year, most of the growth will be around the digital services, which I highlighted. So I said last year, we did 8%, and we see a further acceleration in that growth rate going into this year. And on SITAD, you'll continue to see -- it's a relatively small portion of the business. But as I said, to give you some idea of the scale, those 2 global contracts that we've signed early in this year to serve financial service institutions. Those 2 combined are probably in the order of about 15% year-on-year growth. So it's pretty high levels of growth on what it traditionally was smaller parts of our business. 
But over time, over the next -- what you can expect is over the next year or 2, we'll start guiding more and more to those individual pieces of business. But if you think about it, what this all means is more on a consolidated basis, it gives us the confidence on guiding to say that we said that 2% to 6% growth in terms of top line range. And if you take the midpoint of 4%, it just gives us much more confidence as we go forward that we can really start driving bottom line growth, not just through margin expansion, but through top line growth because of the resiliency and the attractiveness of these new segments."

If I take the total revenue guide, which is 4% to 8%, that's a little over $250 million at the midpoint or slightly over 6%. We're expecting data center, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, to be up kind of double digits, approaching mid-teens. So that's, call it, $40 million of pure revenue growth, be it a small amount of FX on that number since you asked about that. And then turning to the global RIM business, we're projecting $200-plus million of total growth. Now that's assuming revenue management of the normal levels that we've been experiencing, 2% to 3%, maybe even a little bit closer to the high end as we continue to roll that out. 
And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, certainly, the vast majority of those actions will be in place by the end of the quarter. We're certainly expecting COVID -- with COVID, we're planning to flat to slightly up volume. And Bill mentioned the digital solutions, which would be probably in the vicinity as much as $50 million of year-on-year benefit, and that results in a very slight service activity recovery for the balance of our services. On the adjacent businesses, we're continuing to see the business improve, but I'd say we're being a little bit conservative and prudent with respect to the COVID impact as we continue to see those underlying markets recover. I will note that we did see, for the second quarter in a row and very nice volume out of our adjacent businesses, and that's the entertainment services business continuing to see improving trends. Bill, anything you'd like to add there?"

So coming on the Web Werks JV that we announced this morning, it's a great question. So we're super excited about India. I mean, personally, I've been to India, I don't know how many times over the last 3 years, specifically looking for a data center -- the right data center entry because it's been on our radar screen for quite some time. And with Web Werks, we found a very good partner that already has presence in Mumbai, Pune and Delhi, which are 3 of the key regions, and they have a roadmap to expand that to Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai. So -- which we really think gives us a very good platform because Delhi is not a single location. 
In terms of the way -- why we chose Web Werks is that first of all, the team, it's entrepreneurial brothers that actually built the company. And they have always had a very strong focus on telecommunications interconnects. And in fact, that's how they started their business. So we think that actually, they've built a good ecosystem around the locations that they already have. They understand the market and the business extremely well. So we're also buying into effectively a management team. And as we alluded to in our press release is that the way the JV is structured is we start in a minority, and they have about 4 megawatts that are actually running as we sit here today in those 3 locations. They have both brownfield expansion capacity as well as land for further greenfield expansion. And the $150 million that we announced will be put in over time on a cost basis as we build out that expansion. 
So you can think of it as a way that we paid a slight premium for our entry to get the initial 4 megawatts and the management team. And then that $150 million that goes in over the next 2 or 3 years will lead to us to have a majority ownership, and that will be on a cost basis, that money is put in. So we'll effectively slide down towards a cost that is approaching the actual cost to build the facility. So we're really excited about the market. It is the second largest telecommunications market in the world. It has probably about 10% of data center running in India has Northern Virginia. So -- and it's just a very fast-growing market. We've got a great management team that comes along as part of the deal, and we have a clear road map to expand and build a truly Indian footprint."

We, as you know, see recycling of industrial assets is highly attractive as we see the valuations as really good at these levels. And together with our development pipeline and data center, among others, it's a really good move for us to invest in faster-growing opportunities. The way I think about it is industrial assets continue to increase in terms of valuation. So the level of recycling that we've assumed in the plan this year would kind of be a mid-single-digit percent of purely the industrial asset base. So we've got a -- and that is obviously a base that continues to expand in terms of value in light of what's going on in asset prices out there. 
So over time, I think planning for something in this level annually is not a bad place to plan, if I were you. And I would also note that if we continue to see opportunities on both sides. On the industrial side as well as incremental opportunities in development pipeline, we would not be afraid to continue to recycle even at a little bit higher level. But for the year, we're planning $125 million. Thanks for the question."

I think it's an important topic in wage inflation just a -- even absent of the $15 minimum wage in terms of our frontline staff, especially our couriers. We've been in that I would say, a highly competitive environment for the last 4 or 5 years, at least, with a boom of e-commerce. So for us, the $15 minimum wage is less of an issue. Most, if not all, of our workers are kind of north of that. The bigger issue for us is, quite frankly, the pressure on e-commerce for similar types of jobs. That being said, we've been able to manage our churn pretty well. 
And the one thing I've spent it personally, a fair amount of time traveling around the country as well as in Europe and in Mexico, speaking to our frontline staff. Many of whom we had to furlough during the depths of the crisis, just to take the temperature. And their connection to the company, their loyalty, the gratitude in terms of the way our leadership teams have managed the crisis and also trying to support them and their families both mentally, health-wise and monetarily has been highly appreciated. So I think, I still remain very confident that mountaineers are really -- mountaineers, we look after each other. But the inflation that you're referring to is less for us driven by the minimum wage and it's more driven by just the boom in e-commerce, but it's a good point."

I think the other thing what I would say is just another proof point, then I'll say how we're compete. Is that if you look at our -- especially on the sales side, but also on the operations side of our data centers, most, if not all of these folks come from leading, what I would call, pure-play data center companies. And so you could almost say, to me, it's not -- you measure the success of your offering in 2 dimensions. One is do customers buy it, right, which is the 58.5 megawatts this year of leasing activity or new leases signed, I think, is a pretty good proof point. On the other side is, are really -- are people willing to bet their career and their livelihood by coming to join you who are specialists in the field? And I have to say that Mark Kidd, who leads that business, has done a remarkable job in terms of attracting, really, I would say, top-tier focused data center talent. 
Now in terms of the synergies between the business, which goes into the secret sauce, which you alluded to, it's still 40 -- about 40% of our colo leads come from our traditional records management sales force. And you're seeing that even more and more now that we set up strategic accounts. So I don't go to a strategic account meeting where they -- a strategic account executive pull me along where we're not speaking about data center opportunities. I mean, just last week, Barry and I were with the #2 executive of a global bank, and he brought up data center even before we could, we -- Barry and I, with one of our strategic account executives. So it's a -- people definitely see the connection. The decades -- this is our 70th year, the decades of trust that we've had with financial service institutions, hence the reason why the likes of Goldman Sachs and Crédit Suisse have trusted us with their colocation installs. So definitely, the trust is a big factor. And the team seems to be really getting great traction in the market."

From an EBITDA standpoint, the stock comp year-to-year is very similar. I will note, like most companies, we have a performance element in our grant. So it's conceivable that depending upon where performance is, those grants could go higher or lower. So I would be planning for that to be very modestly up year-on-year. On the non-venture as it relates to how that impacts EBITDA there's 2 things there. As you know, that's our consumer joint venture, where we have a higher ownership, but the business -- and while the businesses performing better year-on-year as our plan, it still is in a loss position. So that will be a little bit more of a headwind, and then we'll add on the Frankfurt joint venture, where we own 20%, as you know, and that starts up, as we've mentioned before, the lease commences midyear and ramps over time as the client gets into the lease. 
So that -- I would say, the unconsolidated ventures portion is fairly similar year-on-year, slight improvement. So net to EBITDA, very similar to the 2020 level of the add-back that you see in the documents. A EPS and FFO would flow similarly to EBITDA. And then from an AFFO standpoint, you'll note that there's less impact there than EBITDA since we were already adding back stock comp, so that has no change to AFFO. And the portion of growth capital is essentially at the same level. And I already mentioned the unconsolidated joint venture. So an add-back of kind of a high single-digit million dollar benefit to AFFO year-on-year, not unlike what we had again in 2020. Good question. Thanks for the question."

We haven't seen a -- we have -- and you can almost -- you can see that in our supplemental. We haven't seen an acceleration in that headwind that we're getting. But we're still, for sure, going through what I think I described on a few calls previously, maybe it was a year ago what I call the second derivative action. In other words, virtually all our customers are continuing to send us new boxes. But some of our historically fastest growing and largest verticals are sending them in at slower rates. So we continue to see that, what I call the second derivative drag on volume coming in slower than boxes aging out at their normal kind of 15-year life span. So we expect to continue to have what I would call the same pre-COVID headwinds on the traditional document side of the business more than offset by the growth in consumer."

So let me kind of start about how we think about the JVs or we use India as an example. So India is a country that we're pretty comfortable, and that's why specific to India, at least a couple of times a year. But I would say, 5 years ago, I started going there with a focus on finding the right data center entry. Even though we have a little less than 2,000 people working on the records management side in India. So it's a market we know is, for us, it was important to find the right -- not just physical opportunity for entry, the right footprint, but also the right team that we could build on. 
And with Web Werks, we found that. I think from a Web Werks standpoint, they also appreciate it is that we are not a financial sponsor or we're not a newbie in the Indian market. So they see how we operate in India already today. Culturally, we're attuned to the challenges that they have and are very supportive of their journey. And so that -- and this case, Deutsche Bank ran the process. But I think 1 of the reasons why we wanted was the relationship we were able to build with the entrepreneurs in the way we operate. 
So that, to me, is part of our secret sauce is that we are a company that is in 56 countries around the world, over 20,000 mountaineers around the world so that we can make those connections. And then also, it's not lost on these entrepreneurs in this particular case, that we were actually refusing data center demand. We had a number of customers that were asking for capacity in India, and quite frankly, we just couldn't deliver for them so that we can bring that network to bear. 
I think if you kind of think more broadly on build-to-suit, as we build on our reputation with some of the large hyperscale players, so as we announced the -- Frankfurt started off not as a build-to-suit, but ended up being a build-to-suit effectively because we had that interesting data center asset and it was hyperscaler that needed the whole 27 megawatts. So the design and engineering got modified to satisfy them. And that was one reason why we put it into the type of joint venture structure that we did because it turned out to be a completely stabilized asset from day 1, if you will. That has also led us to have -- we haven't done any at this point, but there's more and more that are approaching us to look at build-to-suit opportunities. 
And quite frankly, where we just look at the returns. If the campus supports that and it allows us to actually further expand or even upgrade the capacity of a campus by bringing in more power on the back of a build-to-suit opportunity, then we absolutely entertain it. So the last thing I would say is that we are starting to see more pipeline and whether or not we execute on that is interesting is that when I was talking about the Frankfurt situation is that the customer there admitted to me that he really does see us as one of this handful of suppliers that he looks to when he's needing third-party capacity. So just naturally, we are starting to see those kind of opportunities. Whether or not we actually execute on them. It really is going to depend on the types of returns in the specific campus opportunity."

Some of the key accomplishments of the quarter include: we achieved a record level of quarterly revenue; pricing continues to yield strong results as highlighted by our organic storage rental revenue growth of 1.7% year-on-year; total organic volume grew some 2 million cubic feet versus last quarter, and we continue to forecast overall volume growth to be flat to slightly positive for the year; we saw a strong performance from our growth areas, for example, digital solutions has shown year-over-year organic growth of 11%, while secure IT asset disposition, or SITAD, has shown 30% growth; we are in line with delivering over $50 million of revenue growth from these 2 dynamic areas this year; our global data center team leased 9 megawatts in Q1 versus our guidance of between 25 and 30 megawatts for the full year; we continue to grow our footprint, acquiring a new land parcel adjacent to our campus in Northern Virginia, which will increase our total potential capacity in that key market to 145 megawatts and bringing our total potential data center capacity globally to 445 megawatts; finally, adjusted EBITDA grew 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and our margin expanded 100 basis points. 
It should be noted that Q1 this year is even more impressive given that we are comparing it to a year ago where COVID, for the most part, was affecting very few of our customers. Whilst the impact from COVID during this quarter continues with many of the 56 countries we operate in to be in various stages of lockdown, we are proud of the consistency and stability of our core business and we continue to deliver on our strategic plan. This reflects the diversity and scale of our portfolio, the depth and breadth of our service offerings and the efficiencies that have been created through Project Summit. 
To further underline the point, our sales productivity remains strong and our mountaineers persevere resulting in Q1 overall revenue it ahead of last year, whilst our traditional service revenue, which is most closely tied with being in the office, was off 7%. We continue to expect to see very modest improvements in core service revenue as we progress through the year, and we are not factoring in a full COVID recovery for the traditional side of the business before Q4 and perhaps for some parts of the world, even Q1 next year. 
In the meantime, we can see in our results and our improved guidance, our growth from new product areas will continue to deliver overall growth in our business in spite of the COVID impacts elsewhere. We remain committed to taking purposeful and bold steps to transform our entire organization, both operationally and culturally. We remained true to our plans to accelerate growth and continue our digital transformation journey, which for us includes both an internal focus as well as expanded product offerings for our customers. 
We are confident that our continued delivery of overall revenue growth, together with the expansion of margins due to Project Summit, will enable us to continue our acceleration in cash generation, which will allow us to continue to invest in our future, whilst returning more and more cash to our investors. 
Project Summit is well on track to deliver $375 million of annual run rate adjusted EBITDA benefits exiting this year, even after investing in new growth areas. In addition to adding $375 million to our EBITDA through margin improvement, Project Summit will continue to enable us to invest in the growth areas we identified and discussed last quarter, further accelerating our growth in revenue as well as profits. Some of these areas, you will recall, include digital solutions, consumer storage, data center and SITAD. Examples to illustrate the impact of our focus on revenue growth can be seen from recent wins in digital services and SITAD. One recent win in digital services was with a global insurance company, which was managing its exposure from a large and complicated liability claim. This customer desired and state was to streamline underwriting and claims management processes by providing digital accessibility to records to quickly identify risk exposure, reduce processing times, improve SLAs, ensure chain of custody and gain scalability for large discovery audits. 
Our unique solution was to integrate 440,000 of their physical boxes with their digital information to provide a single view to search across and identify relevant and required information on demand. By leveraging our InSight platform, we were able to immediately improve their legal discovery efforts and automate their claims processes. 
Another recent win was with the Government of Canada to leverage our Image on Demand, or IoD, solution to process applications for immigration, refugee or citizenship status. The government experienced a backlog during COVID as staff could not access offices and applications kept piling up. This digital solution enabled the government staff to work through the backlog. We are currently imaging more than 4,000 applications on a weekly basis, which are then digitally delivered for processing by the Government of Canada's employees. 
Switching to SITAD. This quarter, we have secured contracts with 4 large global clients to provide services across the globe. These engagements cover everything from enterprise infrastructure such as servers, routers, switches, printers, copiers to small personal devices and specialized equipment such as card readers. Our solutions in SITAD are the only ones in the market built around a secure chain of custody where assets attract at every stage of their journey and our customers' data is kept secure. 
Also, our disposition process is built with sustainability in mind. We are a leader in thinking and acting for the environment. Demand for these services is particularly strong as companies look to consolidate and transform their physical footprint to move to new hybrid collaboration models post-COVID, and we expect to partner with many more of our enterprise and global clients throughout 2021 and beyond. 
Now let me switch gears and spend some time discussing our ESG commitments, including the sustainability of our products, services and operations as well as our efforts focused on diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Our eighth annual corporate social responsibility report will be published later today. In that report, we share sustainability goals as part of our ESG commitments to reduce our environmental impact. Whilst we have been extremely successful in achieving targets that were previously set, including exceeding our science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 6 years ahead of schedule. We have -- we are introducing even stronger commitments to our planet, our customers, our employees and our communities. 
Some highlights include: we are committed to achieving carbon net 0 by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Climate accord. We are proud to be ranked #81 on Newsweek's list of America's most responsible companies in 2021. By 2025, we are committed to building all of our newly constructed multi-tenant data centers to be certified to the BREEAM green building standard. In addition to contracting for renewable energy equivalent to 100% of our data center electricity load worldwide and passing through the carbon reduction benefits to our customers who availed themselves of our Green Power Pass, we have announced our first electricity supply contract that matches our load 24/7 with local renewable generation for our facilities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Additionally, we shared with you our REIT commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, not just because it is just, but also because it is key to our strategic success in being a more creative and dynamic organization, which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs. 
For example, by 2025, we have committed to increasing representation of women in our global leadership team to 40% from 31% today, and people who identify as BIPOC in our U.S. leadership team to 30% from 19%. Thanks to the true commitment of my fellow mountaineers across the globe and with the guidance and engagement of our employee resource groups, we have made significant process on our journey, but have a lot more to do. 
To further us on our journey, I'm pleased to announce that we have recently recruited Charlene Jackson as our Global Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer. Charlene brings a strong set of experience and skills as we continue building our global enterprise into an organization which is both diverse and inclusive. 
Finally, before handing the call over to Barry, I would like to provide a bit more information on the data center performance. As I mentioned earlier, our global data center team is off to a strong start, leasing more than 9 megawatts in the first quarter. As you likely saw, this included 6 megawatts with an existing U.S.-based Fortune 100 technology company. We also signed a 1-megawatt lease in Singapore with a leading e-commerce and gaming company. The remainder of the leasing for the quarter was colocation, and we continue to build our pipeline for both hyperscale and retail deployment. 
Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we closed on our joint venture with Web Werks and have already seen great growth prospects from that partnership. Web Werks recently announced that they have acquired a land parcel to build a stand-alone purpose-built greenfield data center in Mumbai. This new data center will be designed to support 12.5 megawatts of IT capacity with a rich interconnected ecosystem consisting of major telcos, over 150 Internet service providers and 3 major Internet exchanges. The new facility, expected to be operational by mid-2022, abuts Web Werks existing data center in Mumbai, which would result in a campus with 15 megawatts of total capacity. 
We also continue to grow our platform organically with the recent purchase of a land parcel adjacent to our existing Northern Virginia campus. This parcel is expected to support 32 megawatts of IT capacity at full build-out. In addition, we redesigned our Manassas campus master plan and can now support 30 megawatts of IT load at VA2 compared to 24 megawatts previously, as well as an additional 35 megawatts of capacity at the campus. With these design and scope changes, our NoVa campus capacity has increased more than 90% to 145 megawatts, with 16 megawatts built and 72% of that leased. 
Our total data center potential capacity globally now is 445 megawatts on or an increase of more than 18%, giving us a long runway for future development and growth. 
In closing, let me say thank you to our mountaineers and their families for their continued support and dedication in what has been a difficult and heart-wrenching year for many. We and our customers count on our essential workers every day, and I personally always come back inspired after meeting with many of our teams around the globe. 
Our results demonstrate accelerating earnings growth, the resiliency of our business revenue growth in new areas and the benefits of our culture. Our culture supports customer first with an innovative mindset. With that inner DNA, we will continue to climb higher together with our customers. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."
30292,711405850,2272762,"Iron Mountain Incorporated, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Iron Mountain Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, our team delivered solid performance that exceeded expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Building on the improved performance we delivered in the second half of 2020, reven",1289,"Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, our team delivered solid performance that exceeded expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Building on the improved performance we delivered in the second half of 2020, revenue trends continued to strengthen in the first quarter. 
Our core physical storage business is demonstrating its resilience and momentum is building in our growth areas. We are confident in our projections and are pleased to raise our full year financial guidance. 
Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion grew 1.2%. Total organic revenue declined 60 basis points. Organic service revenue declined 4.8%, a marked improvement from prior quarters, representing our best performance since the first quarter of 2020. 
While our service activity is still experiencing an impact from COVID, March was the first month since February 2020 with positive organic service revenue growth. Our team continues to drive improving trends with growth in our global digital solutions business and revenue management notable callouts. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7% with continued benefit from pricing combined with a slight increase in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $381 million. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team delivered stronger margin flow-through together with the revenue beat. 
First quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation and revenue management, offset by COVID-driven impacts to the business. AFFO was $235 million or $0.81 on a per share basis. As we mentioned on our prior earnings call, AFFO reflects an increase in recurring CapEx as we catch up on some projects that were deferred during the pandemic. Our full year recurring CapEx guidance is unchanged. 
Turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our global RIM business delivered revenue of $967 million, an increase of $11 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue declined 80 basis points. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 1.7% or 1.6% on an organic basis. Growth was driven by pricing and volume. 
While our traditional services have been impacted by the pandemic, trends continued to improve during the first quarter. We are focused on expanding our global digital solutions business. And in the first quarter, we experienced strong growth, building on the commercial successes we delivered in 2020. We are pleased with the continued performance in our consumer storage business. Even with normal seasonality, the business contributed nicely to our overall physical volume. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $409 million, an increase of $17 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 120 basis points, driven by pricing and Project Summit. 
Taking a look at headline numbers for our global data center business, we had another strong quarter of bookings with 9 megawatts. We are well on track to deliver our full year target of 25 to 30 megawatts. Total revenue grew 6% year-over-year, in line with our projections. As I mentioned on our prior call, we expect revenue growth in the data center business will be more back half weighted as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commenced in the second quarter and beyond. We continue to project full year revenue growth in the range of low double digits to approaching mid-teens. With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility. 
In the second quarter, we anticipate an increase in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA compared to the first quarter. In terms of margin, we expect the second quarter to be down 2 to 3 points sequentially as a result of COVID-driven construction delays and onetime build-out services for a specific customer. We expect margins to remain at that level in the third quarter before recovering in the fourth quarter. 
In late April, we formed a joint venture with Web Werks, a leading colocation data center provider in India. We made an initial investment of approximately $50 million in exchange for a noncontrolling interest. As we have previously disclosed, we expect to invest an additional $100 million over the next 2 years, which we expect will result in a majority ownership position. 
Turning to Project Summit. This quarter, the team delivered $50 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. As a reminder, we expect Summit to contribute $150 million of year-on-year benefit in 2021 with another $60 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $113 million with an investment of $85 million of growth CapEx, along with $29 million of recurring CapEx. 
Turning to capital recycling. In the first quarter, our program generated approximately $12 million of proceeds. With the highly favorable market backdrop and our strong data center development pipeline, we remain committed to recycling approximately $125 million of industrial assets for the full year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of just under 5.5x, slightly better than our projection and down from last year. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5x. 
For 2021, we continue to expect to end the year within our target range near the high end, which will be modestly down from year-end 2020 on a pro forma basis. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early July. As we have said before, we are fully committed to our dividend at this sustainable level. Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid-60s as a percentage of AFFO. 
Turning to our outlook. Today, we are pleased to increase our 2021 financial guidance. There are 2 factors driving the improved projections. Our outlook for the business continues to improve with first quarter performance better than expected and increased confidence in our key growth drivers and the underlying business trends. Second, we've also factored in the benefit from 2 small recently closed acquisitions as well as the Web Werks investment. And I would note that we have been able to increase our guidance despite the ongoing impact of COVID on our traditional services business and construction delays in Frankfurt. 
For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue of $4.365 billion to $4.515 billion. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.585 billion to $1.635 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents growth of -- revenue growth of 7% and EBITDA growth of 9%. We now expect AFFO to be in the range of $955 million to $1.005 billion and AFFO per share of $3.28 to $3.45. At the midpoint, this represents 10% growth for both metrics. 
Our guidance assumes global organic physical volume will be flat to slightly positive versus last year. Our revenue management program will provide a significant benefit in 2021, and I will note that nearly all of the actions driving that benefit were in place by the end of the first quarter. 
For services, we are prudently assuming some measure of continued COVID impact, albeit the first quarter was another good proof point for the momentum building in our digital solutions business. While we do not typically guide quarterly with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the second quarter. 
We expect revenue to approach $1.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA to approach $400 million. We are confident in our outlook and the strength of our pipeline. We expect to grow revenue sequentially throughout the year. 
In summary, the year is off to a good start. I am confident in the team's ability to continue to build on our momentum, we feel well positioned. 
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

So taking back, as you referred to the last meeting, over the last 5 years, we've been developing a number of new products and market approaches that really have taken us from a total addressable market, where our products",312,"George, thanks for the question. So taking back, as you referred to the last meeting, over the last 5 years, we've been developing a number of new products and market approaches that really have taken us from a total addressable market, where our products and services range up from $10 billion to over $80 billion. So the things that we've been doubling down are consistent with that road map and picture that we highlighted last year. And that $80 billion, I should highlight, is also growing kind of low teens in terms of our organic growth rate. 
So if you think about -- I highlighted SITAD, for instance, and digital services today. I mean, I wouldn't say that we've just been doubling down on them in the last quarter, this has been a continuous build with, I would say, acceleration as part of Project Summit. And part of Project Summit, you're seeing the $375 million net EBITDA improvement that we're delivering and committing to, this is net of the investments that takes us -- that's required to actually invest in our digital services, SITAD, our continued investment in data center, further acceleration in consumer, for instance. 
So the investment is already in there. The $375 million is a net number that's coming out. And I think you can expect, as we said today, is that we just look at SITAD and digital services, this year alone, that will add roughly $50 million of revenue on a year-over-year basis. So we feel pretty good. 
Obviously, we just highlighted those 2 today, but across the board, and you can see it also in data center with 9 megawatts leased in this quarter, so we feel pretty good about now aiming towards an $80 billion market in terms of revenue growth, and that was part of Barry upsizing the revenue guidance for the full year."

I'm just wondering if you could parse out the guidance increase? What's coming from really operational outperformance versus perhaps some slightly more favorable foreign exchange rates that you experienced in the quarter versus last year? 
And then another question on the data center side. Just wondering, as you look at future growth areas, are there potentially any new markets either domestically or internationally that could make sense for Iron Mountain to enter either via M&A or through a new greenfield development? Or do you think you -- you're just going to continue to develop in the markets that you have today?"

Maybe I'll take the first one, and I'll let Bill take the second one. I appreciate the question. As compared to our prior guidance, the increase of $40 million of revenue and $10 million of EBITDA is really driven by 2 factors, as I mentioned on the call: first, it's our outlook on the business, which just continues to improve; the first quarter performance, I think, is a testament of that; the team did a very well -- executed very well in the first quarter, and we're continuing to increase our confidence in our growth drivers and the underlying business trends. That's about $20 million of revenue in the guide up and probably 7, round number $7 million of the EBITDA. 
The second point is we factored in the benefit from 2 recently closed acquisitions as well as the Web Werks investment. That's about, combined, $20 million of revenue in the year. Note that we acquired those in the second quarter. And then about, call it, $3 million of EBITDA. I'll remind people that the Web Werks acquisition is not consolidated, so there's no revenue that comes along with that in our financials. 
I would also just note that there's no change in our assumption as it relates to foreign exchange rates. So the rates that we're using and the impact of that on our growth that we had in our prior guidance is unchanged in the current guidance. So it's the underlying business performance, together with a couple of small deals."
30292,711405850,2272762,"Iron Mountain Incorporated, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Iron Mountain Incorporated","Executives","Yes. And the only thing I would add, Eric, in terms of other areas of growth for data sets. So I appreciate the question is, let me kind of parse it out into theaters or parts of the world. So if we look at domestic, as you know, that we have a land bank",513,"Yes. And the only thing I would add, Eric, in terms of other areas of growth for data sets. So I appreciate the question is, let me kind of parse it out into theaters or parts of the world. So if we look at domestic, as you know, that we have a land bank in Chicago, we continue to like the Chicago market. So it's just a matter of where our priorities are on capital allocation. So I think you can expect, at some point, Chicago will be on the map. Also we continue to like the potential opportunities to repurpose some of our electricity meters, if you will, in California, where we can actually buy wholesale power, which gives us an advantage in terms of power costs by taking a records management facility and repurposing that into a data center. So California continues to be an area that we remain focused on as potential market for further development. 
On Europe, as we highlighted a few calls ago that we started building Frankfurt and then sold the thing out 100% over 27 megawatts, so Frankfurt is a market that we continue to look at further expansion to because it's a key market serving Continental Europe. London, too, as we noted, is in full development, but that's also looking to be pretty buoyant, so we'll continue to look at if we need more capacity in London. 
And then the last aspect, I would say, in London is we have had a few of our customers approach us on looking at edge deployments and where we were considering actually repurposing some of our industrial real estate footprint into data centers. So if you think about -- we have a land bank for our data center business, which takes us up to 445 megawatts. But that's not including the 80 million square feet of industrial warehouses that we have around the world. A number of those are suitable to be repurposed into data centers. So we continue to look at that mainly for, as I say, edge kind of deployment, which can be anywhere from, let's say, from 2 to 6 megawatts. 
On the Asia front, as Barry highlighted, and I mentioned in my remarks, we're super excited about the joint venture that we have with Web Werks. India, we think, has a lot of potential, and we're already seeing pent-up demand. Partly, it's regulatory driven and partly it's just the growth of the economy. So I think there's a lot more for us to do in India. As you would have noted, is that we're now 100% sold out in Singapore. So we're working through the permitting process on finding additional capacity in that market. And there are other areas in Southeast Asia, which I think are early days that we're looking at countries that would be interesting to expansion. And I would put Latin America in the same category is that there are a number of areas in Latin America that we're starting to look at, but we're at earlier stages for those areas."

Yes, I think also as people really start understanding the durability of our business and also the ability for us to continue to grow organically, cash generation through top line growth, I think people are starting to realize that they're probably overplaying the paper storage aspect of the story. 
So to your point is that you saw the records volume was slightly improved from  Q4 into Q1. Overall, we reiterate our commitment that we expect physical storage in the business to be flat to up for the full year, again, on an organic basis. And then you add 3 points of price to it. So -- and given the relatively slow growth of that business, there's not a lot of CapEx is going into it. So we feel really good because this is just effectively generating tons of cash that we're able to plow over to invest behind some of those growth initiatives that are targeted at the $80 billion total addressable market that I mentioned before as well as data center, which we've been increasing our capital allocation to over the last few years. 
So I think over time, I mean people are going to really understand that the physical volume, physical storage business is alive and well, and we're getting good price increase on top of that. And of course, as you alluded to, some of the other new physical storage areas like consumer continue to deliver dividends. And then on the other aspect is the revenue growth is starting to pick up from the investments we've made over the last 5 years into new business areas, I think, is starting to come through."

I'll talk about the physical volume side, and then Barry can give you our thinking around the guidance around storage. So I think on the physical volume, as you've been watching the story for a very long time. I mean, first of all, that the record storage is just 1 aspect of our physical storage business, right? And at the end of the day, it comes down to occupancy and our ability to drive cash returns for that business. So we feel that -- I wouldn't say a large diversification, but a purposeful diversification of our physical storage business. I think -- and you can even see that in our data is showing robustness and continuity of that business, which we feel really good about. 
Specifically, to your question on the sequential Q4 to Q1 improvement in the records management side of the business, we were really pleased with it. That's why it continues to give our confidence that overall physical storage will be flat to slightly up for the year. And part of that improvement, which you can say during a COVID time frame is kind of interesting, is really, I give a lot of credit to our global strategic accounts organization, which we set up, I guess, about 12 to 18 months ago is their degree of mining and broadening the conversation with our customers is showing real results, not just in the new areas that I highlighted in my opening remarks around digital services and SITAD, which we've had, obviously, really nice growth in that area. But they actually -- as part of a broader conversation they're having with our customers, which, quite frankly, has delivered more box to our facilities as well. So we feel pretty good across the board. We feel good about the  different conversation we're having with our customers due to some of the investments we've made in our commercial operations. But Barry, you might want to take that?"

We don't see anything that is outside of our expectations that were embedded in the original guidance, and that's the part of the reason why we were able to continue to raise the guidance for the beat that we saw in the first quarter. 
I'll note that with our structure and our relatively high margins on both storage and service, it does result in with inflation, the opportunity to price that much more incremental profitability for us. As you know, we kind of price comparing to other logistics companies. So in some respect, it helps a little bit with our revenue management program. 
In terms of funding growth, a couple of thoughts. One, obviously, we're continuing to expand EBITDA, thanks to Summit and the team's underlying performance. We will be doing a level of capital recycling this year, call it $125 million is what's embedded in the guidance. I'll note that the market there is very favorable, and we continue to like cap rates. And so those would be the principal things I'd mention. And in terms of where the yield is and where the stock is, we feel very good about our ability to fund our operations within framework.

If we look at some of our European markets, is it's more just based on the dynamics and the absorption versus the level of capacity in those markets like places like Frankfurt, London, et cetera. So I think it's kind of 2 different worlds. And then the same thing in New Jersey, it's a high -- reasonable levels of absorption with the right balance of supply. So I think it's a mix. There are some cases where it's purely on market dynamics, and there are other areas where we really like the conversations we're having with a number of customers, especially around some of our large campuses."

So If we're talking about those kinds of things where we do a make versus buy situation for entering into a market or expanding in a market, we will continue to look at those kind of what I would call small M&A deals. But large platform M&A, we don't see -- we really have the need. I think partly we're already in 56 countries for many decades as an operator. So we feel we have good cultural fit in the countries that we operate in. And we already have a pretty good international spread across our data center business, but we feel really good. 
On the capital allocation question, I would just reiterate with what Barry said before is we feel that between EBITDA growth and opportunities to recycle capital like what we're doing in our industrial portfolio, where the cap rates are, we think, really low.

And as you work through the model, you'll find another continued nice growth in EBITDA going forward. 
I will say, I think, a notable call out, frankly, in the first quarter is the fact that our cost of sales are actually down about $15 million despite sales being up. And that is a testament to the team's strong progress on Project Summit. As we've talked about before, Project Summit in 2021 is vastly going to be benefiting cost of sales as opposed to SG&A just in light of the sort of operational improvements that we talked about and highlighted at such as service delivery changes, et cetera.

I hope you and your families are safe and well. We are pleased to have delivered a strong start to the year with both revenue and profitability coming in ahead of our expectations for the first quarter despite the ongoing challenges of the pandemic and continued lockdowns in many parts of the world. Some of the key accomplishments of the quarter include: we achieved a record level of quarterly revenue; pricing continues to yield strong results as highlighted by our organic storage rental revenue growth of 1.7% year-on-year; total organic volume grew some 2 million cubic feet versus last quarter, and we continue to forecast overall volume growth to be flat to slightly positive for the year; we saw a strong performance from our growth areas, for example, digital solutions has shown year-over-year organic growth of 11%, while secure IT asset disposition, or SITAD, has shown 30% growth; we are in line with delivering over $50 million of revenue growth from these 2 dynamic areas this year; our global data center team leased 9 megawatts in Q1 versus our guidance of between 25 and 30 megawatts for the full year; we continue to grow our footprint, acquiring a new land parcel adjacent to our campus in Northern Virginia, which will increase our total potential capacity in that key market to 145 megawatts and bringing our total potential data center capacity globally to 445 megawatts; finally, adjusted EBITDA grew 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and our margin expanded 100 basis points. 
It should be noted that Q1 this year is even more impressive given that we are comparing it to a year ago where COVID, for the most part, was affecting very few of our customers. Whilst the impact from COVID during this quarter continues with many of the 56 countries we operate in to be in various stages of lockdown, we are proud of the consistency and stability of our core business and we continue to deliver on our strategic plan. This reflects the diversity and scale of our portfolio, the depth and breadth of our service offerings and the efficiencies that have been created through Project Summit. 
To further underline the point, our sales productivity remains strong and our mountaineers persevere resulting in Q1 overall revenue it ahead of last year, whilst our traditional service revenue, which is most closely tied with being in the office, was off 7%. We continue to expect to see very modest improvements in core service revenue as we progress through the year, and we are not factoring in a full COVID recovery for the traditional side of the business before Q4 and perhaps for some parts of the world, even Q1 next year. 
In the meantime, we can see in our results and our improved guidance, our growth from new product areas will continue to deliver overall growth in our business in spite of the COVID impacts elsewhere. We remain committed to taking purposeful and bold steps to transform our entire organization, both operationally and culturally. We remained true to our plans to accelerate growth and continue our digital transformation journey, which for us includes both an internal focus as well as expanded product offerings for our customers. 
We are confident that our continued delivery of overall revenue growth, together with the expansion of margins due to Project Summit, will enable us to continue our acceleration in cash generation, which will allow us to continue to invest in our future, whilst returning more and more cash to our investors. 
Project Summit is well on track to deliver $375 million of annual run rate adjusted EBITDA benefits exiting this year, even after investing in new growth areas. In addition to adding $375 million to our EBITDA through margin improvement, Project Summit will continue to enable us to invest in the growth areas we identified and discussed last quarter, further accelerating our growth in revenue as well as profits. Some of these areas, you will recall, include digital solutions, consumer storage, data center and SITAD. Examples to illustrate the impact of our focus on revenue growth can be seen from recent wins in digital services and SITAD. One recent win in digital services was with a global insurance company, which was managing its exposure from a large and complicated liability claim. This customer desired and state was to streamline underwriting and claims management processes by providing digital accessibility to records to quickly identify risk exposure, reduce processing times, improve SLAs, ensure chain of custody and gain scalability for large discovery audits. 
Our unique solution was to integrate 440,000 of their physical boxes with their digital information to provide a single view to search across and identify relevant and required information on demand. By leveraging our InSight platform, we were able to immediately improve their legal discovery efforts and automate their claims processes. 
Another recent win was with the Government of Canada to leverage our Image on Demand, or IoD, solution to process applications for immigration, refugee or citizenship status. The government experienced a backlog during COVID as staff could not access offices and applications kept piling up. This digital solution enabled the government staff to work through the backlog. We are currently imaging more than 4,000 applications on a weekly basis, which are then digitally delivered for processing by the Government of Canada's employees. 
Switching to SITAD. This quarter, we have secured contracts with 4 large global clients to provide services across the globe. These engagements cover everything from enterprise infrastructure such as servers, routers, switches, printers, copiers to small personal devices and specialized equipment such as card readers. Our solutions in SITAD are the only ones in the market built around a secure chain of custody where assets attract at every stage of their journey and our customers' data is kept secure. 
Also, our disposition process is built with sustainability in mind. We are a leader in thinking and acting for the environment. Demand for these services is particularly strong as companies look to consolidate and transform their physical footprint to move to new hybrid collaboration models post-COVID, and we expect to partner with many more of our enterprise and global clients throughout 2021 and beyond. 
Now let me switch gears and spend some time discussing our ESG commitments, including the sustainability of our products, services and operations as well as our efforts focused on diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Our eighth annual corporate social responsibility report will be published later today. In that report, we share sustainability goals as part of our ESG commitments to reduce our environmental impact. Whilst we have been extremely successful in achieving targets that were previously set, including exceeding our science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 6 years ahead of schedule. We have -- we are introducing even stronger commitments to our planet, our customers, our employees and our communities. 
Some highlights include: we are committed to achieving carbon net 0 by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Climate accord. We are proud to be ranked #81 on Newsweek's list of America's most responsible companies in 2021. By 2025, we are committed to building all of our newly constructed multi-tenant data centers to be certified to the BREEAM green building standard. In addition to contracting for renewable energy equivalent to 100% of our data center electricity load worldwide and passing through the carbon reduction benefits to our customers who availed themselves of our Green Power Pass, we have announced our first electricity supply contract that matches our load 24/7 with local renewable generation for our facilities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Additionally, we shared with you our REIT commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, not just because it is just, but also because it is key to our strategic success in being a more creative and dynamic organization, which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs. 
For example, by 2025, we have committed to increasing representation of women in our global leadership team to 40% from 31% today, and people who identify as BIPOC in our U.S. leadership team to 30% from 19%. Thanks to the true commitment of my fellow mountaineers across the globe and with the guidance and engagement of our employee resource groups, we have made significant process on our journey, but have a lot more to do. 
To further us on our journey, I'm pleased to announce that we have recently recruited Charlene Jackson as our Global Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer. Charlene brings a strong set of experience and skills as we continue building our global enterprise into an organization which is both diverse and inclusive. 
Finally, before handing the call over to Barry, I would like to provide a bit more information on the data center performance. As I mentioned earlier, our global data center team is off to a strong start, leasing more than 9 megawatts in the first quarter. As you likely saw, this included 6 megawatts with an existing U.S.-based Fortune 100 technology company. We also signed a 1-megawatt lease in Singapore with a leading e-commerce and gaming company. The remainder of the leasing for the quarter was colocation, and we continue to build our pipeline for both hyperscale and retail deployment. 
Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we closed on our joint venture with Web Werks and have already seen great growth prospects from that partnership. Web Werks recently announced that they have acquired a land parcel to build a stand-alone purpose-built greenfield data center in Mumbai. This new data center will be designed to support 12.5 megawatts of IT capacity with a rich interconnected ecosystem consisting of major telcos, over 150 Internet service providers and 3 major Internet exchanges. The new facility, expected to be operational by mid-2022, abuts Web Werks existing data center in Mumbai, which would result in a campus with 15 megawatts of total capacity. 
We also continue to grow our platform organically with the recent purchase of a land parcel adjacent to our existing Northern Virginia campus. This parcel is expected to support 32 megawatts of IT capacity at full build-out. In addition, we redesigned our Manassas campus master plan and can now support 30 megawatts of IT load at VA2 compared to 24 megawatts previously, as well as an additional 35 megawatts of capacity at the campus. With these design and scope changes, our NoVa campus capacity has increased more than 90% to 145 megawatts, with 16 megawatts built and 72% of that leased. 
Our total data center potential capacity globally now is 445 megawatts on or an increase of more than 18%, giving us a long runway for future development and growth. 
In closing, let me say thank you to our mountaineers and their families for their continued support and dedication in what has been a difficult and heart-wrenching year for many. We and our customers count on our essential workers every day, and I personally always come back inspired after meeting with many of our teams around the globe. 
Our results demonstrate accelerating earnings growth, the resiliency of our business revenue growth in new areas and the benefits of our culture. Our culture supports customer first with an innovative mindset. With that inner DNA, we will continue to climb higher together with our customers. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

In the first quarter, our team delivered solid performance that exceeded expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Building on the improved performance we delivered in the second half of 2020, revenue trends continued to strengthen in the first quarter. 
Our core physical storage business is demonstrating its resilience and momentum is building in our growth areas. We are confident in our projections and are pleased to raise our full year financial guidance. 
Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion grew 1.2%. Total organic revenue declined 60 basis points. Organic service revenue declined 4.8%, a marked improvement from prior quarters, representing our best performance since the first quarter of 2020. 
While our service activity is still experiencing an impact from COVID, March was the first month since February 2020 with positive organic service revenue growth. Our team continues to drive improving trends with growth in our global digital solutions business and revenue management notable callouts. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7% with continued benefit from pricing combined with a slight increase in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $381 million. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team delivered stronger margin flow-through together with the revenue beat. 
First quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation and revenue management, offset by COVID-driven impacts to the business. AFFO was $235 million or $0.81 on a per share basis. As we mentioned on our prior earnings call, AFFO reflects an increase in recurring CapEx as we catch up on some projects that were deferred during the pandemic. Our full year recurring CapEx guidance is unchanged. 
Turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our global RIM business delivered revenue of $967 million, an increase of $11 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue declined 80 basis points. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 1.7% or 1.6% on an organic basis. Growth was driven by pricing and volume. 
While our traditional services have been impacted by the pandemic, trends continued to improve during the first quarter. We are focused on expanding our global digital solutions business. And in the first quarter, we experienced strong growth, building on the commercial successes we delivered in 2020. We are pleased with the continued performance in our consumer storage business. Even with normal seasonality, the business contributed nicely to our overall physical volume. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $409 million, an increase of $17 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 120 basis points, driven by pricing and Project Summit. 
Taking a look at headline numbers for our global data center business, we had another strong quarter of bookings with 9 megawatts. We are well on track to deliver our full year target of 25 to 30 megawatts. Total revenue grew 6% year-over-year, in line with our projections. As I mentioned on our prior call, we expect revenue growth in the data center business will be more back half weighted as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commenced in the second quarter and beyond. We continue to project full year revenue growth in the range of low double digits to approaching mid-teens. With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility. 
In the second quarter, we anticipate an increase in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA compared to the first quarter. In terms of margin, we expect the second quarter to be down 2 to 3 points sequentially as a result of COVID-driven construction delays and onetime build-out services for a specific customer. We expect margins to remain at that level in the third quarter before recovering in the fourth quarter. 
In late April, we formed a joint venture with Web Werks, a leading colocation data center provider in India. We made an initial investment of approximately $50 million in exchange for a noncontrolling interest. As we have previously disclosed, we expect to invest an additional $100 million over the next 2 years, which we expect will result in a majority ownership position. 
Turning to Project Summit. This quarter, the team delivered $50 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. As a reminder, we expect Summit to contribute $150 million of year-on-year benefit in 2021 with another $60 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $113 million with an investment of $85 million of growth CapEx, along with $29 million of recurring CapEx. 
Turning to capital recycling. In the first quarter, our program generated approximately $12 million of proceeds. With the highly favorable market backdrop and our strong data center development pipeline, we remain committed to recycling approximately $125 million of industrial assets for the full year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of just under 5.5x, slightly better than our projection and down from last year. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5x. 
For 2021, we continue to expect to end the year within our target range near the high end, which will be modestly down from year-end 2020 on a pro forma basis. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early July. As we have said before, we are fully committed to our dividend at this sustainable level. Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid-60s as a percentage of AFFO. 
Turning to our outlook. Today, we are pleased to increase our 2021 financial guidance. There are 2 factors driving the improved projections. Our outlook for the business continues to improve with first quarter performance better than expected and increased confidence in our key growth drivers and the underlying business trends. Second, we've also factored in the benefit from 2 small recently closed acquisitions as well as the Web Werks investment. And I would note that we have been able to increase our guidance despite the ongoing impact of COVID on our traditional services business and construction delays in Frankfurt. 
For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue of $4.365 billion to $4.515 billion. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.585 billion to $1.635 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents growth of -- revenue growth of 7% and EBITDA growth of 9%. We now expect AFFO to be in the range of $955 million to $1.005 billion and AFFO per share of $3.28 to $3.45. At the midpoint, this represents 10% growth for both metrics. 
Our guidance assumes global organic physical volume will be flat to slightly positive versus last year. Our revenue management program will provide a significant benefit in 2021, and I will note that nearly all of the actions driving that benefit were in place by the end of the first quarter. 
For services, we are prudently assuming some measure of continued COVID impact, albeit the first quarter was another good proof point for the momentum building in our digital solutions business. While we do not typically guide quarterly with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the second quarter. 
We expect revenue to approach $1.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA to approach $400 million. We are confident in our outlook and the strength of our pipeline. We expect to grow revenue sequentially throughout the year. 
In summary, the year is off to a good start. I am confident in the team's ability to continue to build on our momentum, we feel well positioned. 
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

So taking back, as you referred to the last meeting, over the last 5 years, we've been developing a number of new products and market approaches that really have taken us from a total addressable market, where our products and services range up from $10 billion to over $80 billion. So the things that we've been doubling down are consistent with that road map and picture that we highlighted last year. And that $80 billion, I should highlight, is also growing kind of low teens in terms of our organic growth rate. 
So if you think about -- I highlighted SITAD, for instance, and digital services today. I mean, I wouldn't say that we've just been doubling down on them in the last quarter, this has been a continuous build with, I would say, acceleration as part of Project Summit. And part of Project Summit, you're seeing the $375 million net EBITDA improvement that we're delivering and committing to, this is net of the investments that takes us -- that's required to actually invest in our digital services, SITAD, our continued investment in data center, further acceleration in consumer, for instance. 
So the investment is already in there. The $375 million is a net number that's coming out. And I think you can expect, as we said today, is that we just look at SITAD and digital services, this year alone, that will add roughly $50 million of revenue on a year-over-year basis. So we feel pretty good. 
Obviously, we just highlighted those 2 today, but across the board, and you can see it also in data center with 9 megawatts leased in this quarter, so we feel pretty good about now aiming towards an $80 billion market in terms of revenue growth, and that was part of Barry upsizing the revenue guidance for the full year."

And then another question on the data center side. Just wondering, as you look at future growth areas, are there potentially any new markets either domestically or internationally that could make sense for Iron Mountain to enter either via M&A or through a new greenfield development? Or do you think you -- you're just going to continue to develop in the markets that you have today?"

Maybe I'll take the first one, and I'll let Bill take the second one. I appreciate the question. As compared to our prior guidance, the increase of $40 million of revenue and $10 million of EBITDA is really driven by 2 factors, as I mentioned on the call: first, it's our outlook on the business, which just continues to improve; the first quarter performance, I think, is a testament of that; the team did a very well -- executed very well in the first quarter, and we're continuing to increase our confidence in our growth drivers and the underlying business trends. That's about $20 million of revenue in the guide up and probably 7, round number $7 million of the EBITDA. 
The second point is we factored in the benefit from 2 recently closed acquisitions as well as the Web Werks investment. That's about, combined, $20 million of revenue in the year. Note that we acquired those in the second quarter. And then about, call it, $3 million of EBITDA. I'll remind people that the Web Werks acquisition is not consolidated, so there's no revenue that comes along with that in our financials. 
I would also just note that there's no change in our assumption as it relates to foreign exchange rates. So the rates that we're using and the impact of that on our growth that we had in our prior guidance is unchanged in the current guidance. So it's the underlying business performance, together with a couple of small deals."
30292,711405850,2272784,"Iron Mountain Incorporated, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Iron Mountain Incorporated","Executives","Yes. And the only thing I would add, Eric, in terms of other areas of growth for data sets. So I appreciate the question is, let me kind of parse it out into theaters or parts of the world. So if we look at domestic, as you know, that we have a land bank",513,"Yes. And the only thing I would add, Eric, in terms of other areas of growth for data sets. So I appreciate the question is, let me kind of parse it out into theaters or parts of the world. So if we look at domestic, as you know, that we have a land bank in Chicago, we continue to like the Chicago market. So it's just a matter of where our priorities are on capital allocation. So I think you can expect, at some point, Chicago will be on the map. Also we continue to like the potential opportunities to repurpose some of our electricity meters, if you will, in California, where we can actually buy wholesale power, which gives us an advantage in terms of power costs by taking a records management facility and repurposing that into a data center. So California continues to be an area that we remain focused on as potential market for further development. 
On Europe, as we highlighted a few calls ago that we started building Frankfurt and then sold the thing out 100% over 27 megawatts, so Frankfurt is a market that we continue to look at further expansion to because it's a key market serving Continental Europe. London, too, as we noted, is in full development, but that's also looking to be pretty buoyant, so we'll continue to look at if we need more capacity in London. 
And then the last aspect, I would say, in London is we have had a few of our customers approach us on looking at edge deployments and where we were considering actually repurposing some of our industrial real estate footprint into data centers. So if you think about -- we have a land bank for our data center business, which takes us up to 445 megawatts. But that's not including the 80 million square feet of industrial warehouses that we have around the world. A number of those are suitable to be repurposed into data centers. So we continue to look at that mainly for, as I say, edge kind of deployment, which can be anywhere from, let's say, from 2 to 6 megawatts. 
On the Asia front, as Barry highlighted, and I mentioned in my remarks, we're super excited about the joint venture that we have with Web Werks. India, we think, has a lot of potential, and we're already seeing pent-up demand. Partly, it's regulatory driven and partly it's just the growth of the economy. So I think there's a lot more for us to do in India. As you would have noted, is that we're now 100% sold out in Singapore. So we're working through the permitting process on finding additional capacity in that market. And there are other areas in Southeast Asia, which I think are early days that we're looking at countries that would be interesting to expansion. And I would put Latin America in the same category is that there are a number of areas in Latin America that we're starting to look at, but we're at earlier stages for those areas."

Yes, I think also as people really start understanding the durability of our business and also the ability for us to continue to grow organically, cash generation through top line growth, I think people are starting to realize that they're probably overplaying the paper storage aspect of the story. 
So to your point is that you saw the records volume was slightly improved from  Q4 into Q1. Overall, we reiterate our commitment that we expect physical storage in the business to be flat to up for the full year, again, on an organic basis. And then you add 3 points of price to it. So -- and given the relatively slow growth of that business, there's not a lot of CapEx is going into it. So we feel really good because this is just effectively generating tons of cash that we're able to plow over to invest behind some of those growth initiatives that are targeted at the $80 billion total addressable market that I mentioned before as well as data center, which we've been increasing our capital allocation to over the last few years. 
So I think over time, I mean people are going to really understand that the physical volume, physical storage business is alive and well, and we're getting good price increase on top of that. And of course, as you alluded to, some of the other new physical storage areas like consumer continue to deliver dividends. And then on the other aspect is the revenue growth is starting to pick up from the investments we've made over the last 5 years into new business areas, I think, is starting to come through."

So I think on the physical volume, as you've been watching the story for a very long time. I mean, first of all, that the record storage is just 1 aspect of our physical storage business, right? And at the end of the day, it comes down to occupancy and our ability to drive cash returns for that business. So we feel that -- I wouldn't say a large diversification, but a purposeful diversification of our physical storage business. I think -- and you can even see that in our data is showing robustness and continuity of that business, which we feel really good about. 
Specifically, to your question on the sequential Q4 to Q1 improvement in the records management side of the business, we were really pleased with it. That's why it continues to give our confidence that overall physical storage will be flat to slightly up for the year. And part of that improvement, which you can say during a COVID time frame is kind of interesting, is really, I give a lot of credit to our global strategic accounts organization, which we set up, I guess, about 12 to 18 months ago is their degree of mining and broadening the conversation with our customers is showing real results, not just in the new areas that I highlighted in my opening remarks around digital services and SITAD, which we've had, obviously, really nice growth in that area. But they actually -- as part of a broader conversation they're having with our customers, which, quite frankly, has delivered more box to our facilities as well.

I'll note that with our structure and our relatively high margins on both storage and service, it does result in with inflation, the opportunity to price that much more incremental profitability for us. As you know, we kind of price comparing to other logistics companies. So in some respect, it helps a little bit with our revenue management program. 
In terms of funding growth, a couple of thoughts. One, obviously, we're continuing to expand EBITDA, thanks to Summit and the team's underlying performance. We will be doing a level of capital recycling this year, call it $125 million is what's embedded in the guidance. I'll note that the market there is very favorable, and we continue to like cap rates.

If we look at some of our European markets, is it's more just based on the dynamics and the absorption versus the level of capacity in those markets like places like Frankfurt, London, et cetera.

On the capital allocation question, I would just reiterate with what Barry said before is we feel that between EBITDA growth and opportunities to recycle capital like what we're doing in our industrial portfolio, where the cap rates are, we think, really low. We like that trade of trading exposure on industrial right now and putting more capital at work in data center."

And as you work through the model, you'll find another continued nice growth in EBITDA going forward. 
I will say, I think, a notable call out, frankly, in the first quarter is the fact that our cost of sales are actually down about $15 million despite sales being up. And that is a testament to the team's strong progress on Project Summit. As we've talked about before, Project Summit in 2021 is vastly going to be benefiting cost of sales as opposed to SG&A just in light of the sort of operational improvements that we talked about and highlighted at such as service delivery changes, et cetera. And so you really saw that starting to come to fruition in the first quarter with the vast majority of that Summit benefit year-on-year that I called out being in cost of sales. And that's a trend that we expect to continue for the remainder of the year. Appreciate the questions, Sheila."

I hope you and your families are safe and well. We are pleased to have delivered a strong start to the year with both revenue and profitability coming in ahead of our expectations for the first quarter despite the ongoing challenges of the pandemic and continued lockdowns in many parts of the world. 
Some of the key accomplishments of the quarter include: we achieved a record level of quarterly revenue; pricing continues to yield strong results as highlighted by our organic storage rental revenue growth of 1.7% year-on-year; total organic volume grew some 2 million cubic feet versus last quarter, and we continue to forecast the overall volume growth to be flat to slightly positive for the year; we saw a strong performance from our growth areas, for example, digital solutions has shown year-over-year organic growth of 11%, while secure IT asset disposition, or SITAD, has shown 30% growth; we are in line with delivering over $50 million of revenue growth from these 2 dynamic areas this year; our global data center team leased 9 megawatts in Q1 versus our guidance of between 25 and 30 megawatts for the full year; we continue to grow our footprint, acquiring a new land parcel adjacent to our campus in Northern Virginia, which will increase our total potential capacity in that key market to 145 megawatts and bringing our total potential data center capacity globally to 445 megawatts; finally, adjusted EBITDA grew 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and our margin expanded 100 basis points. 
It should be noted that Q1 this year is even more impressive given that we are comparing it to a year ago where COVID, for the most part, was affecting very few of our customers. Whilst the impact from COVID during this quarter continues with many of the 56 countries we operate in to be in various stages of lockdown, we are proud of the consistency and stability of our core business and we continue to deliver on our strategic plan. This reflects the diversity and scale of our portfolio, the depth and breadth of our service offerings and the efficiencies that have been created through Project Summit. 
To further underline the point, our sales productivity remains strong and our mountaineers persevere resulting in Q1 overall revenue slightly ahead of last year, whilst our traditional service revenue, which is most closely tied with being in the office, was off 7%. We continue to expect to see very modest improvements in core service revenue as we progress through the year, and we are not factoring in a full COVID recovery for the traditional side of the business before Q4 and perhaps for some parts of the world, even Q1 next year. 
In the meantime, we can see in our results and our improved guidance, our growth from new product areas will continue to deliver overall growth in our business in spite of the COVID impacts elsewhere. We remain committed to taking purposeful and bold steps to transform our entire organization, both operationally and culturally. We remained true to our plans to accelerate growth and continue our digital transformation journey, which for us includes both an internal focus as well as expanded product offerings for our customers. 
We are confident that our continued delivery of overall revenue growth, together with the expansion of margins due to Project Summit, will enable us to continue our acceleration in cash generation, which will allow us to continue to invest in our future, whilst returning more and more cash to our investors. 
Project Summit is well on track to deliver $375 million of annual run rate adjusted EBITDA benefits exiting this year, even after investing in new growth areas. In addition to adding $375 million to our EBITDA through margin improvement, Project Summit will continue to enable us to invest in the growth areas we identified and discussed last quarter, further accelerating our growth in revenue as well as profits. 
Some of these areas, you will recall, include digital solutions, consumer storage, data center and SITAD. Examples to illustrate the impact of our focus on revenue growth can be seen from recent wins in digital services and SITAD. One recent win in digital services was with a global insurance company, which was managing its exposure from a large and complicated liability claim. 
This customer desired end state was to streamline underwriting and claims management processes by providing digital accessibility to records to quickly identify risk exposure, reduce processing times, improve SLAs, ensure chain of custody and gain scalability for large discovery audits. 
Our unique solution was to integrate 440,000 of their physical boxes with their digital information to provide a single view to search across and identify relevant and required information on demand. By leveraging our InSight platform, we were able to immediately improve their legal discovery efforts and automate their claims processes. 
Another recent win was with the Government of Canada to leverage our Image on Demand, or IoD, solution to process applications for immigration, refugee or citizenship status. The government experienced a backlog during COVID as staff could not access offices and applications kept piling up. This digital solution enabled the government staff to work through the backlog. We are currently imaging more than 4,000 applications on a weekly basis, which are then digitally delivered for processing by the Government of Canada's employees. 
Switching to SITAD. This quarter, we have secured contracts with 4 large global clients to provide services across the globe. These engagements cover everything from enterprise infrastructure such as servers, routers, switches, printers, copiers to small personal devices and specialized equipment such as card readers. Our solutions in SITAD are the only ones in the market built around a secure chain of custody where assets attract at every stage of their journey and our customers' data is kept secure. 
Also, our disposition process is built with sustainability in mind. We are a leader in thinking and acting for the environment. Demand for these services is particularly strong as companies look to consolidate and transform their physical footprint to move to new hybrid collaboration models post-COVID, and we expect to partner with many more of our enterprise and global clients throughout 2021 and beyond. 
Now let me switch gears and spend some time discussing our ESG commitments, including the sustainability of our products, services and operations as well as our efforts focused on diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Our eighth annual corporate social responsibility report will be published later today. In that report, we share sustainability goals as part of our ESG commitments to reduce our environmental impact. Whilst we have been extremely successful in achieving targets that were previously set, including exceeding our science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 6 years ahead of schedule. We have -- we are introducing even stronger commitments to our planet, our customers, our employees and our communities. 
Some highlights include: we are committed to achieving carbon net-zero by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris climate accord. We are proud to be ranked #81 on Newsweek's list of America's most responsible companies in 2021. By 2025, we are committed to building all of our newly constructed multi-tenant data centers to be certified to the BREEAM Green Building Standard. 
In addition to contracting for renewable energy equivalent to 100% of our data center electricity load worldwide and passing through the carbon reduction benefits to our customers who availed themselves of our Green Power Pass, we have announced our first electricity supply contract that matches our load 24/7 with local renewable generation for our facilities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
Additionally, we shared with you our REIT commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, not just because it is just, but also because it is key to our strategic success in being a more creative and dynamic organization, which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs. 
For example, by 2025, we have committed to increasing representation of women in our global leadership team to 40% from 31% today, and people who identify as BIPOC in our U.S. leadership team to 30% from 19%. Thanks to the true commitment of my fellow mountaineers across the globe and with the guidance and engagement of our employee resource groups, we have made significant process on our journey, but have a lot more to do. 
To further us on our journey, I'm pleased to announce that we have recently recruited Charlene Jackson as our Global Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer. Charlene brings a strong set of experience and skills as we continue building our global enterprise into an organization which is both diverse and inclusive. 
Finally, before handing the call over to Barry, I would like to provide a bit more information on the data center performance. As I mentioned earlier, our global data center team is off to a strong start, leasing more than 9 megawatts in the first quarter. As you likely saw, this included 6 megawatts with an existing U.S.-based Fortune 100 technology company. 
We also signed a 1-megawatt lease in Singapore with a leading e-commerce and gaming company. The remainder of the leasing for the quarter was co-location, and we continue to build our pipeline for both hyperscale and retail deployment. 
Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we closed on our joint venture with Web Werks and have already seen great growth prospects from that partnership. Web Werks recently announced that they have acquired a land parcel to build a stand-alone purpose-built greenfield data center in Mumbai. 
This new data center will be designed to support 12.5 megawatts of IT capacity with a rich interconnected ecosystem consisting of major telcos, over 150 Internet service providers and 3 major Internet exchanges. The new facility, expected to be operational by mid-2022, abuts Web Werks existing data center in Mumbai, which would result in a campus with 15 megawatts of total capacity. 
We also continue to grow our platform organically with the recent purchase of a land parcel adjacent to our existing Northern Virginia campus. This parcel is expected to support 32 megawatts of IT capacity at full build-out. In addition, we redesigned our Manassas campus master plan and can now support 30 megawatts of IT load at VA2 compared to 24 megawatts previously, as well as an additional 35 megawatts of capacity at the campus. 
With these design and scope changes, our NoVa campus capacity has increased more than 90% to 145 megawatts, with 16 megawatts built and 72% of that leased. 
Our total data center potential capacity globally now is 445 megawatts and/or an increase of more than 18%, giving us a long runway for future development and growth. 
In closing, let me say thank you to our mountaineers and their families for their continued support and dedication in what has been a difficult and heart-wrenching year for many. We and our customers count on our essential workers every day, and I personally always come back inspired after meeting with many of our teams around the globe. 
Our results demonstrate accelerating earnings growth, the resiliency of our business, revenue growth in new areas and the benefits of our culture. Our culture supports customer first with an innovative mindset. With that inner DNA, we will continue to climb higher together with our customers. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

In the first quarter, our team delivered solid performance that exceeded the expectations across each of our key financial metrics.

In the first quarter, our team delivered solid performance that exceeded the expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Building on the improved performance we delivered in the second half of 2020, revenue trends continued to strengthen in the first quarter. 
Our core physical storage business is demonstrating its resilience and momentum is building in our growth areas. We are confident in our projections and are pleased to raise our full year financial guidance. 
Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion grew 1.2%. Total organic revenue declined 60 basis points. Organic service revenue declined 4.8%, a marked improvement from prior quarters, representing our best performance since the first quarter of 2020. 
While our service activity is still experiencing an impact from COVID, March was the first month since February 2020 with positive organic service revenue growth. Our team continues to drive improving trends with growth in our global digital solutions business and revenue management notable callouts. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7% with continued benefit from pricing combined with a slight increase in volume. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $381 million. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team delivered stronger margin flow-through together with the revenue beat. First quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation and revenue management, offset by COVID-driven impacts to the business. AFFO was $235 million or $0.81 on a per share basis. As we mentioned on our prior earnings call, AFFO reflects an increase in recurring CapEx as we catch up on some projects that were deferred during the pandemic. Our full year recurring CapEx guidance is unchanged. 
Turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our global RIM business delivered revenue of $967 million, an increase of $11 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue declined 80 basis points. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 1.7% or 1.6% on an organic basis. Growth was driven by pricing and volume. 
While our traditional services have been impacted by the pandemic, trends continued to improve during the first quarter. We are focused on expanding our global digital solutions business. And in the first quarter, we experienced strong growth, building on the commercial successes we delivered in 2020. We are pleased with the continued performance in our consumer storage business. Even with normal seasonality, the business contributed nicely to our overall physical volume. 
Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $409 million, an increase of $17 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 120 basis points, driven by pricing and Project Summit. 
Taking a look at headline numbers for our global data center business, we had another strong quarter of bookings with 9 megawatts. We are well on track to deliver our full year target of 25 to 30 megawatts. Total revenue grew 6% year-over-year, in line with our projections. As I mentioned on our prior call, we expect revenue growth in the data center business will be more back half weighted as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commenced in the second quarter and beyond. 
We continue to project full year revenue growth in the range of low double digits to approaching mid-teens. With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility. In the second quarter, we anticipate an increase in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA compared to the first quarter. In terms of margin, we expect the second quarter to be down 2 to 3 points sequentially as a result of COVID-driven construction delays and onetime build-out services for a specific customer. We expect margins to remain at that level in the third quarter before recovering in the fourth quarter. 
In late April, we formed a joint venture with Web Werks, a leading co-location data center provider in India. We made an initial investment of approximately $50 million in exchange for a noncontrolling interest. As we have previously disclosed, we expect to invest an additional $100 million over the next 2 years, which we expect will result in a majority ownership position. 
Turning to Project Summit. This quarter, the team delivered $50 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. As a reminder, we expect Summit to contribute $150 million of year-on-year benefit in 2021 with another $60 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $113 million with an investment of $85 million of growth CapEx, along with $29 million of recurring CapEx. 
Turning to capital recycling. In the first quarter, our program generated approximately $12 million of proceeds. With the highly favorable market backdrop and our strong data center development pipeline, we remain committed to recycling approximately $125 million of industrial assets for the full year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of just under 5.5x, slightly better than our projection and down from last year. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5x. 
For 2021, we continue to expect to end the year within our target range near the high end, which will be modestly down from year-end 2020 on a pro forma basis. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early July. As we have said before, we are fully committed to our dividend at this sustainable level. Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid-60s as a percentage of AFFO. 
Turning to our outlook. Today, we are pleased to increase our 2021 financial guidance. There are 2 factors driving the improved projections. Our outlook for the business continues to improve with first quarter performance better than expected and increased confidence in our key growth drivers and the underlying business trends. 
Second, we've also factored in the benefit from 2 small recently closed acquisitions as well as the Web Werks investment. And I would note that we have been able to increase our guidance despite the ongoing impact of COVID on our traditional services business and construction delays in Frankfurt. 
For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue of $4.365 billion to $4.515 billion. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.585 billion to $1.635 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents growth of -- revenue growth of 7% and EBITDA growth of 9%. We now expect AFFO to be in the range of $955 million to $1.005 billion and AFFO per share of $3.28 to $3.45. At the midpoint, this represents 10% growth for both metrics. 
Our guidance assumes global organic physical volume will be flat to slightly positive versus last year. Our revenue management program will provide a significant benefit in 2021, and I will note that nearly all of the actions driving that benefit were in place by the end of the first quarter. 
For services, we are prudently assuming some measure of continued COVID impact, albeit the first quarter was another good proof point for the momentum building in our digital solutions business. While we do not typically guide quarterly with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the second quarter. 
We expect revenue to approach $1.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA to approach $400 million. We are confident in our outlook and the strength of our pipeline. We expect to grow revenue sequentially throughout the year. 
In summary, the year is off to a good start. I am confident in the team's ability to continue to build on our momentum, we feel well positioned. 
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

So taking back, as you referred to the last meeting, over the last 5 years, we've been developing a number of new products and market approaches that really have taken us from a total addressable market, where our products and services range up from $10 billion to over $80 billion. So the things that we've been doubling down are consistent with that road map and picture that we highlighted last year. 
And that $80 billion, I should highlight, is also growing kind of low teens in terms of our organic growth rate.  So if you think about -- I highlighted SITAD, for instance, and digital services today. I mean, I wouldn't say that we've just been doubling down on them in the last quarter, this has been a continuous build with, I would say, acceleration as part of Project Summit. 
And part of Project Summit, you're seeing the $375 million net EBITDA improvement that we're delivering and committing to, this is net of the investments that takes us -- that's required to actually invest in our digital services, SITAD, our continued investment in data center, further acceleration in consumer, for instance. 
So the investment is already in there. The $375 million is a net number that's coming out. And I think you can expect, as we said today, is that we just look at SITAD and digital services, this year alone, that will add roughly $50 million of revenue on a year-over-year basis. So we feel pretty good. 
Obviously, we just highlighted those 2 today, but across the board, and you can see it also in data center with 9 megawatts leased in this quarter, so we feel pretty good about now aiming towards an $80 billion market in terms of revenue growth, and that was part of Barry upsizing the revenue guidance for the full year."

As compared to our prior guidance, the increase of $40 million of revenue and $10 million of EBITDA is really driven by 2 factors, as I mentioned on the call: first, it's our outlook on the business, which just continues to improve, the first quarter performance, I think, is a testament of that. The team did a very well -- executed very well in the first quarter, and we're continuing to increase our confidence in our growth drivers and the underlying business trends. That's about $20 million of revenue in the guide up and probably 7, round number $7 million of the EBITDA. 
The second point is we factored in the benefit from 2 recently closed acquisitions as well as the Web Werks investment. That's about, combined, $20 million of revenue in the year. Note that we acquired those in the second quarter. And then about, call it, $3 million of EBITDA. I'll remind people that the Web Werks acquisition is not consolidated, so there's no revenue that comes along with that in our financials. 
I would also just note that there's no change in our assumption as it relates to foreign exchange rates. So the rates that we're using and the impact of that on our growth that we had in our prior guidance is unchanged in the current guidance. So it's the underlying business performance, together with a couple of small deals."

So I appreciate the question is, let me kind of parse it out into theaters or parts of the world. So if we look at domestic, as you know, that we have a land bank in Chicago, we continue to like the Chicago market. 
So it's just a matter of where our priorities are on capital allocation. So I think you can expect, at some point, Chicago will be on the map. Also we continue to like the potential opportunities to re-purpose some of our electricity meters, if you will, in California, where we can actually buy wholesale power, which gives us an advantage in terms of power costs by taking a records management facility and re-purposing that into a data center. So California continues to be an area that we remain focused on as potential market for further development. 
On Europe, as we highlighted a few calls ago that we started building Frankfurt and then sold the thing out 100% over 27 megawatts, so Frankfurt is a market that we continue to look at further expansion to because it's a key market serving Continental Europe. London, too, as we noted, is in full development, but that's also looking to be pretty buoyant, so we'll continue to look at if we need more capacity in London. 
And then the last aspect, I would say, in London is we have had a few of our customers approach us on looking at edge deployments and where we were considering actually re-purposing some of our industrial real estate footprint into data centers. So if you think about -- we have a land bank for our data center business, which takes us up to 445 megawatts. 
But that's not including the 80 million square feet of industrial warehouses that we have around the world. A number of those are suitable to be re-purposed into data centers. So we continue to look at that mainly for, as I say, edge kind of deployment, which can be anywhere from, let's say, from 2 to 6 megawatts. 
On the Asia front, as Barry highlighted, and I mentioned in my remarks, we're super excited about the joint venture that we have with Web Werks. India, we think, has a lot of potential, and we're already seeing pent-up demand. Partly, it's regulatory driven and partly it's just the growth of the economy. 
So I think there's a lot more for us to do in India. As you would have noted, is that we're now 100% sold out in Singapore. So we're working through the permitting process on finding additional capacity in that market. And there are other areas in Southeast Asia, which I think are early days that we're looking at countries that would be interesting to expansion. 
And I would put Latin America in the same category is that there are a number of areas in Latin America that we're starting to look at, but we're at earlier stages for those areas."

Yes, I think also as people really start understanding the durability of our business and also the ability for us to continue to grow organically, cash generation through top line growth, I think people are starting to realize that they're probably overplaying the paper storage aspect of the story. 
So to your point is that you saw the records volume was slightly improved from Q4 into Q1. Overall, we reiterate our commitment that we expect physical storage in the business to be flat to up for the full year, again, on an organic basis. And then you add 3 points of price to it. So -- and given the relatively slow growth of that business, there's not a lot of CapEx is going into it. 
So we feel really good because this is just effectively generating tons of cash that we're able to plow over to invest behind some of those growth initiatives that are targeted at the $80 billion total addressable market that I mentioned before as well as data center, which we've been increasing our capital allocation to over the last few years. 
So I think over time, I mean people are going to really understand that the physical volume, physical storage business is alive and well, and we're getting good price increase on top of that. And of course, as you alluded to, some of the other new physical storage areas like consumer continue to deliver dividends. 
And then on the other aspect is the revenue growth is starting to pick up from the investments we've made over the last 5 years into new business areas, I think, is starting to come through."

I'll talk about the physical volume side, and then Barry can give you our thinking around the guidance around storage. So I think on the physical volume, as you've been watching the story for a very long time. I mean, first of all, that the record storage is just 1 aspect of our physical storage business, right? 
And at the end of the day, it comes down to occupancy and our ability to drive cash returns for that business. So we feel that -- I wouldn't say a large diversification, but a purposeful diversification of our physical storage business. I think -- and you can even see that in our data is showing the robustness and continuity of that business, which we feel really good about. 
Specifically, to your question on the sequential Q4 to Q1 improvement in the records management side of the business, we were really pleased with it. That's why it continues to give our confidence that overall physical storage will be flattish to slightly up for the year. 
And part of that improvement, which you can say during a COVID time frame is kind of interesting, is really, I give a lot of credit to our global strategic accounts organization, which we set up, I guess, about 12 to 18 months ago is their degree of mining and broadening the conversation with our customers is showing real results, not just in the new areas that I highlighted in my opening remarks around digital services and SITAD, which we've had, obviously, really nice growth in that area. 
But they actually -- as part of a broader conversation they're having with our customers, which, quite frankly, has delivered more box to our facilities as well.

We don't see anything that is outside of our expectations that were embedded in the original guidance, and that's the part of the reason why we were able to continue to raise the guidance for the beat that we saw in the first quarter. 
I'll note that with our structure and our relatively high margins on both storage and service, it does result in with inflation, the opportunity to price that much more incremental profitability for us. As you know, we kind of price comparing to other logistics companies. So in some respect, it helps a little bit with our revenue management program. 
In terms of funding growth, a couple of thoughts. One, obviously, we're continuing to expand EBITDA, thanks to Summit and the team's underlying performance. We will be doing a level of capital recycling this year, call it $125 million is what's embedded in the guidance. 
I'll note that the market there is very favorable, and we continue to like cap rates. And so those would be the principal things I'd mention.

If we look at some of our European markets, is it's more just based on the dynamics and then the absorption versus the level of capacity in those markets like places like Frankfurt, London, et cetera. So I think it's kind of 2 different worlds. 
And then the same thing in New Jersey, it's a high -- reasonable levels of absorption with the right balance of supply. So I think it's a mix.

So If we're talking about those kinds of things where we do a make versus buy situation for entering into a market or expanding in a market, we will continue to look at those kind of what I would call small M&A deals.

This morning, we reported record second quarter financial results with revenue of more than $1.1 billion and EBITDA of $406 million. This strong performance in both Q2 and the first half of the year reflects the breadth and depth of our products and solutions and the strength of our deep customer relationships. 
Our second quarter results especially reflect increased demand for our services across our key markets and is based upon these strong results, and the increased momentum in the business that has caused us to increase the midpoint of our financial guidance as well has increased the expected bookings in our data center business. 
As we celebrate and honor Iron Mountain's 70th anniversary this month, I am extremely proud of what our team has accomplished in growing our relationships with our large and diverse customer base in spite of the continued challenges due to COVID. Our Mountaineers across the globe have conquered every obstacle with tenacity in an innovative mindset, all with a focus on accelerating growth in services to assist our customers. 
Before we dive into our record results and the positive momentum in our business, I want to take a moment to reflect on the current situation with the pandemic and new variants still wrecking havoc in many parts of the world. In addition to operational complexities, we're also dealing with the realities of the workplace and a world changed forever by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In Iron Mountain, we're thinking how we can move forward instead of getting back to normal, all else remaining diligent to ensure the physical and mental health as well as the overall safety of our teams, their families and our customers. As I mentioned earlier, this year, we celebrate 70 years of Iron Mountain. It's a legacy with a rich inspired past, which continues inspiring the future. Since that day on 24 August 1951, we have built, evolved and expanded our trusted relationship with our customers to include, not just the leading storage platform of physical assets, but now includes a rapidly increasing range of business services. 
These new services are centered around data center colocation, information security, data insights, IT asset disposition and business process management. And today, with this broadened portfolio of services and storage capabilities, we have become an innovative and global leader in our field with more than 225,000 customers, including more than 95% of the Fortune 1000, a global footprint of more than 1,450 facilities with a presence in 58 countries and 24,000 dedicated Mountaineers across the globe. And doing all this with -- in an energy sustainable way with 100% of our data centers powered by renewable energy. 
Many of the things about us have changed in 70 years. What hasn't changed is our core values and commitment to building and delivering on the trust our customers have come to count on. Over the last 2 quarters, we shared with you that we now have an expanded total addressable market, or TAM, of more than $80 billion. And against that expanded TAM, we've identified the building blocks for growth that will enable future growth and success. 
And in fact, you can already see evidence of this expansion through our year-on-year digital service revenue growth, together with secure IT asset disposition or ITAD. In this quarter versus a year ago, these business lines have grown over 37%, resulting in $25 million of incremental growth. 
I want to highlight a few examples, which illustrate our progress in helping our customers through utilizing new technologically-enabled approaches and products to not only protect, but unlock value from what matters most to them. The first win I want to highlight is in Singapore with a multinational banking and financial services corporation. We won a $750,000 annual recurring revenue digital mailroom contract over their current service provider. 
At first, the bank didn't believe that Iron Mountain could solve this need for them as they had only known us to support their storage and scanning requirements. However, the account team pursued the opportunity and highlighted Iron Mountain's strength utilizing a new technologically-based approach, which allows us to assist in managing the very start of much of the information entering the bank while securely facilitating a hybrid office and home working model. As we are already this customer's partner for business process outsourcing and processing much of the bank's critical information, the mailroom is a key additional service, which will yield further security and simplicity for the bank. 
Turning to another area representing part of our expanded TAM, I want to touch briefly on secure ITAD. Think of this as an area where we apply our highly secure chain of custody with a service that allows our customers to dispose securely in an environmentally responsible way, their IT assets, which are at end of life. We have continued to see good momentum in our secure ITAD solution following a number of big wins last quarter. We won a deal with one of the world's largest banks to recycle corporate laptops, monitors, and updated IT equipment across over 400 corporate offices, 4,000 conference rooms and 5,000 retail offices, which we expect to generate annual run rate revenues greater than $5 million. This is a valuable offering given our expertise in chain of custody and compliance, helping customers securely dispose of their IT equipment. 
Turning to our data center business. We want to share not only our continued growth in top and bottom line, but some recent exciting developments in the last month which has led us to increase our guidance for expected 2021 leasing from 25 to 30 megawatts to over 30 megawatts, not including additional leasing expected from the recent acquisitions in Frankfurt and India. 
Our increased guidance around leasing activity is based upon the momentum we have seen in the business in the first half of the year as well as the pipeline. Today, we announced not only the 3.6 megawatts of new leases we signed in the second quarter, but also a 6-megawatt lease with a new logo to our platform that was signed post Q2 in Northern Virginia. Taken together, along with our strong results in Q1, we have recorded a total of 19 megawatts of new and expansion leases in the first 7 months of the year. This is a great launching off point for the remainder of the year, and we feel confident we will achieve leasing activity above the top end of our original guidance. 
Turning back to Q2, it should be noted, of the 3.6 megawatts we leased in the quarter, the majority was in the retail and enterprise segments. This resulted in attractive pricing for the quarter which increased 14% sequentially. Our strongest markets in terms of new and expansion leasing were Phoenix, Singapore and Northern Virginia. 
Finally, in terms of development, you likely saw from our recent press releases, our data center business is expanding rapidly in Europe. We have a new 27-megawatt greenfield build in London, adjacent to our existing London-1 facility as well as the pending acquisition of a multi-tenant colocation data center in Frankfurt. Taken together, this will increase our total potential capacity in Europe to more than 88 megawatts and will provide access to important interconnection markets for new and existing customers looking for a reliable, flexible and secure data center location. 
As always, sustainability continues to be a top priority. And as part of our commitments, we will power our new buildings in London and Frankfurt with 100% renewable energy. 
Before I hand the call over, I also wish to touch upon some new product areas which are leading to more growth in our traditional storage areas. One of these newer product offerings is Clean Start, which is a service that helps customers navigate today's changing workplace requirements from reconfiguring the office of the social distancing to office  closures or moving to a more digital way of working. 
Since its inception, the Clean Start product has generated over $19 million in revenue and has uncovered 1.1 million net new cube over a 3-year period. In 2020, we decided to expand Clean Start globally with all regions engaged in growing the program. Since taking the business globally, we have seen an acceleration in bookings. Specifically, in the first half of 2021, Clean Start has delivered $5 million of new revenue or some 25% of the total revenue from this program since its inception 3 years ago. 
A specific customer example in this quarter includes a $1.8 million deal with a leading global hotel chain over the next 5 years. Due to challenges from the pandemic, the customer needed solutions to help with compliance and storage of materials. This customer has been with Iron Mountain for years at an individual hotel level and its corporate team saw the value in our scale, breadth of offerings, compliance expertise in risk reduction solutions. This prompted their decision to deploy our services across 103 hotels, plus an additional 15 one-off sites as required. 
We were able to manage much more than just their record storage, also meeting the destruction needs and providing image on demand services, all of this being done company-wide at a scale unmatched by any other provider. 
Another example which showcases our innovative new products which drive record volume and services growth is Smart Sort. Our customers want to reduce cost and risk by defensively destroying records as they meet retention requirements, which is difficult to do if records are not stored by the destruction eligibility date. 
For example, many health care accounts store records by patient number or last date of visit and not by retention requirement. With Smart Sort, we organize the records by destruction date so the customer knows what they can destroy and when. Our team understood a pervasive customer problem, took a customer-centric approach and proactively came up with a solution to solve it with Smart Sort. 
Just in the last year, we've had 10 health care vertical wins for Smart Sort with our most recent win with Johns Hopkins Medical Center. The agreement is a 5-year term which includes a $1.2 million Smart Sort move project, bringing an additional 160,000 cubic feet of inventory, representing over 4 million individual patient records. 
Reflecting some of these successes, total global volume grew to a record 733 million cubic feet this quarter. In spite of organic volume being down 10 basis points in the second quarter versus the first quarter, total global organic volume was up 1.6 million cubic feet in the first half of the year, and we continue to expect organic volume to be flat to slightly up for the full year. This expected organic volume, together with continued strong price increases, sets us up well for continued strength in organic storage revenue growth from our physical business areas. 
In closing, I want to say thank you to the 24,000 Mountaineers who've done an outstanding job navigating through the pandemic. I'm extremely proud of their relentless dedication to each other and our customers. With a resilient business model, ongoing market share growth and strategic investments to transform the company, we are excited about the significant opportunities ahead of us, which continue to exceed even our ambitious targets. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

The second quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in se",1288,"Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us. 
The second quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in service revenue and activity levels. Our core physical storage business performed well, and we are seeing great progress in our growth areas. Reflecting that progress and the outperformance in the first half, we increased the midpoint of our financial guidance. 
Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion grew 14%. Total organic revenue increased 10%. Organic service revenue increased $81 million or 26%, and was ahead of our expectations. Our team drove strong growth in both our global digital solutions business and secure IT asset disposition. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.5% with continued benefit from pricing, together with positive trends in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $406 million. 
We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team delivered better-than-expected Project Summit savings, together with the revenue beat. 
AFFO was $246 million or $0.85 on a per share basis. If you recall, last year's AFFO benefited from a $23 million tax refund. Adjusting for this, AFFO would have increased 8% year-over-year. As we mentioned on our prior earnings call, AFFO also reflects an increase in recurring CapEx as we catch up on some projects that were deferred during the pandemic. Our full year recurring CapEx guidance is unchanged. 
Turning to segment performance. In the second quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $993 million, an increase of $116 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 9.1%. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 1.9% or 1.6% on an organic basis. Growth was driven primarily by pricing and volume. We added about 4.5 million cubic feet from our acquisition in Indonesia, which closed during the quarter. 
Our traditional services business continued to recover from the pandemic with revenue growing 24% year-over-year and 4% from the first quarter. Our global digital solutions business continued to display strong momentum, growing 24% year-over-year. 
Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $430 million, an increase of $47 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 50 basis points year-over-year as a result of mix given the strong service revenue growth. Sequentially, EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points due to Project Summit benefits and the contribution from pricing. 
Turning to our Global Data Center business, where the team continues to perform exceptionally well. We booked 3.6 megawatts in the quarter, and through the first half, we have booked 12.6 megawatts. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we signed a 6-megawatt lease in Northern Virginia. Based on the year-to-date performance and the strength of our pipeline, we increased our full year leasing target to more than 30 megawatts, which would represent a 23% increase in bookings. 
In terms of revenue, as we projected, growth accelerated sharply to 15% year-over-year. We continue to plan for full year revenue growth in the range of low double digits to approaching midteens. The combination of our strong prior year bookings and the team's leasing performance year-to-date provides high visibility. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.4% increased 60 basis points from the first quarter and was ahead of our expectations. As compared to our prior outlook, the improvement was driven primarily by timing related to the Frankfurt build-out we discussed last quarter, which has been modestly delayed. As a result, we now expect more of the work associated with that project to occur in the second half, which will result in a temporary impact on segment margins on the order of 3 points relative to the second quarter level. 
Turning to Project Summit, this quarter, the team delivered $42 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. With the strength of the team's performance year-to-date, we now expect year-on-year benefits from Summit to approach $160 million, with another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. 
Total capital expenditures were $136 million, of which $100 million was growth and $36 million was recurring. 
Turning to capital recycling. As we have said before, we view the market for industrial assets as highly attractive as a means to supplement our growth capital. With that backdrop, in the second quarter, we upsized our recycling program and generated approximately $203 million of proceeds. Year-to-date, we have generated $215 million in proceeds compared previous guidance of $125 million. With our strong data center development pipeline, we are now expecting to generate full year proceeds of approximately $250 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had approximately $2.1 billion of liquidity. We ended the quarter with net lease-adjusted leverage of 5.3x, slightly better than our projection and down from both last year and last quarter. This marks our lowest leverage level since year-end 2017. 
As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5x. For 2021, we expect to end the year within our target range and estimate we will exit the year at levels similar to the second quarter. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October. 
Turning to our outlook. Today, we are pleased to increase the midpoint of our 2021 financial guidance. There are 3 factors driving the improved projections. First, operational performance in the second quarter was better than expected, and we had good momentum in our key growth areas. Second, we have identified additional benefits from Project Summit, primarily related to opportunities that our commercial team has been able to uncover. And third, we have acquired a small records management business in Morocco that will add about $5 million in revenue. 
Conversely, as compared to our prior guidance, there are 2 headwinds I would call out. First, we divested our Intellectual Property Management business in early June. Compared to our prior guidance, this represents a reduction of approximately $20 million of revenue and $15 million of EBITDA. Second, since May, the stronger U.S. dollar is more of a headwind by nearly $20 million for revenue and $7 million for EBITDA. 
For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue of $4.415 billion to $4.515 billion. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.6 billion to $1.635 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents growth of 8% and EBITDA growth of 10%. We now expect AFFO to be in the range of $970 million to $1.5 billion. And AFFO per share of $3.33 to $3.45. At the midpoint, this represents 11% and 10% growth, respectively. 
Our guidance assumes global organic physical volume will be flat to slightly positive versus last year. And with continued benefit from pricing, we anticipate low single-digit growth in total organic storage revenue. For services, we expect to maintain positive revenue growth through the remainder of the year. 
With the ongoing pandemic, we believe it is helpful to share our short-term expectations. For the third quarter, we expect revenue and EBITDA to both increase approximately $10 million sequentially from the second quarter levels. We expect AFFO to be slightly in excess of $250 million in the third quarter. 
In summary, our team is executing well. We have seen positive trends in the macro environment, and our pipeline continues to build. The momentum we had entering the year has strengthened, our addressable market continues to expand, and we feel confident in our ability to drive growth. We feel well positioned and look forward to updating you on our progress during -- following the third quarter. 
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

And as you pointed out, that was really driven by a lot of our new digital solutions, which was well north of 30% growth if you take ITAD and digital services combined. 
I think your question on the traditional service side is a good one because what we've seen actually is an increase in the backlog of incoming cube, which quite frankly, we haven't been able to get at in some countries because of continued rolling lockdowns or intermittent lockdowns. So we do expect as some of the lockdowns get eased that on the traditional service lines, that we know that there's a backlog of income in cube that we haven't been able to access the offices for. So I think there will be some in the medium-term in that area. How big, it's hard to judge right now."

And you talked about expectations of $160 million savings, with another $50 million next year. So how much of the upside in savings represent the pull-forward in future periods? Or would you say this is like an increase in total savings from Project Summit? And can you just sort of map out the entire time line of when you would expect to realize the full amount of project savings over the next couple of years? And maybe related to that, the Project Summit savings, how does your increased investment into growth initiatives impact the flow-through of Project Summit savings in terms of margin expansion opportunity?"

The full program, we anticipate generating $375 million of benefit. You'll recall that last year, we generated about $165 million of benefit. And year-to-date, together with last year -- so program to date, we're at about $257 million of benefit. We will end the year with all of the run rate savings in the numbers. So we expect to be exiting the year at the full program benefit. 
That leaves about $50 million of year-on-year benefit next year and so you should be penciling something about $70 million of incremental year-on-year benefit in the back half, probably split pretty equally this year with that $50 million remaining. So we feel great about the way the program is progressing. The team is executing well. 
You asked about investments. What you will see is we certainly did as part of Summit, invest in certain areas like our commercial organization, innovation, our global strategic accounts organization, and you would see that in our SG&A expenses this year. If you look at our SG&A year-on-year, it's up, excluding stock compensation expense, up about $16 million. And actually, more than all of that is in the commercial organization supporting growth. 
And so we -- both in the form of increasing that organization as well as some variable costs that go along with the great sales performance year-on-year like variable compensation expense. So you are seeing those expenses in the numbers already, and we expect that you will continue to see very good performance out of the team on Summit."

As you know, the revenue is up considerable amount both year-on-year and sequentially. While the gross margin is a tick down, call it, 40 basis points, I'll note that, that is driven by the fact that revenue in that line outstripped our projections. 
As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, if you look at versus our projections last quarter, for the quarter, we beat revenue by about $25 million, round numbers. The vast majority of that was in services. So we certainly did to maintain customer service, and we did have some level of what I would consider like surge expenses related to servicing that uptick in demand. And I think you should expect that, that will even out as we move forward. The decline in gross margin is about $1 million. So it's not a tremendous amount we feel good about the margins we're generating off the new product offerings, to Bill's point on our global digital solutions and our secure IT asset disposition, those are very nice margins. 
The other thing I'll note is our -- if you work through the numbers in our services area on EBITDA, the EBITDA margin in that business was actually up 100 basis points sequentially. And that was up 640 basis points year-on-year. So we feel good about the way our services are performing."

So on just a number of fronts, it's just a -- it's a great customer win. And as you can see, our -- we keep expanding capacity in our Northern Virginia campus based on the pipeline that we see even beyond that. So really, congratulations to the team. 
I think in terms of the pricing, you noticed this month, we were up slightly. So we thought that was actually a good trend. I think, generally, what we -- we're blessed being in that sense is a relatively newcomer to the data center space, so we don't have as many historical customers that were originally sold in at higher than what today market prices are. So most of our customers, because we've been growing very quickly, over the last few years are relatively new customers that are at what I would call new and -- the new pricing level. So we don't have as much pressure as some of our older peers that have had that. 
With the exception, we've called out the last few quarters from time to time when we did acquisitions. We knew we were acquiring some customers that had been with our acquired companies for a long time and that those were rolling up. So generally, we feel pretty good where we are on pricing. You noticed that this quarter, we were on the 3.6 megawatts, we were up quarter-on-quarter on pricing, and that was really more about mix that we were highly focused on colocation or retail and enterprise customers, which obviously come at higher pricing. So generally, we don't see a big change in the pricing on customers that we've acquired or brought into facilities that we've acquired."

So we don't see a big change in terms of the net volume trends in that part of the business. 
I do think that because of the shutdowns that I referred to earlier in a number of our countries, we have seen a significant increase in backlog, waiting for people to be able to get back to office to allow us access to bring that in. So that's positive. 
But if you just look overall in terms of our total physical storage business, we're really pleased with how that's coming out. Because if you look across the portfolio of our physical storage businesses, the first year -- the first half of the year, where we're up organically in terms of volume. We expect the second half of the year in terms of our physical storage business to continue that trend. So overall, the year, we say flat to slightly up, but as I said, we're up slightly in the first half, and we expect the second half to look the same, and then we had the normal price increase on top. 
So we feel really good in terms of where we're sitting on the general trends and the trends within each of those segments of our physical storage business seem to be relatively consistent. I think there will be a short-term uptick once we can access some of the boxes that were -- that have been ordered for us to pick up.

So maybe what we'll do is I'll answer the first bit in terms of the acquisition of employees because it's a really good point. And then I'll let Barry comment on the inflation that we see across our business, not just on labor. I will just say, inflation for us generally is our friend because we have such high -- 75% -- 70% to 75% gross margin business, but obviously -- and we're able to price pretty aggressively against that. So it generally creates a tailwind towards our margins. 
On accessing talent, look, it is -- luckily, we're blessed with a very strong culture. So if you look at our employees, and I'm referring mainly to our frontline employees who really are the heart and soul of the company. These are the people that you see our trucks out on the road or people see our folks coming into the facilities or the people to keep the lights on in our data centers. They are very long-term employees. Culture is very strong. And we have very low churn. For a service company and probably one of the lowest churns in the industry. So we're blessed that we don't have a lot of outflow of employees. 
That being said, the growth that we're seeing in a number of our service areas as well as our data center 
[Audio Gap] 
we haven't seen a situation where we haven't been able to grow with the demand, except for the backlog I mentioned because we just can't access facilities. And there has been some short-term blips that Barry called out in terms of -- we had to use some expedited labor in a couple of cases so that we could meet the demand. But generally, we feel that our culture has been our friend in terms of being able to acquire the necessary talent."

You'll recall, it was originally $125 million, and I've just increased it to $250 million. 
Most of that is already done, I might add, so you can put that in the model. I think from a standpoint of going forward, you are thinking about it the right way. We've got a large portfolio, and we see the opportunity to opportunistically continue to recycle a relatively small amount. Without giving forward guidance, we've historically said use something [indiscernible] both based on what's out there in terms of cap rates as well as what we need from a development pipeline. 
I will say that one of the benefits of our business is in light of the growth in EBITDA and the cash generation of our core business, which is just tremendous. We see the opportunity to continue to fund our development, both from internal growth of EBITDA and cash generation as well as the sort of modest recycling.

This morning, we reported record second quarter financial results with revenue of more than $1.1 billion and EBITDA of $406 million. This strong performance in both Q2 and the first half of the year reflects the breadth and depth of our products and solutions and the strength of our deep customer relationships.  
Our second quarter results especially reflect increased demand for our services across our key markets and is based upon these strong results and the increased momentum in the business that has caused us to increase the midpoint of our financial guidance, as well has increased the expected bookings in our data center business.  
As we celebrate and honor Iron Mountain's 70th anniversary this month, I am extremely proud of what our team has accomplished in growing our relationships with our large and diverse customer base in spite of the continued challenges due to COVID. Our Mountaineers across the globe have conquered every obstacle with tenacity in an innovative mindset, all with a focus on accelerating growth in services to assist our customers.  
Before we dive into our record results and the positive momentum in our business, I want to take a moment to reflect on the current situation with the pandemic and new variants still wreaking havoc in many parts of the world. In addition to operational complexities, we're also dealing with the realities of the workplace and a world changed forever by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Iron Mountain, we're thinking how we can move forward instead of getting back to normal, all whilst remaining diligent to ensure the physical and mental health as well as the overall safety of our teams, their families and our customers. 
As I mentioned earlier, this year, we celebrate 70 years of Iron Mountain. It's a legacy with a rich inspired past, which continues inspiring the future. Since that day on 24 August 1951, we have built, evolved and expanded our trusted relationship with our customers to include not just the leading storage platform of physical assets but now includes a rapidly increasing range of business services. These new services are centered around data center colocation, information security, data insights, IT asset disposition and business process management. 
And today, with this broadened portfolio of services and storage capabilities, we have become an innovative and global leader in our field with more than 225,000 customers, including more than 95% of the Fortune 1000, a global footprint of more than 1,450 facilities with a presence in 58 countries and 24,000 dedicated Mountaineers across the globe. And doing all this with -- in an energy sustainable way with 100% of our data centers powered by renewable energy. Many of the things about us have changed in 70 years. What hasn't changed is our core values and commitment to building and delivering on the trust our customers have come to count on. 
Over the last 2 quarters, we shared with you that we now have an expanded total addressable market, or TAM, of more than $80 billion. And against that expanded TAM, we've identified the building blocks for growth that will enable future growth and success. And in fact, you can already see evidence of this expansion through our year-on-year digital service revenue growth, together with secure IT asset disposition or ITAD. In this quarter versus a year ago, these business lines have grown over 37%, resulting in $25 million of incremental growth.  
I want to highlight a few examples which illustrate our progress in helping our customers through utilizing new technologically-enabled approaches and products to not only protect, but unlock value from what matters most to them. The first win I want to highlight is in Singapore with a multinational banking and financial services corporation. We won a $750,000 annual recurring revenue digital mailroom contract over their current service provider. 
At first, the bank didn't believe that Iron Mountain could solve this need for them as they had only known us to support their storage and scanning requirements. However, the account team pursued the opportunity and highlighted Iron Mountain's strength utilizing a new technologically-based approach, which allows us to assist in managing the very start of much of the information entering the bank while securely facilitating a hybrid office and home working model. As we are already this customer's partner for business process outsourcing and processing much of the bank's critical information, the mailroom is a key additional service, which will yield further security and simplicity for the bank.  
Turning to another area representing part of our expanded TAM, I want to touch briefly on Secure ITAD. Think of this as an area where we apply our highly secure chain of custody with a service that allows our customers to dispose securely in an environmentally responsible way their IT assets, which are at end of life. We have continued to see good momentum in our Secure ITAD solution following a number of big wins last quarter. We won a deal with one of the world's largest banks to recycle corporate laptops, monitors, and outdated IT equipment across over 400 corporate offices, 4,000 conference rooms and 5,000 retail offices, which we expect to generate annual run rate revenues greater than $5 million. This is a valuable offering given our expertise in chain of custody and compliance, helping customers securely dispose of their IT equipment.  
Turning to our data center business. We want to share not only our continued growth in top and bottom line, but some recent exciting developments in the last month which has led us to increase our guidance for expected 2021 leasing from 25 to 30 megawatts to over 30 megawatts, not including additional leasing expected from the recent acquisitions in Frankfurt and India.  
Our increased guidance around leasing activity is based upon the momentum we have seen in the business in the first half of the year as well as the pipeline. Today, we announced not only the 3.6 megawatts of new leases we signed in the second quarter, but also a 6-megawatt lease with a new logo to our platform that was signed post Q2 in Northern Virginia. Taken together, along with our strong results in Q1, we have recorded a total of 19 megawatts of new and expansion leases in the first 7 months of the year. This is a great launching off point for the remainder of the year, and we feel confident we will achieve leasing activity above the top end of our original guidance.  
Turning back to Q2, it should be noted, of the 3.6 megawatts we leased in the quarter, the majority was in the retail and enterprise segments. This resulted in attractive pricing for the quarter which increased 14% sequentially. Our strongest markets in terms of new and expansion leasing were Phoenix, Singapore and Northern Virginia.  
Finally, in terms of development you likely saw from our recent press releases, our data center business is expanding rapidly in Europe. We have a new 27-megawatt greenfield build in London, adjacent to our existing London-1 facility as well as the pending acquisition of a multi-tenant colocation data center in Frankfurt. Taken together, this will increase our total potential capacity in Europe to more than 88 megawatts and will provide access to important interconnection markets for new and existing customers looking for a reliable, flexible and secure data center location.  
As always, sustainability continues to be a top priority. And as part of our commitments, we will power our new buildings in London and Frankfurt with 100% renewable energy.  
Before I hand the call over, I also wish to touch upon some new product areas which are leading to more growth in our traditional storage areas. One of these newer product offerings is Clean Start, which is a service that helps customers navigate today's changing workplace requirements from reconfiguring the office for social distancing to office  closures or moving to a more digital way of working.  
Since its inception, the Clean Start product has generated over $19 million in revenue and has uncovered 1.1 million net new cube over a 3-year period. In 2020, we decided to expand Clean Start globally with all regions engaged in growing the program. Since taking the business globally, we have seen an acceleration in bookings. Specifically, in the first half of 2021, Clean Start has delivered $5 million of new revenue or some 25% of the total revenue from this program since its inception 3 years ago.  
A specific customer example in this quarter includes a $1.8 million deal with a leading global hotel chain over the next 5 years. Due to challenges from the pandemic, the customer needed solutions to help with compliance and storage of materials. This customer has been with Iron Mountain for years at an individual hotel level and its corporate team saw the value in our scale, breadth of offerings, compliance expertise in risk reduction solutions. This prompted their decision to deploy our services across 103 hotels, plus an additional 15 one-off sites as required. We were able to manage much more than just their record storage, also meeting the destruction needs and providing image on demand services, all of this being done company-wide at a scale unmatched by any other provider.  
Another example which showcases our innovative new products which drive record volume and services growth is Smart Sort. Our customers want to reduce cost and risk by defensively destroying records as they meet retention requirements, which is difficult to do if records are not stored by the destruction eligibility date.  
For example, many health care accounts store records by patient number or last date of visit and not by retention requirement. With Smart Sort, we organize the records by destruction date so the customer knows what they can destroy and when. Our team understood a pervasive customer problem, took a customer-centric approach and proactively came up with a solution to solve it with Smart Sort.  
Just in the last year, we've had 10 health care vertical wins for Smart Sort with our most recent win with Johns Hopkins Medical Center. The agreement is a 5-year term which includes a $1.2 million Smart Sort move project, bringing an additional 160,000 cubic feet of inventory, representing over 4 million individual patient records.  
Reflecting some of these successes, total global volume grew to a record 733 million cubic feet this quarter. In spite of organic volume being down 10 basis points in the second quarter versus the first quarter, total global organic volume was up 1.6 million cubic feet in the first half of the year, and we continue to expect organic volume to be flat to slightly up for the full year. This expected organic volume, together with continued strong price increases, sets us up well for continued strength in organic storage revenue growth from our physical business areas.  
In closing, I want to say thank you to the 24,000 Mountaineers who've done an outstanding job navigating through the pandemic. I'm extremely proud of their relentless dedication to each other and our customers. With a resilient business model, ongoing market share growth and strategic investments to transform the company, we are excited about the significant opportunities ahead of us, which continue to exceed even our ambitious targets.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

The second quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in s",1291,"Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us.  
The second quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in service revenue and activity levels. Our core physical storage business performed well, and we are seeing great progress in our growth areas. Reflecting that progress and the outperformance in the first half, we increased the midpoint of our financial guidance.  
Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion grew 14%. Total organic revenue increased 10%. Organic service revenue increased $81 million or 26%, and was ahead of our expectations. Our team drove strong growth in both our Global Digital Solutions business and Secure IT Asset Disposition. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.5% with continued benefit from pricing, together with positive trends in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $406 million. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team delivered better-than-expected Project Summit savings, together with the revenue beat.  
AFFO was $246 million or $0.85 on a per share basis. If you recall, last year's AFFO benefited from a $23 million tax refund. Adjusting for this, AFFO would have increased 8% year-over-year. As we mentioned on our prior earnings call, AFFO also reflects an increase in recurring CapEx as we catch up on some projects that were deferred during the pandemic. Our full year recurring CapEx guidance is unchanged.  
Turning to segment performance. In the second quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $993 million, an increase of $116 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 9.1%. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 1.9% or 1.6% on an organic basis. Growth was driven primarily by pricing and volume. We added about 4.5 million cubic feet from our acquisition in Indonesia, which closed during the quarter.  
Our traditional services business continued to recover from the pandemic with revenue growing 24% year-over-year and 4% from the first quarter. Our Global Digital Solutions business continued to display strong momentum, growing 24% year-over-year.  
Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $430 million, an increase of $47 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 50 basis points year-over-year as a result of mix given the strong service revenue growth. Sequentially, EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points due to Project Summit benefits and the contribution from pricing.  
Turning to our global data center business, where the team continues to perform exceptionally well. We booked 3.6 megawatts in the quarter, and through the first half, we have booked 12.6 megawatts. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we signed a 6-megawatt lease in Northern Virginia. Based on the year-to-date performance and the strength of our pipeline, we increased our full year leasing target to more than 30 megawatts, which would represent a 23% increase in bookings.  
In terms of revenue, as we projected, growth accelerated sharply to 15% year-over-year. We continue to plan for full year revenue growth in the range of low double digits to approaching mid teens. The combination of our strong prior year bookings and the team's leasing performance year-to-date provides high visibility.  
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.4% increased 60 basis points from the first quarter and was ahead of our expectations. As compared to our prior outlook, the improvement was driven primarily by timing related to the Frankfurt build-out we discussed last quarter, which has been modestly delayed. As a result, we now expect more of the work associated with that project to occur in the second half, which will result in a temporary impact on segment margins on the order of 3 points relative to the second quarter level.  
Turning to Project Summit, this quarter, the team delivered $42 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. With the strength of the team's performance year-to-date, we now expect year-on-year benefits from Summit to approach $160 million, with another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022.  
Total capital expenditures were $136 million, of which $100 million was growth and $36 million was recurring.  
Turning to capital recycling. As we have said before, we view the market for industrial assets as highly attractive as a means to supplement our growth capital. With that backdrop, in the second quarter, we upsized our recycling program and generated approximately $203 million of proceeds. Year-to-date, we have generated $215 million in proceeds compared to our previous guidance of $125 million. With our strong data center development pipeline, we are now expecting to generate full year proceeds of approximately $250 million.  
Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had approximately $2.1 billion of liquidity. We ended the quarter with net lease-adjusted leverage of 5.3x, slightly better than our projection and down from both last year and last quarter. This marks our lowest leverage level since year-end 2017.  
As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5x. For 2021, we expect to end the year within our target range and estimate we will exit the year at levels similar to the second quarter. 
With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October.  
Turning to our outlook. Today, we are pleased to increase the midpoint of our 2021 financial guidance. There are 3 factors driving the improved projections. First, operational performance in the second quarter was better than expected, and we have good momentum in our key growth areas. Second, we have identified additional benefits from Project Summit, primarily related to opportunities that our commercial team has been able to uncover. And third, we have acquired a small records management business in Morocco that will add about $5 million in revenue.  
Conversely, as compared to our prior guidance, there are 2 headwinds I would call out. First, we divested our Intellectual Property Management business in early June. Compared to our prior guidance, this represents a reduction of approximately $20 million of revenue and $15 million of EBITDA. Second, since May, the stronger U.S. dollar is more of a headwind by nearly $20 million for revenue and $7 million for EBITDA.  
For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue of $4.415 billion to $4.515 billion. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.6 billion to $1.635 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents growth of 8% and EBITDA growth of 10%. We now expect AFFO to be in the range of $970 million to $1.005 billion. And AFFO per share of $3.33 to $3.45. At the midpoint, this represents 11% and 10% growth, respectively.  
Our guidance assumes global organic physical volume will be flat to slightly positive versus last year. And with continued benefit from pricing, we anticipate low single-digit growth in total organic storage revenue. For services, we expect to maintain positive revenue growth through the remainder of the year.  
With the ongoing pandemic, we believe it is helpful to share our short-term expectations. For the third quarter, we expect revenue and EBITDA to both increase approximately $10 million sequentially from the second quarter levels. We expect AFFO to be slightly in excess of $250 million in the third quarter.

And as you pointed out, that was really driven by a lot of our new digital solutions, which was well north of 30% growth if you take ITAD and digital services combined. 
I think your question on the traditional service side is a good one because what we've seen actually is an increase in the backlog of incoming cube, which quite frankly, we haven't been able to get at in some countries because of continued rolling lockdowns or intermittent lockdowns. So we do expect, as some of the lockdowns get eased, that on the traditional service lines, that we know that there's a backlog of income in cube that we haven't been able to access the offices for. So I think there will be some in the medium term in that area. How big, it's hard to judge right now."

And can you just sort of map out the entire time line of when you would expect to realize the full amount of project savings over the next couple of years? 
And maybe related to that, the Project Summit savings, how does your increased investment into growth initiatives impact the flow-through of Project Summit savings in terms of margin expansion opportunity?"

The full program, we anticipate generating $375 million of benefit. You'll recall that last year, we generated about $165 million of benefit. And year-to-date, together with last year -- so program to date, we're at about $257 million of benefit. We will end the year with all of the run rate savings in the numbers. So we expect to be exiting the year at the full program benefit. 
That leaves about $50 million of year-on-year benefit next year. And so you should be penciling something about $70 million of incremental year-on-year benefit in the back half, probably split pretty equally this year with that $50 million remaining. So we feel great about the way the program is progressing. The team is executing well. 
You asked about investments. What you will see is we certainly did, as part of Summit, invest in certain areas like our commercial organization, innovation, our global strategic accounts organization, and you would see that in our SG&A expenses this year. If you look at our SG&A year-on-year, it's up -- excluding stock compensation expense, it's up about $16 million. And actually, more than all of that is in the commercial organization supporting growth. 
And so we -- both in the form of increasing that organization as well as some variable costs that go along with the great sales performance year-on-year like variable compensation expense.

As you know, the revenue is up considerable amount both year-on-year and sequentially. While the gross margin is a tick down, call it, 40 basis points, I'll note that, that is driven by the fact that revenue in that line outstripped our projections. 
As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, if you look at versus our projections last quarter, for the quarter, we beat revenue by about $25 million, round numbers. The vast majority of that was in services. So we certainly did to maintain customer service, and we did have some level of what I would consider like surge expenses related to servicing that uptick in demand. And I think you should expect that, that will even out as we move forward. The decline in gross margin is about $1 million. So it's not a tremendous amount. We feel good about the margins we're generating off the new product offerings, to Bill's point on our Global Digital Solutions and our Secure IT Asset Disposition, those are very nice margins. 
The other thing I'll note is our -- if you work through the numbers in our services area on EBITDA, the EBITDA margin in that business was actually up 100 basis points sequentially. And that was up 640 basis points year-on-year. So we feel good about the way our services are performing. Thanks for the question."

So on just a number of fronts, it's just a great -- it's a great customer win. And as you can see, our -- we keep expanding capacity in our Northern Virginia campus based on the pipeline that we see even beyond that. So really, congratulations to the team. 
I think in terms of the pricing, you noticed this month, we were up slightly. So we thought that was actually a good trend. I think, generally, what we -- we're blessed being, in that sense, a relatively newcomer to the data center space, so we don't have as many historical customers that were originally sold in at higher than what today market prices are. So most of our customers, because we've been growing very quickly over the last few years, are relatively new customers that are at what I would call new and -- the new pricing level. So we don't have as much pressure as some of our older peers that have had that. 
With the exception, we've called out the last few quarters from time to time when we did acquisitions. We knew we were acquiring some customers that had been with our acquired companies for a long time and that those were rolling up. So generally, we feel pretty good where we are on pricing. You noticed that this quarter, we were on the 3.6 megawatts. We were up quarter-on-quarter on pricing, and that was really more about mix that we were highly focused on colocation or retail and enterprise customers, which obviously come at higher pricing. So generally, we don't see a big change in the pricing on customers that we've acquired or brought into facilities that we've acquired."

So we don't see a big change in terms of the net volume trends in that part of the business. 
I do think that because of the shutdowns that I referred to earlier in a number of our countries, we have seen a significant increase in backlog, waiting for people to be able to get back to office to allow us access to bring that in. So that's positive. 
But if you just look overall in terms of our total physical storage business, we're really pleased with how that's coming out. Because if you look across the portfolio of our physical storage businesses, the first year -- the first half of the year, we're up organically in terms of volume. We expect the second half of the year in terms of our physical storage business to continue that trend. So overall, the year, we say flat to slightly up. But as I said, we're up slightly in the first half, and we expect the second half to look the same, and then we had the normal price increase on top. 
So we feel really good in terms of where we're sitting on the general trends, and the trends within each of those segments of our physical storage business seem to be relatively consistent. As I said, I think there will be a short-term uptick once we can access some of the boxes that were -- that have been ordered for us to pick up. But I think that's more to do with a one-off transition as we hopefully get out of COVID."

So maybe what we'll do is I'll answer the first bit in terms of the acquisition of employees because it's a really good point. And then I'll let Barry comment on the inflation that we see across our business, not just on labor. 
I will just say, inflation for us generally is our friend because we have such high -- 75% -- 70% to 75% gross margin business, but obviously -- and we're able to price pretty aggressively against that. So it generally creates a tailwind towards our margins. 
On accessing talent, look, it is -- luckily, we're blessed with a very strong culture. So if you look at our employees, and I'm referring mainly to our frontline employees who really are the heart and soul of the company. These are the people that you see our trucks out on the road or people see our folks coming into the facilities or these are the people to keep the lights on in our data centers. They are very long-term employees. Culture is very strong. And we have very low churn. For a service company, we have probably one of the lowest churns in the industry. So we're blessed that we don't have a lot of outflow of employees. 
That being said, the growth that we're seeing in a number of our service areas as well as our data center means that we are actively going out there and acquiring talent. And I'll be honest with you, it's tough sometimes, but our biggest reference are our current core employee growth. So we haven't seen a situation where we haven't been able to grow with the demand, except for the backlog I mentioned because we just can't access facilities. 
And there has been some short-term blips that Barry called out in terms of -- we had to use some expedited labor in a couple of cases so that we could meet the demand. But generally, we feel that our culture has been our friend in terms of being able to acquire the necessary talent."

We certainly continue to view the market for capital recycling on industrial assets as quite favorable.

You'll recall, it was originally $125 million, and I've just increased it to $250 million. 
Most of that is already done, I might add, so you can put that in the model. I think from a standpoint of going forward, you are thinking about it the right way. We've got a large portfolio, and we see the opportunity to opportunistically continue to recycle a relatively small amount. 
Without giving forward guidance, we've historically said use something in the order of $100 million a year, maybe even $125 million a year as a planning posture. Obviously, our recycling efforts are back in circumstances driven, both based on what's out there in terms of cap rates as well as what we need from a development pipeline. 
I will say that one of the benefits of our business is in light of the growth in EBITDA and the cash generation of our core business, which is just tremendous. We see the opportunity to continue to fund our development, both from internal growth of EBITDA and cash generation as well as the sort of modest recycling.

We are pleased to have delivered strong performance in the third quarter, reflecting our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model and the strength of our team. T",1680,"Thank you, Sarah, and thank you all for taking time to join us. We are pleased to have delivered strong performance in the third quarter, reflecting our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model and the strength of our team. This can be easily highlighted by our 7.4% total organic revenue growth. This strong overall organic revenue growth has been delivered by continued strength in our storage business as well as double-digit growth in our new and existing digital offerings, including data center, inside our digital transformation services and IT Asset Disposition, or ITAD. 
Throughout the pandemic, including the most recent challenges of the Delta variant, our mountaineers around the world have truly stepped up each and every day to put our customers first with a focus on growth. I am both proud and humbled by this incredibly talented and dedicated team and what we've been able to accomplish through such a challenging time. Today's results, including our strong organic revenue growth exceeding 7% is a direct result of their dedication in serving our customers in ways they need to keep their businesses growing.
We have a lot to cover today, so I'll start with a brief overview of our results and key business drivers. During the third quarter, we reported revenue of over $1.1 billion and EBITDA of $418 million, both of which are new record highs. Our results are fueled by increased demand for our services across key markets and continued positive momentum in the business. Our digital services and ITAD business continued to build on its prior performance and delivered almost 20% growth in the quarter. Today, we are proud to say that 95% of the Fortune 1000 are among the 225,000 of our loyal customer base.
We have a growing footprint of more than 1,460 facilities. And with our recent expansion in the Middle East, we are now present in 63 countries and we are supported by 25,000 mountaineers across the globe.
As we look ahead to future opportunities, there is no doubt the world has changed, but we're making the improvements to our business today to serve the changed needs of the world tomorrow. That is why we have built, evolved and expanded our trusted relationships with our customers as not only the leading storage platform of physical assets but also the business services partner to support data center colocation, information security, data insights, secure IT asset disposition and business process management.
With this focus, we have expanded our total addressable market to more than $80 billion. Together with our strong customer relationships, focus on innovation and 70-year heritage, we are operating from a unique position of strength.
Now let's turn to some of the exciting events during the quarter. You'll hear us talk a lot about customer centricity here at Iron Mountain. And when we help our customers not only protect their information, but also unlock new revenue opportunities as well as cost efficiencies. That's a big win for our customers and ultimately for us.
We were proud to be featured as one of the winners of Google's first-ever Google Cloud Customer Award for Financial Services for our work with a large financial institution. This is a great follow-on award from a couple of years ago when we won their machine learning artificial intelligence partner of the year. For this award, we leveraged our expertise in mortgage document processing to train machine learning models to automate document classification and data extraction and validation, deliver advanced exception management and unlock value for our customers. In line with our automation first mindset, we utilize Google's document understanding for AI algorithms in Iron Mountain's Insight platform to identify, classify, extract and validate loan data to support authenticity, accuracy and completeness.
As a result of our services, the customer has seen efficiency improvements, including a 25% post-closing cost reduction, increased scalability, a shortened cycle time and increased responsiveness to market demand among other enhancements. We are not only proud of our work with this financial services customer but are also dedicated to continuing to enrich our customers' ability to protect and preserve their high-value assets, and in turn, assist them with gaining market share in their businesses through higher end customer satisfaction.
I'm also pleased to report that Iron Mountain received the JPMorgan Chase Strategic Diverse Gold Supplier Award for our commitment to supplier diversity and the contributions of our very owned supplier diversity program. Together with our fellow gold suppliers, we have selectively agreed to increase spending with diverse owned businesses and have set ambitious goals over the next 3 years. As part of this, we are on track to achieve our goal of $63 million in supplier diversity spend by the end of 2021. This is not just about our diversity goals, but it is also about helping our customers like JPMorgan Chase and our fellow gold suppliers to drive improvements in supplier diversity, which we recognize is important for all communities in which we operate. By working together, we are having a far greater impact than any 1 company can achieve alone.
I would now like to highlight our recent win working together with General Dynamics. You will recall, we have been speaking for some time about the potential for our services inside the U.S. federal government. Whilst the transformation of the federal government has taken some time, we are seeing over the past year major growth in our business across a number of governmental agencies. This growth is due not only to the residents that our products are having with the government and assisting them on their own transformation paths, but also to the work our government team has done in partnership with the likes of General Dynamics. This partnership has already resulted in a 3-year Iron Mountain contract worth $23 million to help the Department of Veterans Affairs with their digital transformation in order to serve better our U.S. soldiers.
As part of this initial project, we're helping the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs digitally process an estimated 15 million official military personnel files. Through digital transformation, this agency is taking a proactive approach to provide greater access to personnel files as well as streamline the overall claims process in order to get veterans the benefits they deserve.
In addition to our successful with General Dynamics, I would like to highlight another win in our Global RIM segment. We've had a long-standing relationship with a major global financial institution for over 20 years and we have recently expanded our relationship with them by signing a new 10-year global contract in which they committed to renew and consolidate all global records and data management business with us. Through this work, along with our global scale, we won an additional 2-year contract for data restoration and migration services. We will provide the customer with clear detailed information from back uptakes spanning 11 years, which will help them make informed decisions around data deletion, retention and remediation. Ultimately, we will reduce and enhance data management and compliance.
Finally, turning to data center. We are well on track to exceeding our bookings target of 30 megawatts this year. In fact, through October, we stand at 24 megawatts. In addition to our continued growth in bookings this quarter, we closed on the acquisition of our new data center in Frankfurt. When we purchased the new Frankfurt data center, we inherited over 2 megawatts of existing clients, and we have expansion capacity of 8 megawatts for a total of over 10 megawatts on that site. Already in this quarter, we have signed 1.6 megawatts of new leases for this site and have a strong pipeline which should absorb the remaining capacity over the next 2 to 3 years.
I should also add that our first in purpose-built data center in Frankfurt is up and running in a tenant which leases the entire 27 megawatts is moving in this quarter. With this transaction in Frankfurt, we now have a total potential capacity in Europe of more than 107 megawatts, which provides access to important interconnection markets for new and existing customers looking for reliable, flexible and secure data center locations across the Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London markets.
Even with our rapid growth, sustainability remains at the core of how we offer data center capacity. Iron Mountain continues to source more than 100% of its energy used for data centers from renewable energy. Moreover, as we announced in April, we took a significant step forward in the development of enhanced solutions for purchasing renewable energy by entering into an agreement to track the hourly load. I'm proud to announce that this September, we were able to report on our performance for the first half of the year for our data centers in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey that are benefiting from this agreement.
Over the past several months, we have taken definitive steps towards a truly carbon-free energy supply, not just by offsetting our carbon footprint by purchasing and reselling renewables and but by matching renewable energy in the very grids in which we operate. We are the first company to join Google to adopt the 24/7 carbon-free energy goal, and we became a founding signatory to the new UN Clean Energy Compact being released at COP 26 this week. We can already publish 24/7 carbon-free energy performance at 3 of our campuses, becoming the first large colocation data center provider with this capability. We recognize that we are an important component of our clients' energy footprint, and we will continue to take every opportunity to minimize our environmental impact on their behalf.
The awards and successes I outlined today are just a few among the various wins Iron Mountain has achieved this quarter. As we continue to deliver accelerated growth at IRM in spite of the continued impact of COVID on some of our traditional service areas, I am confident that our resilient business model, expanded product portfolio, customer-first culture and strategic transformation will continue to deliver strong sales growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."
30292,1685440611,2424753,"Iron Mountain Incorporated, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Iron Mountain Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Bill. And thank you for joining us. The third quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in servi",893,"Thanks, Bill. And thank you for joining us. The third quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in service revenue, reflecting accelerating rates of growth driven by the new service offerings Bill discussed. Our core physical storage business performed well, and we are seeing continued strength in our growth areas.
Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.13 billion grew 9%. Total organic revenue increased 7.4% year-over-year. As an example of the momentum we are building on a 2-year basis, our organic revenue growth continued to accelerate in the quarter. Organic service revenue increased $61 million or 18%. Our team drove strong growth in both our global digital solutions business and secure IT asset disposition.
Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3%, with continued benefit from pricing and positive trends in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $418 million, an increase of $42 million from last year. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team drove improved margin performance despite the stronger U.S. dollar. AFFO was $263 million or $0.90 on a per share basis, up $47 million and $0.15, respectively, from the third quarter of last year.
Turning to segment performance. In the third quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $996 million, an increase of $74 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 6%. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 2.7% or 1.8% on an organic basis. This performance reflects an acceleration in growth as compared to the last few quarters.
Growth was driven by pricing and volume. With positive volume trends in the Mid-East deal that Bill mentioned, total physical volume achieved a new all-time record of 744 million cubic feet. We are pleased with the underlying trends and continue to expect total volume on an organic basis to be flat to modestly up for the full year. Our traditional services business continued to recover from the pandemic with revenue growing 14% year-over-year, albeit still down 4% from the levels achieved in 2019, reflecting the continued COVID impact. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $443 million, an increase of $49 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 180 basis points year-over-year as a result of strong operating leverage and improved service margins.
Turning to our global data center business. Our team booked 9 megawatts in the quarter. And through the end of the third quarter, we have booked 22 megawatts. With our strong and building pipeline and the additional contracts we've already signed this quarter, we are confident in our ability to exceed our full year guidance of 30 megawatts.
In terms of revenue, as we projected, growth accelerated sharply to 22% year-over-year. In light of our strong performance year-to-date and prior year bookings, we now expect full year revenue growth of at least mid-teens percent, exceeding our prior projections.
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% was consistent with the expectations we shared on our last call and driven by build-out services at our Frankfurt facility.
Turning to Project Summit. This quarter, the team delivered $38 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. We continue to expect year-on-year benefits from Summit of $160 million with another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022.
Total capital expenditures were $138 million, of which $100 million was growth and $38 million was recurring.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4x, slightly better than our projection. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5x. For 2021, we expect to exit the year at levels at or below the third quarter.
From a cash cycle perspective, I would like to highlight that our team drove a 2-day improvement from last year and specifically call out that our days sales outstanding are at the best level they've been at in several years.
With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January.
Turning to our outlook. With the ongoing pandemic and where we are in the year, I feel it will be helpful to provide our view explicitly for this quarter. We expect total revenue growth to be in the high single-digit percentage range year-over-year in the fourth quarter. For EBITDA, we expect percentage growth to be in the range of low double-digit to low teens year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We expect year-over-year AFFO growth in excess of 30% in the fourth quarter. As you may remember, last year, we had an elevated level of maintenance CapEx in the fourth quarter as we caught up from pandemic-driven delays. On a more normalized level of CapEx spend last year, this implies at least 20% growth on an AFFO in the fourth quarter of 2021.
In summary, our team is executing well. Our pipeline is growing and momentum continues to build across our business. Our addressable market continues to expand, and we feel confident in our ability to drive growth. We feel well positioned and look forward to updating you on our progress following the fourth quarter.
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

Can you outline what revenue growth opportunities you are positive about for Iron Mountain looking out the next few years?

And then I'll let Barry comment a little bit more on the nuts and bolts in terms of margin. So thanks for the question. I think, first, I think part of Project Summit, you've seen that show up in the record high EBITDA margin that we had this quarter. So thanks for the call out on that. And I think that's an ongoing benefit that we'll have. That EBITDA margin may move up and down depending on the product mix, and it comes to your product portfolio question. On the product portfolio, part of Summit that you haven't seen directly, in other words, it isn't in the margin, is we've also taken a lot of the benefit of Project Summit and reinvested in the business. So besides actually driving the margin improvement that we printed today, we've also invested -- reinvested in the business, and that's really what's driven that total addressable market going from $10 billion to $80 billion that we've highlighted in the last few quarters. And part of that $80 billion of new total addressable market is the almost 20% growth that we've seen in digital services, which is primarily our insight-driven digital platform together with IT asset disposal business, right? So those are some of the new areas that I think you are highlighting behind your question. So we actually see -- that business is growing strong double digits, right? And we see that continue. You take that on top of the growth and the continued acceleration in growth in our data center business, we say we're well on track to exceed our upgraded guidance last quarter of 30 megawatts of bookings for this year. Then I do -- we do expect to see continued levels of revenue growth like we've seen in the last few quarters because this growth that we've seen in the top line, whilst we've seen luckily some recovery in terms of our traditional service business, I think it's fair to say that we've seen an acceleration in terms of our revenue growth, that's really driven by the new product areas and less from what I would call a rebound from historically low activity due to coat.
I don't know, Barry, if you want to kind of comment a little bit on the margin?"

I would say, when we look at outlook and you look at where our margin has been recently where it's going to continue to go, we have very favorable trends in pricing. I think that you will continue to see at least the level of pricing activity going forward as we've seen here over the last year or so. Some macro trends there that are both positive for us, I think, on a pricing benefit. If you look at our data center business, the margin, as we talked about, has on a transitory basis, been a little bit lower than where we expect it to go over time, that business is obviously dealing with some fit-out on our Frankfurt facility, which is transitory here in the third and the fourth quarter. And as we move forward, we see that margin expanding. So that's obviously a very nice secular a tailwind to the business.
And then I would say, when you look at ongoing productivity, we continue to see that. So while Summit has been incredibly beneficial to the business, and we'll have more Summit benefit year-on-year next year, we certainly see the opportunity for additional productivity. The only other thing I would say is, as you know, since you follow the company well, we've had a couple of relatively large sale-leaseback transactions over the last 12 months. And while I expect to continue to do a relative amount of capital recycling, that's been a big headwind on a year-over-year basis. So if that comes down to a little more normalized level going forward, that's also a benefit."

So if you look at the 20% growth that we called out this quarter or just under 20% growth, that's all non-data center.

So if you look at the 20% growth that we called out this quarter or just under 20% growth, that's all non-data center. So that's the -- that is the -- what we call ITAD or IT Asset Disposal business, and we've won some recent large global contracts for that. mainly for corporates that are trying to make sure that they both manage the secure destruction of any information that happens to be on their devices or hardware as well as making sure that they can be managed in an environmentally friendly way. So that's one part of it.
And the other part of it is just the rapid growth that we've seen in adoption of our Insight platform and overall digitization of people's information. So that's everything from people taking advantage to say, okay, when they're retrieving documents on a very simple basis, is we want to actually retrieve them electronically through the Insight platform where they can assess those from a secure platform in the cloud to digital mailroom, which is beyond the typical mailroom employ the arbitrage model, again, allowing people to have a -- not only access to the information that comes through their mailroom, but to be able to operate in a hybrid work fashion. In other words, where people can work from home and the office and always have access to their information to even some, what I would call, larger, more complex deals. And I guess return from the Middle East about a month ago, where we're working with a government there and their national archives to help them digitize everything about the way the government works, right? And that's, again, using the Insight platform, but it's not just the Insight platform but auto classification of the documents to create metadata so that they can actually share the information digitally to the right people with the right security level in a way that can be managed for the long term.
So a multifaceted thing, but those are the areas that are really driving a lot of the top line growth that we see today and as well as our data center business. I mean, obviously, the data center business with the type of bookings that we have will continue to drive increasing levels of growth. I should -- but I should not miss out is the underlying growth of the more traditional side of the business, mostly driven by pricing, continues to chug along nicely."

And so I just want to ask you, what are some of the puts and takes that you might have seen on a sequential basis? Because I think you commented last quarter, expecting some volumes to come in that will up from COVID-19.

Thanks for the question. I'll try to unpack that for you. So you are right. We did close on the transaction in the Mid-East, which we think is a great platform for us to continue to grow in that region together with our existing business. And I will note that, that closed very late in the quarter and the second half of September. So really had almost no benefit to the quarter in terms of the financials, albeit it is in our cube as you note. So that didn't really help the sequential.
On the pricing, you might recall that at the beginning of the year and then again on the first quarter call, I mentioned that all of the pricing we had planned for was already set as of March or April. And so the sequential benefit on pricing was not much and we were planning for it. And then the other thing I'll call out as you think about storage sequentially is we did divest the software escrow business in June, second -- first part of June last quarter. And so the sequential move from the second to the third on storage, that was a completely storage business. So it's about $6 million or $7 million of sequential decline due to that being in the second quarter, but not in the third quarter.
So all in, we feel quite good. In fact, I'll be -- I'll tell you that the storage revenue performed better than we were planning on a sequential basis. And as it relates to the point about pent-up demand, you recall last quarter, we did note that, and that was in some of the economies, particularly in Asia, and I would say with the some of the coded and Delta variant and various other elements that occurred in some of those markets, we continue to have a pretty good sized backlog.

No, I appreciate the question. So 2 or 3 points that I'll cover in your question. I think the first bit is that I would say that for 2022 in terms of supply chain, we're pretty well covered just because of the lead time. But to your point is we have seen, I would say, 10 to 12 weeks increase in supply chain or lead time on some of the MEP and related equipment and even including steel in some markets. So I think to your point is we are seeing a lengthening of the supply chain. But I would say for 2022, we're well covered because that's already been in and committed contracts to actually do that build-out. And now we're already looking at 2023, and we're factoring in that extended lead time for some of that equipment in our planning. So the good news -- the bad news is that the lead times have increased. The good news is that we're well covered for 2022. So we've got the time to make sure we incorporate that in our planning for 2023. So that's, I would say, one aspect.
And in terms of the increase in the price, so we're pretty well hedged for the 2022 commitments that we have because those are contracts that we've already let. But we are seeing an increase in inflation in some of those raw materials. That being said, because this is a business where the cost of construction is well known and quite transparent to our customer base is we see trends and we expect that to continue that our pricing will go in line with the cost of build. So I think we're kind of naturally hedged given the transparency of these businesses.
In terms of the power cost is that -- again, we're pretty well covered for this year, but we have seen an uptick in pricing in pretty much all the markets, as you -- as everyone's noticed. And I would say that -- first part is, I would say, about 60% of our portfolio is in 2022 will be pretty much straight power pass-through. So we don't have any exposure in terms of the power cost.
The remainder is, most of that is still on long-term -- we've contracted to the power long term. So think of our business is north of 70% naturally hedged in the part that isn't -- is up for renewal during the course of 2022 or a big part of it is. So we don't really see power affecting us in any material way. And in fact, we see continued upward progression in terms of our EBITDA margins as we get into 2022. So -- but thanks for the question."

Thanks for the question. Why don't I help you with both the revenue and the EBITDA, the way we're thinking about it. So in the fourth quarter, you're right, we said about high single digits.

So in the fourth quarter, you're right, we said about high single digits. So let's say that's 8% or 9% on the revenue side. Just to give you a couple of the puts and takes, we have the dollar is stronger, so we have less than 1 point of FX benefit year-on-year and a similar amount from M&A less than 1 point because just as a reminder, as I mentioned to Shlomo, we divested that software escrow business in the second quarter and -- so as a result, it's not much M&A benefit. So that leaves you with about, call it, 7% of organic constant currency growth. And with the strength of the data center business, that will contribute probably 1.5 points alone because that business is performing very well. And so you should be working with your model and I think like 20-plus percent growth in the fourth quarter from our data center business.
The balance would be coming from low single-digit growth in our storage rental revenue, and that will be with good pricing contribution. Of course, the remainder is, as Bill has highlighted on the call, the very nice growth we're seeing out of our digital solutions and business. 
On the EBITDA stand side, we're looking at low double-digit to low -- sorry, mid-teens growth. So let's say that's 13-or-so percent just to keep the midpoint there. For the purpose of this discussion, that's about, call it, $48 million of year-on-year increase. FX is a very small contribution, almost nothing and M&A would be actually a net negative on a year-over-year basis. In light of the escrow business, it was a very high margin. And so think about data center as having a modest increase in margin sequentially, still affected by the fit-out in Frankfurt. So a few million of benefit to EBITDA from data center. Our Summit project is doing phenomenally well, and the team is executing very well. You'll probably see $30-plus million of year-on-year benefit in the quarter from that. And then, of course, pricing will continue to be a very strong contributor. And the services margin, I expect to continue to improve, which you've been seeing throughout the year. So naturally, there are some offsets with sale-leaseback, as I mentioned earlier, and higher levels of commission in light of the very good trajectory the team is driving on top line. So we're feeling very good about the fourth quarter as we sit here today and look forward to talking to you about it in 90 days. Thank you. Have a great day."

We are pleased to have delivered strong performance in the third quarter, reflecting our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model and the strength of our team. T",1678,"Thank you, Sarah, and thank you all for taking time to join us. We are pleased to have delivered strong performance in the third quarter, reflecting our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model and the strength of our team. This can be easily highlighted by our 7.4% total organic revenue growth. This strong overall organic revenue growth has been delivered by continued strength in our storage business as well as double-digit growth in our new and existing digital offerings, including data center, inside our digital transformation services and IT Asset Disposition, or ITAD.  
Throughout the pandemic, including the most recent challenges of the Delta variant, our mountaineers around the world have truly stepped up each and every day to put our customers first with a focus on growth. I am both proud and humbled by this incredibly talented and dedicated team and what we've been able to accomplish through such a challenging time. Today's results, including our strong organic revenue growth exceeding 7% is a direct result of their dedication in serving our customers in ways they need to keep their businesses growing. 
We have a lot to cover today, so I'll start with a brief overview of our results and key business drivers. During the third quarter, we reported revenue of over $1.1 billion and EBITDA of $418 million, both of which are new record highs. Our results are fueled by increased demand for our services across key markets and continued positive momentum in the business. Our digital services and ITAD business continued to build on it's prior performance and delivered almost 20% growth in the quarter. Today, we are proud to say that 95% of the Fortune 1000 are among the 225,000 of our loyal customer base. 
We have a growing footprint of more than 1,460 facilities. And with our recent expansion in the Middle East, we are now present in 63 countries and we are supported by 25,000 mountaineers across the globe. 
As we look ahead to future opportunities, there is no doubt the world has changed, but we're making the improvements to our business today to serve the changed needs of the world tomorrow. That is why we have built, evolved and expanded our trusted relationships with our customers as not only the leading storage platform of physical assets, but also the business services partner to support data center colocation, information security, data insights, secure IT asset disposition and business process management. 
With this focus, we have expanded our total addressable market to more than $80 billion. Together with our strong customer relationships, focus on innovation and 70-year heritage, we are operating from a unique position of strength. 
Now let's turn to some of the exciting events during the quarter. You'll hear us talk a lot about customer centricity here at Iron Mountain. And when we help our customers not only protect their information, but also unlock new revenue opportunities as well as cost efficiencies. That's a big win for our customers and ultimately for us. 
We were proud to be featured as one of the winners of Google's first-ever Google Cloud Customer Award for Financial Services for our work with a large financial institution. This is a great follow-on award from a couple of years ago when we won their machine learning artificial intelligence partner of the year. For this award, we leveraged our expertise in mortgage document processing to train machine learning models to automate document classification and data extraction and validation, deliver advanced exception management and unlock value for our customers. 
In line with our automation first mindset, we utilize Google's document understanding for AI algorithms in Iron Mountain's Insight platform to identify, classify, extract and validate loan data to support authenticity, accuracy and completeness. 
As a result of our services, the customer has seen efficiency improvements, including a 25% post-closing cost reduction, increased scalability, a shortened cycle time and increased responsiveness to market demand among other enhancements. We are not only proud of our work with this financial services customer, but are also dedicated to continuing to enrich our customers' ability to protect and preserve their high-value assets, and in turn, assist them with gaining market share in their businesses through higher end customer satisfaction. 
I'm also pleased to report that Iron Mountain received the JPMorgan Chase Strategic Diverse Gold Supplier Award for our commitment to supplier diversity and the contributions of our very owned supplier diversity program. Together with our fellow gold suppliers, we have selectively agreed to increase spending with diverse owned businesses and have set ambitious goals over the next 3 years. 
As part of this, we are on track to achieve our goal of $63 million in supplier diversity spend by the end of 2021. This is not just about our diversity goals, but it is also about helping our customers like JPMorgan Chase and our fellow gold suppliers to drive improvements in supplier diversity, which we recognize is important for all communities in which we operate. By working together, we are having a far greater impact than any 1 company can achieve alone. 
I would now like to highlight our recent win working together with General Dynamics. You will recall, we have been speaking for some time about the potential for our services inside the U.S. federal government. Whilst the transformation of the federal government has taken some time, we are seeing over the past year major growth in our business across a number of governmental agencies. 
This growth is due not only to the residents that our products are having with the government and assisting them on their own transformation paths, but also to the work our government team has done in partnership with the likes of General Dynamics. This partnership has already resulted in a 3-year Iron Mountain contract worth $23 million to help the Department of Veterans Affairs with their digital transformation in order to serve better our U.S. soldiers. 
As part of this initial project, we're helping the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs digitally process an estimated 15 million official military personnel files. Through digital transformation, this agency is taking a proactive approach to provide greater access to personnel files as well as streamline the overall claims process in order to get veterans the benefits they deserve. 
In addition to our successful with General Dynamics, I would like to highlight another win in our Global RIM segment. We've had a long-standing relationship with a major global financial institution for over 20 years and we have recently expanded our relationship with them by signing a new 10-year global contract in which they committed to renew and consolidate all global records and data management business with us. 
Through this work, along with our global scale, we won an additional 2-year contract for data restoration and migration services. We will provide the customer with clear detailed information from back uptakes spanning 11 years, which will help them make informed decisions around data deletion, retention and remediation. Ultimately, we will reduce and enhance data management and compliance. 
Finally, turning to data center. We are well on track to exceeding our bookings target of 30 megawatts this year. In fact, through October, we stand at 24 megawatts. In addition to our continued growth in bookings this quarter, we closed on the acquisition of our new data center in Frankfurt. When we purchased the new Frankfurt data center, we inherited over 2 megawatts of existing clients, and we have expansion capacity of 8 megawatts for a total of over 10 megawatts on that site. 
Already in this quarter, we have signed 1.6 megawatts of new leases for this site and have a strong pipeline which should absorb the remaining capacity over the next 2 to 3 years. 
I should also add that our first in purpose-built data center in Frankfurt is up and running in a tenant which leases the entire 27 megawatts is moving in this quarter. With this transaction in Frankfurt, we now have a total potential capacity in Europe of more than 107 megawatts, which provides access to important interconnection markets for new and existing customers looking for reliable, flexible and secure data center locations across the Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London markets. 
Even with our rapid growth, sustainability remains at the core of how we offer data center capacity. Iron Mountain continues to source more than 100% of its energy used for data centers from renewable energy. Moreover, as we announced in April, we took a significant step forward in the development of enhanced solutions for purchasing renewable energy by entering into an agreement to track the hourly load. I'm proud to announce that this September, we were able to report on our performance for the first half of the year for our data centers in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey that are benefiting from this agreement. 
Over the past several months, we have taken definitive steps towards a truly carbon-free energy supply, not just by offsetting our carbon footprint by purchasing and reselling renewables, but by matching renewable energy in the very grids in which we operate. We are the first company to join Google to adopt the 24/7 carbon-free energy goal, and we became a founding signatory to the new UN Clean Energy Compact being released at COP26 this week. We can already publish 24/7 carbon-free energy performance at 3 of our campuses, becoming the first large colocation data center provider with this capability. 
We recognize that we are an important component of our clients' energy footprint, and we will continue to take every opportunity to minimize our environmental impact on their behalf. 
The awards and successes I outlined today are just a few among the various wins Iron Mountain has achieved this quarter. As we continue to deliver accelerated growth at IRM in spite of the continued impact of COVID on some of our traditional service areas, I am confident that our resilient business model, expanded product portfolio, customer-first culture and strategic transformation will continue to deliver strong sales growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

And thank you for joining us. The third quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics.

The third quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in service revenue, reflecting accelerating rates of growth driven by the new service offerings Bill discussed. 
Our core physical storage business performed well, and we are seeing continued strength in our growth areas. 
Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.13 billion grew 9%. Total organic revenue increased 7.4% year-over-year. As an example of the momentum we are building on a 2-year basis, our organic revenue growth continued to accelerate in the quarter. Organic service revenue increased $61 million or 18%. Our team drove strong growth in both our global digital solutions business and secure IT asset disposition. 
Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3%, with continued benefit from pricing and positive trends in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $418 million, an increase of $42 million from last year. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team drove improved margin performance despite the stronger U.S. dollar. AFFO was $263 million or $0.90 on a per share basis, up $47 million and $0.15, respectively, from the third quarter of last year. 
Turning to segment performance. In the third quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $996 million, an increase of $74 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 6%. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 2.7% or 1.8% on an organic basis. This performance reflects an acceleration in growth as compared to the last few quarters. 
Growth was driven by pricing and volume. With positive volume trends in the Mid-East deal that Bill mentioned, total physical volume achieved a new all-time record of 744 million cubic feet. We are pleased with the underlying trends and continue to expect total volume on an organic basis to be flat to modestly up for the full year. Our traditional services business continued to recover from the pandemic with revenue growing 14% year-over-year, albeit still down 4% from the levels achieved in 2019, reflecting the continued COVID impact. 
Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $443 million, an increase of $49 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 180 basis points year-over-year as a result of strong operating leverage and improved service margins. 
Turning to our global data center business. Our team booked 9 megawatts in the quarter. And through the end of the third quarter, we have booked 22 megawatts. With our strong and building pipeline and the additional contracts we've already signed this quarter, we are confident in our ability to exceed our full year guidance of 30 megawatts. 
In terms of revenue, as we projected, growth accelerated sharply to 22% year-over-year. In light of our strong performance year-to-date and prior year bookings, we now expect full year revenue growth of at least mid-teens percent, exceeding our prior projections. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% was consistent with the expectations we shared on our last call, and driven by build-out services at our Frankfurt facility. 
Turning to Project Summit. This quarter, the team delivered $38 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. We continue to expect year-on-year benefits from Summit of $160 million with another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. 
Total capital expenditures were $138 million, of which $100 million was growth and $38 million was recurring. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4x, slightly better than our projection. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5x to 5.5x. For 2021, we expect to exit the year at levels at or below the third quarter. 
From a cash cycle perspective, I would like to highlight that our team drove a 2-day improvement from last year and specifically call out that our days sales outstanding are at the best level they've been at in several years. 
With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January. 
Turning to our outlook. With the ongoing pandemic and where we are in the year, I feel it will be helpful to provide our view explicitly for this quarter. We expect total revenue growth to be in the high single-digit percentage range year-over-year in the fourth quarter. 
For EBITDA, we expect percentage growth to be in the range of low double-digit to low teens year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We expect year-over-year AFFO growth in excess of 30% in the fourth quarter. As you may remember, last year, we had an elevated level of maintenance CapEx in the fourth quarter as we caught up from pandemic-driven delays. On a more normalized level of CapEx spend last year, this implies at least 20% growth on an AFFO in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
In summary, our team is executing well. Our pipeline is growing and momentum continues to build across our business. Our addressable market continues to expand, and we feel confident in our ability to drive growth. We feel well positioned and look forward to updating you on our progress following the fourth quarter. 
And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A."

And then I'll let Barry comment a little bit more on the nuts and bolts in terms of margin. So thanks for the question. I think, first, I think part of Project Summit, you've seen that show up in the record high EBITDA margin that we had this quarter. So thanks for the call out on that. And I think that's an ongoing benefit that we'll have. That EBITDA margin may move up and down depending on the product mix, and it comes to your product portfolio question. 
On the product portfolio, part of Summit that you haven't seen directly, in other words, it isn't in the margin, is we've also taken a lot of the benefit of Project Summit and reinvested in the business. So besides actually driving the margin improvement that we printed today, we've also invested -- reinvested in the business, and that's really what's driven that total addressable market going from $10 billion to $80 billion that we've highlighted in the last few quarters. 
And part of that $80 billion of new total addressable market is the almost 20% growth that we've seen in digital services, which is primarily our insight-driven digital platform together with IT asset disposal business, right? So those are some of the new areas that I think you are highlighting behind your question. So we actually see -- that business is growing strong double digits, right? And we see that continue. You take that on top of the growth and the continued acceleration in growth in our data center business, we say we're well on track to exceed our upgraded guidance last quarter of 30 megawatts of bookings for this year. 
Then I do -- we do expect to see continued levels of revenue growth like we've seen in the last few quarters because this growth that we've seen in the top line, whilst we've seen luckily some recovery in terms of our traditional service business, I think it's fair to say that we've seen an acceleration in terms of our revenue growth, that's really driven by the new product areas and less from what I would call a rebound from historically low activity due to COVID.
I don't know, Barry, if you want to kind of comment a little bit on the margin?"

I would say, when we look at outlook and you look at where our margin has been recently where it's going to continue to go, we have very favorable trends in pricing. I think that you will continue to see at least the level of pricing activity going forward as we've seen here over the last year or so. Some macro trends there that are both positive for us, I think, on a pricing benefit. 
If you look at our data center business, the margin, as we talked about, has on a transitory basis, been a little bit lower than where we expect it to go over time, that business is obviously dealing with some fit-out on our Frankfurt facility, which is transitory here in the third and the fourth quarter. And as we move forward, we see that margin expanding. So that's obviously a very nice secular a tailwind to the business.
And then I would say, when you look at ongoing productivity, we continue to see that. So while Summit has been incredibly beneficial to the business, and we'll have more Summit benefit year-on-year next year, we certainly see the opportunity for additional productivity. The only other thing I would say is, as you know, since you follow the company well, we've had a couple of relatively large sale-leaseback transactions over the last 12 months. And while I expect to continue to do a relative amount of capital recycling, that's been a big headwind on a year-over-year basis. So if that comes down to a little more normalized level going forward, that's also a benefit."

So if you look at the 20% growth that we called out this quarter or just under 20% growth, that's all non-data center.

So if you look at the 20% growth that we called out this quarter or just under 20% growth, that's all non-data center. So that's the -- that is the -- what we call ITAD or IT Asset Disposal business, and we've won some recent large global contracts for that, mainly for corporates that are trying to make sure that they both manage the secure destruction of any information that happens to be on their devices or hardware as well as making sure that they can be managed in an environmentally friendly way. So that's one part of it.
And the other part of it is just the rapid growth that we've seen in adoption of our Insight platform and overall digitization of people's information. So that's everything from people taking advantage to say, okay, when they're retrieving documents on a very simple basis, is we want to actually retrieve them electronically through the Insight platform where they can assess those from a secure platform in the cloud to digital mailroom, which is beyond the typical mailroom employ arbitrage model, again, allowing people to have a -- not only access to the information that comes through their mailroom, but to be able to operate in a hybrid work fashion. 
In other words, where people can work from home and the office and always have access to their information to even some, what I would call, larger, more complex deals. And I guess return from the Middle East about a month ago, where we're working with a government there and their national archives to help them digitize everything about the way the government works, right? And that's, again, using the Insight platform, but it's not just the Insight platform, but auto classification of the documents to create metadata so that they can actually share the information digitally to the right people with the right security level in a way that can be managed for the long term.
So a multifaceted thing, but those are the areas that are really driving a lot of the top line growth that we see today and as well as our data center business. I mean, obviously, the data center business with the type of bookings that we have will continue to drive increasing levels of growth. I should -- but I should not miss out is the underlying growth of the more traditional side of the business, mostly driven by pricing, continues to chug along nicely."

I wanted to ask a little bit about the storage business and some of the puts and takes that went through. It seems like there is some -- there was an acquisition, something added about 10 million cubic feet. You guys are getting pricing. There's some organic growth. When I go to the total revenue from adjusted storage when including the terminations and prominent withdrawal fees, it's really flattish sequentially. And so I just want to ask you, what are some of the puts and takes that you might have seen on a sequential basis? Because I think you commented last quarter, expecting some volumes to come in that will pent-up from COVID-19. And I'm just wondering how this is translating into revenue as you kind of build through the year?"

Thanks for the question. I'll try to unpack that for you. So you are right. We did close on the transaction in the Mid-East, which we think is a great platform for us to continue to grow in that region together with our existing business. And I will note that, that closed very late in the quarter and the second half of September. So really had almost no benefit to the quarter in terms of the financials, albeit it is in our cube as you note. So that didn't really help the sequential.
On the pricing, you might recall that at the beginning of the year and then again on the first quarter call, I mentioned that all of the pricing we had planned for was already set as of March or April. And so the sequential benefit on pricing was not much and we were planning for it. And then the other thing I'll call out as you think about storage sequentially is we did divest the software escrow business in June, second -- first part of June last quarter. And so the sequential move from the second to the third on storage, that was a completely storage business. So it's about $6 million or $7 million of sequential decline due to that being in the second quarter, but not in the third quarter.
So all in, we feel quite good. In fact, I'll be -- I'll tell you that the storage revenue performed better than we were planning on a sequential basis. And as it relates to the point about pent-up demand, you recall last quarter, we did note that, and that was in some of the economies, particularly in Asia, and I would say with the some of the COVID and Delta variant and various other elements that occurred in some of those markets, we continue to have a pretty good sized backlog.
Bill, anything you want to add?"

No, I appreciate the question. So 2 or 3 points that I'll cover in your question.

No, I appreciate the question. So 2 or 3 points that I'll cover in your question. I think the first bit is that I would say that for 2022 in terms of supply chain, we're pretty well covered just because of the lead time. But to your point is we have seen, I would say, 10 to 12 weeks increase in supply chain or lead time on some of the MEP and related equipment and even including steel in some markets. So I think to your point is we are seeing a lengthening of the supply chain. But I would say for 2022, we're well covered because that's already been in [ train ] and committed contracts to actually do that build-out. 
And now we're already looking at 2023, and we're factoring in that extended lead time for some of that equipment in our planning. So the good news -- the bad news is that the lead times have increased. The good news is that we're well covered for 2022. So we've got the time to make sure we incorporate that in our planning for 2023. So that's, I would say, one aspect.
And in terms of the increase in the price, so we're pretty well hedged for the 2022 commitments that we have because those are contracts that we've already let. But we are seeing an increase in inflation in some of those raw materials. That being said, because this is a business where the cost of construction is well known and quite transparent to our customer base is we see trends and we expect that to continue that our pricing will go in line with the cost of build. So I think we're kind of naturally hedged given the transparency of these businesses.
In terms of the power cost is that -- again, we're pretty well covered for this year, but we have seen an uptick in pricing in pretty much all the markets, as you -- as everyone's noticed. And I would say that -- first part is, I would say, about 60% of our portfolio is in 2022 will be pretty much straight power pass-through. So we don't have any exposure in terms of the power cost.
The remainder is, most of that is still on long-term -- we've contracted to the power long term. So think of our business is north of 70% naturally hedged in the part that isn't -- is up for renewal during the course of 2022 or a big part of it is. So we don't really see power affecting us in any material way. And in fact, we see continued upward progression in terms of our EBITDA margins as we get into 2022. So -- but thanks for the question."

So in the fourth quarter, you're right, we said about high single digits. So let's say that's 8% or 9% on the revenue side. Just to give you a couple of the puts and takes, we have the dollar is stronger, so we have less than 1 point of FX benefit year-on-year and a similar amount from M&A less than 1 point because just as a reminder, as I mentioned to Shlomo, we divested that software escrow business in the second quarter and -- so as a result, it's not much M&A benefit. So that leaves you with about, call it, 7% of organic constant currency growth. 
And with the strength of the data center business, that will contribute probably 1.5 points alone because that business is performing very well. And so you should be working with your model and I think like 20-plus percent growth in the fourth quarter from our data center business.
The balance would be coming from low single-digit growth in our storage rental revenue, and that will be with good pricing contribution. Of course, the remainder is, as Bill has highlighted on the call, the very nice growth we're seeing out of our digital solutions and SITAD business. 
On the EBITDA stand side, we're looking at low double-digit to low -- sorry, mid-teens growth. So let's say that's 13-or-so percent just to keep the midpoint there. For the purpose of this discussion, that's about, call it, $48 million of year-on-year increase. FX is a very small contribution, almost nothing and M&A would be actually a net negative on a year-over-year basis. In light of the escrow business, it was a very high margin. 
And so think about data center as having a modest increase in margin sequentially, still affected by the fit-out in Frankfurt. So a few million of benefit to EBITDA from data center. Our Summit project is doing phenomenally well, and the team is executing very well. You'll probably see $30-plus million of year-on-year benefit in the quarter from that. 
And then, of course, pricing will continue to be a very strong contributor. And the services margin, I expect to continue to improve, which you've been seeing throughout the year. So naturally, there are some offsets with sale-leaseback, as I mentioned earlier, and higher levels of commission in light of the very good trajectory the team is driving on top line. So we're feeling very good about the fourth quarter as we sit here today and look forward to talking to you about it in 90 days. Thank you. Have a great day."

We are pleased to have delivered strong performance in the third quarter, reflecting our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model and the strength of our team. T",1678,"Thank you, Sarah, and thank you all for taking time to join us. We are pleased to have delivered strong performance in the third quarter, reflecting our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model and the strength of our team. This can be easily highlighted by our 7.4% total organic revenue growth. This strong overall organic revenue growth has been delivered by continued strength in our storage business as well as double-digit growth in our new and existing digital offerings, including data center, inside our digital transformation services and IT Asset Disposition, or ITAD.  
Throughout the pandemic, including the most recent challenges of the Delta variant, our mountaineers around the world have truly stepped up each and every day to put our customers first with a focus on growth. I am both proud and humbled by this incredibly talented and dedicated team and what we've been able to accomplish through such a challenging time. Today's results, including our strong organic revenue growth exceeding 7% is a direct result of their dedication in serving our customers in ways they need to keep their businesses growing. 
We have a lot to cover today, so I'll start with a brief overview of our results and key business drivers. During the third quarter, we reported revenue of over $1.1 billion and EBITDA of $418 million, both of which are new record highs. Our results are fueled by increased demand for our services across key markets and continued positive momentum in the business. Our digital services and ITAD business continued to build on its prior performance and delivered almost 20% growth in the quarter. Today, we are proud to say that 95% of the Fortune 1000 are among the 225,000 of our loyal customer base. 
We have a growing footprint of more than 1,460 facilities. And with our recent expansion in the Middle East, we are now present in 63 countries and we are supported by 25,000 mountaineers across the globe. 
As we look ahead to future opportunities, there is no doubt the world has changed, but we're making the improvements to our business today to serve the changed needs of the world tomorrow. That is why we have built, evolved and expanded our trusted relationships with our customers as not only the leading storage platform of physical assets, but also the business services partner to support data center colocation, information security, data insights, secure IT asset disposition and business process management. 
With this focus, we have expanded our total addressable market to more than $80 billion. Together with our strong customer relationships, focus on innovation and 70-year heritage, we are operating from a unique position of strength. 
Now let's turn to some of the exciting events during the quarter. You'll hear us talk a lot about customer centricity here at Iron Mountain. And when we help our customers not only protect their information, but also unlock new revenue opportunities as well as cost efficiencies. That's a big win for our customers and ultimately for us. 
We were proud to be featured as one of the winners of Google's first-ever Google Cloud Customer Award for Financial Services for our work with a large financial institution. This is a great follow-on award from a couple of years ago when we won their machine learning artificial intelligence partner of the year. For this award, we leveraged our expertise in mortgage document processing to train machine learning models to automate document classification and data extraction and validation, deliver advanced exception management and unlock value for our customers. 
In line with our automation first mindset, we utilize Google's document understanding for AI algorithms in Iron Mountain's Insight platform to identify, classify, extract and validate loan data to support authenticity, accuracy and completeness. 
As a result of our services, the customer has seen efficiency improvements, including a 25% post-closing cost reduction, increased scalability, a shortened cycle time and increased responsiveness to market demand among other enhancements. We are not only proud of our work with this financial services customer, but are also dedicated to continuing to enrich our customers' ability to protect and preserve their high-value assets, and in turn, assist them with gaining market share in their businesses through higher end customer satisfaction. 
I'm also pleased to report that Iron Mountain received the JPMorgan Chase Strategic Diverse Gold Supplier Award for our commitment to supplier diversity and the contributions of our very owned supplier diversity program. Together with our fellow gold suppliers, we have selectively agreed to increase spending with diverse owned businesses and have set ambitious goals over the next 3 years. 
As part of this, we are on track to achieve our goal of $63 million in supplier diversity spend by the end of 2021. This is not just about our diversity goals, but it is also about helping our customers like JPMorgan Chase and our fellow gold suppliers to drive improvements in supplier diversity, which we recognize is important for all communities in which we operate. By working together, we are having a far greater impact than any 1 company can achieve alone. 
I would now like to highlight our recent win working together with General Dynamics. You will recall, we have been speaking for some time about the potential for our services inside the U.S. federal government. Whilst the transformation of the federal government has taken some time, we are seeing over the past year major growth in our business across a number of governmental agencies. 
This growth is due not only to the residents that our products are having with the government and assisting them on their own transformation paths, but also to the work our government team has done in partnership with the likes of General Dynamics. This partnership has already resulted in a 3-year Iron Mountain contract worth $23 million to help the Department of Veterans Affairs with their digital transformation in order to serve better our U.S. soldiers. 
As part of this initial project, we're helping the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs digitally process an estimated 15 million official military personnel files. Through digital transformation, this agency is taking a proactive approach to provide greater access to personnel files as well as streamline the overall claims process in order to get veterans the benefits they deserve. 
In addition to our successful with General Dynamics, I would like to highlight another win in our Global RIM segment. We've had a long-standing relationship with a major global financial institution for over 20 years and we have recently expanded our relationship with them by signing a new 10-year global contract in which they committed to renew and consolidate all global records and data management business with us. 
Through this work, along with our global scale, we won an additional 2-year contract for data restoration and migration services. We will provide the customer with clear detailed information from back uptakes spanning 11 years, which will help them make informed decisions around data deletion, retention and remediation. Ultimately, we will reduce and enhance data management and compliance. 
Finally, turning to data center. We are well on track to exceeding our bookings target of 30 megawatts this year. In fact, through October, we stand at 24 megawatts. In addition to our continued growth in bookings this quarter, we closed on the acquisition of our new data center in Frankfurt. When we purchased the new Frankfurt data center, we inherited over 2 megawatts of existing clients, and we have expansion capacity of 8 megawatts for a total of over 10 megawatts on that site. 
Already in this quarter, we have signed 1.6 megawatts of new leases for this site and have a strong pipeline which should absorb the remaining capacity over the next 2 to 3 years. 
I should also add that our first in purpose-built data center in Frankfurt is up and running in a tenant which leases the entire 27 megawatts is moving in this quarter. With this transaction in Frankfurt, we now have a total potential capacity in Europe of more than 107 megawatts, which provides access to important interconnection markets for new and existing customers looking for reliable, flexible and secure data center locations across the Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London markets. 
Even with our rapid growth, sustainability remains at the core of how we offer data center capacity. Iron Mountain continues to source more than 100% of its energy used for data centers from renewable energy. Moreover, as we announced in April, we took a significant step forward in the development of enhanced solutions for purchasing renewable energy by entering into an agreement to track the hourly load. I'm proud to announce that this September, we were able to report on our performance for the first half of the year for our data centers in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey that are benefiting from this agreement. 
Over the past several months, we have taken definitive steps towards a truly carbon-free energy supply, not just by offsetting our carbon footprint by purchasing and reselling renewables, but by matching renewable energy in the very grids in which we operate. We are the first company to join Google to adopt the 24/7 carbon-free energy goal, and we became a founding signatory to the new UN Clean Energy Compact being released at COP26 this week. We can already publish 24/7 carbon-free energy performance at 3 of our campuses, becoming the first large colocation data center provider with this capability. 
We recognize that we are an important component of our clients' energy footprint, and we will continue to take every opportunity to minimize our environmental impact on their behalf. 
The awards and successes I outlined today are just a few among the various wins Iron Mountain has achieved this quarter. As we continue to deliver accelerated growth at IRM in spite of the continued impact of COVID on some of our traditional service areas, I am confident that our resilient business model, expanded product portfolio, customer-first culture and strategic transformation will continue to deliver strong sales growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry."

And thank you for joining us. The third quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics.

The third quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in service revenue, reflecting accelerating rates of growth driven by the new service offerings Bill discussed. 
Our core physical storage business performed well, and we are seeing continued strength in our growth areas. 
Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.13 billion grew 9%. Total organic revenue increased 7.4% year-over-year. As an example of the momentum we are building on a 2-year basis, our organic revenue growth continued to accelerate in the quarter. Organic service revenue increased $61 million or 18%. Our team drove strong growth in both our global digital solutions business and secure IT asset disposition. 
Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3%, with continued benefit from pricing and positive trends in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $418 million, an increase of $42 million from last year. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team drove improved margin performance despite the stronger U.S. dollar. AFFO was $263 million or $0.90 on a per share basis, up $47 million and $0.15, respectively, from the third quarter of last year. 
Turning to segment performance. In the third quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $996 million, an increase of $74 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 6%. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 2.7% or 1.8% on an organic basis. This performance reflects an acceleration in growth as compared to the last few quarters. 
Growth was driven by pricing and volume. With positive volume trends in the Mid-East deal that Bill mentioned, total physical volume achieved a new all-time record of 744 million cubic feet. We are pleased with the underlying trends and continue to expect total volume on an organic basis to be flat to modestly up for the full year. Our traditional services business continued to recover from the pandemic with revenue growing 14% year-over-year, albeit still down 4% from the levels achieved in 2019, reflecting the continued COVID impact. 
Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $443 million, an increase of $49 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 180 basis points year-over-year as a result of strong operating leverage and improved service margins. 
Turning to our global data center business. Our team booked 9 megawatts in the quarter. And through the end of the third quarter, we have booked 22 megawatts. With our strong and building pipeline and the additional contracts we've already signed this quarter, we are confident in our ability to exceed our full year guidance of 30 megawatts. 
In terms of revenue, as we projected, growth accelerated sharply to 22% year-over-year. In light of our strong performance year-to-date and prior year bookings, we now expect full year revenue growth of at least mid-teens percent, exceeding our prior projections. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% was consistent with the expectations we shared on our last call, and driven by build-out services at our Frankfurt facility. 
Turning to Project Summit. This quarter, the team delivered $38 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. We continue to expect year-on-year benefits from Summit of $160 million with another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. 
Total capital expenditures were $138 million, of which $100 million was growth and $38 million was recurring. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4x, slightly better than our projection. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5x to 5.5x. For 2021, we expect to exit the year at levels at or below the third quarter. 
From a cash cycle perspective, I would like to highlight that our team drove a 2-day improvement from last year and specifically call out that our days sales outstanding are at the best level they've been at in several years. 
With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January. 
Turning to our outlook. With the ongoing pandemic and where we are in the year, I feel it will be helpful to provide our view explicitly for this quarter. We expect total revenue growth to be in the high single-digit percentage range year-over-year in the fourth quarter. 
For EBITDA, we expect percentage growth to be in the range of low double-digit to low teens year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We expect year-over-year AFFO growth in excess of 30% in the fourth quarter. As you may remember, last year, we had an elevated level of maintenance CapEx in the fourth quarter as we caught up from pandemic-driven delays. On a more normalized level of CapEx spend last year, this implies at least 20% growth on an AFFO in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
In summary, our team is executing well. Our pipeline is growing and momentum continues to build across our business. Our addressable market continues to expand, and we feel confident in our ability to drive growth. We feel well positioned and look forward to updating you on our progress following the fourth quarter.

Can you outline what revenue growth opportunities you are positive about for Iron Mountain looking out the next few years? And a related question to that is, can you although outline how you're able to effectively present such a broad offering of products to your customers when it appears there will be different context at the customers for storage versus data centers versus insight?"

And then I'll let Barry comment a little bit more on the nuts and bolts in terms of margin. So thanks for the question.

And then I'll let Barry comment a little bit more on the nuts and bolts in terms of margin. So thanks for the question. I think, first, I think part of Project Summit, you've seen that show up in the record high EBITDA margin that we had this quarter. So thanks for the call out on that. And I think that's an ongoing benefit that we'll have. That EBITDA margin may move up and down depending on the product mix, and it comes to your product portfolio question. 
On the product portfolio, part of Summit that you haven't seen directly, in other words, it isn't in the margin, is we've also taken a lot of the benefit of Project Summit and reinvested in the business. So besides actually driving the margin improvement that we printed today, we've also invested -- reinvested in the business, and that's really what's driven that total addressable market going from $10 billion to $80 billion that we've highlighted in the last few quarters. 
And part of that $80 billion of new total addressable market is the almost 20% growth that we've seen in digital services, which is primarily our insight-driven digital platform together with IT asset disposal business, right? So those are some of the new areas that I think you are highlighting behind your question. So we actually see -- that business is growing strong double digits, right? And we see that continue. You take that on top of the growth and the continued acceleration in growth in our data center business, we say we're well on track to exceed our upgraded guidance last quarter of 30 megawatts of bookings for this year. 
Then I do -- we do expect to see continued levels of revenue growth like we've seen in the last few quarters because this growth that we've seen in the top line, whilst we've seen luckily some recovery in terms of our traditional service business, I think it's fair to say that we've seen an acceleration in terms of our revenue growth, that's really driven by the new product areas and less from what I would call a rebound from historically low activity due to COVID.
I don't know, Barry, if you want to kind of comment a little bit on the margin?"

I would say, when we look at outlook and you look at where our margin has been recently where it's going to continue to go, we have very favorable trends in pricing.

I would say, when we look at outlook and you look at where our margin has been recently where it's going to continue to go, we have very favorable trends in pricing. I think that you will continue to see at least the level of pricing activity going forward as we've seen here over the last year or so. Some macro trends there that are both positive for us, I think, on a pricing benefit. 
If you look at our data center business, the margin, as we talked about, has on a transitory basis, been a little bit lower than where we expect it to go over time, that business is obviously dealing with some fit-out on our Frankfurt facility, which is transitory here in the third and the fourth quarter. And as we move forward, we see that margin expanding. So that's obviously a very nice secular a tailwind to the business.
And then I would say, when you look at ongoing productivity, we continue to see that. So while Summit has been incredibly beneficial to the business, and we'll have more Summit benefit year-on-year next year, we certainly see the opportunity for additional productivity. The only other thing I would say is, as you know, since you follow the company well, we've had a couple of relatively large sale-leaseback transactions over the last 12 months. And while I expect to continue to do a relative amount of capital recycling, that's been a big headwind on a year-over-year basis. So if that comes down to a little more normalized level going forward, that's also a benefit."

So if you look at the 20% growth that we called out this quarter or just under 20% growth, that's all non-data center.

So if you look at the 20% growth that we called out this quarter or just under 20% growth, that's all non-data center. So that's the -- that is the -- what we call ITAD or IT Asset Disposal business, and we've won some recent large global contracts for that, mainly for corporates that are trying to make sure that they both manage the secure destruction of any information that happens to be on their devices or hardware as well as making sure that they can be managed in an environmentally friendly way. So that's one part of it.
And the other part of it is just the rapid growth that we've seen in adoption of our Insight platform and overall digitization of people's information. So that's everything from people taking advantage to say, okay, when they're retrieving documents on a very simple basis, is we want to actually retrieve them electronically through the Insight platform where they can assess those from a secure platform in the cloud to digital mailroom, which is beyond the typical mailroom employ arbitrage model, again, allowing people to have a -- not only access to the information that comes through their mailroom, but to be able to operate in a hybrid work fashion. 
In other words, where people can work from home and the office and always have access to their information to even some, what I would call, larger, more complex deals. And I guess return from the Middle East about a month ago, where we're working with a government there and their national archives to help them digitize everything about the way the government works, right? And that's, again, using the Insight platform, but it's not just the Insight platform, but auto classification of the documents to create metadata so that they can actually share the information digitally to the right people with the right security level in a way that can be managed for the long term.
So a multifaceted thing, but those are the areas that are really driving a lot of the top line growth that we see today and as well as our data center business. I mean, obviously, the data center business with the type of bookings that we have will continue to drive increasing levels of growth. I should -- but I should not miss out is the underlying growth of the more traditional side of the business, mostly driven by pricing, continues to chug along nicely."

I wanted to ask a little bit about the storage business and some of the puts and takes that went through. It seems like there is some -- there was an acquisition, something added about 10 million cubic feet. You guys are getting pricing. There's some organic growth. When I go to the total revenue from adjusted storage when including the terminations and prominent withdrawal fees, it's really flattish sequentially. And so I just want to ask you, what are some of the puts and takes that you might have seen on a sequential basis? Because I think you commented last quarter, expecting some volumes to come in that will pent-up from COVID-19. And I'm just wondering how this is translating into revenue as you kind of build through the year?"

Thanks for the question. I'll try to unpack that for you. So you are right. We did close on the transaction in the Mid-East, which we think is a great platform for us to continue to grow in that region together with our existing business. And I will note that, that closed very late in the quarter and the second half of September. So really had almost no benefit to the quarter in terms of the financials, albeit it is in our cube as you note. So that didn't really help the sequential.
On the pricing, you might recall that at the beginning of the year and then again on the first quarter call, I mentioned that all of the pricing we had planned for was already set as of March or April. And so the sequential benefit on pricing was not much and we were planning for it. And then the other thing I'll call out as you think about storage sequentially is we did divest the software escrow business in June, second -- first part of June last quarter. And so the sequential move from the second to the third on storage, that was a completely storage business. So it's about $6 million or $7 million of sequential decline due to that being in the second quarter, but not in the third quarter.
So all in, we feel quite good. In fact, I'll be -- I'll tell you that the storage revenue performed better than we were planning on a sequential basis. And as it relates to the point about pent-up demand, you recall last quarter, we did note that, and that was in some of the economies, particularly in Asia, and I would say with the some of the COVID and Delta variant and various other elements that occurred in some of those markets, we continue to have a pretty good sized backlog.
Bill, anything you want to add?"

And then from a broader pricing perspective, do you think that this environment may be supportive of industry pricing moving upwards in the next couple of years as we work through all these challenges?"

No, I appreciate the question. So 2 or 3 points that I'll cover in your question.

No, I appreciate the question. So 2 or 3 points that I'll cover in your question. I think the first bit is that I would say that for 2022 in terms of supply chain, we're pretty well covered just because of the lead time. But to your point is we have seen, I would say, 10 to 12 weeks increase in supply chain or lead time on some of the MEP and related equipment and even including steel in some markets. So I think to your point is we are seeing a lengthening of the supply chain. But I would say for 2022, we're well covered because that's already been in [ train ] and committed contracts to actually do that build-out. 
And now we're already looking at 2023, and we're factoring in that extended lead time for some of that equipment in our planning. So the good news -- the bad news is that the lead times have increased. The good news is that we're well covered for 2022. So we've got the time to make sure we incorporate that in our planning for 2023. So that's, I would say, one aspect.
And in terms of the increase in the price, so we're pretty well hedged for the 2022 commitments that we have because those are contracts that we've already let. But we are seeing an increase in inflation in some of those raw materials. That being said, because this is a business where the cost of construction is well known and quite transparent to our customer base is we see trends and we expect that to continue that our pricing will go in line with the cost of build. So I think we're kind of naturally hedged given the transparency of these businesses.
In terms of the power cost is that -- again, we're pretty well covered for this year, but we have seen an uptick in pricing in pretty much all the markets, as you -- as everyone's noticed. And I would say that -- first part is, I would say, about 60% of our portfolio is in 2022 will be pretty much straight power pass-through. So we don't have any exposure in terms of the power cost.
The remainder is, most of that is still on long-term -- we've contracted to the power long term. So think of our business is north of 70% naturally hedged in the part that isn't -- is up for renewal during the course of 2022 or a big part of it is. So we don't really see power affecting us in any material way. And in fact, we see continued upward progression in terms of our EBITDA margins as we get into 2022. So -- but thanks for the question."

Thanks for the question. Why don't I help you with both the revenue and the EBITDA, the way we're thinking about it? So in the fourth quarter, you're right, we said about high single digits.

So in the fourth quarter, you're right, we said about high single digits. So let's say that's 8% or 9% on the revenue side. Just to give you a couple of the puts and takes, we have the dollar is stronger, so we have less than 1 point of FX benefit year-on-year and a similar amount from M&A less than 1 point because just as a reminder, as I mentioned to Shlomo, we divested that software escrow business in the second quarter and -- so as a result, it's not much M&A benefit. So that leaves you with about, call it, 7% of organic constant currency growth. 
And with the strength of the data center business, that will contribute probably 1.5 points alone because that business is performing very well. And so you should be working with your model and I think like 20-plus percent growth in the fourth quarter from our data center business.
The balance would be coming from low single-digit growth in our storage rental revenue, and that will be with good pricing contribution. Of course, the remainder is, as Bill has highlighted on the call, the very nice growth we're seeing out of our digital solutions and SITAD business. 
On the EBITDA stand side, we're looking at low double-digit to low -- sorry, mid-teens growth. So let's say that's 13-or-so percent just to keep the midpoint there. For the purpose of this discussion, that's about, call it, $48 million of year-on-year increase. FX is a very small contribution, almost nothing and M&A would be actually a net negative on a year-over-year basis. In light of the escrow business, it was a very high margin. 
And so think about data center as having a modest increase in margin sequentially, still affected by the fit-out in Frankfurt. So a few million of benefit to EBITDA from data center. Our Summit project is doing phenomenally well, and the team is executing very well. You'll probably see $30-plus million of year-on-year benefit in the quarter from that. 
And then, of course, pricing will continue to be a very strong contributor. And the services margin, I expect to continue to improve, which you've been seeing throughout the year. So naturally, there are some offsets with sale-leaseback, as I mentioned earlier, and higher levels of commission in light of the very good trajectory the team is driving on top line. So we're feeling very good about the fourth quarter as we sit here today and look forward to talking to you about it in 90 days. Thank you. Have a great day."
