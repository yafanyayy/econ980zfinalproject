As we look back on 2020, it is clearly not the year anyone predicted, but I'm very proud of how Live Nation has dug in and focused on turning this challenge into an opportunity to improve our business. I want",655,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As we look back on 2020, it is clearly not the year anyone predicted, but I'm very proud of how Live Nation has dug in and focused on turning this challenge into an opportunity to improve our business. I want to take a moment to thank our employees for their resilience and creativity and acknowledge all of those affected by COVID and the shutdown of live events. 
Over the last year, leaders across all of our business lines, concert ticket and sponsorship have been analyzing ways to improve their business. Some of the key initiatives include reorganizing to become more nimble while also reducing our cost structure by $200 million; building concert streaming and direct-to-consumer businesses to expand our revenue streams; advancing our technology initiatives globally while accelerating the shift to digital tickets to meet changing needs of fans, venues and artists; and reinforcing our balance sheet to endure this period while maintaining a strong position to build our business for the future and act on opportunities as we identify them, such as our recent acquisition of the streaming platform, Veeps; and continued pipeline to bolt-on acquisitions throughout the globe. 
So while this past year has been challenging to the company, our employees, fans, artists and so many others globally impacted by COVID, I've never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us. We continue to have a substantial tailwind in the live event industry as consumers, more than ever, are looking to spend on experiences. The supply-demand fundamentals of the concert business remains strong, with artists ready to get back on the road and fans eager to reconnect at events. All our data continues to show that there is substantial pent-up demand for concerts on the consumer demand side. 
The $2.4 trillion projected surplus in savings in the U.S. alone by June is a key indicator of consumer spending potential. At the same time, surveys demonstrate the high demand for concerts globally with 95% of fans likely to attend a show when restrictions are lifted. This is proven out fan behavior as well with 83% of fans continuing to hold on to their tickets with rescheduled shows. On the artist side, there's a broad desire to get back on stage to connect with their fans and provide economic support to their bands crew and hundreds of others employed each night putting on the show. 
Given the limited churn activity in 2020 and '21, the pipeline for 2022 is much stronger than usual, with almost twice as many major touring artists on cycle in 2022 than in a typical year, about 45 artists versus the usual 25. And there remains plenty of scheduling availability at arenas, amphitheaters and stadiums to accommodate these additional tours with over 2/3 of these venue nights unused by sporting events or major concerts in a typical year. 
It appears that the timing to release the pent-up supply and demand is now approaching. Vaccine distribution is accelerating, and declines in COVID cases throughout most of the world gives us even more confidence that a safe and meaningful return to shows will soon be possible. For both the U.S. and U.K., projections indicate that everyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get one by May or June, and Europe and most other markets following a few months later. 
Given the mass social and economic toll the lockdown has put on the public, we believe there will be strong momentum to reopen society swiftly as soon as vaccines are already available, and we believe outdoor activity will be the first to happen. 
So while the timing of return to live will continue to vary across global markets, every sign points to beginning safely in many countries sometime this summer and scaling further from there. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our financial results."

As we did for Q3, we've added some additional tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to on the call. For the fourth quarter, all the key costs and cash numbers are in line with or better than what we forecasted last quarter. As a result, we are confident that our actions taking to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. 
As part of this, we further reduced discretionary spending by another $50 million and closed 2020 with over $950 million in lower costs. We also reduced our cash usage by $1.65 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans, $150 million more than we were projecting last quarter. 
Looking at our Q4 AOI results. Our AOI loss for the quarter was $244 million, which consisted of $290 million in operational fixed costs and $46 million of contribution margin, which included $96 million contribution from operations, along with various onetime items. As we pointed out last quarter, this contribution margin from operations includes our sponsorship business, where we've been able to maintain close to 90% of the commitments that were in place at the end of February last year. Half of this sponsorship moved into 2021, while the portion we retained in 2020 was repurposed into other assets, including streaming concerts. 
Our Artist Management and Merchandise businesses also generated positive contribution margin in the quarter. 
Looking at free cash and liquidity. We ended the fourth quarter with $643 million in free cash, which increased to $1.1 billion in early January with our debt raise. This, along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, gives us $2 billion in readily available liquidity. Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $308 million or $103 million per month. We had $97 million per month average in operational burn, plus another $44 million per month of nonoperational cash costs, to get us to $142 million average per month in gross burn. And then we had $39 million per month in cash contribution margin, and ended up with a total effective cash burn of $103 million per month. 
Now ticket refunds. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window or windows was unchanged from the prior quarter at 17% through the end of Q4. For the tours that have gone through a second refund window, the refund levels were generally much lower for the second window as the casual fans requested their refunds during the first window. 
Festivals generally canceled their 2020 events. But for festivals where fans could retain their tickets for next year's show, 63% of fans are doing so. 
On deferred revenue, at the end of the fourth quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $1.5 billion versus the $1.4 billion we projected at the end of Q3, higher due to $100 million in ticket sales during the quarter. 
Finally, our 2021 outlook. We won't be giving a multi-quarter outlook given the uncertainty on specific timing and likely very timing for different markets around the world. For Q1, we will remain focused on our cash burn rate and particularly managing our total effective burn rate to ensure cash contribution margin growth outstrips any increases in our cost structure as we start to ramp back up. 
With that, let's open up the call for any questions for Michael, Kathy or me. Operator?"

So for right now, we still believe that we'll have enough open throughout the U.K., Australia, Canada, U.S. to keep what we have on the books and the amphitheater booked for now. We might have some certain states that might not be ready. But we have enough states, we think, and enough artists willing to play the open slots if we get to that level in the right markets. So right now, we think we have enough artists. And as long as these states open up to the right capacities, we can start mid-summer into southern U.S., we'd go all the way to November."

We're still not sure if this is a business or a feat",585,"Right. We look at it. Obviously, we have to solve 2 different problems. Live Nation looks to be in this space because we think, as I've said before, it's a great complement to our core physical product. We're still not sure if this is a business or a feature. But we think we've been streaming our live shows from Yahoo! Live to Twitter. We stream most of our festivals for many years on YouTube and other platforms. So streaming a festival or streaming a live show for a sponsor or for other platforms, we've been doing that a long time. This is just now an opportunity with Veeps to do some of that direct-to-consumer on the club shows, amphitheater, festival shows that we think we'll have that added capacity and demand that will help increase some of the revenue for the artist. So we think it's kind of like a T-shirt in the merchandise and a VIP platform. It's another incremental revenue stream to the current physical show. 
We think we have a unique advantage because we have the 30,000 physical shows. So when we're putting those on sale, just like today, we try to sell you an upgrade VIP package or a T-shirt for those that can't come to the show, or possibly even if you come to the show and you want some -- to look at some other camera angles on your phone, we think it's a good complement or an add-on to our physical show. 
Ticketmaster, just wanted to make sure this is a new product. Whether it's like festivals or clubs, we wanted to make sure that they had the capability to service events and clients coming to them saying, ""Hey, I have a virtual show going on sale. Can you ticket it for me since you have such a large database and then the scale and competency."" 
So we're proud that team in COVID was able to take some existing software and quickly ramp up and has been able to service many shows around the globe because that's kind of instantly a global product when you're putting a virtual show on sale. 
So we think Ticketmaster will probably be one of the leaders in that space. Most of the platforms or most of the live shows you've seen have come to Ticketmaster and said, ""We'd love you to ticket it. You have the capability and you have the marketing reach that we don't."" So that's been successful to date. 
Same business model. It's a service fee model. Most of the platforms you see out there are charging a service fee on the ticket, and that's what Ticketmaster is also doing. And that seems to be the accepted model to date. 
So we think it's another product in the channel of the portfolio that Ticketmaster can effectively deliver for the customer. 
How big of this segment this ultimately is in the end? I think it continual will be -- let's say it's been on YouTube. It's always been an interesting way for a customer to see some of a live show. History says that live show though, thanks to TikTok and Instagram, is not consumed in mass. Most people don't want to watch 2 hours of their favorite band. They want to find that 1 great shot on TikTok. 
So we're still not sure how big of a business a live show is, but it's something that is incremental to our core, so we'll be on it, same with Ticketmaster."

So we've been ramping up our 100-plus million customers, doubled it over the last few years, and we'll continue to grow those numbers. But we don't have to make $1 billion acquisitions to make any of that come to life. We were talking the 20 -- $20 million range is a lot of where we pick up a festival, a venue, a promoter that's accretive and in a key market for us. So we'll continue to be acquisitive on our theater, club, global business, any markets we think there's opportunities that arise given where the world sits today. So we will be aggressive on a bolt-on, continued consolidation path while we are able to, we think, '22 is a peak year, which lets us start taking a lot of free cash flow and start working towards delevering also. So we think we can accomplish both as we head over the years."

So we think we're close enough, though where we are with COVID and what all the governors in the states we're talking to, that there will be a clear outline to a 75% to 100% outdoor green light in '21.

As we look back on 2020, it is clearly not the year anyone predicted, but I'm very proud of how Live Nation has dug in and focused on turning this challenge into an opportunity to improve our business. I want",654,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As we look back on 2020, it is clearly not the year anyone predicted, but I'm very proud of how Live Nation has dug in and focused on turning this challenge into an opportunity to improve our business. I want to take a moment to thank our employees for their resilience and creativity and acknowledge all of those affected by COVID and the shutdown of live events.  
Over the last year, leaders across all of our business lines, Concerts, Ticketing and Sponsorship, have been analyzing ways to improve their business. Some of the key initiatives include reorganizing to become more nimble while also reducing our cost structure by $200 million; building concert streaming and direct-to-consumer businesses to expand our revenue streams; advancing our technology initiatives globally while accelerating the shift to digital tickets to meet changing needs of fans, venues and artists; and reinforcing our balance sheet to endure this period while maintaining a strong position to build our business for the future and act on opportunities as we identify them, such as our recent acquisition of the streaming platform, Veeps; and continued pipeline bolt-on acquisitions throughout the globe.  
So while this past year has been challenging for the company, our employees, fans, artists and so many others globally impacted by COVID, I've never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us.  
We continue to have a substantial tailwind in the live event industry as consumers, more than ever, are looking to spend on experiences. The supply-demand fundamentals of the concert business remains strong, with artists ready to get back on the road and fans eager to reconnect at events. All our data continues to show that there is substantial pent-up demand for concerts on the consumer demand side.  
The $2.4 trillion projected surplus in savings in the U.S. alone by June is a key indicator of consumer spending potential. At the same time, surveys demonstrate the high demand for concerts globally with 95% of fans likely to attend a show when restrictions are lifted. This is proving out in fan behavior as well with 83% of fans continuing to hold on to their tickets with rescheduled shows.  
On the artist side, there's a broad desire to get back on stage, to connect with their fans and provide economic support to their bands, crew and hundreds of others employed each night putting on the show.  
Given the limited touring activity in 2020 and '21, the pipeline for 2022 is much stronger than usual, with almost twice as many major touring artists on cycle in 2022 in a typical year, about 45 artists versus the usual 25. And there remains plenty of scheduling availability at arenas, amphitheaters and stadiums to accommodate these additional tours, with over 2/3 of these venue nights unused by sporting events or major concerts in a typical year.  
It appears that the timing to release the pent-up supply and demand is now approaching. Vaccine distribution is accelerating, and declines in COVID cases throughout most of the world gives us even more confidence that a safe and meaningful return to shows will soon be possible. For both the U.S. and U.K., projections indicate that everyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get one by May or June, and Europe and most other markets following a few months later.  
Given the mass social and economic toll the lockdown has put on the public, we believe there will be strong momentum to reopen society swiftly as soon as vaccines are readily available, and we believe outdoor activity will be the first to happen.  
So while the timing of return to live will continue to vary across global markets, every sign points to beginning safely in many countries sometime this summer and scaling further from there. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for more detail on our financial results."

As we did for Q3, we've added some additional tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to on the call.

As we did for Q3, we've added some additional tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to on the call. For the fourth quarter, all the key costs and cash numbers are in line with or better than what we forecasted last quarter. 
As a result, we are confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until the time is right to bring shows back. As part of this, we further reduced discretionary spending by another $50 million and closed 2020 with over $950 million in lower costs. We also reduced our cash usage by $1.65 billion relative to our pre-COVID plans, $150 million more than we were projecting last quarter. 
Looking at our Q4 AOI results. Our AOI loss for the quarter was $244 million, which consisted of $290 million in operational fixed costs and $46 million of contribution margin, which included $96 million contribution from operations along with various onetime items. As we pointed out last quarter, this contribution margin from operations includes our sponsorship business, where we've been able to maintain close to 90% of the commitments that were in place at the end of February last year. 
Half of this sponsorship moved into 2021, while the portion we retained in 2020 was repurposed in other assets, including streaming concerts. Our artist management and merchandise businesses also generated positive contribution margin in the quarter. 
Looking at free cash and liquidity. We ended the fourth quarter with $643 million in free cash, which increased to $1.1 billion in early January with our debt raise. This, along with over $950 million of available debt capacity, gives us $2 billion in readily available liquidity.  
Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $308 million or $103 million per month. We had $97 million per month average in operational burn plus another $44 million per month of nonoperational cash costs to get us to $142 million average per month in gross burn. And then we had $39 million per month in cash contribution margin and ended up with a total effective cash burn of $103 million per month.  
Now ticket refunds. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window or windows was unchanged from the prior quarter at 17% through the end of Q4. For the tours that have gone through a second refund window, the refund levels were generally much lower for the second window as the casual fans requested their refunds during the first window.  
Festivals generally canceled their 2020 events. But for festivals where fans could retain their tickets for next year's show, 63% of fans are doing so.  
On deferred revenue, at the end of the fourth quarter, deferred revenue for events in the next 12 months was $1.5 billion versus the $1.4 billion we projected at the end of Q3, higher due to $100 million in ticket sales during the quarter.  
Finally, our 2021 outlook. We won't be giving a multi-quarter outlook given the uncertainty on specific timing and likely varied timing for different markets around the world. For Q1, we will remain focused on our cash burn rate and particularly managing our total effective burn rate to ensure cash contribution margin growth outstrips any increases in our cost structure as we start to ramp back up. With that, let's open up the call for any questions for Michael, Kathy or me. Operator?"

So for right now, we still believe that we'll have enough open throughout the U.K., Australia, Canada, U.S., to keep what we have on the books and the amphitheater booked for now. 
We might have some certain states that might not be ready, but we have enough states, we think, and enough artists willing to play the open slots if we get to that level in the right markets. So right now, we think we have enough artists. And as long as these states open up to the right capacities, we can start mid-summer into Southern U.S. We could go all the way to November."

Live Nation looks to be in this space because we think, as I've said before, it's a great complement to our core physical product. We're still not sure if this is a business or a feature. But we think we've been streaming our live shows from Yahoo! Live to Twitter. We stream most of our festivals for many years on YouTube and other platforms. 
So streaming a festival or streaming a live show for a sponsor or for other platforms, we've been doing that a long time. This is just now an opportunity with Veeps to do some of that direct-to-consumer on the club shows, amphitheater, festival shows that we think will have that added capacity and demand that will help increase some of the revenue for the artist. So we think it's kind of like a T-shirt and merchandise in a VIP platform. It's another incremental revenue stream to the current physical show. 
We think we have a unique advantage because we have the sort of 30,000 physical shows. So when we're putting those on sale, just like today, we try to sell you an upgrade, VIP package or a T-shirt. For those that can't come to the show -- but possibly even if you come to the show and you want some -- to look at some other camera angles on your phone, we think it's a good complement or an add-on to our physical show. Ticketmaster just wanted to make sure this is a new product. 
Whether it's like festivals or clubs, we wanted to make sure that they had the capability to service events and clients coming to them saying, ""Hey, I have a virtual show going on sale. Can you ticket it for me since you have such a large database and the -- then the scale and competency?"" So we're proud that, that team in COVID was able to take some existing software and quickly ramp up and has been able to service many shows around the globe because that's kind of instantly a global product when you're putting a virtual show on sale. So we think Ticketmaster will probably be one of the leaders in that space. 
Most of the platforms or most of the live shows you've seen have come to Ticketmaster and said, ""We'd love you to ticket it. You have the capability, and you have the marketing reach that we don't."" So that's been successful to date. Same business model, it's a service fee model. Most of the platforms you see out there are charging a service fee on the ticket, and that's what Ticketmaster is also doing, and that seems to be the accepted model to date. So we think it's another product in the channel or their portfolio that Ticketmaster can effectively deliver for the customer. 
How big of this segment, this ultimately is in the end. I think it continue or will be -- --  once like it's been on YouTube, it's always been an interesting way for a customer to see some of a live show. History says that live show though, thanks to Tiktok and Instagram, is not consumed in mass. Most people don't want to watch 2 hours of their favorite band. They want to find that one great shot on Tiktok. So we're still not sure how big of a business a live show is, but it's something that is incremental to our course. So we'll be on it, same with Ticketmaster."

Ticketmaster's cost or, I guess, their revenue was about $1.5 billion in 2019. So if you apply a good chunk of the cost savings to that, you get mid-single-digit margin expansion from that cost savings off the bat. 
We expect that, over time, as we get even more efficient, more globalized than the Ticketmaster platform, there will be some additional savings. But as importantly, it will let us go into new markets faster. And also, when we add new capabilities in the U.S., those can be instantly rolled out worldwide. So we'll be able to drive revenue along with the reduced cost."

So we think we're close enough though where we are with COVID and with all the governors in the states we're talking to, that there will be a clear outline to a 75% to 100% outdoor green light in '21. So we think we're better off waiting for a high bar capacity moment in most of the states to ramp up and talk to the artists about getting paid properly.

When we spoke last in February, I was optimistic that we would soon be returning to live events. And since then, our confidence has increased for our key markets.

And since then, our confidence has increased for our key markets. 
In the U.S., over 40% of the population have received at least 1 vaccine dose, and most states are now fully or partially reopening with more restrictions being lifted daily. In the U.K., over 50% of the population has received at least 1 vaccine dose, and their reopening road map is tracking to plan. And although Europe remains a few months behind on vaccinations, they are progressing, and recent discussions about reopening to international visitors this summer are encouraging. Around the world, people are showing the need to get out and socialize once again, which reinforces our expectation that a return to concerts will be the logical progression as vaccines are readily available to everyone who wants one. This is generally already in the case in the U.S. where we are confidently planning our reopenings, particularly for outdoor shows. And we expect other major markets will follow this summer. 
Alongside these trends, we are seeing the effects of significant pent-up demand. The fans are buying tickets, and events are selling out faster than ever. In the U.S., Bonnaroo, Electric Daisy and Rolling Loud festivals all sold out in record times at full capacity. In the U.K., we have 11 festivals planned this summer, including our largest ones, Reading, Leeds and Parklife, where tickets are already sold out. New Zealand, the country's largest festival, Rhythm and Vines, quickly sold out. And as we get further clarity on reopening time lines, we are announcing more tours for late this summer, including Dave Matthews, Luke Bryan, Maroon 5 and others to come, showing artist's increasing confidence in performing this summer. Given the longer lead times associated with global arena and stadium tours, we expect these will start later this year and into 2022. 
As we've discussed, we are already seeing confirmed major tour dates for 2022, up double digits from the same time prepandemic. Many of these artists will have multiyear tours spend in the U.S., Europe and often Asia or Latin America, setting up for a strong multiyear growth run. 
Complementing our event pipeline, Ticketmaster continues to build its global client base to further accelerate its growth. This year, we have already added new clients representing over 5 million net new fee-bearing tickets, which we expect to grow further throughout the year as more venues prefer for 2022. And with Ticketmaster's client base increasingly shifting to digital ticketing, we continue to enhance our offering, ranging from upsell and improved advertising opportunities as well as blockchain and NFT ability at the Ticketmaster platform. 
Our brand partners remain engaged and are responding well to our reopening. And like our concert business, our sponsorship pipeline of committed activity for 2022 is up double digits for next year relative to where it was prepandemic. Like so many of you, I'm excited to go back to concerts over the next few months and even more excited to see what I expect to be a nonstop 2022 that continues roaring into '23 and beyond. 
With that, I will turn it over to Joe for more detail on our operating results."

As we have done over the past few quarters, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release to reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today. For the first quarter, all th",866,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. 
As we have done over the past few quarters, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release to reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today. 
For the first quarter, all the key costs and cash numbers improved relative to Q4 2020 and are at or better than what we expected at the start of the quarter. We remain confident that our actions taking to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until we bring shows back, which will begin to scale in key markets outdoor this summer. 
As we move toward reopening, we continue to balance strong costs and cash management. We're now making the necessary investments to grow the business. While we expect the second quarter to be our first year-on-year improvement since Q4 of 2019 and to also be generating positive AOI through the second half of the year, we still plan on reducing costs this year by $750 million and reducing cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to prepandemic plans. 
Looking at our Q1 AOI results. Our AOI loss for the quarter was $152 million, which consisted of $323 million in operational fixed costs and $171 million of contribution margin, which included $149 million from operations, along with various onetime items, including insurance recoveries. 
Ticketmaster's ticket sales began to pick up at the beginning of March, particularly in the U.S., with weekly ticket sale count significantly ramping as concert on sales have restarted, including the Bad Bunny on sale, which was the top Ticketmaster artist on sale day since 2018. As Michael noted, sales for our Live Nation festivals and concerts have been strong, demonstrating the tremendous pent-up demand for our shows, with many festivals selling out in record time and a number of tours substantially overperforming relative to their historical levels. 
And our artist management and merchandise businesses also grew their contribution margin relative to the fourth quarter of last year. In our artist management businesses, artists continue to generate revenue through nontrain activity, including publishing rights, while our merchandise business has grown its retail and e-commerce businesses. 
Looking at free cash and liquidity. We ended the first quarter with $1.1 billion in free cash compared to $643 million at the end of 2020, an increase of [ $462 ] million. Our free cash, along with [ $964 ] million of available debt capacity, gives us $2.1 billion in readily available liquidity, up from $1.6 billion at the end of 2020. Benefiting our free cash position, in January, we raised $417 million of net debt, and we had a $181 million timing benefit, largely associated with deferred revenue classification. 
Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $136 million or $45 million per month, which included $100 million per month of average operational burn, roughly in line with Q4, plus another $4 million per month of nonoperational cash costs to get us to $104 million average per month in gross burn. This gross burn includes the benefits we realized from the sale of a nonstrategic minority investment and timing on interest payments and severance costs. And in Q1, we had $59 million average cash contribution margin per month, roughly 50% higher CM than we averaged in Q4. 
Now on the other balance sheet items, ticket refunds. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window or windows was unchanged from the prior quarter at 17% through the end of Q1. For tours that have gone for a second refund window, the refund levels continue to generally be much lower for the second window as the casual fans requested their refunds during the first window. On our festivals where fans were able to retain their tickets for the next scheduled event, [ 65% ] of fans are doing so. 
On deferred revenue, at the end of the first quarter, event-related deferred revenue for shows that will play in the next 12 months was $1.5 billion, the same as at the end of Q4. Ticket sales in the first quarter were $200 million, but this was offset largely by a shift of deferred revenue from short term to long term for shows that were rescheduled into 2022. This long-term deferred revenue will then largely shift back to short term during Q2 and Q3, reversing the timing benefit in free cash this quarter. 
Finally, looking forward, as Michael said, we continue to expect concerts to scale this summer in key markets, notably outdoor, and led by the U.S. and U.K. Given this expected activity through Q2, we will continue to ramp up our operations, enabling Ticketmaster to run its own sales, the concerts division to staff up for the amphitheater and festival season, and sponsorship staff to support delivery for brands of these events. Between this ramp-up and the reversion of some of the Q1 timing benefits, we expect the average monthly net burn for the first half of 2021 to be roughly in line with Q4 of last year. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Michael."

Now we're just starting through what makes sense to go out in '20 -- at the end of '21 still into '22 and some artists, we're talking about moving into '23. So I would say the artists are patient, and they're smart in terms of what their cycle is predicting. Maybe they have a record coming out in the fall, maybe it's in Q1. So right now, we have great supply. We don't have any issues in terms of availability, but we're also not looking to cram everything in 3 years into 1 year. We're looking to stage a good '22 into '23 year. So when you spread it over those 2 years, you find enough Fridays and enough weekends and enough [ rooting ] challenges come to be solved that way."

So that gives us -- that makes it more real, if you will. 
We've done a number of things. On the ticketing side, we've talked about -- we've shifted that to a truly global organization as part of moving to a true single approach on the marketplace, on the enterprise and on all the technology. On the concert side, we have a long-standing local network, which is very important to continue to understand the markets. But with 80% of your shows now booked via tours, you don't need to have an entire infrastructure in every local market. So we've been seeing that there are ways of streamlining it. And when we were growing double digits every year through most of the last decade, it wasn't worth the potential disruption. But as we've stopped, we've asked ourselves what's the best way to do this rebuilding from the ground up, and we're very confident it's going to deliver those savings and be an even more effective organization for driving future growth."

So a bunch of exciting ideas, now finally had months and months to put some people around and some skill set that we've acquired to advance that part of our business.

We get asked it every day, and I read a new article every day on all the great things it's going to solve. So let's step back. I mean, blockchain, we think it's a very exciting technology. We're currently using blockchain technology in our products, been invested in this business for a few years now, and we think it's a great technology that will help our business. 
I would step back from what are the problems that we're trying to solve or what are the opportunities that the blockchain specifically brings to the ticketing business. One of the great advantages in the industry is when we went from a PDF to a digital ticket, we unlocked a lot of what you keep reading about the blockchain is going to do in the future. So the digital ticket or your mobile ticket that you're now buying has solved the biggest problem that unlocked, we've been talking about this for 2 years, identity. Identity for us, the fan, the artist, the team and the venue, knowing who sits on that seat, who's actually coming to the venue, having a communication directly with them, having a verified ticket, being able to trade that ticket, putting rules on that ticket, you currently do that now. If you want to -- can you transfer it? Can you transfer it with a certain cap, all of those things that content could decide to do if they wanted to with a digital ticket. 
And the service fee, I read about being reduced. I mean, the service fee could be reduced tomorrow. It's just a function of the venue. Not the ticket company. So digital ticket and moving from the old PDF model that historically ran the industry has been achieved to date. We've been talking the last couple of years about the progression of adoption. COVID obviously has really sped that up. Most ticket access now does not want to be in the contact business. So having a ticket on your mobile phone, walking into that venue and then being able to buy a drink, communicate with each other, upsell, you name the ideas that when you have a direct communication with your fan, those are all being unlocked right now by sports teams, venues and artists. So we think the blockchain technology is a great part of a technology solution to keep providing a better communication and identity platform for the fan, but that's already in place. There's nothing blockchain would bring to that, that we can't [indiscernible] have currently achieved. So we'll continue to lose blockchain to supplement and augment our platform and continue to look to be better at it. And we'll -- we think the great opportunity in ticketing is just getting this full access. 
I would step back, and Brandon, you and I have talked about this before in terms of what does the ticket company do? I mean, quite honestly, selling the ticket is the easiest part of being a ticketing company. When we talk to clients, they don't pick us because we can sell a ticket. They pick us because we have marketing and distribution reach. They pick us because we have one of the largest marketplaces in the world to help them sell tickets. They pick us because we have a secure, great technology platform that can plug and play with their APIs and their databases and their consumer needs. And they also pick us because it's a financing mechanism. A ticketing business is about financing the venues, and it's exchanging that for ticketing rights. So it's a full bundle to be a ticketing company, and that's what Ticketmaster has delivered so successfully for so many years, and we'll continue to think -- lead with blockchain and bringing identity and all of the transparency and benefit but now having that ticket with an ownership to market."

NFTs are just another way of saying can I add value to the customer relationship? Can I put a contract or privileges on that ticket for the customer? And that's a great mechanism, and it's a great vehicle. I mean, whether we sell a T-shirt to that customer coming into a concert or we sell them a PDF with a unique piece of artwork or concert moment, it's another mechanism to engage your customer, find unique products that will let those magic memories of that event live on. So macro level, we're always in the business of figuring out what else can we add to that experience that the customer would engage in to kind of cement that magic moment called the concert. So NFTs specifically. On Ticketmaster side, they're working already with sports teams and festivals and everyone else about how they would -- how they can layer an NFT on a ticket. You can mint a ticket and mint an NFT right on top of a Ticketmaster platform and deliver it how you want. So that's -- Ticketmaster will be in the delivery business using their ticket -- digital ticket, blockchain. And then as the customer creates its own NFT, we can sell those and bridge those together on whatever minting system and or marketplace they use. 
On the Live Nation side, we're deep in exploration. We have a great team that's been working on this and working with the [indiscernible] of the world and others who are smart in this space. And I think you'll see us come out with an interesting Live Nation concert NFT angle. We think it's a great way for us to engage with our fans using that NFT and that direct relationship now to add rewards, add perks, add souvenir moments. We've all learned from top shops at the NBA. So we envision Live Nation with the marketplace and looking at some of its concert moments as magic moments that we could mint and attach to our ongoing ticket festivals in special moments. So we think it's -- if you have IP, we think it's an exciting time to use that IP to create some exciting moments with fans that can trade it ongoing and live that moment and kind of cement that relationship they have with that July [ 16th ] first concert back at Jones Beach, and I got an NFT and a special souvenir ticket that's mine forever. I can trade it. I can put it in my wallet and own that moment forever. So we think it's a fabulous moment to take a boring PDF and turn it into a magic souvenir with unlimited ideas on how you can bring that to life for the fan. So we think it's an exciting time. We think we'll be able to use our scalable IP to launch our own ways to engage with the fan in this space as well as empowering our artists through our management company that we've been doing to date."

It's another set of distribution platforms of getting tickets in the hands of fans. For all the reasons Michael talked about in terms of digital ticketing and identity, we think that more and more of the control over secondary will go to content, the sports teams and the artists as they have a wide set of agendas in terms of what they'd like to accomplish and how they'd like to have the relationship with their fans. So we think there's some evolution as it goes to digital ticketing, and we absolutely support the content, having more control over how that happens. We support there being more transparency in secondary, but we think it's here to stay, and it will continue to be an important distribution platform. We'll continue to focus on pricing to get as much of the value of those tickets in the hands of fans as we can. 
And I think as we look at Vivid, they've all got a similar business model, right? It's all a service fee business model. They've got customer acquisition costs associated with a lot of search in digital, and we have more customer acquisition costs associated with alignment with content, but it's a similar at the end of the day business model. We think we've got a great proposition by aligning with content and by also leveraging the scale of our Ticketmaster platform. So we like the position we're in.

So I really -- we look at that as a bit of a [indiscernible]. They seem to be -- obviously, scalpers are doing a good job of convincing his staff that we are going to do a digital ticket in a closed platform. So that's the great fear that we're going to have a digital ticket, and we're going to tell you when you buy that ticket, you can only you can only resell it at Ticketmaster. That's never been our intent. So their kind of their main claim [indiscernible] to make sure if they would sit down with us, we'd explain it's never been our intent to have a closed platform. We've actually -- the biggest thing I've done that Ticketmaster has taken over is rebuild this company so we can have an open platform. 
Our goal is to sell that first ticket. But as we did with the NFL last year, we have an open platform with the NFL. We power the NFL. And if those secondary companies are approved by the NFL, then that ticket you buy for the NFL can be freely sold on any other platform and used to get in the show. So that's we think is the best model. We think we have the largest kind of footprint from a primary platform. We believe that if the ticket is to be resold, we have a great marketplace for that, for the Ticketmaster fan, but we're also working and been working towards an open platform that it can be sold in other places with the content like the NFL or venues want that path forward. 
So not sure there's much meat to the claim. We're not looking to limit distribution. We're looking to increase distribution for the teams, venues and artists. And the best platforms will win in the end that offer the best value to the content and the fan. So that's our plan. 
We think we have an incredible opportunity in ticketing in that the amount of people that buy at Ticketmaster and actually resell their ticket is very, very low. So we think we have a natural huge audience that we should do a better job of allowing you, the fan, if you just bought to think about how you can resell on our platform. And maybe there's better incentives we can do for you as a fan to make that even more seamless. But if you want to sell on other platforms as we do on the NFL, then we'll be happy to validate that ticket and let the content decide where it's sold."

So a good start to that business. But now you're going to see with our new clubs -- we do 10,000 club shows. So you start digging into that a little bit, adding some amphitheaters. And the part we think is really exciting is our festivals, opening up that model that in Lollapalooza, instead of just rebroadcasting that for free, what if for $49, you could watch the Lollapalooza weekend or you could buy the Lollapalooza Day at home and continue your party at home if you couldn't make it to the venue. So we've seen great success in our EDM business. [ Pascal's ] blown the numbers up on his business when he does that. So we think extending the festival, which is a bit of a party at home model, it's got great opportunity.

So we're going to test that this summer, and we think we'll get some learning, and that'll help us move forward in that place.

You always get that question on who's the next Rolling Stones. And our data will continually show that, that young artist is capable of selling out stadiums and arenas very fast. I mean, Bad Money just went on sale and sold out arenas very fast, huge Latino star. So we're just seeing pockets of strengths coming from young artists every day. Billie Eilish is selling out instantly. So we see young artists regenerating the supply side. We see new 14-year-olds going crazy for BTS all around the globe. That's a part, to me, is what I look at is, is it still as important to a 14-year-old to see from the Beatles to NSYNC to Backstreet to Britney Spears to BTSs of today, right? So they seem to be -- my 10-year-old is excited about concept as I was when I was 10 or even more, I guess, where he's based. But we see a great, young, vibrant supply/demand in the business. To me, that's what you want to model. And over time, is it still as important to a 15-year-old of today and a 20-year-old of today as it was 10 and 20 years ago."

And since then, our confidence has increased for our key markets. 
In the U.S., over 40% of the population have received at least 1 vaccine dose, and most states are now fully or partially reopening with more restrictions being lifted daily. In the U.K., over 50% of the population has received at least 1 vaccine dose, and their reopening road map is tracking to plan. And although Europe remains a few months behind on vaccinations, they are progressing, and recent discussions about reopening to international visitors this summer are encouraging. 
Around the world, people are showing the need to get out and socialize once again, which reinforces our expectation that a return to concerts will be the logical progression as vaccines are readily available to everyone who wants one. This is generally already in the case in the U.S. where we are confidently planning our reopenings, particularly for outdoor shows. And we expect other major markets will follow this summer. 
Alongside these trends, we are seeing the effects of significant pent-up demand. The fans are buying tickets, and events are selling out faster than ever. In the U.S., Bonnaroo, Electric Daisy and Rolling Loud festivals all sold out in record times at full capacity. In the U.K., we have 11 festivals planned this summer, including our largest ones, Reading, Leeds and Parklife, where tickets are already sold out. New Zealand, the country's largest festival, Rhythm and Vines, quickly sold out. And as we get further clarity on reopening time lines, we are announcing more tours for late this summer, including Dave Matthews, Luke Bryan, Maroon 5 and others to come, showing artists' increasing confidence in performing this summer. 
Given the longer lead times associated with global arena and stadium tours, we expect these will start later this year and into 2022. As we've discussed, we are already seeing confirmed major tour dates for 2022, up double digits from the same time prepandemic. Many of these artists will have multiyear tours spanning in the U.S., Europe and often Asia or Latin America, setting up for a strong multiyear growth run. 
Complementing our event pipeline, Ticketmaster continues to build its global client base to further accelerate its growth. This year, we have already added new clients representing over 5 million net new fee-bearing tickets, which we expect to grow further throughout the year as more venues prefer for 2022. And with Ticketmaster's client base increasingly shifting to digital ticketing, we continue to enhance our offering, ranging from upsell and improved advertising opportunities as well as blockchain and NFT ability at the Ticketmaster platform. 
Our brand partners remain engaged and are responding well to our reopening. And like our concert business, our sponsorship pipeline of committed activity for 2022 is up double digits for next year relative to where it was prepandemic. Like so many of you, I'm excited to go back to concerts over the next few months and even more excited to see what I expect to be a nonstop 2022 that continues roaring into '23 and beyond. 
With that, I will turn it over to Joe for more detail on our operating results."

As we have done over the past few quarters, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release to reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today. For the first quarter, all th",860,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. 
As we have done over the past few quarters, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release to reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today. 
For the first quarter, all the key costs and cash numbers improved relative to Q4 2020 and are at or better than what we expected at the start of the quarter. We remain confident that our actions taken to cut costs and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need until we bring shows back, which will begin to scale in key markets outdoor this summer. 
As we move toward reopening, we continue to balance strong cost and cash management. We're now making the necessary investments to grow the business. While we expect the second quarter to be our first year-on-year improvement since Q4 of 2019 and to also be generating positive AOI through the second half of the year, we still plan on reducing costs this year by $750 million and reducing cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to prepandemic plans. 
Looking at our Q1 AOI results. Our AOI loss for the quarter was $152 million, which consisted of $323 million in operational fixed costs and $171 million of contribution margin, which included $149 million from operations, along with various onetime items, including insurance recoveries. 
Ticketmaster's ticket sales began to pick up at the beginning of March, particularly in the U.S., with weekly ticket sale count significantly ramping as concert on sales have restarted, including the Bad Bunny on sale, which was the top Ticketmaster artist on sale day since 2018. As Michael noted, sales for our Live Nation festivals and concerts have been strong, demonstrating the tremendous pent-up demand for our shows, with many festivals selling out in record time and a number of tours substantially overperforming relative to their historical levels. 
And our artist management and merchandise businesses also grew their contribution margin relative to the fourth quarter of last year. And our artist management businesses, artists continue to generate revenue through nontrain activity, including publishing rights, while our merchandise business has grown its retail and e-commerce businesses. 
Looking at free cash and liquidity. We ended the first quarter with $1.1 billion in free cash compared to $643 million at the end of 2020, an increase of $462 million. Our free cash, along with $964 million of available debt capacity, gives us $2.1 billion in readily available liquidity, up from $1.6 billion at the end of 2020. Benefiting our free cash position, in January, we raised $417 million of net debt, and we had a $181 million timing benefit, largely associated with deferred revenue classification. 
Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $136 million or $45 million per month, which included $100 million per month of average operational burn, roughly in line with Q4, plus another $4 million per month of nonoperational cash costs to get us to $104 million average per month in gross burn. This gross burn includes the benefits we realized from the sale of a nonstrategic minority investment and timing on interest payments and severance costs. And in Q1, we had $59 million average cash contribution margin per month, roughly 50% higher CM than we averaged in Q4. 
Now on the other balance sheet items, ticket refunds. The global refund rate for Live Nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window or windows was unchanged from the prior quarter at 17% through the end of Q1. For tours that have gone for a second refund window, the refund levels continue to generally be much lower for the second window as the casual fans requested their refunds during the first window. On our festivals where fans were able to retain their tickets for the next scheduled event, 65% of fans are doing so. 
On deferred revenue, at the end of the first quarter, event-related deferred revenue for shows that will play in the next 12 months was $1.5 billion, the same as at the end of Q4. Ticket sales in the first quarter were $200 million, but this was offset largely by a shift of deferred revenue from short term to long term for shows that were rescheduled into 2022. This long-term deferred revenue will then largely shift back to short term during Q2 and Q3, reversing the timing benefit in free cash this quarter. 
Finally, looking forward, as Michael said, we continue to expect concerts to scale this summer in key markets, notably outdoor, and led by the U.S. and U.K. Given this expected activity through Q2, we will continue to ramp up our operations, enabling Ticketmaster to run its own sales, the concerts division to staff up for the amphitheater and festival season, and sponsorship staff to support delivery for brands of these events. Between this ramp-up and the reversion of some of the Q1 timing benefits, we expect the average monthly net burn for the first half of 2021 to be roughly in line with Q4 of last year. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Michael."

So the good news is we got incredible supply. Now we're just starting through what makes sense to go out in '20 -- at the end of '21 still into '22. And some artists, we're talking about moving into '23. So I would say the artists are patient, and they're smart in terms of what their cycle is predicting. Maybe they have a record coming out in the fall, maybe it's in Q1. 
So right now, we have great supply. We don't have any issues in terms of availability, but we're also not looking to cram everything in 3 years into 1 year.

So that gives us -- that makes it more real, if you will. 
We've done a number of things. On the ticketing side, we've talked about -- we've shifted that to a truly global organization as part of moving to a true single approach on the marketplace, on the enterprise and on all the technology. On the concert side, we have a long-standing local network, which is very important to continue to understand the markets. With 80% of your shows now booked via tours, you don't need to have an entire infrastructure in every local market. 
So we've been seeing that there are ways of streamlining it. And when we were growing double digits every year through most of the last decade, it wasn't worth the potential disruption. But as we've stopped, we've asked ourselves what's the best way to do this rebuilding from the ground up, and we're very confident it's going to deliver those savings and be an even more effective organization for driving future growth."

But I think the real win of the downtime was what is the new products of the kind of Live Nation 3.0, what else are we going to do with this incredible scale we have across our consumer base. So I would say whether it's sponsorship, concerts or Ticketmaster, we would have a new level of new products in the pipe that we had not historically had the time nor the skill set, set to kind of unlock. So I'm very confident over the next couple of years we're going to see some exciting new things coming out of the concert division. 
Our consumer side of the business, our subscription business, our Ticketmaster business, our new ad business models we're looking at. So a bunch of exciting ideas now finally had months and months to put some people around and some skill set that we've acquired to advance that part of our business. So we look at the future as not only can we run the largest concert company in the world more efficiently and the best at it, but also what other new products will drive our business to think differently about the customer and the artist."

We get asked it every day, and I read a new article every day on all the great things it's going to solve. So let's step back. I mean, blockchain, we think it's a very exciting technology. We're currently using blockchain technology in our products, been invested in this business for a few years now, and we think it's a great technology that will help our business. 
I would step back from what are the problems that we're trying to solve or what are the opportunities that blockchain specifically brings to the ticketing business. One of the great advantages in the industry is when we went from a PDF to a digital ticket, we unlocked a lot of what you keep reading about the blockchain is going to do in the future. 
So the digital ticket or your mobile ticket that you're now buying has solved the biggest problem that unlocked, we've been talking about this for 2 years, identity. Identity for us, the fan, the artist, the team and the venue, knowing who sits on that seat, who's actually coming to the venue, having a communication directly with them, having a verified ticket, being able to trade that ticket, putting rules on that ticket. You currently do that now. If you want to. Can you transfer it? Can you transfer it with a certain cap, all of those things that content could decide to do if they wanted to with a digital ticket. 
And the service fee, I read about being reduced. I mean, the service fee could be reduced tomorrow. It's just a function of the venue. Not the ticket company. So digital ticket and moving from the old PDF model that historically ran the industry has been achieved to date. We've been talking the last couple of years about the progression of adoption. 
COVID, obviously, has really sped that up. Most ticket access now does not want to be in the contact business. So having a ticket on your mobile phone, walking into that venue and then being able to buy a drink, communicate with each other, upsell. You name the ideas that when you have a direct communication with your fan, those are all being unlocked right now by sports teams, by venues and artists. 
So we think the blockchain technology is a great part of a technology solution to keep providing a better communication and identity platform for the fan. But that's already in place. There's nothing blockchain would bring to that, that we can't -- or others have currently achieved. So we'll continue to lose blockchain to supplement and augment our platform and continue to look to be better at it. And we'll -- we think the great opportunity in ticketing, just getting this full access. 
I would step back -- and Brandon, you and I have talked about this before in terms of what does the ticket company do? I mean, quite honestly, selling the ticket is the easiest part of being a ticketing company. When we talk to clients, they don't pick us because we can sell a ticket. They pick us because we have marketing and distribution reach. They pick us because we have one of the largest marketplaces in the world to help them sell tickets. They pick us because we have a secure, great technology platform that can plug and play with their APIs and their databases and their consumer needs. And they also pick us because it's a financing mechanism. 
A ticketing business is about financing the venues, and it's exchanging that for ticketing rights. So it's a full bundle to be a ticketing company, and that's what Ticketmaster has delivered so successfully for so many years. And we'll continue to think -- lead with blockchain and bringing identity and all of the transparency and benefit that now having that ticket with an ownership to market."

NFTs are just another way of saying, can I add value to the customer relationship? Can I put a contract or privileges on that ticket for the customer? And that's a great mechanism, and it's a great vehicle. 
I mean, whether we sell a T-shirt to that customer coming into a concert or we sell them a PDF with a unique piece of artwork or a concert moment, it's another mechanism to engage your customer, find unique products that will let those magic memories of that event live on. So macro level, we're always in the business of figuring out what else can we add to that experience that the customer would engage in to kind of cement that magic moment called the concert. 
So NFTs, specifically, on Ticketmaster side, they're working already with sports teams and festivals and everyone else about how they would -- how they can layer an NFT on a ticket. You can mint a ticket and mint an NFT right on top of a Ticketmaster platform and deliver it how you want. So that's -- Ticketmaster will be in the delivery business using their ticket -- digital ticket, blockchain. And then as the customer creates its own NFT, we can sell those and bridge those together on whatever minting system and/or marketplace they use. 
On the Live Nation side, we're deep in exploration. We have a great team that's been working on this and working with the Mark Cubans of the world and others who are smart in this space. And I think you'll see us come out with an interesting Live Nation concert NFT angle. We think it's a great way for us to engage with our fans using that NFT and that direct relationship now to add rewards, add perks, add souvenir moments. We've all learned from top shops at the NBA, so we envision Live Nation with the marketplace and looking at some of its concert moments as magic moments that we could mint and attach to our ongoing ticket festivals and special moments. 
So we think it's -- if you have IP, we think it's an exciting time to use that IP to create some exciting moments with fans that can trade it ongoing and live that moment and kind of cement that relationship they have with that July 16th first concert back at Jones Beach, and I got an NFT and a special souvenir ticket that's mine forever. I can trade it. I can put it in my wallet and own that moment forever. 
So we think it's a fabulous moment to take a boring PDF and turn it into a magic souvenir with unlimited ideas on how you can bring that to life for the fan. So we think it's an exciting time. We think we'll be able to use our scalable IP to launch our own ways to engage with the fan in this space as well as empowering our artists through our management company that we've been doing to date."

It's another set of distribution platforms of getting tickets in the hands of fans. For all the reasons Michael talked about in terms of digital ticketing and identity, we think that more and more of the control over secondary will go to content, the sports teams and the artists as they have wide set of agendas in terms of what they'd like to accomplish and how they'd like to have the relationship with their fans. 
So we think there's some evolution as it goes to digital ticketing, and we absolutely support the content, having more control over how that happens. We support there being more transparency in secondary. But we think it's here to stay, and it will continue to be an important distribution platform. We'll continue to focus on pricing to get as much of the value of those tickets in the hands of fans as we can. 
And I think as we look at Vivid, they've all got a similar business model, right? It's all a service fee business model. They've got customer acquisition costs associated with a lot of search in digital, and we have more customer acquisition costs associated with alignment with content, but it's similar at the end of the day business model. We think we've got a great proposition by aligning with content and by also leveraging the scale of our Ticketmaster platform. 
So we like the position we're in. Whether it grows or shrinks exactly as artists price their content to market value is less of a concern and making sure we're delivering on that content agenda."

It would surprise us, too, right now where we are, but Pascal has been on this mission for quite a while. So we would love to sit with his team and educate him on the business so we can get all of the idiosyncrasies nailed because it's never as simple as it seems. 
So I really -- we look at that as a bit of a nuisance. They seem to be -- obviously, scalpers are doing a good job of convincing his staff that we are going to do a digital ticket in a closed platform. So that's their great fear that we're going to have a digital ticket, and we're going to tell you when you buy that ticket, you can only you can only resell it at Ticketmaster. That's never been our intent. 
So their kind of their main claim -- and I'm not even sure if they would sit down with us, we'd explain it's never been our intent to have a closed platform. We've actually -- the biggest thing I've done at Ticketmaster, since it's taken over, is rebuild this company so we can have an open platform. 
Our goal is to sell that first ticket. But as we did with the NFL last year, we have an open platform with the NFL. We power the NFL. And if those secondary companies are approved by the NFL, then that ticket you buy for the NFL can be freely sold on any other platform and used to get in the show. 
So that, we think, is the best model. We think we have the largest kind of footprint from a primary platform. We believe that if the ticket is to be resold, we have a great marketplace for that, for the Ticketmaster fan. But we're also working and been working towards an open platform that it can be sold in other places with the content like the NFL or venues want that path forward. 
So not sure there's much meat to the claim. We're not looking to limit distribution. We're looking to increase distribution for the teams, venues and artists. And the best platforms will win in the end that offer the best value to the content and the fan. So that's our plan. 
We think we have an incredible opportunity in ticketing in that -- the amount of people that buy at Ticketmaster and actually resell their ticket is very, very low. So we think we have a natural huge audience that we should do a better job of allowing you, the fan, if you just bought to think about how you can resell on our platform. And maybe there's better incentives we can do for you as a fan to make that even more seamless. But if you want to sell on other platforms, as we do on the NFL, then we'll be happy to validate that ticket and let the content decide where it's sold."

We're just thrilled with the acquisition partnership with the Madden Brothers who run this on a daily basis. The soul and sweat they put in, it's really all them. We've just added a bit of a firehose by helping them with our distribution. 
They're -- I think they're up to over 1,000 shows in the last year, probably grow somewhere over 10 million. So a good start to that business. But now, you're going to see with our new clubs -- we do 10,000 club shows. So you start digging into that a little bit, adding some amphitheaters. 
And the part we think is really exciting is our festivals, opening up that model that, in Lollapalooza, instead of just rebroadcasting that for free, what if for $49, you could watch the Lollapalooza weekend or you could buy the Lollapalooza Day at home and continue your party at home if you couldn't make it to the venue. 
So we've seen great success in our EDM business. Pascal's blown the numbers up on his business when he does that. So we think extending the festival, which is a bit of a party-at-home model, it's got great opportunity. And I would much rather use my festivals to add another revenue ticket to the equation than treat it as promotion value. So we're going to test that this summer, and we think we'll get some learning, and that'll help us move forward in that place. 
If you just launch festival TV, you have a proposition itself there with our 150-plus festivals. So we think that's exciting, plus our club business for young artist. So new space for us. 
We think it's an exciting place to add value. We think there's subscription ideas forward with that. We think we can bundle it with other things. We think there's a great foundation to our core business here that we can keep exploring and innovating on."

You always get that question on who's the next Rolling Stones. And our data will continually show that, that young artist is capable of selling out stadiums and arenas very fast. 
I mean, Bad Bunny just went on sale and sold out arenas very fast, huge Latino star. So we're just seeing pockets of strengths coming from young artists every day. Billie Eilish is selling out instantly. So we see young artists regenerating the supply side. We see new 14-year-olds going crazy for BTS all around the globe. That's a part, to me, is what I look at is, is it still as important to a 14-year-old to see from the Beatles to NSYNC to Backstreet to Britney Spears to BTSs of today, right? So they seem to be -- my 10-year-old is as excited about concerts as I was when I was 10 -- or even more, I guess, where he's based.

As communities reopen, we're seeing the pent-up demand for live events play out as artists and fans are eager to reconnect in person. In the U.S. and U.K., we're seeing strong ticket sales and the restart of our concerts and festivals highlighted over the past weekend by Lollapalooza and Rolling Loud in the U.S. and Latitude in the U.K., posting 750,000 fans combined. With vaccine rollouts increasing throughout Canada and Europe, we expect additional markets to open up broadly in the coming months. And momentum for the return of live has been building every month, with ticket sales and concert attendance pacing faster than expected, underscoring the strength and resilience of the concert business and live events in general. 
This progress, combined with our cost discipline, has enabled us to deliver positive AOI for the second quarter, well ahead of where we thought we would be for this quarter. We expect to see further ramp-up accelerate through the rest of the year, with all segments returning to AOI profitability for the second half of the year, setting us up for a full-scale 2022. As we put more shows on sale for this year and next, ticket sales are the best early indicator for concerts in our overall business. 
To that end, June was Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month in history for transacted ticket volume. This was driven in part by our U.S. concert division, putting the highest number of shows on sale ever during a single month, 50% more than the next highest mark back in 2019. In concerts, our recovery this summer continue to be led by our outdoor events at our festivals and amphitheaters. We expect to have over 6 million fans attend our festivals during the second half of the year, with about 2/3 of our festivals increasing their attendance compared to 2019. Most of our major festivals sold out in record time, while average ticket prices have been 10% higher than 2019. And while still early, at our amphitheater shows over the past few weeks, we have delivered strong double-digit increase in average per fan revenue and on-site spending versus 2019. 
Looking forward to 2022 and now 2023, all our leading indicators continue to point to a roaring era for concerts and other live events. Starting with our Concerts division, every major venue type arenas, amphitheaters and stadiums have pipeline indicating double-digit growth in our show count and ticket sales relative to 2019 levels. In some cases, our pipeline is so strong, we are extending our planning into 2023 and even beginning to discuss tours that extended to 2024. At the same time, Ticketmaster's leading-edge technology continues to attract new clients, adding $11 million net new fee-bearing ticket so far this year, already surpassing any previous full year growth. As a result, Ticketmaster has set the benefit in 2022 from both increased Live Nation concert ticket sales as well as additional sales from new clients. 
In our sponsorship business, our brand partners have maintained and grown their interest in live events, with contracted sponsorship up double digits for 2022, where we were at this point in 2019 for 2020. As our revenue is rebounding, we continue to evolve our business to maximize opportunities in the global recovery and strengthen our flywheel. We have structurally reduced our cost basis by $200 million, making us more nimble in converting more of our revenue to AOI. We have integrated our Ticketmaster team globally, enabling us to work toward a global product road map that will both reduce our costs and increase our flexibility and speed to deploy new client tools and improve our marketplace experience. 
And we continue to build our direct-to-consumer business with initiatives ranging from streaming concerts, NFTs to artist merchandise, bringing more value to artists and deepening fan relationships. These enhancements, combined with our strongest supply and demand dynamics our industry has ever seen, are fueling our core flywheel strategy, and setting us up for multiple years of growth, attendance revenue and AOI. 
And with that, I'll let Joe take you through more details of our results."

As we've done over the past year, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today. In the second quarter, our AOI was posi",1406,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've done over the past year, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today. 
In the second quarter, our AOI was positive for the first time since the start of the pandemic as the U.S., by far our largest market, accelerated its reopening, also driving our revenue to the highest level since the first quarter of last year. As a result, our contribution margin ramped up faster than expected, particularly in ticketing. Even with the increased activity, our monthly gross burn for the first half of the year was lower than the monthly burn during the last 3 quarters of 2020 due to our structural cost savings and continued cost discipline. As a result, we remain confident that actions taken to reduce cash burn and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need that shows return. And as we move toward reopening in more markets, we continue to balance the strong cost and cash management with making the necessary investments to grow the business. While we expect to generate positive AOI overall and for each segment for the second half of the year, we will also reduce costs this year by over $800 million and reduce cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to pre-pandemic plans. 
Looking at our Q2 results, revenue for the quarter was $576 million compared to $74 million in the second quarter of 2020 for growth of over $0.5 billion. All 3 of our business segments more than doubled their revenues from last year. Our AOI for the quarter was $10 million compared to a loss of $432 million for the second quarter of 2020. Our Q2 2021 AOI consisted of $351 million of contribution margin, which included $364 million from operations, along with various onetime items, including gains from insurance recoveries and government support and losses from ticketing service fee refunds paid out. This was then offset by $341 million in operational fixed costs. 
Getting into our business segments a bit deeper, starting with Ticketing, which was the primary driver of our results this quarter, contribution margin for the quarter was $204 million or nearly 60% of our total contribution margin, delivering $99 million in AOI. Ticketing revenue for the quarter was $244 million or just over 40% of our total revenue for the quarter. Each month of the quarter, Ticketmaster had progressively stronger results, culminating with June being Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month ever for transacted ticket volume. In general, North America drove much of this resurgence, accounting for over 75% of total transacted tickets in the quarter as compared to approximately 2/3 of transacted tickets for 2019. Concert tickets drove much of this activity, and as a result, the top 10 artists sold over $513 million in GTV during the second quarter this year compared to $329 million in the second quarter of 2019. Secondary ticketing has similarly rebounded. Our June GTV was only 8% below June of 2019. That trend has continued into the third quarter, with July 12 marking the highest resale GTV day in our history, driven by the U.S. Open along with strong NBA, NFL and concert resale volumes. These results in ticketing are a leading indicator to our concerts business. 
For the second quarter, our Concerts AOI loss of $84 million was an improvement of $127 million relative to Q2 last year, and our revenue was up $145 million relative to Q2 last year as we promoted nearly 1,700 shows for 1.3 million fans during the quarter. More importantly, these ticket sales drove our event-related deferred revenue up to $2.1 billion, representing a pipeline of future activity even higher than the $1.6 billion we had at the end of the second quarter in 2019. In part, this event-related deferred revenue is associated with over 25 million tickets we have sold for our concerts in the second half of this year, along with also being part of the 14 million tickets that we have already sold for concerts in 2022, which reflects strong double-digit growth in our 2022 pipeline for show count and fans relative to 2019. 
Sponsorship and advertising then naturally flow from our ticketing and concert platforms. Our Sponsorship and Advertising AOI for the quarter was $13 million and revenue was $45 million, with the bulk of our activity tied to our ticketing platform and concert presales. We continue to find brands that are committed to maintaining or increasing their spend with Live Nation to reach our music fans and other live event audiences. And during the quarter, we added several long-term strategic partners, including Allegion Payer, Adobe and Sinch in the airline, technology and auto sectors, respectively. And more broadly, we expect our sponsorship and advertising full-scale activity to return somewhere between ticketing and concerts timing. Most importantly, as we look out at our 2022 pipeline, confirmed activity is pacing well ahead of where we were in 2019 at this point. And with many multiyear contracts on the books, we are lining up to be growing this business in 2022 and beyond. 
Looking at free cash and liquidity, as of June 30, we had total cash of $4 billion, including $1.1 billion in ticketing client cash and $1.8 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $1.1 billion. This was flat relative to our first quarter reported number. Our free cash, along with $971 million of available debt capacity, gives us $2.1 billion in readily available liquidity, up from $1.6 billion at the end of 2020 and steady with our Q1 ending liquidity. Benefiting our free cash position in the second quarter was $161 million in favorable timing, largely the result of classification of our event-related deferred revenue between short term and long term. Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $163 million or $54 million per month, which included $115 million per month of operational burn, up from $100 million per month in the first quarter as furloughed employees returned to prepare for our reopening, and we reinstated full pay for most employees, plus another $58 million per month of nonoperational cash costs, including investment in capital expenditures, acquisitions and artists and ticket client advances, to give us $173 million average per month in gross burn. And in Q2, we had $119 million average per month cash contribution margin, double our Q1 average. 
Turning to other balance sheet items. More on deferred revenue. At the end of the second quarter, event-related deferred revenue for shows that will play in the next 12 months was $2.1 billion, up from $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. Ticket sales in the second quarter were nearly $900 million, while refunds totaled $100 million and a shift to deferred revenue from short term to long term for shows that were rescheduled into the back half of 2022, totaled $150 million. This long-term deferred revenue will then largely shift back to short term during Q3 and Q4, reversing the timing benefit in free cash this quarter. 
Our total capital expenditures were $52 million for the first 6 months, with $38 million spent on revenue-generating items. The markets have reopened faster than expected. We will similarly be accelerating some of our investments to take advantage of additional opportunities this year and into 2022. As a result, we now expect total capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $170 million, with over 60% of the spend going into revenue-generating CapEx projects. Our total debt as of June 30 was $5.3 billion, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.4%, with about 90% of that debt at a fixed rate. 
Finally, looking forward, as Michael said, we continue to expect concerts to scale further in the second half of this year in key markets, notably outdoor and led by the U.S. and U.K. With this activity, we will continue to ramp up our operations, enabling Ticketmaster to run its own sales, the Concerts division, to book and market 2022 tours and sponsorship staff to support delivery for brands on site and online. Given the COVID issues in our key markets appear to be short term at this point, we continue to expect 2022 activity and results to exceed 2019 levels, with continued growth opportunities from there.

We had that at Lollapalooza over the last weekend, very successfully done.

So my expectation is that we will see that continue, whether at the artist level, at the city level, like New York just announced or they're large crowds, frankly, Lollapalooza certainly went above and beyond what was happening at baseball games in Chicago. And similarly, I think in other markets, we're going above what others are doing. 
So we'll continue to focus on that. I think the great news is that at this point, the discussion is around what are the requirements to hold the events, what do we need to see in terms of vaccinations and testing, not hearing discussions certainly in the U.S. or the U.K. about impacting those shows to any scale."

So we would expect, as we've seen over the last 10 years, demand overall for live on a global basis has continually been growing. We like to always point out, we think that the product is still underpriced given all of the secondary business. So this is still an attractive night out for a fan. Now that artist is traveling more around the world, the fan base has grown for live as a functional entertainment items. So we think global demand will continue to have double-digit growth as an industry for many years to come as the global landscape continues to grow."

And $200 million structural savings is a subset of that. So what we're navigating this year is the pace at which we bring back some of the costs versus the piece at which we ramp up activity. And it's not going to be totally linear. We had a great month of June in TM, and we're finally getting back to scale there, and we expect to have nice scale with Ticketmaster in the second half, but the first part of the year was lower scale. 
So overall, yes, we expect margins to improve because a large chunk of that $200 million is going to come out of Ticketmaster, and that would just naturally flow into a margin. I wouldn't try to overly analyze the single quarter and let's get you a few more quarters at more traditional scale with more traditional costs and staffing over the next 6 months."

And I thought one of the more interesting developments in the quarter was the extension and expansion of your relationship with ASM for two reasons. One is that ASMs obviously, half AG, and it didn't go to access. But more so, that Ticketmaster could sell tickets for Live Nation promoted shows in the other ASM venues. And the North American ticket model has been exclusive for as long as I can remember, at least. 
Is this a sign of change in the future? Do you think that exclusivity model is here to stay? Or do you think depending on event type, the promoter will ultimately control the ticket?"

I think the exclusive approach has worked well for the venues, and the ecosystem is a large part of how the venues get funded and how the venues then make the rental costs approachable for promoters and artists. So it's an ecosystem that's worked well in the U.S., and the Ticketmaster as you know, has been a very large source of funding and the profit stream for the venues. 
I wouldn't read too much into this. If you look at ASM's scale, that's not a common typical scale in terms of the number of buildings they have. It's also a fairly unique situation, where you have somebody who owns buildings, who's saying we're going to let you bring in Ticketmaster regardless of the situation and they control both sides of that decision-making. It's not something that we are looking to do or that we see as any real mark of the industry going forward."

I assume they would have liked to have used their own in-house ticketing system.

And then my second question is just you made a helpful comment around sponsorship, saying that I think contracted business is up double digits for '22 relative to where you were in '19 for '20.

And I think as we've gone through the past 3 months, whatever we said 3 months ago, we're more confident in that at this point.

And sponsorship then would be a part of that expectation, up double digits and committed sponsorship.

We think turnover rate at or below the overall entertainment industry. So we feel very good about how we've been able to retain staff. I think it's a testimony to people's commitment to our industry and the culture that we built here. 
So in terms of the core people, they are the ones that we've talked about bringing back the shows, bringing back the ticketing and the sponsorship. Those people are in place. As we've put on our shows in various amphitheaters and festival sites around the country and around the world, we've been able to get the volume heap what we needed.

As communities reopen, we're seeing the pent-up demand for live events play out as artists and fans are eager to reconnect in person. In the U.S. and U.K., we're seeing strong ticket sales, and the restart of our concerts and festivals highlighted over the past weekends by Lollapalooza and Rolling Loud in the U.S. and Latitude in the U.K. hosting 750,000 fans combined. With vaccine rollouts increasing throughout Canada and Europe, we expect additional markets to open up broadly in the coming months. 
And momentum for the return of live has been building every month, with ticket sales and concert attendance pacing faster than expected, underscoring the strength and resilience of the concert business and live events in general. This progress, combined with our cost discipline, has enabled us to deliver positive AOI for the second quarter, well ahead of where we thought we would be for this quarter. We expect to see further ramp-up accelerate through the rest of the year, with all segments returning to AOI profitability for the second half of the year, setting us up for a full-scale 2022. 
As we put more shows on sale for this year and next, ticket sales are the best early indicator for concerts in our overall business. To that end, June was Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month in history for transacted ticket volume. This was driven in part by our U.S. concert division putting the highest number of shows on sale ever during a single month, 50% more than the next highest mark back in 2019. 
In concerts, our recovery this summer continue to be led by our outdoor events at our festivals and amphitheaters. We expect to have over 6 million fans attend our festivals during the second half of the year, with about 2/3 of our festivals increasing their attendance compared to 2019. Most of our major festivals sold out in record time, while average ticket prices have been 10% higher than 2019. And while still early, at our amphitheater shows over the past few weeks, we have delivered strong double-digit increase in average per fan revenue and on-site spending versus 2019.
Looking forward to 2022 and now 2023, all our leading indicators continue to point to a roaring era for concerts and other live events. Starting with our concerts division, every major venue type, arenas, amphitheaters and stadiums, have pipeline indicating double-digit growth in our show count and ticket sales relative to 2019 levels. In some cases, our pipeline is so strong, we are extending our planning into 2023 and even beginning to discuss tours that extend into 2024. 
At the same time, Ticketmaster's leading-edge technology continues to attract new clients, adding 11 million net new fee-bearing tickets so far this year, already surpassing any previous full year growth. As a result, Ticketmaster is set the benefit in 2022 from both increased Live Nation concert ticket sales as well as additional sales from new clients.
In our sponsorship business, our brand partners have maintained and grown their interest in live events, with contracted sponsorship up double digits for 2022 from where we were at this point in 2019 for 2020. 
As our revenue is rebounding, we continue to evolve our business to maximize opportunities from the global recovery and strengthen our flywheel. We have structurally reduced our cost basis by $200 million, making us more nimble in converting more of our revenue to AOI. We have integrated our Ticketmaster team globally, enabling us to work toward a global product road map that will both reduce our costs and increase our flexibility and speed to deploy new client tools and improve our marketplace experience.
We continue to build our direct-to-consumer business with initiatives ranging from streaming concerts to NFTs to artist merchandise, bringing more value to artists and deepening fan relationships. These enhancements, combined with our strongest supply and demand dynamics our industry has ever seen, are fueling our core flywheel strategy and setting us up for multiple years of growth in attendance revenue and AOI.
And with that, I'll let Joe take you through more details of our results."

As we've done over the past year, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today.In the second quarter, our AOI was posit",1405,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've done over the past year, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today.
In the second quarter, our AOI was positive for the first time since the start of the pandemic as the U.S., by far our largest market, accelerated its reopening, also driving our revenue to the highest level since the first quarter of last year. As a result, our contribution margin ramped up faster than expected, particularly in ticketing. Even with the increased activity, our monthly gross burn for the first half of the year was lower than the monthly burn during the last 3 quarters of 2020 due to our structural cost savings and continued cost discipline. 
As a result, we remain confident that actions taken to reduce cash burn and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need as shows return. And as we move toward reopening in more markets, we continue to balance the strong cost and cash management with making the necessary investments to grow the business. While we expect to generate positive AOI overall and for each segment for the second half of the year, we will also reduce costs this year by over $800 million and reduce cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to pre-pandemic plans.
Looking at our Q2 results. Revenue for the quarter was $576 million compared to $74 million in the second quarter of 2020 for growth of over $0.5 billion. All 3 of our business segments more than doubled their revenues from last year. 
Our AOI for the quarter was $10 million compared to a loss of $432 million for the second quarter of 2020. Our Q2 2021 AOI consisted of $351 million of contribution margin, which included $364 million from operations, along with various onetime items, including gains from insurance recoveries and government support and losses from ticketing service fee refunds paid out. This was then offset by $341 million in operational fixed costs.
Getting into our business segments a bit deeper, starting with Ticketing, which was the primary driver of our results this quarter. Contribution margin for the quarter was $204 million or nearly 60% of our total contribution margin, delivering $99 million in AOI. 
Ticketing revenue for the quarter was $244 million or just over 40% of our total revenue for the quarter. Each month of the quarter, Ticketmaster had progressively stronger results, culminating with June being Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month ever for transacted ticket volume. In general, North America drove much of this resurgence, accounting for over 75% of total transacted tickets in the quarter as compared to approximately 2/3 of transacted tickets for 2019. 
Concert tickets drove much of this activity, and as a result, the top 10 artists sold over $513 million in GTV during the second quarter this year compared to $329 million in the second quarter of 2019. Secondary ticketing has similarly rebounded. Our June GTV was only 8% below June of 2019. That trend has continued into the third quarter, with July 12 marking the highest resale GTV day in our history, driven by the U.S. Open along with strong NBA, NFL and concert resale volumes. These results in ticketing are a leading indicator to our concerts business. 
For the second quarter, our concerts AOI loss of $84 million was an improvement of $127 million relative to Q2 last year, and our revenue was up $145 million relative to Q2 last year as we promoted nearly 1,700 shows for 1.3 million fans during the quarter. More importantly, these ticket sales drove our event-related deferred revenue up to $2.1 billion, representing a pipeline of future activity even higher than the $1.6 billion we had at the end of the second quarter in 2019. 
In part, this event-related deferred revenue is associated with over 25 million tickets we have sold for our concerts in the second half of this year, along with also being part of the 14 million tickets that we have already sold for concerts in 2022, which reflects strong double-digit growth in our 2022 pipeline for show count and fans relative to 2019.
Sponsorship and advertising then naturally flow from our ticketing and concert platforms. Our sponsorship and advertising AOI for the quarter was $13 million and revenue was $45 million, with the bulk of our activity tied to our ticketing platform and concert presales. We continue to find brands that are committed to maintaining or increasing their spend with Live Nation to reach our music fans and other live event audiences. And during the quarter, we added several long-term strategic partners, including Allegiant Air, Adobe and cinch in the airline, technology and auto sectors, respectively. And more broadly, we expect our sponsorship and advertising full-scale activity to return somewhere between ticketing and concerts timing.
Most importantly, as we look out at our 2022 pipeline, confirmed activity is pacing well ahead of where we were in 2019 at this point. And with many multiyear contracts on the books, we are lining up to be growing this business in 2022 and beyond.
Looking at free cash and liquidity. As of June 30, we had total cash of $4 billion, including $1.1 billion in ticketing client cash and $1.8 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $1.1 billion. This was flat relative to our first quarter reported number. Our free cash, along with $971 million of available debt capacity, gives us $2.1 billion in readily available liquidity, up from $1.6 billion at the end of 2020 and steady with our Q1 ending liquidity. Benefiting our free cash position in the second quarter was $161 million in favorable timing, largely the result of classification of our event-related deferred revenue between short term and long term. 
Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $163 million or $54 million per month, which included $115 million per month of operational burn, up from $100 million per month in the first quarter as furloughed employees returned to prepare for our reopening and we reinstated full pay for most employees, plus another $58 million per month of nonoperational cash costs, including investment in capital expenditures, acquisitions and artists and ticket client advances, to give us $173 million average per month in gross burn. And in Q2, we had $119 million average per month cash contribution margin, double our Q1 average.
Turning to other balance sheet items. More on deferred revenue. At the end of the second quarter, event-related deferred revenue for shows that will play in the next 12 months was $2.1 billion, up from $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. Ticket sales in the second quarter were nearly $900 million, while refunds totaled $100 million, and a shift to deferred revenue from short term to long term for shows that were rescheduled into the back half of 2022 totaled $150 million. This long-term deferred revenue will then largely shift back to short term during Q3 and Q4, reversing the timing benefit in free cash this quarter. 
Our total capital expenditures were $52 million for the first 6 months, with $38 million spent on revenue-generating items. The markets have reopened faster than expected. We will similarly be accelerating some of our investments to take advantage of additional opportunities this year and into 2022. As a result, we now expect total capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $170 million, with over 60% of the spend going into revenue-generating CapEx projects. 
Our total debt as of June 30 was $5.3 billion. And our weighted average cost of debt was 4.4%, with about 90% of that debt at a fixed rate.
Finally, looking forward, as Michael said, we continue to expect concerts to scale further in the second half of this year in key markets, notably outdoor and led by the U.S. and U.K. With this activity, we will continue to ramp up our operations, enabling Ticketmaster to run its on-sales, the concerts division to book and market 2022 tours and sponsorship staff to support delivery for brands on site and online. Given the COVID issues in our key markets appear to be short term at this point, we continue to expect 2022 activity and results to exceed 2019 levels, with continued growth opportunities from there.

I think what we're seeing is a shift to increasing requirements for entry of either vaccinated or tested or fully vaccinated. We had that at Lollapalooza over the last weekend, very successfully done. Over 90% of the people were fully vaccinated, which I think was a great signal in terms of people's commitment and support of being vaccinated in order to go to these shows. So my expectation is that we will see that continue, whether at the artist level, at the city level like New York just announced, or they're large crowds. Frankly, Lollapalooza certainly went above and beyond what was happening at baseball games in Chicago. And similarly, I think in other markets, we're going above what others are doing. 
So we'll continue to focus on that. I think the great news is that at this point, the discussion is around what are the requirements to hold the events, what do we need to see in terms of vaccinations and testing. Not hearing discussions certainly in the U.S. or the U.K. about impacting those shows to any scale."

I wouldn't read too much into this. If you look at ASM's scale, that's not a common typical scale in terms of the number of buildings they have. It's also a fairly unique situation where you have somebody who owns buildings who's saying we're going to let you bring in Ticketmaster regardless of the situation and they control both sides of that decision-making. It's not something that we are looking to do or that we see as any real mark of the industry going forward."

I assume they would have liked to have used their own in-house ticketing system. But I think our relationship and what we've done for all those venues for so long won us that business and that renewal. 
So that was a very important renewal, a very good testament to Ticketmaster. I give the ASM management team credit.

I know where the Street expectations are, but I thought I'd give you a chance to maybe expand on that. 
And then my second question is just you made a helpful comment around sponsorship, saying that I think contracted business is up double digits for '22 relative to where you were in '19 for '20. I guess a similar question on the ticketing question. How much of the forward year is sort of already in the books typically? Just trying to understand what that tells us about next year and make sure we don't over-extrapolate that comment about growth for sponsorship."

Just in terms of overall '22 expectations first, it starts for us with where are the concert bookings, what do the show count look like, and from that, our expectations on the ticket counts, both of which, we think, again, are up relative to 2019 based on what we said. And I think as we've gone through the past 3 months, whatever we said 3 months ago, we're more confident in that at this point. And as a result, we expect then revenue and AOI growth relative to 2019 as well. 
And sponsorship then would be a part of that expectation, up double digits in committed sponsorship. Usually, you'd have -- I mean we've talked about how much of our sponsorship is in the form of multiyear, multimillion-dollar, multi-asset strategic sponsors. That's a large portion of our sponsorship base. So you know us, we probably wouldn't be talking about expectations of growth for next year already at this point unless we had a pretty good feel that a lot of it was committed."

We think turnover rate at or below the overall entertainment industry. So we feel very good about how we've been able to retain staff. I think it's a testimony to people's commitment to our industry and the culture that we built here. 
So in terms of the core people, they are the ones that we've talked about bringing back the shows, bringing back the ticketing and the sponsorship. Those people are in place. As we've put on our shows in various amphitheaters and festival sites around the country and around the world, we've been able to get the volume heap we needed. It hasn't been a material cost impact, taking in total, and we've had to work a bit harder at times to find the people, but it has not impacted our ability to put on the shows."

So I think the biggest challenge we've had is just scrambling on a day-to-day basis with part-time employees back and abiding by different local COVID laws, mask, no mask, now test, no test.

As communities reopen, we're seeing the pent-up demand for live events play out as artists and fans are eager to reconnect in person. In the U.S. and U.K., we're seeing strong ticket sales and the restart of our concerts and festivals highlighted over the past weekends by Lollapalooza and Rolling Loud in the U.S. and Latitude in the U.K. hosting 750,000 fans combined. With vaccine rollouts increasing throughout Canada and Europe, we expect additional markets to open up broadly in the coming months. 
And momentum for the return of live has been building every month, with ticket sales and concert attendance pacing faster than expected, underscoring the strength and resilience of the concert business and live events in general. This progress, combined with our cost discipline, has enabled us to deliver positive AOI for the second quarter, well ahead of where we thought we would be for this quarter. We expect to see further ramp-up accelerate through the rest of the year, with all segments returning to AOI profitability for the second half of the year, setting us up for a full-scale 2022. 
As we put more shows on sale for this year and next, ticket sales are the best early indicator for concerts in our overall business. To that end, June was Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month in history for transacted ticket volume. This was driven in part by our U.S. concert division putting the highest number of shows on sale ever during a single month, 50% more than the next highest mark back in 2019. 
In concerts, our recovery this summer continue to be led by our outdoor events at our festivals and amphitheaters. We expect to have over 6 million fans attend our festivals during the second half of the year, with about 2/3 of our festivals increasing their attendance compared to 2019. Most of our major festivals sold out in record time, while average ticket prices have been 10% higher than 2019. And while still early, at our amphitheater shows over the past few weeks, we have delivered strong double-digit increase in average per fan revenue and on-site spending versus 2019.
Looking forward to 2022 and now 2023, all our leading indicators continue to point to a roaring era for concerts and other live events. Starting with our concerts division, every major venue type, arenas, amphitheaters and stadiums, have pipeline indicating double-digit growth in our show count and ticket sales relative to 2019 levels. In some cases, our pipeline is so strong, we are extending our planning into 2023 and even beginning to discuss tours that extend into 2024. 
At the same time, Ticketmaster's leading-edge technology continues to attract new clients, adding 11 million net new fee-bearing tickets so far this year, already surpassing any previous full year growth. As a result, Ticketmaster is set to benefit in 2022 from both increased Live Nation concert ticket sales as well as additional sales from new clients.
In our sponsorship business, our brand partners have maintained and grown their interest in live events, with contracted sponsorship up double digits for 2022 from where we were at this point in 2019 for 2020. 
As our revenue is rebounding, we continue to evolve our business to maximize opportunities from the global recovery and strengthen our flywheel. We have structurally reduced our cost basis by $200 million, making us more nimble in converting more of our revenue to AOI. We have integrated our Ticketmaster team globally, enabling us to work toward a global product road map that will both reduce our costs and increase our flexibility and speed to deploy new client tools and improve our marketplace experience.
We continue to build our direct-to-consumer business with initiatives ranging from streaming concerts to NFTs to artist merchandise, bringing more value to artists and deepening fan relationships. These enhancements, combined with our strongest supply and demand dynamics our industry has ever seen, are fueling our core flywheel strategy and setting us up for multiple years of growth in attendance revenue and AOI.
And with that, I'll let Joe take you through more details of our results."
384687,1674655980,2383357,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've done over the past year, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today.In the second quarter, our AOI was posit",1405,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've done over the past year, we've added some tables at the back of our earnings release that reconcile in more detail some of the numbers I will refer to today.
In the second quarter, our AOI was positive for the first time since the start of the pandemic as the U.S., by far our largest market, accelerated its reopening, also driving our revenue to the highest level since the first quarter of last year. As a result, our contribution margin ramped up faster than expected, particularly in ticketing. Even with the increased activity, our monthly gross burn for the first half of the year was lower than the monthly burn during the last 3 quarters of 2020 due to our structural cost savings and continued cost discipline. 
As a result, we remain confident that actions taken to reduce cash burn and increase liquidity will provide us with the runway we need as shows return. And as we move toward reopening in more markets, we continue to balance the strong cost and cash management with making the necessary investments to grow the business. While we expect to generate positive AOI overall and for each segment for the second half of the year, we will also reduce costs this year by over $800 million and reduce cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to pre-pandemic plans.
Looking at our Q2 results. Revenue for the quarter was $576 million compared to $74 million in the second quarter of 2020 for growth of over $0.5 billion. All 3 of our business segments more than doubled their revenues from last year. 
Our AOI for the quarter was $10 million compared to a loss of $432 million for the second quarter of 2020. Our Q2 2021 AOI consisted of $351 million of contribution margin, which included $364 million from operations, along with various onetime items, including gains from insurance recoveries and government support and losses from ticketing service fee refunds paid out. This was then offset by $341 million in operational fixed costs.
Getting into our business segments a bit deeper, starting with Ticketing, which was the primary driver of our results this quarter. Contribution margin for the quarter was $204 million or nearly 60% of our total contribution margin, delivering $99 million in AOI. 
Ticketing revenue for the quarter was $244 million or just over 40% of our total revenue for the quarter. Each month of the quarter, Ticketmaster had progressively stronger results, culminating with June being Ticketmaster North America's fourth best month ever for transacted ticket volume. In general, North America drove much of this resurgence, accounting for over 75% of total transacted tickets in the quarter as compared to approximately 2/3 of transacted tickets for 2019. 
Concert tickets drove much of this activity, and as a result, the top 10 artists sold over $513 million in GTV during the second quarter this year compared to $329 million in the second quarter of 2019. Secondary ticketing has similarly rebounded. Our June GTV was only 8% below June of 2019. That trend has continued into the third quarter, with July 12 marking the highest resale GTV day in our history, driven by the U.S. Open along with strong NBA, NFL and concert resale volumes. These results in ticketing are a leading indicator to our concerts business. 
For the second quarter, our concerts AOI loss of $84 million was an improvement of $127 million relative to Q2 last year, and our revenue was up $145 million relative to Q2 last year as we promoted nearly 1,700 shows for 1.3 million fans during the quarter. More importantly, these ticket sales drove our event-related deferred revenue up to $2.1 billion, representing a pipeline of future activity even higher than the $1.6 billion we had at the end of the second quarter in 2019. 
In part, this event-related deferred revenue is associated with over 25 million tickets we have sold for our concerts in the second half of this year, along with also being part of the 14 million tickets that we have already sold for concerts in 2022, which reflects strong double-digit growth in our 2022 pipeline for show count and fans relative to 2019.
Sponsorship and advertising then naturally flow from our ticketing and concert platforms. Our sponsorship and advertising AOI for the quarter was $13 million and revenue was $45 million, with the bulk of our activity tied to our ticketing platform and concert presales. We continue to find brands that are committed to maintaining or increasing their spend with Live Nation to reach our music fans and other live event audiences. And during the quarter, we added several long-term strategic partners, including Allegiant Air, Adobe and cinch in the airline, technology and auto sectors, respectively. And more broadly, we expect our sponsorship and advertising full-scale activity to return somewhere between ticketing and concerts timing.
Most importantly, as we look out at our 2022 pipeline, confirmed activity is pacing well ahead of where we were in 2019 at this point. And with many multiyear contracts on the books, we are lining up to be growing this business in 2022 and beyond.
Looking at free cash and liquidity. As of June 30, we had total cash of $4 billion, including $1.1 billion in ticketing client cash and $1.8 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $1.1 billion. This was flat relative to our first quarter reported number. Our free cash, along with $971 million of available debt capacity, gives us $2.1 billion in readily available liquidity, up from $1.6 billion at the end of 2020 and steady with our Q1 ending liquidity. Benefiting our free cash position in the second quarter was $161 million in favorable timing, largely the result of classification of our event-related deferred revenue between short term and long term. 
Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $163 million or $54 million per month, which included $115 million per month of operational burn, up from $100 million per month in the first quarter as furloughed employees returned to prepare for our reopening and we reinstated full pay for most employees, plus another $58 million per month of nonoperational cash costs, including investment in capital expenditures, acquisitions and artists and ticket client advances, to give us $173 million average per month in gross burn. And in Q2, we had $119 million average per month cash contribution margin, double our Q1 average.
Turning to other balance sheet items. More on deferred revenue. At the end of the second quarter, event-related deferred revenue for shows that will play in the next 12 months was $2.1 billion, up from $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. Ticket sales in the second quarter were nearly $900 million, while refunds totaled $100 million, and a shift to deferred revenue from short term to long term for shows that were rescheduled into the back half of 2022 totaled $150 million. This long-term deferred revenue will then largely shift back to short term during Q3 and Q4, reversing the timing benefit in free cash this quarter. 
Our total capital expenditures were $52 million for the first 6 months, with $38 million spent on revenue-generating items. The markets have reopened faster than expected. We will similarly be accelerating some of our investments to take advantage of additional opportunities this year and into 2022. As a result, we now expect total capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $170 million, with over 60% of the spend going into revenue-generating CapEx projects. 
Our total debt as of June 30 was $5.3 billion. And our weighted average cost of debt was 4.4%, with about 90% of that debt at a fixed rate.
Finally, looking forward, as Michael said, we continue to expect concerts to scale further in the second half of this year in key markets, notably outdoor and led by the U.S. and U.K. With this activity, we will continue to ramp up our operations, enabling Ticketmaster to run its on-sales, the concerts division to book and market 2022 tours and sponsorship staff to support delivery for brands on site and online. Given the COVID issues in our key markets appear to be short term at this point, we continue to expect 2022 activity and results to exceed 2019 levels, with continued growth opportunities from there.

So my expectation is that we will see that continue, whether at the artist level, at the city level like New York just announced, or they're large crowds. Frankly, Lollapalooza certainly went above and beyond what was happening at baseball games in Chicago. And similarly, I think in other markets, we're going above what others are doing. 
So we'll continue to focus on that. I think the great news is that at this point, the discussion is around what are the requirements to hold the events, what do we need to see in terms of vaccinations and testing. Not hearing discussions certainly in the U.S. or the U.K. about impacting those shows to any scale."

We like to always point out we think that the product is still underpriced given all of the secondary business. So this is still an attractive night out for a fan. Now that artist is traveling more around the world, the fan base has grown for live as a functional entertainment item.

And it's not going to be totally linear. We had a great month of June in TM, and we're finally getting back to scale there. And we expect to have nice scale with Ticketmaster in the second half, but the first part of the year was lower scale. 
So overall, yes, we expect margins to improve because a large chunk of that $200 million is going to come out of Ticketmaster, and that would just naturally flow into a margin.

And I thought one of the more interesting developments in the quarter was the extension and expansion of your relationship with ASM for 2 reasons. One is that ASM is obviously half AEG and it didn't go to AXS, but more so, that Ticketmaster could sell tickets for Live Nation promoted shows in the other ASM venues. And the North American ticket model has been exclusive for as long as I can remember at least. Is this a sign of change in the future? Do you think that exclusivity model is here to stay? Or do you think depending on event type, the promoter will ultimately control the ticket?"

I think the exclusive approach has worked well for the venues, and the ecosystem is a large part of how the venues get funded and how the venues then make the rental costs approachable for promoters and artists. So it's an ecosystem that's worked well in the U.S., and the Ticketmaster, as you know, has been a very large source of funding and the profit stream for the venues. 
I wouldn't read too much into this. If you look at ASM's scale, that's not a common typical scale in terms of the number of buildings they have. It's also a fairly unique situation where you have somebody who owns buildings who's saying we're going to let you bring in Ticketmaster regardless of the situation and they control both sides of that decision-making. It's not something that we are looking to do or that we see as any real mark of the industry going forward."

I assume they would have liked to have used their own in-house ticketing system. But I think our relationship and what we've done for all those venues for so long won us that business and that renewal. 
So that was a very important renewal, a very good testament to Ticketmaster. I give the ASM management team credit. They put their bias aside and went with the best option in the marketplace after looking at all options. So we are very proud that that's a very good testament to the Ticketmaster core competency.

The 2021 summer concert season rebounded qui",787,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Live Music roared back over the past quarter driving all our business segments to positive AOI for the first time in 2 years, with company-wide AOI of $306 million. The 2021 summer concert season rebounded quickly with 17 million fans attending our shows in the quarter as return to live reflected tremendous pent-up demand. Festivals were a large part of our return to live this summer with many of our festivals selling out in record time and overall ticket sales for major festivals was up 10% versus 2019. And we had a number of our tours already sell over 500,000 tickets for tours this year, including sell out tours by Harry Styles, Chris Stapleton and others. In addition to increasing attendance, strong demand also enabled improving pricing with average amphitheater and major festival pricing up double digits relative to 2019. And that our shows fan spend at record levels with on-site spending per fan up over 20% in both asperities and festivals compared to 2019. 
We delivered these results with an operating environment that required us to wrap up quickly, institute new health and safety protocols and staff are frontline in a tight labor market. On the health and safety front, we set the industry standard by requiring proof of vaccine or testing for our shows with no change in fan purchase behavior. More importantly, our protocols proved effective at mitigating major COVID disruptions to our business in the U.S. and U.K. and allowed us to work in conjunction with local health officials to mitigate transmission risks from our events. 
On the labor front, we were able to set staffing requirements for our peak outdoor season without any show disruptions. We also saw strong fan demand in our Ticketmaster results. We delivered its highest AOI quarter ever, Q3 was Ticketmaster's fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter excluding refunds, led by sports leagues restarting and concert on sales for 2022 wrapping up. In addition, Ticketmaster's secondary business delivered its highest GTV month in September, showing continued growth in this segment even as artists and content owners continue shifting more of the value to primary sales. And as the fans came back so did our brand partners, who continue to seek to connect to the live music fan. As a result, our sponsorship and advertising business delivered over $100 million in AOI for the quarter, the first time at this level since Q3 of 2019. The return of sponsorship and advertising has been largely driven by historic major partners, along with the addition of new brands, including Truly Hard Seltzer as well as Coinbase and Solana in the FinTech segment. 
As we look forward to 2022, we are encouraged by all our leading indicators across each business. Through October, our confirmed show count across amphitheaters, arenas, stadium shows is up double digits relative to the point in 2019 for 2020 shows. And through mid-October, we have already sold 22 million tickets for our shows in 2022. And demand has been stronger than ever for many of these on sales with 1 million tickets sold for each of the Coldplay and Red Hot Chili Pepper tours and several other tours already selling over 500,000 tickets. Ticketmaster's on sale for 2022 also reinforces this demand, as we expect Q4 transacted fee-bearing GTV to be at record level, even after already selling 65 million fee-bearing tickets for events next year. 
Ticketmaster has also added clients representing over 14 million net new fee-bearing tickets so far this year, further accelerate its growth on a global basis. And our sponsorship and advertising business had similar success, this confirmed pipeline for 2022 up double digits relative to this time in 2019 and 2020. But at the same time, we are continuing our cost focus well over $200 million in structural savings from our pre-pandemic 2020 plan, making us more nimble and better positioned to invest for future growth. As we get close to turning the page on 2021, I remain more convinced than ever in the power and potential of live entertainment in the strength of our position. 
No industry was more impacted by the pandemic over the last 2 years and no industry as so proven the durability of its demand in the face of such disruption. I fully expect we will continue to have bumps in the road in the coming months, and it will take some time for international artists to be touring on a truly global basis, but the fundamental strength of live entertainment and Live Nation has proven out and expect we will only continue to grow from here. With that, I will let Joe take you through more details on our results."
384687,1685813977,2426262,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the detail in each business, a few points of context for the quarter. First, this is primarily a U.S. and U.K. driven quarter. These markets accounted for 95% of our fans in Q3 versus 75%",1046,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the detail in each business, a few points of context for the quarter. First, this is primarily a U.S. and U.K. driven quarter. These markets accounted for 95% of our fans in Q3 versus 75% in Q3 of 2019. And they represented 90% of fee-bearing GTV in Q3 versus 80% in Q3 of 2019. Second, our contracts activity primarily ramped up in August with 90% of our attendance for shows occurring in August and September. 
Let me now go into more detail on the divisions. First concerts. As Michael noted, pricing and on-site spending was up for both our amphitheaters and our major festivals in the U.S. and U.K. with almost 1,200 amphitheater shows played off. These shows give us the best data set for comparing to 2019. So I'll give you more detail on trends for these shows. And in general, the same trends also hold for our festivals. On pricing, average ticket pricing at our amphitheaters was up 17% to $63. There are 2 primary drivers to this. First, ticket pricing, including more platinum and VIP tickets for shows this year increased average ticket pricing by $7. Secondly, our concert week promotion and other promotions were smaller scale this year, which had an impact of $2 per ticket. And for on-site spending, average fan spending was up 25% to $36. This growth came from a combination of more orders per fan, more items per order and higher average spend per order. Many of our fans shifted to buying higher-priced products, which was part of our higher spend per order. And the shift to cashless also helped as card transactions have historically been larger than cash transactions and this has held up as we shifted to 100% cashless. 
Finally, operating costs, including labor costs were up. These higher labor costs are driven by several factors, fewer shows per building or accelerated ramp-up to open the buildings this summer, new health and safety protocols and a generally tightened labor market. At the same time, as noted with increased average ticket price and higher on-site spending, we increased the contribution margin per fan and did so to such a level that our profitability per fan, net of operating expenses rose double digits. 
Turning now to Ticketmaster. As Michael said, Ticketmaster had a record AOI of $172 million for the quarter, driven by its fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter excluding refunds, and lower cost structure from its reorganization along with lower ramp up labor costs as we accelerated activity faster than the return of staff. Primary ticketing was driven substantially by concerts, which accounted for over 70% of fee-bearing GTV, while sports was the second largest category. And together, they represented approximately 90% of all fee-bearing GTV. 
Geographically, North America accounted for 80% of fee-bearing GTV as activity remained limited internationally outside the U.K. In secondary ticketing, we similarly saw concerts and sports account for over 90% of fee-bearing GTV, though in this case, sports was the primary driver with the launch of new football and basketball seasons. Another contributor to our growth in ticketing is the continued signing of new clients with over 14 million net new fee-bearing tickets added this year through the third quarter. These new client additions have been particularly strong internationally, accounting for 2/3 of our new client tickets. 
Finally sponsorship, sponsorship AOI surpassed $100 million in the quarter for the first time in 2 years. as it again had available ad units at scale, both on-site and online. Like our other businesses, it was largely U.S. and U.K. driven, together accounting for approximately 90% of total activity. And as activity resumed, we were also able to engage new sponsors, adding 8 new strategic sponsors in the quarter. As we look to Q4, we see a continuation of the same trends we had in Q3. With concerts, we expect North America and the U.K. to continue ramping toward historical activity levels, while the rest of Europe and other international markets have limited activity given the lead time to plan concerts. 
With Ticketing, we expect a broader recovery as most European markets put stadium and arena tours on sale in Q4 and enabling GTV levels that could approach Q4 2019 levels despite 65 million fee-bearing tickets already being sold for 2022 events. And while Q4 is typically a seasonally slower period for sponsorship, it too should benefit from concerts and ticketing sales ramping up. 
Let us now turn to our cash and cost management. We had free cash of $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter, which includes $450 million earmarked for the OCESA acquisition. This was our first quarter since 2019 and where our cash contribution margin was higher than our cash burn, contributing a net $166 million in free cash. We also added $850 million in cash in the quarter through our $400 million drawdown of our Term A loan and $450 million equity raise for OCESA mentioned previously. We then had free cash reduced by $370 million, largely resulting from long-term deferred revenue shifting into short term for shows next summer, as we previously indicated would be happening. This improved cash position was also helped by our ongoing cost and cash management program as this year, we expect to reduce costs by $900 million and cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to pre-pandemic plans and on the cash side, excluding OCESA. As we prepare for 2022 plans, we remain confident that we have structurally reduced our operating costs by $200 million relative to our pre-pandemic 2020 plans. 
A few other balance sheet items. Our deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion. This is compared to $950 million at the end of Q3 of 2019, which gives us the best like-for-like view of the demand pipeline already in place? And then a reminder on our debt that we continue with our liquidity covenants until we report Q4 this year, at which point, we switch to a more traditional leverage test. Given our current liquidity and expected Q4 and 2022 activity levels, we do not anticipate any covenant issues through next year and expect to continue investing in growth. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?"

Just on operating with the reduced cost structure, we had the benefit, if you will, of really 0 basing our cost structure over the past 1.5 years. So -- and we talked through at various points, a lot of it around Ticketmaster's globalization and how we revised our approach on the concert side. So we're not seeing any issues in terms of operating with this renewed cost structure because it's been a pretty methodical laid out approach to how we want to run the business. And then I think as we move forward and we continue to grow the business, our expectations is that the incremental profitability of our business is as good or better than it's ever been and there continues to be a long runway to do so. In terms of the labor constraint as we talked, we were able to put on all of our shows this year without any issues. Looking forward to next year, -- At the end, it probably -- we don't think that there's any issue in terms of getting back to the level of activity that we've had or the level of activity that we're talking about in terms of our pipeline of shows. Ultimately, that is what the short-term constraint is in terms of why we won't be doing 45 mega tours, but you can't have 80% growth in a given year. Does have to do with some of the short-term ability to get your buses or to get your staff. But there's no long-term constraints for the growth, and we're still able to grow it in next year. In terms of the costs incurred, it's different pieces for different folks. The artists are generally responsible for their crew and their operations that they're being out on the road and we're responsible for the venues that we operate."

We would have concern, but we surprisingly were able to fully staff all of those jobs. As Joe said, marginal cost increased a few million dollars. So we did see that the part-time seasonal workforce that needed to come back to help kind of make the machine work were eager to get back. So we didn't have that challenge. I think we're going to keep looking at how we do a better job of attracting and retaining them in today's environment, but we don't see that as a cost challenge. We think it's an exciting category. So a lot of people like coming to work at the amphitheater the club, the theater lifestyle-type job. And as Joe said, we have no supply chain issues.

We already are well over 200 venues that we operate somewhere in the world, amphitheaters, theaters, clubs, arenas in Dublin, Poland, et cetera. So we know that the venue when we go vertical is a high-margin business for us. And I consider festivals, almost venues because you get to own the real estate for the weekend, you're owning all the revenue streams. So any time that we can put a show in our festival or our venue on ticketed by Ticketmasters, have our sponsorship able to use the asset and count all the revenue streams, it's our highest margin business. What we've seen over time now is in the last 5 years, is there's been a new real estate boom around the world where every major city in the world looks at live entertainment, much like they used to look at movie theaters as being this incredible tenant in their development. 
So we are talking ongoing to multiple developers around the world who are building something and they want a 2,000-seat, a 5,000 seat or 7,000 seat, maybe an arena an anchor into 1 of their developments. So we've really ramped up that division over the last 2 years, and we see great opportunity around the world to continue to expand our venue portfolio in these prime markets. I mean, Austin is an example where there's no arena. We're going to open that arena in the next couple of years. It's going to be a monster of a return for us as a great single venue in the Austin market right now for live shows to complement our club, our theater, our amphitheater portfolio. So we'll continue to be very opportunistic in the markets around the world where there's an opening for a live venue of any size."

This is Joe. I'll start. On the pricing and the per cap, I think we believe this is structurally a level of spend that we're seeing from the consumer now on the pricing, heavily driven by the front of the house, the best seats, where we've long known there's this arbitrage because of the size and continued growth of the secondary market is even as we've been pricing and moving more money to the artists over the past several years. So this year, that trend continued, more VIP, more platinum tickets getting that money to the artist. And we're seeing a relatively strong inelasticity on the demand for those best tickets. And then on the on-site, I think because we're seeing it come from a number of fronts, we're confident that it's staying. So we talked about it in the comments, right, moving from cash to cashless. It just opens up increased spend. It's been a long existing difference between those 2, moving to 100% cashless just raises the average because instead of being half of each. And then we're seeing, again, structural trends. People are going to a bit higher quality in terms of some of the alcohol, some of our product offerings are making more of a deal for people to take higher price point products. 
So all of those, we think, are a continuation of the trends that we've seen over the past several years and have no reason to expect that, that would be any different going forward. In terms of the cadence for shows next year, in general, and Michael talked about this a bit, you'll see similar where Q2 and Q3 will continue to be our strongest quarters. That's when we'll have a great stadium next year. looks to be far and away the largest stadium mirror we've had. That will be primarily in those Q2, Q3 outdoor months. Obviously, our amphitheater and festivals, largely those months. And even the arena, certainly here in the U.S., you just have more avails in those months because of the timing of the sports season. So there's no reason not to expect similar seasonality in general as we've had historically."

And secondly, as we also talked, this is much more of a U.S. driven and then secondly, U.K. driven. And we've talked historically about the fact that the U.S. market is a higher service fee and therefore, generally a higher margin market than internationally. So some of that mix shift will convert back next year. I don't think we're ready to give exact numbers, but we certainly do think that the ticketing margin will improve relative to historical."

The 2021 summer concert season rebounded qu",787,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Live Music roared back over the past quarter, driving all our business segments to positive AOI for the first time in 2 years, with company-wide AOI of $306 million. The 2021 summer concert season rebounded quickly with 17 million fans attending our shows in the quarter as our return to live reflected tremendous pent-up demand. Festivals were a large part of our return to live this summer, with many of our festivals selling out in record time and overall ticket sales for major festivals was up 10% versus 2019. And we had a number of our tours already sell over 500,000 tickets for tours this year, including sellout tours by Harry Styles, Chris Stapleton and others. In addition to increasing attendance, strong demand also enabled improving pricing with average amphitheater and major festival pricing up double digits relative to 2019. And at our shows, fans spent at record levels, with on-site spending per fan up over 20% in both amphitheaters and festivals compared to 2019. 
We delivered these results with an operating environment that required us to ramp up quickly, institute new health and safety protocols and staff our frontline in a tight labor market. On the health and safety front, we set the industry standard by requiring proof of vaccine or testing for our shows with no change in fan purchase behavior. More importantly, our protocols proved effective at mitigating major COVID disruptions to our business in the U.S. and U.K. and allowed us to work in conjunction with local health officials to mitigate transmission risks from our events. 
On the labor front, we were able to set staffing requirements for our peak outdoor season without any show disruptions. We also saw strong fan demand in our Ticketmaster results. We delivered its highest AOI quarter ever. Q3 was Ticketmaster's fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter excluding refunds, led by sports leagues restarting and concert on sales for 2022 wrapping up. In addition, Ticketmaster's secondary business delivered its highest GTV month in September, showing continued growth in this segment even as artists and content owners continue shifting more of the value to primary sales. And as the fans came back, so did our brand partners, who continue to seek to connect to the live music fan. As a result, our sponsorship and advertising business delivered over $100 million in AOI for the quarter, the first time at this level since Q3 of 2019. The return of sponsorship and advertising has been largely driven by historic major partners, along with the addition of new brands, including Truly Hard Seltzer as well as Coinbase and Solana in the FinTech segment. 
As we look forward to 2022, we are encouraged by all our leading indicators across each business. Through October, our confirmed show count across amphitheaters, arenas, stadium shows is up double digits relative to the point in 2019 for 2020  shows. And to mid-October, we have already sold 22 million tickets for our shows in 2022. And demand has been stronger than ever for many of these on sales, with 1 million tickets sold for each of the Coldplay and Red Hot Chili Pepper tours, and several other tours already selling over 500,000 tickets. Ticketmaster's on sale for 2022 also reinforces this demand, as we expect Q4 transacted fee-bearing GTV to be at record level, even after already selling 65 million fee-bearing tickets for events next year. 
Ticketmaster has also added clients representing over 14 million net new fee-bearing tickets so far this year, further accelerating its growth on a global basis. And our sponsorship and advertising business had similar success, this confirmed pipeline for 2022 up double digits relative to this time in 2019 for 2020. But at the same time, we are continuing our cost focus well over $200 million in structural savings from our pre-pandemic 2020 plan, making us more nimble and better positioned to invest for future growth. As we get close to turning the page on 2021, I remain more convinced than ever in the power and potential of live entertainment and the strength of our position. 
No industry was more impacted by the pandemic over the last 2 years and no industry has so proven the durability of its demand in the face of such disruption. I fully expect we will continue to have bumps in the road in the coming months, and it will take some time for international artists to be touring on a truly global basis, but the fundamental strength of live entertainment and Live Nation has proven out, and expect we will only continue to grow from here. With that, I will let Joe take you through more details on our results."
384687,1685813977,2426498,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the detail in each business, a few points of context for the quarter. First, this is primarily a U.S. and U.K. driven quarter. These markets accounted for 95% of our fans in Q3 versus 75%",1042,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the detail in each business, a few points of context for the quarter. First, this is primarily a U.S. and U.K. driven quarter. These markets accounted for 95% of our fans in Q3 versus 75% in Q3 of 2019. And they represented 90% of fee-bearing GTV in Q3 versus 80% in Q3 of 2019. Second, our concerts activity primarily ramped up in August, with 90% of our attendance for shows occurring in August and September. 
Let me now go into more detail on the divisions. First, concerts. As Michael noted, pricing and on-site spending was up for both our amphitheaters and our major festivals in the U.S. and U.K. With almost 1,200 amphitheater shows played off, these shows give us the best data set for comparing to 2019. So I'll give you more detail on trends for these shows. And in general, the same trends also hold for our festivals. On pricing, average ticket pricing at our amphitheaters was up 17% to $63. There are 2 primary drivers to this. First, ticket pricing, including more platinum and VIP tickets for shows this year, increased average ticket pricing by $7. Secondly, our concert week promotion and other promotions were smaller scale this year, which had an impact of $2 per ticket. And for on-site spending, average fan spending was up 25% to $36. This growth came from a combination of more orders per fan, more items per order and higher average spend per order. Many of our fans shifted to buying higher-priced products, which was part of our higher spend per order. And the shift to cashless also helped, as card transactions have historically been larger than cash transactions and this has held up as we shifted to 100% cashless. 
Finally, operating costs, including labor costs, were up. These higher labor costs are driven by several factors: fewer shows per building, our accelerated ramp-up to open the buildings this summer, new health and safety protocols and a generally tightened labor market. At the same time, as noted with increased average ticket price and higher on-site spending, we increased the contribution margin per fan and did so to such a level that our profitability per fan, net of operating expenses, rose double digits. 
Turning now to Ticketmaster. As Michael said, Ticketmaster had a record AOI of $172 million for the quarter, driven by its fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter excluding refunds, and lower cost structure from its reorganization, along with lower ramp-up labor costs as we accelerated activity faster than the return of staff. Primary ticketing was driven substantially by concerts, which accounted for over 70% of fee-bearing GTV, while sports was the second largest category. And together, they represented approximately 90% of all fee-bearing GTV. 
Geographically, North America accounted for 80% of fee-bearing GTV as activity remained limited internationally outside the U.K. In secondary ticketing, we similarly saw concerts and sports account for over 90% of fee-bearing GTV, though in this case, sports was the primary driver with the launch of new football and basketball seasons. Another contributor to our growth in ticketing is the continued signing of new clients, with over 14 million net new fee-bearing tickets added this year through the third quarter. These new client additions have been particularly strong internationally, accounting for 2/3 of our new client tickets. 
Finally, sponsorship. Sponsorship AOI surpassed $100 million in the quarter for the first time in 2 years, as it again had available ad units at scale, both on-site and online. Like our other businesses, it was largely U.S. and U.K. driven, together accounting for approximately 90% of total activity. And as activity resumed, we were also able to engage new sponsors, adding 8 new strategic sponsors in the quarter. As we look to Q4, we see a continuation of the same trends we had in Q3. With concerts, we expect North America and the U.K. to continue ramping toward historical activity levels, while the rest of Europe and other international markets have limited activity given the lead time to plan concerts. 
With Ticketing, we expect a broader recovery as most European markets put stadium and arena tours on sale in Q4, enabling GTV levels that could approach Q4 2019 levels despite 65 million fee-bearing tickets already being sold for 2022 events. And while Q4 is typically a seasonally slower period for sponsorship, it too should benefit from concerts and ticketing sales ramping up. 
Let us now turn to our cash and cost management. We had free cash of $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter, which includes $450 million earmarked for the OCESA acquisition. This was our first quarter since 2019 where our cash contribution margin was higher than our cash burn, contributing a net $166 million in free cash. We also added $850 million in cash in the quarter through our $400 million drawdown of our Term A loan, and $450 million equity raise for OCESA mentioned previously. We then had free cash reduced by $370 million, largely resulting from long-term deferred revenue shifting into short-term for shows next summer, as we previously indicated would be happening. This improved cash position was also helped by our ongoing cost and cash management program, as this year we expect to reduce costs by $900 million and cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to pre-pandemic plans and on the cash side, excluding OCESA. As we prepare for 2022 plans, we remain confident that we have structurally reduced our operating costs by $200 million relative to our pre-pandemic 2020 plans. 
A few other balance sheet items. Our deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion. This is compared to $950 million at the end of Q3 of 2019, which gives us the best like-for-like view of the demand pipeline already in place. And then a reminder on our debt that we continue with our liquidity covenants until we report Q4 this year, at which point we switch to a more traditional leverage test. Given our current liquidity and expected Q4 and 2022 activity levels, we do not anticipate any covenant issues through next year, and expect to continue investing in growth. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?"

Just on operating with the reduced cost structure, we had the benefit, if you will, of really 0 basing our cost structure over the past 1.5 years. So -- and we've talked through at various points a lot of it around Ticketmaster's globalization and how we revised our approach on the concert side. So we're not seeing any issues in terms of operating with this renewed cost structure because it's been a pretty methodical laid out approach to how we want to run the business. And then I think as we move forward and we continue to grow the business, our expectations is that the incremental profitability of our business is as good or better than it's ever been, and that there continues to be a long runway to do so. In terms of the labor constraint as we talked, we were able to put on all of our shows this year without any issues. Looking forward to next year, at the end, it probably -- we don't think that there's any issue in terms of getting back to the level of activity that we've had or the level of activity that we're talking about in terms of our pipeline of shows. Ultimately, that is what the short-term constraint is in terms of why we won't be doing 45 mega tours, why you can't have 80% growth in a given year does have to do with some of the short-term ability to get your buses or to get your staff. But there's no long-term constraints for the growth, and we're still able to grow it in next year. In terms of the costs incurred, it's different pieces for different folks. The artist is generally responsible for their crew and their operations that their being out on the road, and we're responsible for the venues that we operate."

I think we're going to keep looking at how we do a better job of attracting and retaining them in today's environment, but we don't see that as a cost challenge. We think it's an exciting category. So a lot of people like coming to work at the amphitheater, the club, the theater, the lifestyle-type job. And as Joe said, we have no supply chain issues. The artist gets on stage, there's plenty of trucks, lights, staging, et cetera, to make the machine work on a global basis."

So we think internationally, on a global basis by April, the world will be moving around again. Doesn't overly affect our business short term, because most of the outdoor stadium festival business is summertime. So that will be all fully up and rolling.

I always think we kind of underestimate bragging about our venue portfolio. We already are well over 200 venues that we operate somewhere in the world, amphitheaters, theaters, clubs, arenas in Dublin, Poland, et cetera. So we know that the venue when we go vertical is a high-margin business for us. And I consider festivals almost venues, because you get to own the real estate for the weekend, you're owning all the revenue streams. So any time that we can put a show in our festival or our venue on ticketed by Ticketmasters, have our sponsorship able to use the asset and count all the revenue streams, it's our highest-margin business. What we've seen over time now is in the last 5 years, is there's been a new real estate boom around the world where every major city in the world looks at live entertainment much like they used to look at movie theaters, as being this incredible tenant in their development. 
So we are talking ongoing to multiple developers around the world who are building something and they want a 2,000-seat, a 5,000 seat, a 7,000 seat, maybe an arena, as an anchor into 1 of their developments. So we've really ramped up that division over the last 2 years, and we see great opportunity around the world to continue to expand our venue portfolio in these prime markets. I mean, Austin is an example where there's no arena. We're going to open that arena in the next couple of years. It's going to be a monster of a return for us as a great single venue in the Austin market right now for live shows to complement our club, our theater, our amphitheater portfolio. So we'll continue to be very opportunistic in the markets around the world where there's an opening for a live venue of any size."

This is Joe. I'll start. On the pricing and the per caps, I think we believe this is structurally a level of spend that we're seeing from the consumer now on the pricing, heavily driven by the front of the house, the best seats, where we've long known there's this arbitrage because of the size and continued growth of the secondary market even as we've been pricing and moving more money to the artists over the past several years. So this year, that trend continued, more VIP, more platinum tickets getting that money to the artist. And we're seeing a relatively strong inelasticity on the demand for those best tickets. And then on the on-site, I think because we're seeing it come from a number of fronts, we're confident that it's staying. So we talked about it in the comments, right, moving from cash to cashless. It just opens up increased spend. It's been a long existing difference between those 2, moving to 100% cashless just raises the average because instead of being half of each. And then we're seeing, again, structural trends. People are going to a bit higher quality in terms of some of the alcohol, some of our product offerings are making more of a deal for people to take higher price point products. 
So all of those, we think, are a continuation of the trends that we've seen over the past several years and have no reason to expect that, that would be any different going forward. In terms of the cadence for shows next year, in general, and Michael talked about this a bit, you'll see similar where Q2 and Q3 will continue to be our strongest quarters. That's when we'll have a great stadium next year. Looks to be far and away the largest stadium year we've had. That will be primarily in those Q2, Q3 outdoor months. Obviously, our amphitheater and festivals, largely those months. And even the arena, certainly here in the U.S., you just have more avails in those months because of the timing of the sports season. So there's no reason not to expect similar seasonality in general as we've had historically."

So we pushed our people and extracted more from that side. And secondly, as we also talked, this is much more of a U.S. driven and then secondly, U.K. driven.

Live Music roared back over the past quarter, driving all our business segments to positive AOI for the first time in 2 years, with company-wide AOI of $306 million. The 2021 summer concert season rebounded quickly with 17 million fans attending our shows in the quarter as our return to live reflected tremendous pent-up demand. Festivals were a large part of our return to live this summer, with many of our festivals selling out in record time and overall ticket sales for major festivals was up 10% versus 2019. And we had a number of our tours already sell over 500,000 tickets for tours this year, including sellout tours by Harry Styles, Chris Stapleton and others. In addition to increasing attendance, strong demand also enabled improving pricing with average amphitheater and major festival pricing up double digits relative to 2019. And at our shows, fans spent at record levels, with on-site spending per fan up over 20% in both amphitheaters and festivals compared to 2019. 
We delivered these results with an operating environment that required us to ramp up quickly, institute new health and safety protocols and staff our frontline in a tight labor market. On the health and safety front, we set the industry standard by requiring proof of vaccine or testing for our shows with no change in fan purchase behavior. More importantly, our protocols proved effective at mitigating major COVID disruptions to our business in the U.S. and U.K. and allowed us to work in conjunction with local health officials to mitigate transmission risks from our events. 
On the labor front, we were able to set staffing requirements for our peak outdoor season without any show disruptions. We also saw strong fan demand in our Ticketmaster results. We delivered its highest AOI quarter ever. Q3 was Ticketmaster's fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter excluding refunds, led by sports leagues restarting and concert on sales for 2022 wrapping up. In addition, Ticketmaster's secondary business delivered its highest GTV month in September, showing continued growth in this segment even as artists and content owners continue shifting more of the value to primary sales. And as the fans came back, so did our brand partners, who continue to seek to connect to the live music fan. As a result, our sponsorship and advertising business delivered over $100 million in AOI for the quarter, the first time at this level since Q3 of 2019. The return of sponsorship and advertising has been largely driven by historic major partners, along with the addition of new brands, including Truly Hard Seltzer as well as Coinbase and Solana in the FinTech segment. 
As we look forward to 2022, we are encouraged by all our leading indicators across each business. Through October, our confirmed show count across amphitheaters, arenas, stadium shows is up double digits relative to the point in 2019 for 2020  shows. And to mid-October, we have already sold 22 million tickets for our shows in 2022. And demand has been stronger than ever for many of these on sales, with 1 million tickets sold for each of the Coldplay and Red Hot Chili Pepper tours, and several other tours already selling over 500,000 tickets. Ticketmaster's on sale for 2022 also reinforces this demand, as we expect Q4 transacted fee-bearing GTV to be at record level, even after already selling 65 million fee-bearing tickets for events next year. 
Ticketmaster has also added clients representing over 14 million net new fee-bearing tickets so far this year, further accelerating its growth on a global basis. And our sponsorship and advertising business had similar success, this confirmed pipeline for 2022 up double digits relative to this time in 2019 for 2020. But at the same time, we are continuing our cost focus well over $200 million in structural savings from our pre-pandemic 2020 plan, making us more nimble and better positioned to invest for future growth. As we get close to turning the page on 2021, I remain more convinced than ever in the power and potential of live entertainment and the strength of our position. 
No industry was more impacted by the pandemic over the last 2 years and no industry has so proven the durability of its demand in the face of such disruption. I fully expect we will continue to have bumps in the road in the coming months, and it will take some time for international artists to be touring on a truly global basis, but the fundamental strength of live entertainment and Live Nation has proven out, and expect we will only continue to grow from here. With that, I will let Joe take you through more details on our results."
384687,1685813977,2426511,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the detail in each business, a few points of context for the quarter. First, this is primarily a U.S. and U.K. driven quarter. These markets accounted for 95% of our fans in Q3 versus 75%",1042,"Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before getting into the detail in each business, a few points of context for the quarter. First, this is primarily a U.S. and U.K. driven quarter. These markets accounted for 95% of our fans in Q3 versus 75% in Q3 of 2019. And they represented 90% of fee-bearing GTV in Q3 versus 80% in Q3 of 2019. Second, our concerts activity primarily ramped up in August, with 90% of our attendance for shows occurring in August and September. 
Let me now go into more detail on the divisions. First, concerts. As Michael noted, pricing and on-site spending was up for both our amphitheaters and our major festivals in the U.S. and U.K. With almost 1,200 amphitheater shows played off, these shows give us the best data set for comparing to 2019. So I'll give you more detail on trends for these shows. And in general, the same trends also hold for our festivals. On pricing, average ticket pricing at our amphitheaters was up 17% to $63. There are 2 primary drivers to this. First, ticket pricing, including more platinum and VIP tickets for shows this year, increased average ticket pricing by $7. 
Secondly, our concert week promotion and other promotions were smaller scale this year, which had an impact of $2 per ticket. And for on-site spending, average fan spending was up 25% to $36. This growth came from a combination of more orders per fan, more items per order and higher average spend per order. Many of our fans shifted to buying higher-priced products, which was part of our higher spend per order. And the shift to cashless also helped, as card transactions have historically been larger than cash transactions and this has held up as we shifted to 100% cashless. 
Finally, operating costs, including labor costs, were up. These higher labor costs are driven by several factors: fewer shows per building, our accelerated ramp-up to open the buildings this summer, new health and safety protocols and a generally tightened labor market. At the same time, as noted with increased average ticket price and higher on-site spending, we increased the contribution margin per fan and did so to such a level that our profitability per fan, net of operating expenses, rose double digits. 
Turning now to Ticketmaster. As Michael said, Ticketmaster had a record AOI of $172 million for the quarter, driven by its fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter excluding refunds, and lower cost structure from its reorganization, along with lower ramp-up labor costs as we accelerated activity faster than the return of staff. Primary ticketing was driven substantially by concerts, which accounted for over 70% of fee-bearing GTV, while sports was the second largest category. And together, they represented approximately 90% of all fee-bearing GTV. 
Geographically, North America accounted for 80% of fee-bearing GTV as activity remained limited internationally outside the U.K. In secondary ticketing, we similarly saw concerts and sports account for over 90% of fee-bearing GTV, though in this case, sports was the primary driver with the launch of new football and basketball seasons. Another contributor to our growth in ticketing is the continued signing of new clients, with over 14 million net new fee-bearing tickets added this year through the third quarter. These new client additions have been particularly strong internationally, accounting for 2/3 of our new client tickets. 
Finally, sponsorship. Sponsorship AOI surpassed $100 million in the quarter for the first time in 2 years, as it again had available ad units at scale, both on-site and online. Like our other businesses, it was largely U.S. and U.K. driven, together accounting for approximately 90% of total activity. And as activity resumed, we were also able to engage new sponsors, adding 8 new strategic sponsors in the quarter. As we look to Q4, we see a continuation of the same trends we had in Q3. With concerts, we expect North America and the U.K. to continue ramping toward historical activity levels, while the rest of Europe and other international markets have limited activity given the lead time to plan concerts. 
With Ticketing, we expect a broader recovery as most European markets put stadium and arena tours on sale in Q4, enabling GTV levels that could approach Q4 2019 levels despite 65 million fee-bearing tickets already being sold for 2022 events. And while Q4 is typically a seasonally slower period for sponsorship, it too should benefit from concerts and ticketing sales ramping up. 
Let us now turn to our cash and cost management. We had free cash of $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter, which includes $450 million earmarked for the OCESA acquisition. This was our first quarter since 2019 where our cash contribution margin was higher than our cash burn, contributing a net $166 million in free cash. We also added $850 million in cash in the quarter through our $400 million drawdown of our Term A loan, and $450 million equity raise for OCESA mentioned previously. We then had free cash reduced by $370 million, largely resulting from long-term deferred revenue shifting into short-term for shows next summer, as we previously indicated would be happening. This improved cash position was also helped by our ongoing cost and cash management program, as this year we expect to reduce costs by $900 million and cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to pre-pandemic plans and on the cash side, excluding OCESA. As we prepare for 2022 plans, we remain confident that we have structurally reduced our operating costs by $200 million relative to our pre-pandemic 2020 plans. 
A few other balance sheet items. Our deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion. This is compared to $950 million at the end of Q3 of 2019, which gives us the best like-for-like view of the demand pipeline already in place. And then a reminder on our debt that we continue with our liquidity covenants until we report Q4 this year, at which point we switch to a more traditional leverage test. Given our current liquidity and expected Q4 and 2022 activity levels, we do not anticipate any covenant issues through next year, and expect to continue investing in growth. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator?"

Just on operating with the reduced cost structure, we had the benefit, if you will, of really 0 basing our cost structure over the past 1.5 years. So -- and we've talked through at various points a lot of it around Ticketmaster's globalization and how we revised our approach on the concert side. So we're not seeing any issues in terms of operating with this renewed cost structure because it's been a pretty methodical laid out approach to how we want to run the business. And then I think as we move forward and we continue to grow the business, our expectations is that the incremental profitability of our business is as good or better than it's ever been, and that there continues to be a long runway to do so. 
In terms of the labor constraint as we talked, we were able to put on all of our shows this year without any issues. Looking forward to next year, at the end, it probably -- we don't think that there's any issue in terms of getting back to the level of activity that we've had or the level of activity that we're talking about in terms of our pipeline of shows. Ultimately, that is what the short-term constraint is in terms of why we won't be doing 45 mega tours, why you can't have 80% growth in a given year does have to do with some of the short-term ability to get your buses or to get your staff. But there's no long-term constraints for the growth, and we're still able to grow it in next year. In terms of the costs incurred, it's different pieces for different folks. The artist is generally responsible for their crew and their operations that their being out on the road, and we're responsible for the venues that we operate."

We would have had concern, but we surprisingly were able to fully staff all of those jobs. As Joe said, marginal cost increased a few million dollars. So we did see that the part-time seasonal workforce that needed to come back to help kind of make the machine work, were eager to get back. So we didn't have that challenge. I think we're going to keep looking at how we do a better job of attracting and retaining them in today's environment, but we don't see that as a cost challenge. We think it's an exciting category. So a lot of people like coming to work at the amphitheater, the club, the theater, the lifestyle-type job. And as Joe said, we have no supply chain issues.

We already are well over 200 venues that we operate somewhere in the world, amphitheaters, theaters, clubs, arenas in Dublin, Poland, et cetera. So we know that the venue when we go vertical is a high-margin business for us. And I consider festivals almost venues, because you get to own the real estate for the weekend, you're owning all the revenue streams. So any time that we can put a show in our festival or our venue on ticketed by Ticketmasters, have our sponsorship able to use the asset and count all the revenue streams, it's our highest-margin business. What we've seen over time now is in the last 5 years, is there's been a new real estate boom around the world where every major city in the world looks at live entertainment much like they used to look at movie theaters, as being this incredible tenant in their development. 
So we are talking ongoing to multiple developers around the world who are building something and they want a 2,000-seat, a 5,000 seat, a 7,000 seat, maybe an arena, as an anchor into 1 of their developments. So we've really ramped up that division over the last 2 years, and we see great opportunity around the world to continue to expand our venue portfolio in these prime markets. I mean, Austin is an example where there's no arena. We're going to open that arena in the next couple of years. It's going to be a monster of a return for us as a great single venue in the Austin market right now for live shows to complement our club, our theater, our amphitheater portfolio. So we'll continue to be very opportunistic in the markets around the world where there's an opening for a live venue of any size."

This is Joe. I'll start. On the pricing and the per caps, I think we believe this is structurally a level of spend that we're seeing from the consumer now on the pricing, heavily driven by the front of the house, the best seats, where we've long known there's this arbitrage because of the size and continued growth of the secondary market even as we've been pricing and moving more money to the artists over the past several years. So this year, that trend continued, more VIP, more platinum tickets getting that money to the artist. And we're seeing a relatively strong inelasticity on the demand for those best tickets. 
And then on the on-site, I think because we're seeing it come from a number of fronts, we're confident that it's staying. So we talked about it in the comments, right, moving from cash to cashless. It just opens up increased spend. It's been a long existing difference between those 2, moving to 100% cashless just raises the average because instead of being half of each. And then we're seeing, again, structural trends. People are going to a bit higher quality in terms of some of the alcohol, some of our product offerings are making more of a deal for people to take higher price point products. 
So all of those, we think, are a continuation of the trends that we've seen over the past several years and have no reason to expect that, that would be any different going forward. In terms of the cadence for shows next year, in general, and Michael talked about this a bit, you'll see similar where Q2 and Q3 will continue to be our strongest quarters. That's when we'll have a great stadium next year. Looks to be far and away the largest stadium year we've had. That will be primarily in those Q2, Q3 outdoor months. Obviously, our amphitheater and festivals, largely those months. And even the arena, certainly here in the U.S., you just have more avails in those months because of the timing of the sports season. So there's no reason not to expect similar seasonality in general as we've had historically."

So it kind of self-regulates itself. You're never going to have a bunch of tours on the same weekend piled on. So that just meant we had more inventory to spread into '22, '23, and we're talking '24 now. So I would say we have a backlog that needs to still work through the system in '22, '23, which will be incredibly strong years. And then we continue to kind of just get back to regular, as we've had over the year, double-digit growth in the live entertainment space ongoing. We project that to continue both on pricing and global volume, as demand and supply continues to grow around the world."

So digital ticketing, as you said, is -- overnight goes from being a nice feature to a critical part of it. Because you're moving away from contactless of any sort, you need a digital ticket, and our leadership there is a big differentiator. We've been investing for a long time. We're not trying to play catch-up. And these tickets are a mix of where we have the full allocation in some markets. In other markets, we have a partial allocation. But in aggregate, it's adding 14 million tickets to the portfolio."

If you want a stadium or arena, high-volume ticket business, with complex season owners and regular tickets, it's a complex business to do at scale. So a lot of our customers, sometimes we may lose a customer, they end up coming back. So one, I just want to remind you, we've been investing in this platform for the last few years. Our enterprise platform is a world-class platform. The U.S. ticket market is the most complicated market in the world. Reserved seats equal seasons seats is a complex model to manage at 10 a.m. on an on-sale with Box and all the things that pressure your system. So when -- at the core, our enterprise platform is really good. 
So when we're out competing for that offering, we end up just being ultimately winning the business because we are the best at it. And we see that because we see the clients that may leave but end up coming back because the functionality that we provide is superior to others. We're seeing this in a Brooklyn arena last week with a competitor trying to do a presale that broke, and that's the pretty basic stuff. So I'd just remind people, we are on a global basis, the best at what we do. That's why clients pick us. And then we happen to be global, and opening up all of our technology to a global base is going to be our great runway for the next while."

So it'd be hard to separate out Delta specifically versus reopening in general. But everything that we saw was more fans going to more shows, consistently contrary to some of the press that I've seen. Very low no-show rates, low to low single-digit increases in terms of no shows as a result of the pandemic. So it seems that the people that want to go to the shows are going to the shows, and that's just continued to grow as a portion of the fan base out there."

So we did -- we weren't sure going into the market what segment or what age demo would react differently or if there would be a difference.
