And we naturally have a lot of good news to talk about today, but I'd say we'd be remiss if we didn't begin by at least acknowledging Rick Fearon and his upcoming retirement. As most of you know, Rick will reach mandatory retirement age of 65 in March and will retire on March 31. And so I'd like to extend a sincere thanks to Rick for his 19 years of service to Eaton. Rick has obviously played just an instrumental role in the transformation shaping of our company and the company that we have today. And he's been a trusted partner to the management team, to our Board and certainly to me personally. And looking back, Rick has participated in more than 75 of these earnings calls, and this will be his last one. So we certainly wish Rick and his family well as he makes this transition onto life after Eaton, if there is life after Eaton. I'm not sure, Rick. But Rick will also be around for another couple of months and also will attend the investor meeting on March 1. 
Moving to Page 4. I'd also like to welcome Tom Okray to Eaton as well. Tom becomes Eaton's CFO effective April 1. Tom was previously the CFO of W.W. Grainger and joined the team in January. Throughout his career, he's held various leadership positions at Advanced Auto Parts, at Amazon and GM. Tom is a seasoned CFO with a strong track record of success, and we anticipate he will bring a very unique perspective and set of skills to the role here at Eaton. He's operational, he's growth-oriented, and he just has outstanding knowledge of distribution channels. Like Rick, Tom is also a global leader who's lived around the world, including several countries in Europe as well as Korea. And so we're very happy to welcome Tom to the Eaton team as well and look forward to his contributions in the future. 
Now on the move to more good news and turning to Page 5. Here, we summarize a number of recent noteworthy accomplishments. And I'll begin with the recent announcements to acquire Tripp Lite for $1.65 billion and Cobham Mission Systems for $2.8 billion, 2 very strategic acquisitions that improve the profitability and, quite frankly, the growth outlook for our company. The acquisition of Tripp Lite will enhance the breadth of our edge computing and distributed IT product portfolio and will also expand our single-phase UPS business in the United States. We're paying approximately 12x 2020 EBITDA and 11x estimated 2021 EBITDA, and we expect this transaction to close in the middle part of 2021. 
Yesterday, we also announced the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems. Cobham is a leading manufacturer of air radar refueling systems, environmental systems and actuation. And Cobham also adds highly complementary products to our company and has a strong position, importantly, on growing defense platforms. We're paying approximately 14x 2020 EBITDA, 13x estimated '21 EBITDA, and we expect this transaction to close in the early part of Q4. 
And if we can just turn to Q4 specifically, we certainly have a stronger-than-expected quarter, and we're pleased with our solid results. Our team just continued to execute well despite the pandemic. Q4 earnings per share of $1.18 on a GAAP basis and $1.28 on an adjusted basis. Our Q4 revenues of $4.7 billion were down 5% organically, which was at the high end of the range that we provided, and it's up 3% versus Q3. And our decremental margins were 21%, also better than the guidance of 25% that we provided. 
I'm also very pleased that with very strong free cash flow. I mean our operating cash flows were $943 million, and our free cash flows were $845 million, both of which exceeded prior year levels. And for 2020, we generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow, which was at the top end of our guidance range, and an all-time record of free cash flow to sales at 14.3%. So a lot of really positive kind of things to talk about there as the business and the company continues to execute well. 
Turning to Page 6, we summarize our Q4 financial results. And I'll only note a few items on this page. First, acquisitions increased sales by 2%, which was more than offset by the divestiture of Lighting and Automotive Fluid Conveyance, which reduced sales by 8%. 
Second, our segment margins of 17.4% were very strong, for sure, and only 40 basis points below prior year despite lower volumes. And then just as a bit of a reminder, I would note that we record all of our charges related to acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring at corporate instead of at the segment level, which hopefully makes it easier to model the company going forward. 
Moving to Page 7, we summarize our Electrical Americas segment. Revenues were down 18%, and this was made up of a 1% decline in organic revenues and then 17% mainly due to the divestiture of Lighting. In this segment, we saw strong growth in data centers and residential markets, which was offset by weakness in industrial and commercial markets. 
Operating margins increased 120 basis points to 21.1%, and this very strong margin performance was due to really effective cost-containment actions but also aided by the divestiture of Lighting. This combination resulted in very strong decremental margin performance of 15%. 
While orders were down 1% on a rolling 12-month basis, data center orders were particularly strong and actually up double digit. Our backlog grew by 12%, and this was driven by strength in both residential and data center markets. 
Lastly, and as I mentioned at the beginning, we're very pleased to announce the acquisition of Tripp Lite. This business is just a tremendous strategic fit with our existing Electrical franchise and allow us to continue to capitalize on this digitalization trend that requires edge computing. And when you think about some of the future estimates suggesting that some 75% of enterprise-generated data will be created and processed via edge computing, we expect this rapid growth to continue for some time to come. 
Next, on Page 8, we show the results of our Electrical Global segment. Revenues declined 5% with a 7% decline in organic revenue, partially offset by 2% positive currency. And this was better than the midpoint of our expectations for the quarter. The lower organic sales were driven by weakness, not surprisingly, in oil and gas and industrial markets. And if you exclude oil and gas and industrial businesses, kind of more project-driven businesses, Europe was down slightly, and Asia Pacific was actually up low single digit. 
Operating margins declined 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And here, once again, decremental margins were well managed at 25%. In this segment, our orders declined 6% on a rolling 12-month basis with continued weakness in oil and gas and industrial markets. And excluding oil and gas and industrial markets, orders were down 1%. And we saw strength in data centers and residential markets. And in fact, data centers were actually up some 30%. 
We also continue to expand our backlog, which was up 14%, driven once again by strength in residential and data center markets. Lastly, we were pleased to announce in mid-December an agreement to buy 50% of HuanYu High Tech, which is based in China. HuanYu manufactures low-voltage circuit breakers and contactors in China and also throughout Asia Pacific. This investment will provide us access to a really strong portfolio of products, and it will open up significant growth opportunities for our company throughout Asia Pacific. And we'd expect this transaction to close sometime in Q2. 
Turning to Page 9, we summarize our Hydraulics segment. Revenues were up 2%, which was all organic. This was much better than the down 7.5% at the midpoint of our guidance as markets just continued to recover faster than anticipated and especially, I'd say, in China and in Europe. Operating margins were 10.5%, up 70 basis points from Q3. 
The momentum in this segment really continued really throughout the quarter, resulting in a 25% increase in Q4 orders with strength in both agriculture and construction equipment markets. We're working towards closing the Hydraulics transaction by the end of the first quarter. I would also add though, but given some of the time needed to complete all of the regulatory approvals, we wouldn't be surprised to see this slip into the early part of the second quarter. 
Next on Page 10, we have the results for our Aerospace segment. As expected, revenues declined 13%, down 25% organically, partially offset by an 11% increase from the acquisition of Souria and 1% positive currency. The organic revenue decline was primarily driven by the continued downturn, as we all know, in commercial markets, partially offset by double-digit growth in military sales. Operating margins declined to 13 -- excuse me, to 18.3%, but we see these at still very healthy levels of performance. 
And lastly, yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems. Cobham, a technology leader in important defense aerospace product lines, will add a number of complementary capabilities to our Aerospace business. The acquisition will significantly increase our exposure to, once again, growing defense platforms. It will enhance our fuel systems business and strongly position our Aerospace business for future growth. 
Moving to Page 11, we summarize our Vehicle segment. Revenues here declined 7%, including a 1% organic decline, negative 5% from the divestiture of our Automotive Fluid Conveyance business and 1% headwind from negative currency. The 1% decline in organic revenues was once again much better than the 8.5% decline at the midpoint of our guidance as both light motor vehicle and truck markets have continued to rebound more quickly than we anticipated. We had particular strength actually in South America and in Asia Pacific. 
NAFTA Class 8 production was down 6% in Q4, but once again, this was better than expected. We're certainly happy also to see the rebound in operating margins of 16.6%, down just slightly versus prior year and up 260 basis points sequentially. And our decremental margin performance here was once again very solid at 23%. 
Turning to Page 12. We show the results of our eMobility segment. Revenues increased 13%, including 11% organic and 2% currency tailwind. Organic growth was also here much higher than the 1.5% growth at the midpoint of our guidance. We experienced solid growth across all regions, which was driven by both high-voltage electrical solutions for passenger cars as well as low-voltage solutions for commercial vehicles. 
Operating margins were a negative 5.9%. And once again, it's just a reflection of the fact that we continue to invest more in R&D and program implementation in this fast-growing segment of the company. We have a robust pipeline of opportunities, and we continue to see electrification as a significant growth opportunity into the future. 
So before we turn our attention to '21, I'd like to take a minute to really summarize our results for 2020, and those are shown on Page 13. First, while the pandemic caused certainly an unprecedented economic volatility and downturn, we remain focused on delivering for all of our stakeholders. We remain focused on keeping our employees safe, delivering for our customers and certainly supporting our communities. And we're also proud of how well we perform for our shareholders. We took the appropriate cost-reduction and cost measurement -- cost-management measures to ensure solid decremental margins of 23% and resilient cash flow of $2.6 billion. Our free cash flow to adjusted earnings conversion was very robust at 149%. And free cash flow to sales was 14.3%, 90 basis points over 2019 and another all-time record. 
We launched a $280 million multiyear restructuring program to reduce fixed costs. This is really targeted mostly in those businesses that have been impacted by the pandemic. And these actions will yield $200 million mature year benefits and make certainly Eaton stronger in the long run. 
We also continue to transform our portfolio, announcing -- or completing divestitures valued at $4.7 billion. We acquired Power Distribution, Inc., and we also announced our intention to acquire 50% of HuanYu High Tech. In addition, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders via buyback and dividend payments. 
And lastly, we delivered very strong shareholder returns, results that were 20 basis points above the median of our peer group. And so we're certainly proud of that performance as well. Overall, certainly proud of the team and certainly even more encouraged by our prospects for the future. 
As we continue to transform Eaton into a company of higher growth, higher margins and more consistent earnings, the company certainly feels like in 2020, we took an important step forward, demonstrating that it is, in fact, a different company, and we're well on our way to delivering against that goal. 
Moving to Page 14, we list our revenue and margin guidance for 2021. Overall, here, we expect organic growth between 4% and 6% with weakness in Q1 followed by strength thereafter, and obviously, given the comparisons, particular strength in Q2. In both our Electrical segments, we expect organic growth to be 3% to 5%. And just starting with the Americas, we expect to see continued strength in residential, data center and utility markets, solid growth in industrial control markets and ongoing weakness in commercial construction markets. 
In Electrical Global, we anticipate strength in residential, data centers, utility and industrial control markets, so very much like in the Americas, offset by softness in commercial construction and in the oil and gas market. And for Hydraulics, we expect organic growth to be between 4% and 6% with broadly improving markets around the world. And in Aerospace, we expect organic growth of 2% to 4% with strength in military, offset by continued weakness in commercial markets. And for Vehicle, we anticipate strong organic growth, some 10% to 12%, with strength in both light vehicle markets and truck markets. And just as a reminder here, our Eaton Cummins joint venture will actually consolidate the revenues associated with this particular joint venture. And so much of this growth will show up in the joint venture, not in Eaton's revenue. And in eMobility, organic growth is expected to be up 14% to 16% driven by strength in electric vehicles globally. 
Turning to segment margins. We expect Eaton to be between 17.8% and 18%. At the midpoint, it's 140 basis points improvement over 2020, and importantly, 20 basis points over the pre-pandemic levels in 2019. 
If we could turn to Page 15. And really, before we discuss the rest of our 2020 guidance, we'd like to show you the math behind our new definition of adjusted EPS. In 2020, we're revising our definition of adjusted EPS to add back amortization of intangibles. We believe this will provide investors with a more accurate measure of performance. And it will also, quite frankly, make it easier for you to compare our performance with our peers. The table shows adjusted EPS using our current and new definitions for both 2020 and for our guidance range for 2021. 
It's important to note here as well that the applicable tax rate for intangibles is 23.5%, and this is really based upon the tax jurisdictions where the intangibles are located. For 2021, we expect full year adjusted EPS to be between $5.40 and $5.80. And this includes $0.7 from the after-tax impact of intangibles, $0.25 of accretion from the addition of Tripp Lite and Cobham, but this $0.25 is reduced by $0.15 due to lower-than-planned share repurchases and additional financing costs. So on a net basis, the 2 acquisitions will add $0.10 to our expectations for earnings for 2021. We're assuming that Tripp Lite closes once again at the start of Q3 and Cobham closes at the start of Q4. 
Turning to Page 16, we cover the balance of our 2021 guidance. Organic growth, as we talked about, 4% to 6%, with divestitures subtracting 8% and and positive currency adding $200 million. Adjusted operating cash flow is expected to be between $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion, and CapEx will be approximately $500 million. On an adjusted free cash flow, this is projected to be $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion with a midpoint of $2 billion. The way I would say to think about this is 2021 for us is really a bit of a transition year with several unusual items impacting cash flow, including approximately $200 million due to the sale of the Hydraulics business. 
We have an incremental $125 million related to our multiyear restructuring plan, approximately $125 million due to the repayment of the CARES Act payroll deferral from 2020 and, as I noted, $110 million increase in capital spending, which we really see as a return to more historical levels and the levels we were at prior to the COVID-19-driven reductions. 
I'd also note that the increase in capital spend is going to support strategic growth, and we're really pleased to put dollars to work here. For example, in Q4, we announced a $100 million investment to expand our North America electrical manufacturing and distribution centers. Excluding these items, as I think about this as a transition year, the midpoint of our guidance would really be approximately $2.6 billion. 
And lastly, our Q1 guidance is as follows: we expect earnings to be between $1.17 and $1.27; for revenues to be down 3% to 4%; for segment margins to come in between 15.7% and 16.1%; and consistent with the full year, we expect our tax rate to be between 15.5% and 16.5%. 
And finally, I'd like to conclude on Page 17 with a summary we'd say -- why we think eaton remains a very attractive long-term investment. First, we're an intelligent power management company. And this means that we're well positioned to take advantage of perhaps what we think is the most important secular growth trend that we will experience in our lifetime: an energy transition driven by climate change, increasing electrification really of everything and explosive growth in connectivity. 
And it's also helpful, and I'll remind you that we've been at it for some time in terms of being a leader in ESG practices, which is now becoming increasingly important around the world. In fact, I'd say that Eaton's commitment to sustainability is deeply embedded in the belief that what's good for the planet is also good for Eaton and that environmentally friendly solutions will create growth opportunities for our company. 
As you know, our commitment to improve our business portfolio with a focus on high growth, higher earnings and more earnings consistency is ongoing. That's exactly what we've been doing over the last number of years and what we'll continue to do. 
Today, some 85% of our segment profits come from Electrical and Aerospace and with -- and that percentage will actually continue to grow with these announced acquisitions. And while not complete, I think it's clear to say that our strategy is working. Our operating margin guidance for 2021 at 17.8% at the midpoint is an all-time record and 20 basis points above 2019. 
In addition, our cash flow continues to be a real point of differentiation. As we demonstrated in 2020, it's not only strong, but it's resilient under all economic conditions. You can expect this point of differentiation to continue. Lastly, we expect to deliver 8% to 10% EPS growth over the 5-year planning horizon, including 14% in 2021. 
And so with that, I'll turn it back to Yan for Q&A."

And what's starting to show -- or what's continuing to show sequential improvement in the fourth quarter and into early 1Q?"
175265,701284835,2188388,"Eaton Corporation plc, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Eaton Corporation plc","Executives","Yes. Nicole, appreciate the question.

And that's obviously the big one that we're all spending a lot of time focusing on. And I'd say that if you think about our Electrical Americas business in the fourth quarter, it continued to be impacted, quite frankly, by the spread of COVID-19 and some intermittent shutdowns and supply chain issues that we experienced, principally here in the U.S. market. And so I would suggest that if you think about those areas that have been strong and continue to be strong and the things that are really driving the increase in the backlog. Residential markets continue to be doing this extraordinarily strong to the point where I'd say we're still needing to run after that market. We're still trying to fulfill this increasing backlog in that business. And so residential, we think, continues to be extremely strong. 
You heard me talk about what's going on today in the data center market and some of the double-digit growth in the Americas, up 30% in Global. And so data center market is driven by this insatiable appetite that we all have for data. It continues to grow very strongly. Utility markets continue to do well. 
There's been a lot written about what's happening today in commercial construction, and that's the market that everybody's watching and we are as well. We think it's important to note even there that if you think about for Eaton, specifically, commercial construction is under 20% of our total Electrical business in the Americas. Of that, some 1/3 of it goes into retrofit and upgrades, which tend to be more predictable. 
And then there are markets like warehousing, for example, that's in commercial construction, which has a much higher electrical intensity than, let's say, retail, that's doing quite well. And so I'd say that, by and large, we're comfortable with the guidance that we provided for our Electrical businesses in the Americas and globally. 3% to 5%, very much consistent with the trends that we saw during the course of Q4, assuming we don't have the supply chain-related disruptions that we experienced. And we're certainly encouraged by the fact that we built backlog. And as you know, the backlog for us typically ships in 12 months or less. So that gives us also lots of confidence in our ability to deliver those revenue numbers."

And I think the margins that we guided to, 7.8% at the midpoint, an all-time record, is certainly very much indicative of the fact that the incremental margins in 2021 are going to be quite attractive. 
Certainly, we're going to start to see some benefits associated with the $280 million restructuring program that we put in place, $200 million in mature year. But we start to see some of those benefits clearly in '21. 
The other thing with respect to -- we did, like other companies, take a number of temporary cost-containment measures during the course of 2020. And I'd say for the most part, we're expecting most of our costs to come back in 2021. The one place that we'll continue to see some benefits with respect to cost-containment measures -- certainly, we're not spending nearly as much traveling, hotels. And so our travel and entertainment expenses will certainly continue to run at levels that are well below historical levels. 
But the other things that we've done during the course of 2020 to contain costs, we're assuming that all those costs come back into the business during 2021. And so for the most part, I'd say the plan is very well conceived and thought through. And the margins that we've articulated for our businesses are very much consistent with where our businesses are currently running and simply adding to that, these increments and decrements for cost-containment measures plus restructuring benefits. And so we're comfortable with the number."

And sometimes, these are additions, as you think about moving the strategic direction of the company in a particular direction or 2. And sometimes, people simply time out, like Rick has. 
And but certainly, if you think about some of the additions that we've made like to add Aravind Yarlagadda to our team and he reports to me, and he's our Chief Digital Officer. And that's really a reflection of the fact that I talk about these 3 big trends that are taking place and, as I mentioned, perhaps the 3 biggest trends that we'll see in our lifetimes around energy transition, connectivity, climate change and the like. So this is really positioning the organization to capitalize on these trends that we're seeing inside of our markets. And so I think these are changes that you've got -- that we're absolutely thrilled with. 
And we think we're bringing in people or having people step up to take on responsibilities that are ensured that Eaton takes our unfair share of these growth opportunities that we're looking at into the future. And so I just think it's -- these changes, I would hope that you'd see that they are very much strategically aligned with where the company has said that we want to go. And these are things that are certainly going to help us capitalize on those opportunities."

No, I'd say specifically, as the quarter unfolded, I would say that we, in the U.S., certainly experienced second waves and an additional kind of supply chain-related constraints in the Americas that certainly impacted the business. And I'd say on a relative basis, the month of December and the end of the quarter was better than the beginning of the quarter as some of the supply chain constraints began to be sorted somewhat. As you probably read and hear, there's lots of issues in the various ports, LA Long Beach. 
And so it really has been a supply chain issue. It's been, in some cases, an issue around keeping our sites fully staffed on the manufacturing floor as absentee rates, whether it's for Eaton or some of the suppliers, had been a little bit of a challenge during the early part of the quarter. 
And so I'd say, no, the Americas business specifically, it's performing very much in line with what we would have anticipated. But for these disruptions, I'd say, in supply chain. And specifically to your question around destocking, I'd say no. I mean we didn't really -- at this juncture, we think inventory levels in the channel. With the exception, as I noted, in residential, we think the channel is largely where it should be given the outlook for revenue. 
And so I think we, quite frankly, still have some channel stocking to do in the residential side of the business. But other than that, it's pretty well aligned."

I'd say that for us, Joe, we're always actively courting companies and strategically, if you think about today, the way these 2 companies fit into our broader portfolio. You could imagine that they've been on our list for some time. And we always find that when you create long-term relationships and you're working with companies and the management team early on in the process, it increases your likelihood of success. And as a result, we're absolutely thrilled to be able to add these 2 companies to our portfolio. 
And so suffice it to say that we've been at it with these companies for some time. Obviously, these transactions tend to come together fairly quickly. But a lot of courting had taken place long before these deals were finally signed overall. 
And then in terms of performance, I mean, both of these businesses performed extremely well through the pandemic, as you saw -- or you'll likely see with Cobham. And because it's a military business, they actually -- despite the fact that we went through this pandemic, their military business, just like our military business, held up very well. And that's one of the good attributes of having military businesses. In general, they tend to be much more consistent, much more predictable than perhaps some of the more commercial endeavors. 
And the same thing I would say would be true of Tripp Lite. While the revenues regressed a little bit during the course of 2020, it held up much better than most other businesses, largely because of the segment of the market that it's serving in essentially enterprise, data solutions, computing at the edge. They're exposed, obviously, to this growth in 5G. And so both of these businesses, I would say, held up better than the underlying markets."

And the market -- actually, if you look at the entire power quality market, the market splits out historically about half 3-phase and half single phase. And we, of course, are already a significant participant in a single-phase market, not as much in the U.S. as we are in EMEA and APAC. And so this simply gives us a complete global footprint for the single-phase business. 
And we -- the single-phase business is one that we built up over really the last 10 years through several acquisitions, starting with MGE, which we did in '07; and Phoenix Tech, which we did in '08. And so we've been -- we're a very knowledgeable acquirer in this space.

Appreciate that question, Ann. And I'd say very much like we experienced in the U.S., I'd say our Electrical Global business, while it did better than what we anticipated, you find many of the same trends where I'd say that residential markets, utility markets, data centers continue to be very strong. 
The one headwind we have that we -- in Electrical Global, as you know, we report our oil and gas exposure through Crouse-Hinds in our Electrical Global business. And the oil and gas markets continue to be weak. And so that's perhaps holding that business back a little bit. 
But with respect to supply chain, yes, we're absolutely seeing it. We're seeing inflationary pressures in copper. We're seeing it in some steel. We're seeing some availability and some pressures also on microprocessors and the like around the company. And the way I would think about that once again is that we've seen this stuff starting to kind of raise its head back in the fourth quarter. Our teams have been very busy putting together mitigation plans, largely around things that we can do to either change sourcing or taking our prices up in the marketplace. 
And while there could always be a quarter-or-so timing impact, we're confident that we'll be able to offset any inflation that we see in the business with either cost-reduction measures or through pricing in the marketplace. But no question, what you're hearing about copper and some of the other commodities is absolutely consistent with what we're seeing, which is maybe, on the other hand, is an indication also that markets are strengthening. So the other side of that equation, you typically see these commodity increases when the market is inflecting positively."

And we naturally have a lot of good news to talk about today, but I'd say we'd be remiss if we didn't begin by at least acknowledging Rick Fearon and his upcoming retirement. As most of you know, Rick will reach mandatory retirement age of 65 in March and will retire on March 31. And so I'd like to extend a sincere thanks to Rick for his 19 years of service to Eaton. Rick has obviously played just an instrumental role in the transformation and shaping of our company and the company that we have today. And he's been a trusted partner to the management team, to our Board, and certainly to me personally. And looking back, Rick has participated in more than 75 of these earnings calls, and this will be his last one. So we certainly wish Rick and his family well as he makes this transition onto life after Eaton, if there is life after Eaton. I'm not sure, Rick. But Rick will also be around for another couple of months and also will attend the investor meeting on March 1.  
Moving to Page 4. I'd also like to welcome Tom Okray to Eaton as well. Tom becomes Eaton's CFO effective April 1. Tom was previously the CFO of W.W. Grainger and joined the team in January. Throughout his career, he's held various leadership positions at Advanced Auto Parts, at Amazon and GM. Tom is a seasoned CFO with a strong track record of success, and we anticipate he will bring a very unique perspective and set of skills to the role here at Eaton. He's operational, he's growth-oriented, and he just has outstanding knowledge of distribution channels. Like Rick, Tom is also a global leader who's lived around the world, including several countries in Europe as well as Korea. And so we're very happy to welcome Tom to the Eaton team as well and look forward to his contributions in the future.  
Now on the move to more good news and turning to Page 5. Here, we summarize a number of recent noteworthy accomplishments. And I'll begin with the recent announcements to acquire Tripp Lite for $1.65 billion and Cobham Mission Systems for $2.8 billion, 2 very strategic acquisitions that improve the profitability, and quite frankly, the growth outlook for our company. The acquisition of Tripp Lite will enhance the breadth of our edge computing and distributed IT product portfolio and will also expand our single-phase UPS business in the United States. We're paying approximately 12x 2020 EBITDA, 11x estimated 2021 EBITDA, and we expect this transaction to close in the middle part of 2021.  
Yesterday, we also announced the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems. Cobham is a leading manufacturer of air radar refueling systems, environmental systems and actuation. And Cobham also adds highly complementary products to our company and has a strong position, importantly, on growing defense platforms. We're paying approximately 14x 2020 EBITDA, 13x estimated '21 EBITDA, and we expect this transaction to close in the early part of Q4.  
And if we can just turn to Q4 specifically, we certainly have a stronger-than-expected quarter, and we're pleased with our solid results. Our team just continued to execute well despite the pandemic. Q4 earnings per share of $1.18 on a GAAP basis and $1.28 on an adjusted basis. Our Q4 revenues of $4.7 billion were down 5% organically, which was at the high end of the range that we provided, and it's up 3% versus Q3.  And our decremental margins were 21%, also better than the guidance of 25% that we provided.  
I'm also very pleased that with very strong free cash flow. I mean our operating cash flows were $943 million, and our free cash flows were $845 million, both of which exceeded prior year levels. And for 2020, we generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow, which was at the top end of our guidance range, and an all-time record for free cash flow to sales at 14.3%. So a lot of really positive kind of things to talk about there as the business and the company continues to execute well.  
Turning to Page 6, we summarize our Q4 financial results. And I'll only note a few items on this page. First, acquisitions increased sales by 2%, which was more than offset by the divestiture of Lighting and Automotive Fluid Conveyance, which reduced sales by 8%.  
Second, our segment margins of 17.4% were very strong, for sure, and only 40 basis points below prior year despite lower volumes. And then just as a bit of a reminder, I would note that we record all of our charges related to acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring at corporate instead of at the segment level, which hopefully makes it easier to model the company going forward.  
Moving to Page 7, we summarize our Electrical Americas segment. Revenues were down 18%, and this was made up of a 1% decline in organic revenues and then 17% mainly due to the divestiture of Lighting. In this segment, we saw strong growth in data centers and residential markets, which was offset by weakness in industrial and commercial markets.  
Operating margins increased 120 basis points to 21.1%, and this very strong margin performance was due to really effective cost-containment actions, but also aided by the divestiture of Lighting. This combination resulted in very strong decremental margin performance of 15%.  
While orders were down 1% on a rolling 12-month basis, data center orders were particularly strong and actually up double digit. Our backlog grew by 12%, and this was driven by strength in both residential and data center markets.  
Lastly, and as I mentioned at the beginning, we're very pleased to announce the acquisition of Tripp Lite. This business is just a tremendous strategic fit with our existing Electrical franchise and allow us to continue to capitalize on this digitalization trend that requires edge computing. And when you think about some of the future estimates suggesting that some 75% of enterprise-generated data will be created and processed via edge computing, we expect this rapid growth to continue for some time to come.  
Next, on Page 8, we show the results of our Electrical Global segment. Revenues declined 5% with a 7% decline in organic revenue, partially offset by 2% positive currency. And this was better than the midpoint of our expectations for the quarter. The lower organic sales were driven by weakness, not surprisingly, in oil and gas and industrial markets. And if you exclude oil and gas and industrial businesses, kind of more project-driven businesses, Europe was down slightly, and Asia Pacific was actually up low single digit.  
Operating margins declined 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And here, once again, decremental margins were well managed at 25%. In this segment, our orders declined 6% on a rolling 12-month basis with continued weakness in oil and gas and industrial markets. And excluding oil and gas and industrial markets, orders were down 1%. And we saw strength in data centers and residential markets. And in fact, data centers were actually up some 30%.  
We also continue to expand our backlog, which was up 14%, driven once again by strength in residential and data center markets. Lastly, we were pleased to announce in mid-December an agreement to buy 50% of HuanYu High Tech, which is based in China. HuanYu manufactures low-voltage circuit breakers and contactors in China and also throughout Asia Pacific. This investment will provide us access to a really strong portfolio of products, and it will open up significant growth opportunities for our company throughout Asia Pacific. And we'd expect this transaction to close sometime in Q2.  
Turning to Page 9, we summarize our Hydraulics segment. Revenues were up 2%, which was all organic. This was much better than the down 7.5% at the midpoint of our guidance as markets just continued to recover faster than anticipated, and especially, I'd say, in China and in Europe. Operating margins were 10.5%, up 70 basis points from Q3.  
The momentum in this segment really continued really throughout the quarter, resulting in a 25% increase in Q4 orders with strength in both agriculture and construction equipment markets. We're working towards closing the Hydraulics transaction by the end of the first quarter. I would also add though, but given some of the time needed to complete all of the regulatory approvals, we wouldn't be surprised to see this slip into the early part of the second quarter.  
Next on Page 10, we have the results for our Aerospace segment. As expected, revenues declined 13%, down 25% organically, partially offset by an 11% increase from the acquisition of Souriau and 1% positive currency. The organic revenue decline was primarily driven by the continued downturn, as we all know, in commercial markets, partially offset by double-digit growth in military sales. Operating margins declined to 13 -- excuse me, to 18.3%, but we see these at still very healthy levels of performance.
And lastly, yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems. Cobham, a technology leader in important defense aerospace product lines, will add a number of complementary capabilities to our Aerospace business. The acquisition will significantly increase our exposure to, once again, growing defense platforms. It will enhance our fuel systems business and strongly position our Aerospace business for future growth.  
Moving to Page 11, we summarize our Vehicle segment. Revenues here declined 7%, including a 1% organic decline, negative 5% from the divestiture of our Automotive Fluid Conveyance business and 1% headwind from negative currency. The 1% decline in organic revenues was once again much better than the 8.5% decline at the midpoint of our guidance as both light motor vehicle and truck markets have continued to rebound more quickly than we anticipated. We had particular strength actually in South America and in Asia Pacific.
NAFTA Class 8 production was down 6% in Q4, but once again, this was better than expected. We're certainly happy also to see the rebound in operating margins of 16.6%, down just slightly versus prior year and up 260 basis points sequentially. And our decremental margin performance here was once again very solid at 23%.  
Turning to Page 12. We show the results of our eMobility segment. Revenues increased 13%, including 11% organic and 2% currency tailwind. Organic growth was also here much higher than the 1.5% growth at the midpoint of our guidance. We experienced solid growth across all regions, which was driven by both high-voltage electrical solutions for passenger cars as well as low-voltage solutions for commercial vehicles.  
Operating margins were a negative 5.9%. And once again, it's just a reflection of the fact that we continue to invest more in R&D and program implementation in this fast-growing segment of the company. We have a robust pipeline of opportunities, and we continue to see electrification as a significant growth opportunity into the future.  
So before we turn our attention to '21, I'd like to take a minute to really summarize our results for 2020, and those are shown on Page 13. First, while the pandemic caused certainly an unprecedented economic volatility and downturn, we remain focused on delivering for all of our stakeholders. We remain focused on keeping our employees safe, delivering for our customers, and certainly supporting our communities. And we're also proud of how well we performed for our shareholders. We took the appropriate cost-reduction and cost measurement -- cost-management measures to ensure solid decremental margins of 23% and resilient cash flow of $2.6 billion. Our free cash flow to adjusted earnings conversion was very robust at 149%. And free cash flow to sales was 14.3%, 90 basis points over 2019 and another all-time record.  
We launched a $280 million multiyear restructuring program to reduce fixed costs. This is really targeted mostly in those businesses that have been impacted by the pandemic. And these actions will yield $200 million of mature year benefits and make certainly Eaton stronger in the long run.  
We will also continue to transform our portfolio, announcing or completing divestitures valued at $4.7 billion. We acquired Power Distribution, Inc., and we also announced our intention to acquire 50% of HuanYu High Tech. In addition, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders via buyback and dividend payments.  
And lastly, we delivered very strong shareholder returns, results that were 20 basis points above the median of our peer group. And so we're certainly proud of that performance as well. Overall, certainly proud of the team and certainly even more encouraged by our prospects for the future.  
As we continue to transform Eaton into a company of higher growth, higher margins and more consistent earnings, the company certainly feels like in 2020, we took an important step forward, demonstrating that it is, in fact, a different company, and we're well on our way to delivering against that goal.  
Moving to Page 14, we list our revenue and margin guidance for 2021. Overall, here, we expect organic growth between 4% and 6% with weakness in Q1 followed by strength thereafter, and obviously, given the comparisons, particular strength in Q2. In both our Electrical segments, we expect organic growth to be 3% to 5%. And just starting with the Americas, we expect to see continued strength in residential, data center and utility markets, solid growth in industrial control markets and ongoing weakness in commercial construction markets. 
In Electrical Global, we anticipate strength in residential, data centers, utility and industrial control markets, so very much like in the Americas, offset by softness in commercial construction and in the oil and gas market. And for Hydraulics, we expect organic growth to be between 4% and 6% with broadly improving markets around the world. And in Aerospace, we expect organic growth of 2% to 4% with strength in military, offset by continued weakness in commercial markets. And for Vehicle, we anticipate strong organic growth, some 10% to 12%, with strength in both light vehicle markets and truck markets. And just as a reminder here, our Eaton Cummins joint venture will actually consolidate the revenues associated with this particular joint venture. And so much of this growth will show up in the joint venture, not in Eaton's revenue. And in eMobility, organic growth is expected to be up 14% to 16% driven by strength in electric vehicles globally. 
Turning to segment margins. We expect Eaton to be between 17.8% and 18%. At the midpoint, it's 140 basis points improvement over 2020, and importantly, 20 basis points over the pre-pandemic levels in 2019. 
If we could turn to Page 15. And really, before we discuss the rest of our 2020 guidance, we'd like to show you the math behind our new definition of adjusted EPS. In 2020, we're revising our definition of adjusted EPS to add back amortization of intangibles. We believe this will provide investors with a more accurate measure of performance. And it will also, quite frankly, make it easier for you to compare our performance with our peers. The table shows adjusted EPS using our current and new definitions for both 2020 and for our guidance range for 2021. 
It's important to note here as well that the applicable tax rate for intangibles is 23.5%, and this is really based upon the tax jurisdictions where the intangibles are located. For 2021, we expect full year adjusted EPS to be between $5.40 and $5.80. And this includes $0.7 from the after-tax impact of intangibles, $0.25 of accretion from the addition of Tripp Lite and Cobham, but this $0.25 is reduced by $0.15 due to lower-than-planned share repurchases and additional financing costs. So on a net basis, the 2 acquisitions will add $0.10 to our expectations for earnings for 2021. We're assuming that Tripp Lite closes once again at the start of Q3 and Cobham closes at the start of Q4. 
Turning to Page 16, we cover the balance of our 2021 guidance. Organic growth, as we talked about, 4% to 6%, with divestitures subtracting 8% and  positive currency adding $200 million. Adjusted operating cash flow is expected to be between $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion, and CapEx will be approximately $500 million. On an adjusted free cash flow, this is projected to be $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion with a midpoint of $2 billion. The way I would say to think about this is 2021 for us is really a bit of a transition year with several unusual items impacting cash flow, including approximately $200 million due to the sale of the Hydraulics business. 
We have an incremental $125 million related to our multiyear restructuring plan, approximately $125 million due to the repayment of the CARES Act payroll deferral from 2020, and as I noted, $110 million increase in capital spending, which we really see as a return to more historical levels and the levels we were at prior to the COVID-19-driven reductions. 
I'd also note that the increase in capital spend is going to support strategic growth, and we're really pleased to put dollars to work here. For example, in Q4, we announced  $100 million investment to expand our North America electrical manufacturing and distribution centers. Excluding these items, as I think about this as a transition year, the midpoint of our guidance would really be approximately $2.6 billion. 
And lastly, our Q1 guidance is as follows: We expect earnings to be between $1.17 and $1.27, for revenues to be down 3% to 4%, for segment margins to come in between 15.7% and 16.1%. And consistent with the full year, we expect our tax rate to be between 15.5% and 16.5%. 
And finally, I'd like to conclude on Page 17 with a summary we'd say -- why we think Eaton remains a very attractive long-term investment. First, we're an intelligent power management company. And this means that we're well positioned to take advantage of perhaps what we think is the most important secular growth trend that we will experience in our lifetime; an energy transition driven by climate change, increasing electrification really of everything, and explosive growth in connectivity. 
And it's also helpful, and I'll remind you that we've been at it for some time in terms of being a leader in ESG practices, which is now becoming increasingly important around the world. In fact, I'd say that Eaton's commitment to sustainability is deeply embedded in the belief that what's good for the planet is also good for Eaton, and that environmentally friendly solutions will create growth opportunities for our company. 
As you know, our commitment to improve our business portfolio with a focus on high growth, higher earnings and more earnings consistency is ongoing. That's exactly what we've been doing over the last number of years and what we'll continue to do. 
Today, some 85% of our segment profits come from Electrical and Aerospace and with -- and that percentage will actually continue to grow with these announced acquisitions. And while not complete, I think it's clear to say that our strategy is working. Our operating margin guidance for 2021 at 17.8% at the midpoint is an all-time record and 20 basis points above 2019. 
In addition, our cash flow continues to be a real point of differentiation. As we demonstrated in 2020, it's not only strong, but it's resilient under all economic conditions. You can expect this point of differentiation to continue. Lastly, we expect to deliver 8% to 10% EPS growth over the 5-year planning horizon, including 14% in 2021. 
And so with that, I'll turn it back to Yan for Q&A."

So Craig, maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in realtime in the end markets. And what's starting to show -- or what's continuing to show sequential improvement in the fourth quarter and into early 1Q?"
175265,701284835,2188582,"Eaton Corporation plc, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Eaton Corporation plc","Executives","Yes. Nicole, appreciate the question.

And that's obviously the big one that we're all spending a lot of time focusing on. And I'd say that if you think about our Electrical Americas business in the fourth quarter, it continued to be impacted, quite frankly, by the spread of COVID-19 and some intermittent shutdowns and supply chain issues that we experienced, principally here in the U.S. market. And so I would suggest that if you think about those areas that have been strong and continue to be strong and the things that are really driving the increase in the backlog, residential markets continue to be doing this extraordinarily strong to the point where I'd say we're still needing to run after that market. We're still trying to fulfill this increasing backlog in that business. And so residential, we think, continues to be extremely strong. 
You heard me talk about what's going on today in the data center market and some of the double-digit growth in the Americas, up 30% in Global. And so data center market is driven by this insatiable appetite that we all have for data. It continues to grow very strongly. Utility markets continue to do well. 
There's been a lot written about what's happening today in commercial construction, and that's the market that everybody's watching and we are as well. We think it's important to note even there that if you think about for Eaton, specifically, commercial construction is under 20% of our total Electrical business in the Americas. Of that, some 1/3 of it goes into retrofit and upgrades, which tend to be more predictable. 
And then there are markets like warehousing, for example, that's in commercial construction, which has a much higher electrical intensity than, let's say, retail, that's doing quite well. And so I'd say that, by and large, we're comfortable with the guidance that we provided for our Electrical businesses in the Americas and globally. 3% to 5%, very much consistent with the trends that we saw during the course of Q4, assuming we don't have the supply chain-related disruptions that we experienced. And we're certainly encouraged by the fact that we built backlog. And as you know, the backlog for us typically ships in 12 months or less. So that gives us also lots of confidence in our ability to deliver those revenue numbers."

And I think the margins that we guided to, 7.8% at the midpoint, an all-time record, is certainly very much indicative of the fact that the incremental margins in 2021 are going to be quite attractive. 
Certainly, we're going to start to see some benefits associated with the $280 million restructuring program that we put in place, $200 million in mature year. But we start to see some of those benefits clearly in '21. 
The other thing with respect to -- we did, like other companies, take a number of temporary cost-containment measures during the course of 2020. And I'd say for the most part, we're expecting most of our costs to come back in 2021. The one place that we'll continue to see some benefits with respect to cost-containment measures -- certainly, we're not spending nearly as much traveling, hotels. And so our travel and entertainment expenses will certainly continue to run at levels that are well below historical levels. 
But the other things that we've done during the course of 2020 to contain costs, we're assuming that all those costs come back into the business during 2021. And so for the most part, I'd say the plan is very well conceived and thought through. And the margins that we've articulated for our businesses are very much consistent with where our businesses are currently running and simply adding to that, these increments and decrements for cost-containment measures plus restructuring benefits. And so we're comfortable with the number."

And sometimes, these are additions, as you think about moving the strategic direction of the company in a particular direction or 2. And sometimes, people simply time out, like Rick has. 
And but certainly, if you think about some of the additions that we've made like to add Aravind Yarlagadda to our team and he reports to me, and he's our Chief Digital Officer. And that's really a reflection of the fact that I talk about these 3 big trends that are taking place and, as I mentioned, perhaps the 3 biggest trends that we'll see in our lifetimes around energy transition, connectivity, climate change and the like. So this is really positioning the organization to capitalize on these trends that we're seeing inside of our markets. And so I think these are changes that we're absolutely thrilled with. 
And we think we're bringing in people or having people step up to take on responsibilities that are -- ensure that Eaton takes our fair share of these growth opportunities that we're looking at into the future. And so I just think it's -- these changes, I would hope that you'd see that they are very much strategically aligned with where the company has said that we want to go.

No, I'd say specifically, as the quarter unfolded, I would say that we, in the U.S., certainly experienced second waves and an additional kind of supply chain-related constraints in the Americas that certainly impacted the business. And I'd say on a relative basis, the month of December and the end of the quarter was better than the beginning of the quarter as some of the supply chain constraints began to be sorted somewhat. As you probably read and hear, there's lots of issues in the various ports, LA, Long Beach.  And so it really has been a supply chain issue. It's been, in some cases, an issue around keeping our sites fully staffed on the manufacturing floor as absentee rates, whether it's for Eaton or some of the suppliers, had been a little bit of a challenge during the early part of the quarter. 
And so I'd say, no, the Americas business specifically, it's performing very much in line with what we would have anticipated. But for these disruptions, I'd say, in supply chain. And specifically to your question around destocking, I'd say no. I mean, we didn't really -- at this juncture, we think inventory levels in the channel, with the exception, as I noted, in residential, we think the channel is largely where it should be given the outlook for revenue. 
And so I think we, quite frankly, still have some channel stocking to do in the residential side of the business. But other than that, it's pretty well aligned."

I'd say that for us, Joe, we're always actively courting companies and strategically, if you think about today, the way these 2 companies fit into our broader portfolio, you could imagine that they've been on our list for some time. And we always find that when you create long-term relationships and you're working with companies and the management team early on in the process, it increases your likelihood of success. And as a result, we're absolutely thrilled to be able to add these 2 companies to our portfolio. 
And so suffice it to say that we've been at it with these companies for some time. Obviously, these transactions tend to come together fairly quickly. But a lot of courting had taken place long before these deals were finally signed overall. 
And then in terms of performance, I mean, both of these businesses performed extremely well through the pandemic, as you saw -- or you'll likely see with Cobham. And because it's a military business, they actually -- despite the fact that we went through this pandemic, their military business, just like our military business, held up very well. I mean, that's one of the good attributes of having military businesses. In general, they tend to be much more consistent, much more predictable than perhaps some of the more commercial endeavors. 
And the same thing I would say would be true of Tripp Lite. While the revenues regressed a little bit during the course of 2020, it held up much better than most other businesses, largely because of the segment of the market that it's serving in, essentially, enterprise, data solutions, computing at the edge. They're exposed, obviously, to this growth in 5G. And so both of these businesses, I would say, held up better than the underlying markets."

And the market -- actually, if you look at the entire power quality market, the market splits out historically about half 3-phase and half single-phase. And we, of course, are already a significant participant in a single phase market, not as much in the U.S. as we are in EMEA and APAC. And so this simply gives us a complete global footprint for the single-phase business. 
And we -- the single-phase business is one that we built up over really the last 10 years through several acquisitions, starting with MGE, which we did in '07; and Phoenixtec, which we did in '08. And so we've been -- we're a very knowledgeable acquirer in this space. And so this was an opportunity to add a fill-in for us, a company that gave us the Americas exposure that we hadn't gotten through those other acquisitions. And it's a very high-margin space.

And I'd say very much like we experienced in the U.S., I'd say our Electrical Global business, while it did better than what we anticipated, you find many of the same trends where I'd say that residential markets, utility markets, data centers continue to be very strong. 
The one headwind we have that we -- in Electrical Global, as you know, we report our oil and gas exposure through Crouse-Hinds in our Electrical Global business. And the oil and gas markets continue to be weak. And so that's perhaps holding that business back a little bit. 
But with respect to supply chain, yes, we're absolutely seeing it. We're seeing inflationary pressures in copper. We're seeing it in some steel. We're seeing some availability and some pressures also on microprocessors and the like around the company. And the way I would think about that once again is that we've seen this stuff starting to kind of raise its head back in the fourth quarter. Our teams have been very busy putting together mitigation plans, largely around things that we can do to either change sourcing or taking our prices up in the marketplace. 
And while there could always be a quarter-or-so timing impact, we're confident that we'll be able to offset any inflation that we see in the business with either cost-reduction measures or through pricing in the marketplace. 
But yes, no question, what you're hearing about copper and some of the other commodities is absolutely consistent with what we're seeing, which is maybe, on the other hand, is an indication also that markets are strengthening. So the other side of that equation, you typically see these commodity increases when the market is inflecting positively."

Our agenda today, including opening remarks by Craig highlighting the company's performance in the first quarter. As we have done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at end of Craig's comments. The press release and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. This presentation, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures that are reconciled in the appendix. 
A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projection due to a wide range of the risk and uncertainty as described in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Craig."

And first, I'd just say we had a terrific quarter, and we're significantly increasing our full year guidance, as you saw. Our teams have just done an outstanding job of managing through this dynamic market environment, which is reflected in our strong results.  
Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 were a solid 15% increased year-over-year and 18% above the midpoint of our guidance. Our Q1 revenues of $4.7 billion were up 0.5% organically, which was well above the high end of our guidance range of down 3%. This outperformance was driven primarily by the 2 electrical segments as well as our Vehicle business. 
We also posted a Q1 record for segment margins of 17.7%. And looking at our incrementals, we generated $73 million of higher profits despite having $97 million of lower revenues. This was the result of, we'd say, strong execution, ongoing improvements in the cost structure from the multiyear restructuring program that we announced in the second quarter of 2020 as well as closely managing price and inflation in the quarter. 
Our cash flow was also very strong. Adjusted operating cash flow increased by 42%, and our adjusted free cash flow increased by 62%. And we have another successful quarter of M&A closing 3 deals. We're also making good progress towards the closure of the previously announced acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems as well as the divestiture of Hydraulics. 
And finally, we recently announced the agreement to acquire 50% of Jiangsu Electric Bus Way business in China, an important part of our growth strategy for the Asia Pacific region. Having been quite busy on the M&A front, we thought it would be helpful to provide a summary of these 3 recent deals. We covered trip light and Cobham Mission Systems acquisitions in some depth on the investor meetings. 
But each of these 3 deals here certainly advance our strategic growth objectives in our electrical business. First, green motion based in Switzerland. It expands our capabilities in the electrical charging market, where we expect to see significant growth over the next decade linked to energy transition. 
Their proven charger designs and advanced power management capabilities and building software are valuable additions to our existing energy storage and power distribution offerings that support our view of ""Everything as a Grid"". 
We also closed our previously announced investment in Hanyu. Hanyu is based  in China and provides a strong portfolio of products that will open up significant growth opportunities in our business throughout Asia Pacific. They make cost-effective circuit breakers and contactors and that give us access to Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets in Asia Pacific. 
And finally, last week, we're pleased to announce the agreement to acquire 50% of Jiangsu Innings Electric Busway business in China. [indiscernible] strong busway capabilities in China, combined with Eaton's broad portfolio of products, will really position us well to participate in the high-growth data center, industrial and high-end commercial segments and allowing us to pull-through related electrical products. 
The Hunyu and [indiscernible] transactions, I'd also add, significantly expand our addressable market in China and in Asia Pacific, certainly allowing us to accelerate our growth rate in the region. 
Moving to Page 5. We summarize our Q1 financial results, and I'll just note a couple of points here. First, acquisitions increased sales by 1%, but this was more than offset by the divestiture of Lighting, which reduced sales by 5.5%. And you'll recall that we sold the Lighting business in March of 2020. And second, segment margins of $831 million were 10% above prior year, and this is despite a 2% decline in total revenue. 
This is largely the result that, I'd say, of solid execution, restructuring savings and really our ability to effectively manage price and inflation during the quarter. We expect the inflation impact to worsen, certainly in Q2, but we will full -- more than fully offset this for the full year. And lastly, our adjusted earnings of $577 million, up 12% and when combined with our lower share count, we delivered a 15% increase in our adjusted EPS. 
Turning to Page 6. You see the results for our Electrical Americas segment. Revenues were up 2% organically, driven by strength in data centers, residential and utility markets, which offset weakness in industrial and commercial markets. The acquisition of Tripp Lite and PDI added 2% of revenues, while the divestiture of lighting reduced revenues by 14%. 
We're very pleased to also have closed the Tripp Lite acquisition sooner than planned and to welcome their team to the Eaton family. Operating margins, as you can see, increased sharply, up 330 basis points to 20.5%, a quarterly record. And as you can see, profits were $24 million higher on significantly lower revenues. 
These results, once again, were driven by good execution, cost savings and really favorable mix due to the divestiture of lighting. We're also pleased with the 11% orders growth in the quarter. This was driven by once again strength in data center and residential markets. 
Our backlog was actually up 23% versus last year and due to ongoing strength in, once again, data center and residential markets. We are also encouraged to see some very large orders in select commercial markets perhaps a sign here that these markets too, are beginning to turn positive. And while it's difficult to judge, we do think the order strength could have been due to some concern about some of the supply chain shortages that you certainly have been reading about. 
Next, on Page 7. We show the results for our Electrical Global segment. We posted a 5% organic growth with 5% favorable impact from currency, largely due to the weaker; dollar. Organic revenue growth was driven by strength in data centers, residential and utility markets. You can see the pattern here. We also delivered 250 basis point increase in operating margins and posted a new Q1 record of 17%. 
Our incremental margins in the segment were also strong, more than 40% and and we're also driven by good cost control measures, saving from actions taken from our multiyear restructuring program. Orders grew 7% in the quarter, and like sales, the primary contributors to the growth came from data centers, residential and utility markets. 
I'd say dragged down by the earlier COVID-related declines, orders declined 12% -- excuse me, 5% on a rolling 12-month basis. And lastly, here, our backlog was up 17% versus last year, driven by the same 3 end markets. 
Moving to Page 8. We summarize our Hydraulics segment. Revenues increased 11%, with strong 9% organic growth and 2% positive currency impact. Operating margin stepped up significantly to 15%, a 420 basis point improvement over last year. And our Q1 orders were also very strong, up 53%, driven primarily by strength in mobile equipment markets. 
As we anticipated, Danfoss did receive conditional regulatory approval from the EU to acquired Hydraulics business, which is an important step in the process, and this sale is still expected to close in the second quarter here. 
Turning to Page 9. We have the financial results for our Aerospace segment. Revenues were down 24%, including 26% organic decline, driven by the continued downturn in commercial aviation. Currency, as you can see, added 2% to revenues. And as you can also see, operating margins were down 310 basis points to 18.5%, down but still at very attractive levels overall. 
Our team, I give them a lot of credit. They moved quickly to flex the business and were able to really deliver better than normal decremental margins of approximately 30%. Orders were down 36% on a rolling 12-month basis, once again, due to the ongoing downturn in commercial aerospace markets. 
Now however, I would add, on a sequential basis, we are starting to see some improvement as orders were up 14% from Q4. And lastly, our previously announced acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems remains on track, and we expect the transaction to close at the beginning of Q4 2021. 
Next, on Page 10, we show the results of our Vehicle segment. As you can see, revenues increased 9% and were much stronger than anticipated. The strongest growth came from global commercial vehicle markets and from the Chinese light vehicle market. This as a point of reference here, [indiscernible] 8 production was up some 12%. 
Operating margins also improved significantly here to 17.3%, another quarterly record and a 380 basis point increase with incremental margins of nearly 60%. The strong margin performance was driven certainly by increased volume and also from savings from the multiyear restructuring program that we've undertaken. And despite volumes that were still below pre pandemic levels, this business is approaching our target segment margins of 18%, so making very strong progress in our vehicle segment. 
And one additional noteworthy development in this segment was the introduction of the new automated transmission for the heavy-duty truck market in China through our Eaton Cummins JV. This product, I'd say, is already getting great traction and seeing strong growth in the market. 
Turning to Page 11. We summarize our e-mobility segment. Here, revenues increased 15%: 13% organic and 2% from currency. We experienced solid growth in global vehicle markets, which was driven here both by high and low-voltage products. Operating margins were a negative 8.4% as we continue to invest heavily in R&D. And as I've reported in the past, we continue to manage just a really robust pipeline of opportunities. 
Of note in Q1, we secured a multiyear agreement with a leading global automotive customer to buy our next-generation break door circuit protection technology for battery electric vehicles. This award represents $33 million in material revenue sales, and we hope to be awarded additional vehicle platforms using the same technology. And this win, I would say, it really does highlight the strength of our electrical pedigree and how we're able to leverage this strength to grow in the e-mobility markets. 
And on Slide 12, we've updated our organic revenue guidance for the year. As you can see, we're significantly increasing our organic revenue growth for the year with our strong Q1 results. We're optimistic about the remainder of 2021. Our strong order book and growing backlog basis that markets and market demand is really increasing and improving across most of our end markets. We now expect overall Eaton organic growth to be up 7% to 9%, and this is up from 4% to 6% previously. And while we're experiencing some supply chain issues, we have confidence in our team's ability to manage through these temporary challenges. 
As you can see, we've kept our forecast for aerospace unchanged. Vehicle has increased by 600 basis points. Electrical Globals increased by 400 basis points and all other segments have increased by 300 basis points. Encouragingly, I'd say here about our Electrical segment, we're seeing higher-than-expected demand across all of our markets with the exception of utility, and that market remains in line with our original outlook, which was for mid-single-digit growth, a really strong performance in the electrical segments. 
Moving to Page 13. We show our updated segment margin guidance for the year, where we're also significantly increasing our guidance. For Eaton overall, we're increasing segment margins by 50 basis points at the midpoint with a range of 17.8% to 18.3%. And we've raised our margin guidance in each of our segments with the exception of Aerospace and eMobility, which are unchanged. Compared with our original guidance, we expect to deliver better incremental margins for sure on this higher volume. I'd also note that for the full year, we continue to expect net price versus inflation to be neutral. 
And on Page 14, we have the balance of our 2021 guidance. We're raising our full year adjusted EPS by $0.50 to $5.90 to $6.30, a midpoint of $6.10. And this is a 9% increase over our prior guidance and a 24% increase over 2020. With our recent M&A activities, we now expect a net 4% headwind from acquisitions and divestitures, down from our prior outlook of 8%. 
I say it's also worth noting here that our segment margin guidance of 18.1% to 18.5% is 190 basis point increase at the midpoint over 2020 and will be an all-time record. It's also -- this is a point of reference, above our pre pandemic margins of 17.6%, which we posted in 2019, which was also an all-time record. 
So we're off to a strong start, and I'd say, well on our way to achieve our longer-term targets of getting to 21% segment margins. The remaining components of our full year 2021 guidance remain unchanged. And lastly, for Q2, our guidance is as follows. We expect to be between $1.45 and $1.55 on earnings, for organic revenue to be up 24% to 28% and for segment margins to come in between 17.5% and 17.9%. 
And if I could, just finally, on Page 15, I'll wrap up with a kind of a high-level summary of why we think Eaton remains an attractive long-term investment. And I begin with first, our intelligent power management strategy really does position us to capitalize on these key secular growth trends that we've talked about for the last couple of years: electrification, energy transition and digitalization. And we're gaining traction here. In all of these areas, we put a number of new wins. 
Our technology solutions, including our Brightlayer platform are being well received by customers. And as a result, we continue to expect higher-than-historical organic growth rates for the company. And over the next 5 years, we're reaffirming our view that 4% to 6% outlook looks very much in hand. 
Now this accelerated growth plus our, what I call, proven ability to deliver margin expansion will allow us to deliver on average 11% to 13% EPS growth per year over the next 5 years. We'll also continue to deliver very strong free cash flow, which provides the optionality to invest in organic growth, to add strategic acquisitions and to return cash to shareholders. 
And  our commitment to ESG remains strong. We'll continue to develop sustainable solutions for our customers, for our own businesses and certainly for the environment that we all share. So with that, I'd like to turn it back to Yan. Obviously, we're very pleased with a really strong start to the year and looking forward to answering your questions."

No, certainly appreciate that question as well, and it's obviously one of the bigger topics that we're dealing with internally. And I think you're dealing with in terms of trying to model our results and others. And I'd say that what we experienced in Q1, I'd say, is largely, we were able to offset a lot of this commodity inflation that we had been experiencing through hedges and working out of inventory and other agreements. And so the biggest impact for us will be in Q2. And it's one of the reasons why you look at our Q2 guidance, and you say it may be a little muted given the very strong Q1. But that really is the quarter where we expect to see the biggest impact of material cost inflation. We're obviously getting price in the marketplace. It does take us typically a quarter or 2 to fully get pricing seeded into the marketplace. And so certainly, Q2 will be the most challenging quarter. It's certainly factored into our guidance that we've laid out, and it will get better from that point forward. So Q3 and Q4 will be certainly better on an incremental basis than Q2 will be. Fully offsetting it for the year. I would add as well, it's sometimes in hyperinflationary environment, it's tough to get a full incremental margin on material cost inflation. Will certainly more than offset it. But certainly, if you think about in hyperinflationary environment, you generally don't get a full incremental margin on inflation."

And our local team having been in the market for a number of years, building strong relationships with some of the electrical companies in the region, we're able to pull off some really attractive deals and I think a lot of that is attributed to the fact that we're willing to partner. These are JVs that we have 50% of. We won't consolidate the revenue. At least in China, we'll leverage their products and their low-cost footprint and we will consolidate revenues as we grow these businesses outside of China. But I say it's a combination of our local team's connectivity to the market. And Eaton's willingness and proven track record of really being a very successful JV partner. As you know, we have a number of JVs inside of our company in China, in our aerospace business in China. And I think we have a very strong reputation in the country around a company that can very effectively -- you can very effectively partner with. And at the same time, do things that are helpful to both our company and to the companies that we're partnering with. And so we're thrilled with it. I would add that to your other question, we are, in fact, having a number of other conversations around other similar types of transactions. Nothing to announce here today, but we're hopeful that we will continue to build on kind of this pattern of filling product gaps and whether that's a gap because it's a technology that we don't have like the busway products in the China market or it's a product gap in the form of the ability to really compete in the local market because you have a low cost product. We see other opportunities to do very similar things in other parts of the portfolio."

The data center market will continue to be a very attractive market to be in for a very long time. And in terms of visibility, specifically in hyperscale, we're typically in the 6 to 12 months out window in terms of having fairly good visibility. As we've said, historically, hyperscale specifically tend to be a relatively lumpy market.

I think this margin that you're seeing in us posting these record levels of margins is really a function of the things that we talked about, which is our teams are executing well. We're certainly benefiting from some restructuring that we've done as a company, and the volume is obviously helping. And the big one is, obviously, if you think about electrical Americas, we divested the Lighting business. And as we continue to work the portfolio in what we call growth ahead and shrink to tail. We continue to do things inside of the company to ensure that we're serving attractive markets. But no, we would expect that there's more room to grow. And when we think about margin expansion in our Electrical Americas segment, and certainly, as the industrial markets come back, that's going to certainly be accretive to margins."

And so yes, this is a market that we continue to be optimistic about and we think the utility segment, very much different than its history is really going to be one of the important growth vectors for the company as we look forward."

And so we track negotiations in our business and they are up quite significantly from the fourth quarter and most of that increase, I'd say the biggest part of that increase in what we call our negotiations is coming from our industrial businesses. And so we're certainly seeing some green shoots there. You see a lot of discussion about this whole trend towards reshoring. And you certainly see that today in the semiconductor market, for example, where a number of very large semiconductor companies have announced very sizable projects here in the U.S., and those are very big industrial projects. And so yes, we're clearly seeing some early signs, too early to, let's say, once again, to clear that we know exactly where we're headed here, but certainly encouraging."

I mean, Green motion is a company that started back in 2009, so it's a relatively new organization as everything in and around kind of electrification of vehicles is new and so they are -- some revenues, but revenues are relatively modest at this point. As I mentioned, dilutive to margins as we continue to invest in this business. But yet, strategically, I mean it's just a perfect fit for us. And we see Uday and his team spend a lot of time talking about energy transition and what it's going to mean in terms of opportunities with respect to the grid as electric vehicles continue to grow. And they have both the hardware and the software technology and the billing systems to allow us to really participate in this really fast-growing and exciting space. And so today, they have a solution that works perfectly in the Nordic countries and most of Europe. We'll be taking that technology and integrating it with what we're currently doing in North America. So that we have a solution for the North American market as well. And so it's really an important part of our strategy, and it really accelerates what we would have done organically inside of our company by acquiring this company. This gives us, I'd say, at least a couple of year head start for what we were planning to do organically. I think if you think about it in terms of our longer-term goals of where we said we'd be by 2030, probably doesn't change that materially because we planned on making these investments organically. So -- but it certainly accelerates our progress."

We're dealing with certainly -- if you look at the basket of commodities that we buy, whether that's copper, aluminum, sheet steel, we're probably seeing today levels of inflation in those key raw materials that probably are at levels that we have not seen since probably 2010, 2011. And so clearly, commodity cost increase is on our key. Input materials is quite a significant challenge. As you mentioned, freight around the world and is up dramatically as well. And then with these challenges, obviously, you're dealing with the intermittent availability issues on things like you reading the newspaper with respect to semiconductors, which is impacting our vehicle business and also, to a certain extent, is impacting our electrical business. And so I think we're dealing with this entire kind of portfolio of challenges right now in the market, and our teams are managing through it extraordinarily well. And I would tell you that the good news in all of this, is a great indicator of just how strong the market is. And so the other side of dealing with these challenges around inflation and freight and the like is that something very positive must be going on in your end markets, and that's really what we're experiencing. And as you know, getting price as a company is something that we do. It's certainly easier. In certain cases, distribution, for example, as long as the market moves, price is a good thing for distribution. 
And so today, I would tell you that we're dealing with each of these challenges, and there'll be certainly intermittent hiccups that we'll see in a business or any product line or in a quarter. But by and large, our teams are managing it well, and we'd expect things to start to to improve beginning in Q3. And by the time you get to Q4, perhaps at the end of the year for a lot of the bigger issues to be behind us. But we're managing through all of these challenges, but we've been here before. This is nothing new for our company. We've dealt with inflation before. We've dealt with these intermittent supply chain issues before, and I'm confident that we'll manage through this one extremely well as well."

It's a little different one that we're getting around aerospace these days, but certainly appreciate it. And I would tell you that one of the things that we've done is we've lived through cyclical businesses and have a lot of experience side of our company around how do you manage these businesses that go through from periods of time, these pretty big cyclical swings, and so I would tell you that our business is sized appropriately and is well positioned for a rebound in commercial aerospace. The bigger challenge is always tend to be the supply chain. So what we're trying to do and make sure that it's not only -- we have our house in order, and we're ready for the rebound. But also throughout the supply chain that everyone is prepared and like everything else in these businesses, it's the weakest link that tend to create issues for your businesses. And so yes, our business itself very well footed with a viewpoint of -- we think it's '23, '24 recovery. We did take some restructuring actions inside of the business. Most of it was around fixed structural costs that will not come back, things that we would have done anyway, even in a more healthy environment. And as we talked about this prior years, what we try to do in each of our businesses have what we call shovel-ready projects. And so this list of restructuring projects that we would undertake at any point in time. And then we simply accelerate them or decelerate them based upon the market environment that we're living in. And that's simply what we did in aerospace. Things that we wanted to do anyway, we would have done them any way, we simply accelerated them during this period of low economic activity, but not things that take capacity and capability to respond out of the system. So we're in great shape. And obviously, we're working with our suppliers to make sure that they're also prepared for the ramp. It sounds like a -- it's a pretty good positioning to be in. Maybe just as a follow-up, Tom, I wanted to ask, in your first 90 days, what have you uncovered? And I'm sure with your boss sitting there, you're going to say a lot of positive things, but I'm wondering also, though, if you could talk about areas for maybe opportunities for Eaton and where your background could be additive to this, so maybe like some areas for improvement? I don't know whatever whatever you'd like to say? Yes. I appreciate it, John. I guess a few things that I've seen. The first 1 is just a tremendous amount of opportunity. I knew that coming in. And it's even more than I expected. And specifically in the area of organic growth, I think that's a great opportunity for us. And hopefully, that's something that I can be additive to another thing that I've found is with all of the issues that we've been managing, whether it be commodities or supply chain, just the professionalism of the organization to get after it and just to mitigate it, has been really remarkable and the final thing is just a really top-notch leadership team that wants to win.

But still a lag relative to the overall electrical market that we're seeing in general. And then in oil and gas, while we are another place where we're certainly seeing some green shoots and the market is certainly firming. The rig count is increasing. We're starting to see more MRO projects and the like. So that market is improving. But once again, relative to the overall electrical market, that market is still a laggard versus the overall electrical market.

I mean not to say if there aren't challenges in commercial vehicles, there are we have issues there as well, but it's certainly been a much bigger issue in the light vehicle market. And the 1 thing that's helped us a little bit, I would say, with respect to the way the OEMs are responding to kind of the shortages of semiconductors is that they're tending to make decisions to manufacture to produce, they're more expensive vehicles. And so what you're finding is trucks and things where they tend to make higher margins are also the places where Eaton has higher content. And so our impact in the way we're being impacted by this semiconductor issue is being somewhat muted by the way the OEMs are prioritizing what they produce. And so as we think about Q2, it's maybe a 2% to 3% impact on revenues. And revenues would have been 2% to 3% higher, but for the semiconductor issue. Overall. And so our teams are once again managing it well, but it is a real issue and 1 that we expect to really deal with throughout Q2 and maybe even into Q3."

I mean, it's obviously a difficult question to really know for certain in terms of the behavior and what's going on specifically in the channel. I would say that we probably did see some order surges that took place at the end of Q1 in the month of March. Tough to call it double ordering. I think some of that ordering could be certainly trying to get out in front of price increases, some of that or could be to put in some safety stock to protect against concerns about shortages. But I would say that overall, if you think about inventory levels -- I say inventory levels, in general, I'd say, or still probably slightly below where they really ought to be. If you think about some of the end markets of residential and others and, let's say, in some of our factory OEM equipment markets, inventory levels there are probably well below where they need to be, and we're still kind of hand to mouth with respect to dealing with some of the demand that we're seeing. And so I would say kind of the spirit of the question is, do we think this strength that we're seeing in the Electrical business has legs? Or is it a little bit of an artificial pop that we're seeing? I think mostly, we're comfortable that it's real. The underlying demand that we're seeing in these end markets is real and that's what's really driving the ordering more than anything.

And so we really think about that as being a a key growth platform for Eaton and a great source of synergies with respect to the way we develop technology, the way we leverage scale in our supply chain. And so we really do see it as an integrated part of our company as we go forward. If you think about one of the examples that we mentioned in the earnings call today around this break tour technology, which is basically a resettable circuit breaker that's used in a vehicle application in a market that has historically only used fuses, that's a great example. That core technology came from our electrical business. That's where it was developed. And so our e-mobility team lifted that technology naturally modified it for the commercial vehicle space. And here, we landed a number of key wins that are, we think, at maturity we could be talking about this $100 million worth of business in this kind of space around this break door technology once we get to full maturity and we bed down all the wins that we're working on right now.

I mean the infrastructure needs in our country are vast and what's happening today in terms of the stimulus programs that are being either approved already or proposed by the biden administration are going to put significant dollars in the hands of both state and local governments. And I can tell you today, it's early days. In terms of what's been approved already, I'd say that we are starting to see some of those projects. And when you look at kind of the C 30 report, the public sector has tended to be a little stronger than the private sector. When you think about what's going on in commercial construction. And so we obviously have seen some of that already. But the biggest piece of it, we think, is still out in front of us. And we think that -- and obviously, it's going to depend upon where these dollars go in terms of this infrastructure build. If it's in roads and bridges, that probably won't have a material impact on our company. But if it's where the Biden administration is pointing a lot of those dollars, whether that's in the reduced energy consumption, the greening of the economy, electrification of the economy, building out the electrical infrastructure, grid resiliency, a lot of the things that the administration are talking about not baked into our current forecast and outlook could be another real, I'd say, leg of growth for our company and we're hopeful. But I think today, we've seen very little of that really show up in our business."

I'd say, clearly, when you think about the charging infrastructure side of there is obviously the hardware and I think when you think about the piece that's -- today, you could argue is not very differentiated. It's really the hardware itself. It's the equipment. We view that as really more of as a gateway and the real value creation really comes in the software associated with how do you manage the charging infrastructure. And so yes, they have charging, and they have the hardware associated with charging and that piece for us is interesting because we do think that depending upon the application that you're in, all charging isn't the same. There is an opportunity, we believe, depending upon which segment of the market you're serving, where the charging infrastructure in and of itself is important. We think there's an opportunity to really pull-through and couple the charging infrastructure with what we do on the electrical equipment on year side, which we think will be value creating. But the real value ultimately is really in the software and the way the solutions around how do you manage the charging of vehicles, of fleets, manage the load in a smart way in a really complex environment. And that's ultimately where we see the biggest value and what really intrigued us a lot about what Green motion has already done and the ability to do billing as well and what Green motion has already done in the Nordic countries."

And certainly, as our restructuring programs get completed we'll see those benefits as well, show up in our expanded margins. But we're very comfortable with the margin outlook for Aerospace. Even in Q1, the margins that we delivered in that business of 18.5%, very attractive margins on volumes that are down dramatically. And so as we think about the business and the margin profile overall, nothing that I'd say would be extraordinary or Herculean in our effort to deliver the forecast."

And first, I'd just say we had a terrific quarter, and we're significantly increasing our full year guidance, as you saw. Our teams have just done an outstanding job of managing through this dynamic market environment, which is reflected in our strong results.   
Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 were a solid 15% increase year-over-year and 18% above the midpoint of our guidance. Our Q1 revenues of $4.7 billion were up 0.5% organically, which was well above the high end of our guidance range of down 3%. This outperformance was driven primarily by the 2 electrical segments as well as our Vehicle business.  We also posted a Q1 record for segment margins of 17.7%. 
And looking at our incrementals, we generated $73 million of higher profits despite having $97 million of lower revenues. This was the result of, we'd say, strong execution, ongoing improvements in the cost structure from the multiyear restructuring program that we announced in the second quarter of 2020 as well as closely managing price and inflation in the quarter.  
Our cash flow was also very strong. Our adjusted operating cash flow increased by 42%, and our adjusted free cash flow increased by 62%. And we have another successful quarter of M&A closing 3 deals. We're also making good progress towards the closure of the previously announced acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems as well as the divestiture of Hydraulics. 
And finally, we recently announced the agreement to acquire 50% of Jiangsu YiNeng Electric's bus way business in China, an important part of our growth strategy for the Asia Pacific region. 
Having been quite busy on the M&A front, we thought it'd be helpful to provide a summary of these 3 recent deals. We covered Tripp Lite and Cobham Mission Systems acquisitions in some depth on the investor meetings.  
But each of these 3 deals here certainly advance our strategic growth objectives in our electrical business. First, Green Motion, based in Switzerland. It expands our capabilities in the electrical charging market, where we expect to see significant growth over the next decade linked to energy transition.  Their proven charger designs and advanced power management capabilities and building software are valuable additions to our existing energy storage and power distribution offerings that support our view of everything as a grid. We also closed our previously announced investment in HuanYu. HuanYu is based  in China and provides a strong portfolio of products that will open up significant growth opportunities in our business throughout Asia Pacific. They make cost-effective circuit breakers and contactors that give us access to Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets in Asia Pacific.  
And finally, last week, we're pleased to announce the agreement to acquire 50% of Jiangsu YiNeng Electric's busway business in China. YiNeng's strong busway capabilities in China, combined with Eaton's broad portfolio of products, will really position us well to participate in the high-growth data center, industrial and high-end commercial segments and allowing us to pull through related electrical products.  The HuanYu and YiNeng transactions, I'd also add, significantly expand our addressable market in China and in Asia Pacific, certainly allowing us to accelerate our growth rate in the region.  
Moving to Page 5. We summarize our Q1 financial results, and I'll just note a couple of points here. First, acquisitions increased sales by 1%, but this was more than offset by the divestiture of Lighting, which reduced sales by 5.5%. And you'll recall that we sold the Lighting business in March of 2020. 
Second, segment margins of $831 million were 10% above prior year, and this is despite a 2% decline in total revenue.  This is largely the result that, I'd say, of solid execution, restructuring savings, and really our ability to effectively manage price and inflation during the quarter. We expect the inflation impact to worsen, certainly in Q2, but we will full -- more than fully offset this for the full year. 
And lastly, our adjusted earnings of $577 million, up 12%. And when combined with our lower share count, we delivered a 15% increase in our adjusted EPS.  
Turning to Page 6. You see the results for our Electrical Americas segment. Revenues were up 2% organically, driven by strength in data centers, residential and utility markets, which offset weakness in industrial and commercial markets. The acquisition of Tripp Lite and PDI added 2% of revenues, while the divestiture of lighting reduced revenues by 14%. We're very pleased to also have closed the Tripp Lite acquisition sooner than planned and to welcome their team to the Eaton family. Operating margins, as you can see, increased sharply, up 330 basis points to 20.5%, a quarterly record. And as you can see, profits were $24 million higher on significantly lower revenues.  These results, once again, were driven by good execution, cost savings and really favorable mix due to the divestiture of lighting. We're also pleased with the 11% orders growth in the quarter. This was driven by, once again, strength in data center and residential markets.  
Our backlog was actually up 23% versus last year and due to ongoing strength in, once again, data center and residential markets. 
We are also encouraged to see some very large orders in select commercial markets, perhaps a sign here that these markets, too, are beginning to turn positive.  And while it's difficult to judge, we do think the order strength could have been due to some concern about some of the supply chain shortages that you certainly have been reading about.  
Next, on Page 7. We show the results for our Electrical Global segment. We posted a 5% organic growth with 5% favorable impact from currency, largely due to the weaker dollar. Organic revenue growth was driven by strength in data centers, residential and utility markets. You can see the pattern here. We also delivered a 250 basis point increase in operating margins and posted a new Q1 record of 17%.  
Our incremental margins in the segment were also strong, more than 40%, and were also driven by good cost control measures, savings from actions taken from our multiyear restructuring program. Orders grew 7% in the quarter, and like sales, the primary contributors to the growth came from data centers, residential and utility markets.  
I'd say dragged down by the earlier COVID-related declines, orders declined 12% -- or excuse me, 5% on a rolling 12-month basis. And lastly, here, our backlog was up 17% versus last year, driven by the same 3 end markets.  
Moving to Page 8. We summarize our Hydraulics segment. Revenues increased 11%, with strong 9% organic growth and 2% positive currency impact. Operating margin stepped up significantly to 15%, a 420 basis point improvement over last year. And our Q1 orders were also very strong, up 53%, driven primarily by strength in mobile equipment markets.  
As we anticipated, Danfoss did receive conditional regulatory approval from the EU to acquire our Hydraulics business, which is an important step in the process, and this sale is still expected to close in the second quarter here.  
Turning to Page 9. We have the financial results for our Aerospace segment. Revenues were down 24%, including 26% organic decline, driven by the continued downturn in commercial aviation. Currency, as you can see, added 2% to revenues. And as you can also see, operating margins were down 310 basis points to 18.5%, down but still at very attractive levels overall.  
Our team, I give them a lot of credit. They moved quickly to flex the business and were able to really deliver better than normal decremental margins of approximately 30%. 
Orders were down 36% on a rolling 12-month basis, once again, due to the ongoing downturn in commercial aerospace markets.  
Now, however, I would add, on a sequential basis, we are starting to see some improvement as orders were up 14% from Q4. And lastly, our previously announced acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems remains on track, and we expect the transaction to close at the beginning of Q4 2021, next year. 
Next, on Page 10, we show the results of our Vehicle segment. As you can see, revenues increased 9% and were much stronger than anticipated. The strongest growth came from global commercial vehicle markets and from the Chinese light vehicle market. Just as a point of reference here, [indiscernible] production was up [ some ] 12%.  
Operating margins also improved significantly here to 17.3%, another quarterly record, and a 380 basis point increase with incremental margins of nearly 60%. The strong margin performance was driven certainly by increased volume and also from savings from the multiyear restructuring program that we've undertaken. And despite volumes that were still below pre-pandemic levels, this business is approaching our target segment margins of 18%. So making very strong progress in our Vehicle segment.  
And one additional noteworthy development in this segment was the introduction of the new automated transmission for the heavy-duty truck market in China through our Eaton Cummins JV. This product, I'd say, is already getting great traction and seeing strong growth in the market.  
Turning to Page 11. We summarize our e-mobility segment. Here, revenues increased 15%; 13% organic and 2% from currency. We experienced solid growth in global vehicle markets, which was driven here both by high- and low-voltage products. Operating margins were a negative 8.4% as we continue to invest heavily in R&D. And as I've reported in the past, we continue to manage just a really robust pipeline of opportunities. Of note in Q1, we secured a multiyear agreement with a leading global automotive customer to buy our next-generation break door circuit protection technology for battery electric vehicles. This award represents $33 million in material revenue sales, and we hope to be awarded additional vehicle platforms using the same technology. And this win, I would say, it really does highlight the strength of our electrical pedigree and how we're able to leverage this strength to grow in the e-mobility markets.  
And on Slide 12, we've updated our organic revenue guidance for the year. As you can see, we're significantly increasing our organic revenue growth for the year with our strong Q1 results. We're optimistic about the remainder of 2021. Our strong order book and growing backlog basis that markets and market demand is really increasing and improving across most of our end markets. 
We now expect overall Eaton organic growth to be up 7% to 9%, and this is up from 4% to 6% previously. And while we're experiencing some supply chain issues, we have confidence in our team's ability to manage through these temporary challenges.  
As you can see, we've kept our forecast for Aerospace unchanged, Vehicle has increased by 600 basis points, Electrical Global has increased by 400 basis points, and all other segments have increased by 300 basis points. Encouragingly, I'd say here about our Electrical segment, we're seeing higher-than-expected demand across all of our markets, with the exception of utility. And that market remains in line with our original outlook, which was for mid-single-digit growth. So really strong performance in the electrical segments.  
Moving to Page 13. We show our updated segment margin guidance for the year, where we're also significantly increasing our guidance. For Eaton overall, we're increasing segment margins by 50 basis points at the midpoint with a range of 17.8% to 18.3%. And we've raised our margin guidance in each of our segments with the exception of Aerospace and eMobility, which are unchanged. Compared with our original guidance, we expect to deliver better incremental margins for sure on this higher volume. I'd also note that for the full year, we continue to expect net price versus inflation to be neutral.  
And on Page 14, we have the balance of our 2021 guidance. We're raising our full year adjusted EPS by $0.50, to $5.90 to $6.30, a midpoint of $6.10. And this is a 9% increase over our prior guidance and a 24% increase over 2020. With our recent M&A activities, we now expect a net 4% headwind from acquisitions and divestitures, down from our prior outlook of 8%.  
I say it's also worth noting here that our segment margin guidance of 18.1% to 18.5% is 190 basis point increase at the midpoint over 2020, and will be an all-time record. It's also -- this is a point of reference, above our pre-pandemic margins of 17.6%, which we posted in 2019, which was also an all-time record.  
So we're off to a strong start, and I'd say, well on our way to achieve our longer-term targets of getting to 21% segment margins. The remaining components of our full year 2021 guidance remain unchanged. And lastly, for Q2, our guidance is as follows. We expect to be between $1.45 and $1.55 on earnings, for organic revenue to be up 24% to 28% and for segment margins to come in between 17.5% and 17.9%.  
And if I could, just finally, on Page 15, I'll wrap up with a kind of a high-level summary of why we think Eaton remains an attractive long-term investment. And I begin with first, our intelligent power management strategy really does position us to capitalize on these key secular growth trends that we've talked about for the last couple of years: electrification, energy transition and digitalization. And we're gaining traction here. In all of these areas, we put a number of new wins.  
Our technology solutions, including our Brightlayer platform, are being well received by customers. And as a result, we continue to expect higher-than-historical organic growth rates for the company. And over the next 5 years, we're reaffirming our view that 4% to 6% outlook looks very much in hand.  
Now this accelerated growth plus our, what I call, proven ability to deliver margin expansion, will allow us to deliver, on average, 11% to 13% EPS growth per year over the next 5 years. We'll also continue to deliver very strong free cash flow, which provides the optionality to invest in organic growth, to add strategic acquisitions and to return cash to shareholders.  
And  our commitment to ESG remains strong. We'll continue to develop sustainable solutions for our customers, for our own businesses, and certainly for the environment that we all share. 
So with that, I'd like to turn it back to Yan. Obviously, we're very pleased with a really strong start to the year and looking forward to answering your questions."

And I think you're dealing with in terms of trying to model our results and others. And I'd say that what we experienced in Q1, I'd say, is largely, we were able to offset a lot of this commodity inflation that we had been experiencing through hedges and working out of inventory and other agreements. And so the biggest impact for us will be in Q2. And it's one of the reasons why you look at our Q2 guidance, and you say it may be a little muted given the very strong Q1. But that really is the quarter where we expect to see the biggest impact of material cost inflation. We're obviously getting price in the marketplace. It does take us typically a quarter or 2 to fully get pricing seeded into the marketplace. And so certainly, Q2 will be the most challenging quarter. It's certainly factored into our guidance that we've laid out, and it will get better from that point forward. So Q3 and Q4 will be certainly better on an incremental basis than Q2 will be. Fully offsetting it for the year. 
I would add as well that sometimes, in hyperinflationary environment, it's tough to get a full incremental margin on material cost inflation. We'll certainly more than offset it. But certainly, if you think about in hyperinflationary environment, you generally don't get a full incremental margin on inflation."

And our local team, having been in the market for a number of years, building strong relationships with some of the electrical companies in the region, we're able to pull off some really attractive deals. 
And I think a lot of that is attributed to the fact that we're willing to partner. These are JVs that we have 50% of. We won't consolidate the revenue. At least in China, we'll leverage their products and their low-cost footprint, and we will consolidate revenues as we grow these businesses outside of China. But I think it's a combination of our local team's connectivity to the market and Eaton's willingness and proven track record of really being a very successful JV partner. As you know, we have a number of JVs inside of our company in China, in our aerospace business in China. And I think we have a very strong reputation in the country around a company that can very effectively -- you can very effectively partner with. And at the same time, do things that are helpful to both our company and to the companies that we're partnering with. And so we're thrilled with it. 
I would add that, to your other question, we are, in fact, having a number of other conversations around other similar types of transactions. Nothing to announce here today, but we're hopeful that we will continue to build on kind of this pattern of filling product gaps and whether that's a gap because it's a technology that we don't have like the busway products in the China market or it's a product gap in the form of the ability to really compete in the local market because you have a low cost product.

We're certainly benefiting from some restructuring that we've done as a company, and the volume is obviously helping. 
And the big one is, obviously, if you think about Electrical Americas, we divested the Lighting business. And as we continue to work the portfolio in what we call grow the head and shrink the tail, we continue to do things inside of the company to ensure that we're serving attractive markets.

And we see Uday and his team spend a lot of time talking about energy transition and what it's going to mean in terms of opportunities with respect to the grid as electric vehicles continue to grow. And they have both the hardware and the software technology and the billing systems to allow us to really participate in this really fast-growing and exciting space. And so today, they have a solution that works perfectly in the Nordic countries and most of Europe. We'll be taking that technology and integrating it with what we're currently doing in North America so that we have a solution for the North American market as well. And so it's really an important part of our strategy, and it really accelerates what we would have done organically inside of our company by acquiring this company. This gives us, I'd say, at least a couple of year head start for what we were planning to do organically.

And so clearly, commodity cost increase is on our key. Input materials is quite a significant challenge. As you mentioned, freight around the world is up dramatically as well. And then with these challenges, obviously, you're dealing with the intermittent availability issues on things like you reading the newspaper with respect to semiconductors, which is impacting our vehicle business. And also, to a certain extent, is impacting our electrical business. 
And so I think we're dealing with this entire kind of portfolio of challenges right now in the market, and our teams are managing through it extraordinarily well. And I would tell you that the good news in all of this, it's a great indicator of just how strong the market is. And so the other side of dealing with these challenges around inflation and freight and the like is that something very positive must be going on in your end markets, and that's really what we're experiencing. 
And as you know, getting price as a company is something that we do. It's certainly easier. In certain cases, distribution, for example. As long as the market moves, price is a good thing for distribution.

But by and large, our teams are managing it well, and we'd expect things to start to  improve beginning in Q3.

And so yes, our business itself, very well footed with a viewpoint of -- we think it's '23, '24 recovery. We did take some restructuring actions inside of the business. Most of it was around fixed structural costs that will not come back, things that we would have done anyway even in a more healthy environment. 
And as we talked about this in prior years, what we try to do in each of our businesses is have what we call shovel-ready projects. And so this list of restructuring projects that we would undertake at any point in time. And then we simply accelerate them or decelerate them based upon the market environment that we're living in. And that's simply what we did in aerospace.

Within commercial, there are certain segments that continue to do well. We've talked about, for example, warehousing, for example, as a segment that is very strong. And once again, it's another one of these markets with a much higher electrical intensity than other commercial applications. But the commercial market, I'd say, our view on it, in general, what we call commercial, institutional is that this year, we're calling that market to be flat to up slightly, but still a laggard relative to the overall electrical market that we're seeing in general. And then in oil and gas, while we are -- in other places where we're certainly seeing some green shoots and the market is certainly firming, the rig count is increasing, we're starting to see more MRO projects and the like. So that market is improving. 
But once again, relative to the overall electrical market, that market is still a laggard versus the overall electrical market. In that market, we're still calling to be essentially largely flat on the year, but still not a return to kind of the growth that we certainly would expect to see, perhaps beginning at the end of this year into next year."

And I'd say that if you think about the semiconductor issue, it certainly has hit the light vehicle market harder than it has, let's say, the commercial vehicle market. I mean, not to say there aren't challenges in commercial vehicles; there are. We have issues there as well. But it's certainly been a much bigger issue in the light vehicle market. 
And the one thing that's helped us a little bit, I would say, with respect to the way the OEMs are responding to kind of the shortages of semiconductors is that they're tending to make decisions to manufacture to produce their more expensive vehicles. And so what you're finding is trucks and things where they tend to make higher margins are also the places where Eaton has higher content. And so our impact in the way we're being impacted by this semiconductor issue is being somewhat muted by the way the OEMs are prioritizing what they produce. 
And so as we think about Q2, it's maybe a 2% to 3% impact on revenues. And revenues would have been 2% to 3% higher, but for the semiconductor issue overall. And so our teams are once again managing it well, but it is a real issue and one that we expect to really deal with throughout Q2 and maybe even into Q3."

I mean, it's obviously a difficult question to really know for certain in terms of the behavior and what's going on specifically in the channel.

Tough to call it double ordering. I think some of that ordering could be certainly trying to get out in front of price increases, some of that ordering could be to put in some safety stock to protect against concerns about shortages. But I would say that overall, if you think about inventory levels, I say inventory levels, in general, I'd say, are still probably slightly below where they really ought to be. If you think about some of the end markets of residential and others and, let's say, in some of our factory OEM equipment markets, inventory levels there are probably well below where they need to be, and then we're still kind of hand to mouth with respect to dealing with some of the demand that we're seeing. And so I would say, kind of the spirit of the question is, do we think this strength that we're seeing in the Electrical business has legs? Or is it a little bit of an artificial pop that we're seeing? I think mostly, we're comfortable that it's real. The underlying demand that we're seeing in these end markets is real and that's what's really driving the ordering more than anything.

And I'd say that every company has got their own strategy around how you unlock value in your organization.

And so we really think about that as being a  key growth platform for Eaton and a great source of synergies with respect to the way we develop technology, the way we leverage scale in our supply chain. And so we really do see it as an integrated part of our company as we go forward. 
If you think about one of the examples that we mentioned in the earnings call today around this break to our technology, which is basically a resettable circuit breaker that's used in a vehicle application in a market that has historically only used fuses, that's a great example. That core technology came from our electrical business. That's where it was developed. And so our eMobility team lifted that technology, naturally modified it for the commercial vehicle space, and here, we landed a number of key wins that are, we think, at maturity, we could be talking about $100 million worth of business in this kind of space around this break door technology once we get to full maturity and we bed down all the wins that we're working on right now. So we really do see it as a core piece of the way we run the company, the way we leverage our scale and the way we'll ultimately grow our business and synergies that will flow back to both our electrical and to our eMobility segment."

And when you look at kind of the C-30 report, the public sector has tended to be a little stronger than the private sector. When you think about what's going on in commercial construction. And so we obviously have seen some of that already. But the biggest piece of it, we think, is still out in front of us. 
And we think that -- and obviously, it's going to depend upon where these dollars go in terms of this infrastructure build. If it's in roads and bridges, that probably won't have a material impact on our company. But if it's where the Biden administration is pointing a lot of those dollars, whether that's in reduced energy consumption, the greening of the economy, electrification of the economy, building out the electrical infrastructure, grid resiliency, a lot of the things that the administration are talking about not baked into our current forecast and outlook, could be another real, I'd say, leg of growth for our company.

And so yes, they have charging, and they have the hardware associated with charging. And that piece, for us, is interesting because we do think that, depending upon the application that you're in, all charging isn't the same. There is an opportunity, we believe, depending upon which segment of the market you're serving, where the charging infrastructure in and of itself is important. We think there's an opportunity to really pull through and couple the charging infrastructure with what we do on the electrical equipment on year side, which we think will be value-creating. But the real value, ultimately, is really in the software and the way the solutions around how do you manage the charging of vehicles, of fleets, manage the load in a smart way in a really complex environment.

So we'll start on Page 3, like we normally do with highlights of the quarter. And I'll summarize by saying that we had another very strong quarter with -- and we're seeing significant increases, obviously, in our market. 
And as a result of that, we're taking our '21 guidance up for the second time. Our teams continue to perform at a very high level despite significant supply chain disruptions and rising commodity costs. Q2 adjusted earnings of $1.72 were Q2 record, 15% above the midpoint of our guidance and earnings were up nearly a 100% versus last year and importantly, 20% sequentially. 
Our sales were $5.2 billion, up 35%, 27% organically and above the midpoint of our guidance. For the second quarter in a row, we delivered record segment margins. Q2 margins were 18.6%, up 390 basis points from prior year and up 90 basis points sequentially. We're also pleased with our incremental margins of 30%, we think, strong results given the material cost headwinds that we're facing. 
Our order growth was perhaps the biggest highlight of the quarter. Orders are up more than 40% in each of our electrical segments and both ended the quarter with record backlog. And our portfolio transformation continues. We closed the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems and our 50% ownership in Jiangsu YiNeng Electric business in China. 
We're also pleased to have completed the sale of Hydraulics Danfoss yesterday for $3.3 billion. The sale of Hydraulics is certainly a successful outcome for Eaton. our shareholders and for Danfoss, who we think will be an excellent owner of the business. We want to thank our former Hydraulics employees for the loyal service at Eaton, and we wish them well under the leadership of Danfoss. 
Lastly, we continue to make strong progress on our strategic growth initiatives, and I'll point out just a few highlights on the next slide. So turning to Page 4. You've heard us talk about the 3 most important secular growth trends for the company, electrification, energy transition and digitalization. We're making significant progress in all 3 areas, and we're seeing strong results. Highlighting a few notable examples, I'll begin with electrification where we've had significant wins in both our Electrical and Vehicle businesses. 
In Vehicle, we delivered $50 million of new wins for electric fuel powertrains, which includes EV transmission, EV gearing and EV differentials. And I'm noting this example because it demonstrates that even in an area where many of you think about as our traditional Vehicle business, electrification is creating very large growth opportunities for the company. 
In Electrical, as you would expect, our team secured attractive wins tied to renewable energy and residential applications. In this case, we're noting a win with a leading solar and energy storage OEM. In energy transition, we recently won a large distributed energy management project for a leading financial services company. This is a greenfield project and a great example of building as a grid solution. 
Eaton will be providing the low and medium voltage switchgear, our force electrical power monitoring software and our microgrid controller. In digitalization, our Brightlayer team delivered a win in the industrial market with a leading global chemical processing company to provide remote monitoring software solution. In this application, our solutions really leverage Eaton's portfolio of electrical hardware, along with our expertise in power management to provide the customer with real-time operational data, alarms and insights that are delivered directly to their mobile devices. In addition to the operating benefits, the customer will be able to use Brightlayer's industrial trending and measurement data to optimize energy usage. 
So it's an exciting time to be at the center of these 3 growth trends, and we'll certainly keep you updated as we continue to progress in this area. 
Moving to Page 5, we summarize our Q2 results, and I'll point out just a couple of highlights here. First, on 35% total revenue growth, we delivered a 71% increase in operating profit, so very strong operating leverage; second, our adjusted earnings of $690 million increased by 99%, we're also effectively managing our corporate cost. 
Overall, our teams are certainly executing at a very high level. They're efficiently managing supply chain constraints, increasing productivity and delivering the expected benefits from our multiyear restructuring program and a trend that we expect to continue for the balance of the year. 
Turning to Page 6, we summarize the results of our Electrical Americas segment. Revenues were up 15% organically, driven by strength in residential and data center markets but we also had solid growth in commercial and institutional markets as well. 
The acquisition of Tripp Lite added 8% and favorable currency added 1%. Looking at our sequential growth, we were up 8% over Q1. And historically, we would have seen a 5% lift between the quarters, so I'd say our growth rate is accelerating here. Our operating margins increased 60 basis points to 21.3%, a Q2 record. This is 190 basis points above pre-pandemic levels in Q2 of 2019. Our portfolio changes, the sale of Lighting and the acquisition of Tripp Lite, solid execution and benefits once again from our multiyear restructuring program, all contributed to the improvement. 
We're also pleased with the 43% growth in orders in the quarter, a 13% increase on a rolling 12-month basis. This led to also a 43% increase in our backlog, which now sits at a record level. We had broad order strength in all end markets with particular strength once again in data centers, residential and commercial and institutional. 
You'll recall that at the end of Q1, we started to see some large orders in select commercial markets. This pattern strengthened in Q2 and our negotiation pipeline in the commercial market was up significantly. Data, all data, which suggests that the second half of the year and really going into 2022 should see solid growth. 
Turning to Page 7. You'll see the financial summary of our Electrical Global segment. And as you can see, we had strong organic growth here, up 22% and currency added some 6%. Like the Americas, organic revenue growth was driven by residential and data center markets, but we also have broad-based strength in commercial and institutional and utility and in industrial markets as well. 
We posted strong operating margins of 18.3%. Once again, a Q2 record, up 230 basis points from last year and up 130 basis points sequentially. Incremental margins on an organic basis were solid at 32%. Result once again of good cost control and benefits from our multiyear restructuring program. Orders were also very strong, up some 46% from last year and up 10% on a rolling 12-month basis. 
Once again, we had strength across all markets with particular strength in data center and residential markets. And we ended the quarter with record backlog, up from 50% from last year. Moving to Page 8, we show the results of our Aerospace segment. While we have a long way to go, we're starting to see signs of recovery in this market, which posted 17% growth in the quarter. 
As you know, we closed the Cobham transaction on June 1, and the business delivered solid results in the month of June, adding [16%] to our quarterly revenue. Currency also added 3%. Operating margins were 21%, up 600 basis points from last year and 250 basis points sequentially. With improving volumes, the team executed extremely well, delivering 50% incremental margins on an organic basis. 
Orders on a rolling 12-month basis are still down from 16% but this is an improvement from down 36% in Q1. In fact, sequentially, orders were up 12%. The commercial industry is seeing increase in leisure travel, especially in domestic markets. But international travel continues to be down sharply. We think the market will grow over the next several years, but we don't expect to return to 2019 levels until 2024. 
Lastly, our backlog here has stabilized and was flat with last year. Next on Page 9, you see the financial results of our Vehicle segment. Organic revenues more than doubled with strength in all regions. Operating margins were 17.9%, and we delivered very strong incremental margins, which were over 40%. The margin performance was driven by higher volume, certainly, but also once again from the benefit from the multiyear restructuring program. 
And despite volume still being down from 10% to 15% below pre-pandemic levels, the business is really already sitting on the cusp of achieving our long-term margin target of 18%. Now turning to Page 10. We show a summary of our e-mobility business. Revenues were up 57%, 54% organically, 3% from positive currency. The organic revenues were driven by strong growth really in all eMobility markets around the world. Operating margins were negative 6.8%, and they continue to be depressed by heavy investments in new programs. 
As you know, we're investing in this segment in high-voltage power electronics and power distribution and power protection. But you should also be aware that we have significantly expanded our view of the market here. We now see large opportunities for our traditional business in the eMobility segment. These technologies include EV gearing and EV transmissions and torque control solutions.  As I noted earlier, and we already have wins in these areas. In fact, our traditional products have increased the size of the addressable market for eMobility, we think, some $5 billion. And so it continues to be a really exciting segment and a big part of the company's future. 
Moving to Page 11. We've updated our guidance for 2021 on organic revenue. And as you can see, we are significantly increasing our organic revenue growth for the second time this year with an increase in most segments. In fact, we're raising the midpoint of our organic growth guidance by 400 basis points from 8% to 12%. And this is on top of a 300 basis point increase that we took in Q1. The largest increases are in Electrical Global and Vehicle with smaller increases, as you can see, in the Americas and eMobility. 
With very strong first half, robust order book and a growing backlog, we're comfortable with 11% to 13% growth outlook for the year.
This is despite, quite frankly, some of our markets that remain in the week saying we're in the early stages of recovery, notably, commercial construction, industrial, oil and gas and commercial Aerospace. We expect to see certainly continued recovery in these markets over the balance of this year, and we think it bodes well for 2022. 
Next, on Page 12, we show an update on our segment margin guidance for the year. For Eaton overall, we're increasing segment margins by 30 basis points at the midpoint from 18.3% to 18.6%, which will once again be an all-time record for the company. 
The 30 basis point increase, as you know, follows the 50 basis point increase that we reported following our Q1 earnings call. And we've raised the margin guidance in each of our segments with the exception of eMobility. We continue to expect organic incremental margin of around 30% and for price and commodity costs to be approximately neutral for the year. 
Our team has certainly been very effective at managing through these complexities related to price increases and supply chain constraints, and we would expect this to continue through the balance of the year. And on Page 13, we have the remaining items of our 2021 guidance. We're raising our full year adjusted earnings per share by [$0.63] to a range of $6.58 to $6.88. At the midpoint, $6.73. This is an increase of 10% over our prior guidance and a 37% increase over 2020. You'll recall that we raised guidance by [$0.50] in Q1. With this increase, we're now forecasting a a 20% increase from the midpoint of our original guidance, which was $5.60. With our recent M&A activities, we now see net headwinds of 1% from acquisitions and divestitures, and this is down from our prior outlook of 4%, and we now expect positive currency of $350 million, up from our prior forecast of $200 million. 
And we're also raising our guidance for adjusted operating cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, both up $200 million at the midpoint. The increase is really driven by a combination of higher profits on organic growth and sales, the timing of acquisitions and divestitures, but also partially offset by some investments that we're making in working capital given the current constrained supply chain environment. 
The remaining components of our full year guidance remain unchanged. And lastly, our Q3 guidance is as follows. We expect earnings to be $1.72 to $1.82. Organic revenues to be up 11% to 13% and for segment margins to come in between 19% and 19.4%. And lastly, I'll wrap up the presentation on Page 14. You've heard us talk for the last few years about Eaton's transformation into an intelligent power management company. This strategy is built on the belief that there's a few secular growth trends electrification, energy transition and digitalization that allow the company to grow at a much faster rate than we have historically. And every day, we get confirmation that we're on the right path. We're seeing it in the growing importance of sustainability initiatives in society. 
We're seeing it in government spending, and we're certainly seeing it in our opportunities and in our win. We're pleased with the progress that we've made on the portfolio. Each move has been consistent with our objectives of delivering a company that has faster growth, higher margins and better earnings consistency. And you've seen our track record on margin expansion. The Eaton Business System is what provides the consistent approach to how we run the company, how we execute and how we expand margins and it's working. 
And this enables us to be on track to expand margins by the 400 to 500 basis points over the 5-year planning period. And as you can see, we're running ahead of plan. And we're committed to our sustainability goals. They reflect the right thing to do for society but just as importantly, sustainability is at the core of what's driving our growth. I'd also note that we published our 2020 sustainability report and our first task force on climate-related financial disclosure reports at the end of June. I encourage those of you who have a special interest in sustainability to read it, I think they're extremely well done and reflect the direction of the company's [edited]. Lastly, we continue to generate very attractive cash flows -- We'll continue to generate very attractive cash flow. 
Over $9 billion through 2025, which will allow us to return cash to shareholders and also make investments to grow the company. And as you can see, we're off to a very strong start in 2021. At the midpoint of our guidance, once again, revenue is expected to grow 12% and earnings by 37%. So with that, I'll turn it back to Yan and open the line for questions."

And so I'd say a lot of what you're seeing today, I just think is a reflection of the broader strength in many of our end markets. And certainly, we always talk about data center is a great example of the world is consuming and process and ensuring an increasing amount of data. So I think a lot of what you're seeing today is restocking because markets have certainly been strong in many of our end markets. 
Inventories were taken down pretty hard in the pandemic last year. And so I'd say, once again, broad-based strength. We talked about the fact that there's been a lot of stuff written about what's going to happen with commercial construction. Commercial construction has come back very strongly. And we we had outstanding orders as well as negotiations in the commercial and institutional side of the business as well. And so it really has been a story of really broad-based strength in orders across almost every end market in every geography. So at this juncture, we think we're at the very front end of what should be a pretty exciting runway as we look forward as some of the longer-cycle businesses we talked about, whether that's commercial construction or oil and gas or some of these other markets, the large projects start to come back into the business. We think this should go on for a while [indiscernible]."

If you think about modeling the company on a go-forward basis, clearly, we're having to make some fairly sizable investments in the business right now as we deal with a revenue growth outlook that's more robust than what we've seen historically. So we'll be putting some investments in the business. We'll also obviously investing pretty heavily right now in electrification in places like eMobility and as well as in other aspects of the business like in Brightlayer platform that we're bringing online. 
So we think that, that 30% incremental number is not a good planning guideline as you think about modeling the future of the organization. And it's largely, I think, on the basis of the investments that we're going to be making in the business that perhaps will pull back what could be an incremental story that would expand. But given the investments that we think are important to make for the future growth of the company, we think 30% makes a lot of sense."

And so we continue to see positive signs in commercial construction markets, and we don't think there's any reason why there should be any letter from those markets as we think about going into the second half of this year or into 2022. 
Our negotiation pipeline, which as we talked about on prior calls, proceeds in order, obviously, and our negotiation pipeline for both light commercial as well as large commercial projects, including commercial buildings, was up very strongly year-on-year and up actually very strongly sequentially as well. And so at this juncture, we're optimistic that commercial construction will come back. And we think the second half of this year and into next year should post fairly strong growth."

And so we think the industrial markets are another one of these markets that I think in the relatively early stages of recovery, there's been relative underinvestment in manufacturing over the last number of years.

And it's one of the reasons why we made the acquisition of Green Motion. 
We acquired Green Motion, which is a European company that does everything from the physical hardware of charging all the way through the charge port operating and billing systems. And so we think that e-charging, whether that's at residential, commercial buildings or really more on a grid scale and the bigger industrial application is going to be an important part of what we're trying to do inside of our Electrical business. 
Those markets, as you're seeing, and you see it reflected in some of the infrastructure bills that are being proposed in the U.S., you see fairly sizable investments that are taking place in Europe and in Asia.

But I said it also, even in our legacy Vehicle business, and that's what we're really highlighting this quarter is that you think about this legacy business that we had and you say, what's going to happen to that business in the context of the world's transition to electric vehicles. When we say, ""Hey, there's a huge growth opportunity in gears and differentials in transmission, hybrid transmissions for our legacy business as well. And so those opportunities for us -- and we laid out a goal of getting to $2 billion to $4 billion between now and 2030. But the opportunity set is much larger in order of magnitude 5, 10x greater than it would be for our traditional Vehicle business where we're doing valve and valve actuation and some charging.

And we're obviously dealing with fairly sizable challenges in and around supply chain and probably no secret in tea on the call. When we provided our Q2 earnings guidance at the end of Q1, we had an expectation around the amount of commodity inflation that we would see in the business and commodity prices, quite frankly, have only gone up and in some cases, fairly significantly since that time. So we've naturally as an organization, have had to continue to work to offset additional commodity price inflation more than what we anticipated. And I really think about that whole thing maybe even shifting a full quarter in terms of the pressure points that we expected to see in the business. And so at this juncture, when we think about the year, we call in the year neutral. 
We don't think it gets worse in terms of the impact on our company and the balance between price and cost, but we think the year is neutral. And we think the pressure point in Q3 are going to be probably as great as what we expected in Q2 as a result, quite frankly, of seeing commodity prices continue to run. And once again, we're running to obviously catch up with that in terms of the things that we're doing around taking prices up in the market as well as working on things to take costs out of the organization. So neutral for the year, things have probably shifted according to the right based upon the fact that commodity prices have continued to run."

The team very proactively and aggressively put in a number of restructuring programs to take out some of the fixed costs that we knew would be a challenge on a go-forward basis. And so I would really attribute it to the team being proactive, putting in the restructuring early in the downturn and then really doing an effective job of running the business as well as managing costs. 
In terms of the expectation going forward, yes, I think it's reasonable to say that as this business improves, we approach 25% return on sales in our Aerospace business back in 2019 prior to the downturn. And our goal is certainly to get back to those numbers. But I do think something north of 20% is where really we'd expect this business to perform.

And I'd say that our Aerospace business probably it's not too much of an outlier from what you've seen from others in the market. Clearly, the commercial side of the house continues to be under pretty significant pressure, while we're certainly seeing revenue passenger kilometers return, those markets are still running well below where they ran in 2019. We did see a little bit of an improvement in aftermarket in the quarter as that business certainly off dramatically last year. 
And so I'd say that the commercial OE continues to be weak. Commercial aftermarket is still weak versus where we've been historically but improving. And really, on the military side of the house, I'd say pretty much no change. And you think about that business being kind of a low single-digit grower is kind of our outlook for the military market, and we think that's pretty much consistent with what we think the outlook is going to be over the near term as well. So a lot of the -- once again, the margin piece, really, I'd say, is mostly a function of our team's ability to execute.

Currently, in the residential markets in Electrical, we're well short of where we should be, and our distributors have not been able to restock. I think the fact that we're building fairly sizable backlog is a reflection of the fact that some of these end markets would like to have more inventory than they're currently sitting on.

And I'd say we do have capacity depending upon which segment of the business you're talking about. I'd say that one of the good things about being kind of an organization that works across multiple businesses and industries is that and doing the deals, the size that we've done is that none of these deals are going to be so big that they're going to really consume the capacity of the entire company. 
And so if you're talking about some of the things that we've done recently in Aerospace, they may be a little bit full on the Fuel and Motion side of the business, but we have capacity maybe on the other side. And the same thing would be true in Electrical. We really haven't done very large deals in Electrical. We've done very strategic deals. We've done deals that I think are outstanding additions to the portfolio. But I'd say, by and large, in our Electrical business, we have plenty of capacity organizationally to go out and find opportunities and to bring them in and integrate them in, and that will not be a bottleneck or a limiter in terms of our ability to actually go out and transaction.

So that will be kind o",666,"Yes. So on the M&A focused question specifically, I'd say that if you just think about it strategically, we've laid out as a company, these 3 kind of major secular growth trends of electrification, energy transition, digitalization. So that will be kind of a good kind of framework when you think about where we're likely to deploy M&A dollars in terms of following the strategic kind of growth vectors that we think are important to the company. If you think about acquiring a company like Green Motion, think about acquiring a company like Tripp Lite, which is really in data centers and 5G expansion. And so as you think about what we've done, they ought to be really thought about as an expression of the strategy in the areas that we said that we'd like to really take the future of the company. In addition to that, if you think about it geographically, we have huge opportunities. 
So outside of the Americas market to really round out the business portfolio and participate as we mentioned, like in China and some of these very large markets that have been historically closed to us. we have those kinds of opportunities in Asia sell. We have some of those opportunities that still remain in Europe. 
And so there will be some geographic plays where we'll actually do things to augment supplement the portfolio as a way of participating in markets that we have historically essentially not played in as fully as we do, let's say, in the North America market. So I think you're going to find that is a pretty wide set of opportunities that we have to continue to look at ways of growing the company through M&A in our Electrical business based upon these broader strategic platforms as well as the geographic expansion and filling some of these product gaps and some of these other emerging markets of the world. 
The other question that you had with respect to kind of the Global business and why the increase in the guide. I'd say, one, I mean you just think about it on a relative basis, the Global markets fell more than the Americas business. And so the comp is a little easier there. 
But also in some of these global markets, specifically in Europe, for example, they're now coming back. The reopening of these markets is also coming into the business at a time when, once again, the markets are ramping. And so the same kind of reopening kind of phenomenon that took place in the U.S. off of a higher base because they didn't close as much is now starting to take place in markets across Europe. And as I said, it's every place. I mean it's not just in -- These historical hot segments of data centers and residential, but we're seeing it in commercial institutional, seeing it industrial. We're seeing it in utility. 
So really, it's a broad set of end markets that are really responding nicely in Europe and quite frankly, in Asia as well as the economies continue to open and our underlying growth in Asia and our underlying growth in the European pieces that make up the Global business, those markets, I'd say, both performed very well. The one segment that, if you recall that we report inside of Global that tend to be or will be more of a later cycle play will be what's happening in our [indiscernible] business, which is kind of the place where we really get most of our oil and gas exposure, that market is starting to see a number of green shoots. 
Still certainly not back to levels that it was at historically. But we think second half of this year and into '22, that market also starts to come back and should help continue to drive growth in the Global segment. So it's really kind of a broad range of these end markets, most of which that are doing well right now."

Appreciate the price cost commentary for the balance of the year. But just wondering, as you look across your portfolio and as we think about incrementals next year, where do you think price will be most sticky?

As I said earlier, we anti",365,"Yes, I appreciate the question on price cost, and it's in many ways, we're kind of all kind of working through this period of unprecedented commodity inflation and learning together in terms of where it's actually going to land. As I said earlier, we anticipated that we would have seen the worst of it in Q2, and it looks like a lot of those pressure points have been pushed out into Q3 into the second half of the year. 
And and once again, I think as a general rule, we talk about being neutral between pricing cost. And I don't think there's any reason to suggest that, that won't be the case that price cost will continue to be neutral. It does, as you can imagine, put a little pressure on our incrementals as well as you don't typically get a normal incremental on commodity inflation. And so in terms of how it impacts incrementals, it obviously puts downward pressure on incrementals. 
But having said that, we still think 30% from a planning perspective is the right way to think about incrementals for the company. On price stickiness, I'd say that typically speaking, if you're in an inflationary environment and the commodity costs are up, the price is going to be sticky. And so in this kind of environment, it's never easy to get price. But I'd say, in this kind of environment, it's very understandable that prices are going to go up. It's very well publicized, everybody is dealing with the same challenges. And so I would imagine that price will be very, very sticky in this environment, given the supply shortages across the board.  
The fact that markets are doing well, really today, I'd say almost across the board. And so it said it's never easy, but this is probably 1 of the easiest times at least in my professional career to actually pass on price because essentially, the environmental factors are essentially warranting it. We're seeing labor inflation as well. And so all of these things bode well for at least the price environment and suggesting prices will likely be sticky through this part of the cycle for some time to come."

There's always going to be quarterly timing, depending upon what companies do in various end markets and segments or the geographic mix. But I would suggest to you that probably at this point in time, given the fact that so many of us are dealing with supply chain challenges and there's probably more business out there than any of us can handle and we're building pretty large backlogs and probably other companies are as well. 
So my speculation would be that there's probably not large share changes taking place at this point in the market. So we're probably holding market share in terms of our core businesses. And we would imagine that really until you get to the point where you actually have enough capacity to serve the underlying demand overall and you stop building backlog, that share shift is probably not going to be something that's a big part of the picture, at least in the near term."

We think as we look into the future for the utility market, we think it becomes one of the faster-growing segments inside of the company. So maybe that growth is mid-single digits in the near term. 
And as you think about some of the big investments that have to go into energy transition first, which is obviously a really big one, and then that obviously involves things like grid hardening and grid resiliency due to climate change and some of the weather-related events that we've seen. And so we like the utility market, and we think that, that market will certainly be a growth market into the future. I will say that we've not yet seen once again, these big inflection points that we would expect to see in the utility market. 
We think most of that growth is still out in front of us. Those markets, as you know, they tend to move more slowly. We have, over the last number of years seen more investments going into the distribution side of utility, which certainly plays to our strength. But the bigger plays that we think around grid hardening, grid resilience, energy transition, the things that utilities are going to have to make fairly sizable investments in.

And as we've said before, that those markets that can be lumpy. There could be a quarter or 2 or even a year or so where a particular hyperscale player will take the time to consolidate and not expand. And so the business can be lumpy at least specifically in hyperscale. But the projections for that market and what we've experienced is that it continues to surprise on the upside with respect to growth. I think this year, we're talking about high teens kind of growth in the data center market.

So we'll start on Page 3, like we normally do, with highlights of the quarter. And I'll summarize by saying that we had another very strong quarter with -- we're seeing significant increases, obviously, in our market.  And as a result of that, we're taking our '21 guidance up for the second time. Our teams continue to perform at a very high level despite significant supply chain disruptions and rising commodity costs. Q2 adjusted earnings of $1.72 were Q2 record, 15% above the midpoint of our guidance; and earnings were up nearly a 100% versus last year, and importantly, 20% sequentially.  
Our sales were $5.2 billion, up 35%, 27% organically, and above the midpoint of our guidance. For the second quarter in a row, we delivered record segment margins. Q2 margins were 18.6%, up 390 basis points from prior year and up 90 basis points sequentially. We're also pleased with our incremental margins of 30%. We think, strong results given the material cost headwinds that we're facing.  
Our order growth was perhaps the biggest highlight of the quarter. Orders were up more than 40% in each of our electrical segments, and both ended the quarter with record backlog. And our portfolio transformation continues. We closed the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems and our 50% ownership in Jiangsu YiNeng Electric business in China.  
We're also pleased to have completed the sale of Hydraulics to Danfoss yesterday for $3.3 billion. The sale of Hydraulics is certainly a successful outcome for Eaton, our shareholders and for Danfoss, who we think will be an excellent owner of the business. We want to thank our former Hydraulics employees for their loyal service to Eaton, and we wish them well under the leadership of Danfoss.  
Lastly, we continue to make strong progress on our strategic growth initiatives, and I'll point out just a few highlights on the next slide. So turning to Page 4. You've heard us talk about the 3 most important secular growth trends for the company: electrification, energy transition and digitalization. We're making significant progress in all 3 areas, and we're seeing strong results. Highlighting a few notable examples, I'll begin with electrification where we've had significant wins in both our Electrical and Vehicle businesses.  
In Vehicle, we delivered $50 million of new wins for electric vehicle powertrains, which includes EV transmission, EV gearing and EV differentials. And I'm noting this example because it demonstrates that even in an area where many of you think about as our traditional vehicle business, electrification is creating very large growth opportunities for the company.  
In Electrical, as you would expect, our team secured attractive wins tied to renewable energy and residential applications. In this case, we're noting a win with a leading solar and energy storage OEM. In energy transition, we recently won a large distributed energy management project for a leading financial services company. This is a greenfield project and a great example of building as a grid solution.  
Eaton will be providing the low and medium voltage switchgear, our Foreseer electrical power monitoring software, and our microgrid controller. 
In digitalization, our Brightlayer team delivered a win in the industrial market with a leading global chemical processing company to provide remote monitoring software solution. In this application, our solutions really leverage Eaton's portfolio of electrical hardware, along with our expertise in power management, to provide the customer with real-time operational data, alarms and insights that are delivered directly to their mobile devices. In addition to the operating benefits, the customer will be able to use Brightlayer's industrial trending and measurement data to optimize energy usage.  
So it's an exciting time to be at the center of these 3 growth trends, and we'll certainly keep you updated as we continue to progress in this area.  
Moving to Page 5, we summarize our Q2 results, and I'll point out just a couple of highlights here. First, on 35% total revenue growth, we delivered a 71% increase in operating profit. So very strong operating leverage. Second, our adjusted earnings of $690 million increased by 99%, and we're also effectively managing our corporate cost.  
Overall, our teams are certainly executing at a very high level. They're efficiently managing supply chain constraints, increasing productivity and delivering the expected benefits from our multiyear restructuring program, and a trend that we expect to continue for the balance of the year.  
Turning to Page 6, we summarize the results of our Electrical Americas segment. Revenues were up 15% organically, driven by strength in residential and data center markets, but we also had solid growth in commercial and institutional markets as well.  The acquisition of Tripp Lite added 8%, and favorable currency added 1%. Looking at our sequential growth, we were up 8% over Q1. And historically, we would have seen a 5% lift between the quarters, so I'd say our growth rate is accelerating here. Our operating margins increased 60 basis points to 21.3%, a Q2 record. This is 190 basis points above pre-pandemic levels in Q2 of 2019. Our portfolio changes, the sale of Lighting and the acquisition of Tripp Lite, solid execution and benefits, once again, from our multiyear restructuring program, all contributed to the improvement.  
We're also pleased with the 43% growth in orders in the quarter, a 13% increase on a rolling 12-month basis. This led to also a 43% increase in our backlog, which now sits at record level. We had broad order strength in all end markets, with particular strength once again in data centers, residential and commercial and institutional.  
You'll recall that at the end of Q1, we started to see some large orders in select commercial markets. This pattern strengthened in Q2, and our negotiation pipeline in the commercial market was up significantly. Data, all data would suggest that the second half of the year and really going into 2022 should see solid growth.  
Turning to Page 7. You'll see the financial summary of our Electrical Global segment. And as you can see, we had strong organic growth here, up 22%, and currency added some 6%. Like the Americas, organic revenue growth was driven by residential and data center markets, but we also have broad-based strength in commercial and institutional and utility and in industrial markets as well.  
We posted strong operating margins of 18.3%. Once again, a Q2 record, up 230 basis points from last year and up 130 basis points sequentially. Incremental margins on an organic basis were solid at 32%. Result, once again, of good cost control and benefits from our multiyear restructuring program. Orders were also very strong, up some 46% from last year and up 10% on a rolling 12-month basis.  
Once again, we had strength across all markets, with particular strength in data center and residential markets. And we ended the quarter with record backlog, up from 50% from last year. 
Moving to Page 8, we show the results of our Aerospace segment. While we have a long way to go, we're starting to see signs of recovery in this market, which posted 17% growth in the quarter.  As you know, we closed the Cobham transaction on June 1, and the business delivered solid results in the month of June, adding 16 to our quarterly revenue. Currency also added 3%. Operating margins were 21%, up 600 basis points from last year and 250 basis points sequentially. With improving volumes, the team executed extremely well, delivering 50% incremental margins on an organic basis.  
Orders on a rolling 12-month basis are still down from 16%, but this is an improvement from down 36% in Q1. In fact, sequentially, orders were up 12%. The commercial industry is seeing increase in leisure travel, especially in domestic markets. But international travel continues to be down sharply. We think the market will grow over the next several years, but we don't expect it to return to 2019 levels until 2024.  Lastly, our backlog here has stabilized and was flat with last year. 
Next on Page 9, you see the financial results of our Vehicle segment. Organic revenues more than doubled with strength in all regions. Operating margins were 17.9%, and we delivered very strong incremental margins, which were over 40%. The margin performance was driven by higher volume, certainly, but also once again from the benefit from the multiyear restructuring program.  And despite volume still being down from 10% to 15% below pre-pandemic levels, the business is really already sitting on the cusp of achieving our long-term margin target of 18%. 
Now turning to Page 10. We show a summary of our eMobility business. Revenues were up 57%; 54% organically, 3% from positive currency. The organic revenues were driven by strong growth really in all eMobility markets around the world. Operating margins were negative 6.8%, and they continue to be depressed by heavy investments in new programs.  
As you know, we're investing in this segment in high-voltage power electronics and power distribution and power protection. But you should also be aware that we have significantly expanded our view of the market here. We now see large opportunities for our traditional business in the eMobility segment. These technologies include EV gearing, EV transmissions and torque control solutions.  As I noted earlier -- and we already have wins in these areas. In fact, our traditional products have increased the size of the addressable market for eMobility, we think, some $5 billion. And so it continues to be a really exciting segment and a big part of the company's future.  
Moving to Page 11. We've updated our guidance for 2021 on organic revenue. And as you can see, we are significantly increasing our organic revenue growth for the second time this year with an increase in most segments. In fact, we're raising the midpoint of our organic growth guidance by 400 basis points from 8% to 12%. And this is on top of a 300-basis-point increase that we took in Q1. The largest increases are in Electrical Global and Vehicle, with smaller increases, as you can see, in the Americas and eMobility.  
With very strong first half, robust order book and a growing backlog, we're comfortable with 11% to 13% growth outlook for the year. This is despite, quite frankly, some of our markets that remain in the week saying we're in the early stages of recovery, notably, commercial construction, industrial, oil and gas and Commercial Aerospace. We expect to see certainly continued recovery in these markets over the balance of this year, and we think it bodes well for 2022.  
Next, on Page 12, we show an update on our segment margin guidance for the year. For Eaton overall, we're increasing segment margins by 30 basis points at the midpoint, from 18.3% to 18.6%, which will once again be an all-time record for the company.  
The 30-basis-point increase, as you know, follows the 50-basis-point increase that we reported following our Q1 earnings call. And we've raised the margin guidance in each of our segments with the exception of eMobility. We continue to expect organic incremental margin of around 30%, and for price and commodity costs to be approximately neutral for the year.  
Our team has certainly been very effective at managing through these complexities related to price increases and supply chain constraints, and we would expect this to continue through the balance of the year. 
And on Page 13, we have the remaining items of our 2021 guidance. We're raising our full year adjusted earnings per share by [ $0.53 ] to a range of $6.58 to $6.88. At the midpoint, $6.73. This is an increase of 10% over our prior guidance and a 37% increase over 2020. You'll recall that we raised guidance by $0.50 in Q1. With this increase, we're now forecasting a 20% increase from the midpoint of our original guidance, which was $5.60. With our recent M&A activities, we now see net headwinds of 1% from acquisitions and divestitures, and this is down from our prior outlook of 4%, and we now expect positive currency of $350 million, up from our prior forecast of $200 million.  
And we're also raising our guidance for adjusted operating cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, both up $200 million at the midpoint. The increase is really driven by a combination of higher profits on organic growth and sales, the timing of acquisitions and divestitures, but also partially offset by some investments that we're making in working capital given the current constrained supply chain environment.  The remaining components of our full year guidance remain unchanged. 
And lastly, our Q3 guidance is as follows: We expect earnings to be $1.72 to $1.82, organic revenues to be up 11% to 13%, and for segment margins to come in between 19% and 19.4%. 
And lastly, I'll wrap up the presentation on Page 14. You've heard us talk for the last few years about Eaton's transformation into an intelligent power management company. This strategy is built on the belief that there's a few secular growth trends: electrification, energy transition and digitalization, that allow the company to grow at a much faster rate than we have historically. And every day, we get confirmation that we're on the right path. We're seeing it in the growing importance of sustainability initiatives in society.  We're seeing it in government spending. And we're certainly seeing it in our opportunities and in our win. We're pleased with the progress that we've made on the portfolio. Each move has been consistent with our objectives of delivering a company that has faster growth, higher margins and better earnings consistency. And you've seen our track record on margin expansion. The Eaton Business System is what provides the consistent approach to how we run the company, how we execute and how we expand margins and it's working.  And this enables us to be on track to expand margins by the 400 to 500 basis points over the 5-year planning period. And as you can see, we're running ahead of plan. 
And we're committed to our sustainability goals. They reflect the right thing to do for society, but just as importantly, sustainability is at the core of what's driving our growth. I'd also note that we published our 2020 sustainability report and our first task force on climate-related financial disclosure reports at the end of June. I encourage those of you who have a special interest in sustainability to read it. I think they're extremely well done and reflect the direction that the company's headed in. 
Lastly, we continue to generate very attractive cash flows -- we'll continue to generate very attractive cash flow.  Over $9 billion through 2025, which will allow us to return cash to shareholders and also make investments to grow the company. And as you can see, we're off to a very strong start in 2021. At the midpoint of our guidance, once again, revenue is expected to grow 12% and earnings by 37%. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Yan and open the line for questions."

And order were really strong across all geographies and end markets with, as I mentioned, the highest growth coming in data centers and residential. And we talk about the secular growth trends that will be such an important part of the future of the company, we still believe strongly we're just in the early innings of really seeing a material impact from some of these bigger secular growth trends that are going to drive, we think, the future of the organization. We're not seeing any benefits around government kind of infrastructure spending yet. And so I'd say a lot of what you're seeing today, I just think, is a reflection of the broader strength in many of our end markets. And certainly, we always talk about data center is a great example of the world is consuming and processing and storing increasing amounts of data. 
So I think a lot of what you're seeing today is restocking because markets have certainly been strong in many of our end markets. Inventories were taken down pretty hard in the pandemic last year. And so I'd say, once again, broad-based strength. We talked about the fact that there's been a lot of stuff written about what's going to happen with commercial construction. Commercial construction has come back very strongly. And we had outstanding orders as well as negotiations in the commercial and institutional side of the business as well. And so it really has been a story of really broad-based strength in orders across almost every end market in every geography. 
So at this juncture, we think we're at the very front end of what should be a pretty exciting runway as we look forward as some of the longer-cycle businesses we talked about, whether that's commercial construction or oil and gas or some of these other markets, the large projects start to come back into the business, we think this should go on for a while as well."

So we'll be putting some investments in the business. We're also obviously investing pretty heavily right now in electrification, in places like eMobility and as well as in other aspects of the business like in the Brightlayer platform that we're bringing online. 
So we think that, that 30% incremental number is still a good planning guideline as you think about modeling the future of the organization. And it's largely, I think, on the basis of the investments that we're going to be making in the business that perhaps will pull back what could be an incremental story that would expand. But given the investments that we think are important to make for the future growth of the company, we think 30% makes a lot of sense."

And so we continue to see positive signs in commercial construction markets, and we don't think there's any reason why there should be any letter from those markets as we think about going into the second half of this year or into 2022. 
Our negotiation pipeline, which as we talked about on prior calls, proceeds in order, obviously. And our negotiation pipeline for both light commercial as well as large commercial projects, including commercial buildings, was up very strongly year-on-year and up actually very strongly sequentially as well. And so at this juncture, we're optimistic that commercial construction will come back. And we think the second half of this year and into next year should post fairly strong growth."

We acquired Green Motion, which is a European company that does everything from the physical hardware of charging, all the way through the charge port operating and billing systems. And so we think that e-charging, whether that's at residential, commercial buildings or really more on a grid scale and the bigger industrial application is going to be an important part of what we're trying to do inside of our Electrical business. 
Those markets, as you're seeing, and you see it reflected in some of the infrastructure bills that are being proposed in the U.S., you see fairly sizable investments that are taking place in Europe and in Asia. So we do think e-charging, both in the physical hardware as well as in the software will be an important part of what we're going to try to get done in our Electrical business.

But I said it also, even in our legacy Vehicle business, and that's what we're really highlighting this quarter, is that you think about this legacy business that we had and you say, what's going to happen to that business in the context of the world's transition to electric vehicles. When we say, ""Hey, there's a huge growth opportunity in gears, in differentials, in transmission, hybrid transmission for our legacy business as well. And so those opportunities for us -- and we laid out a goal of getting to $2 billion to $4 billion between now and 2030.

And we're obviously dealing with fairly sizable challenges in and around supply chain, and probably no secret getting in on the call.

And in some cases, fairly significantly since that time. So we've naturally as an organization, have had to continue to work to offset additional commodity price inflation more than what we anticipated. And I really think about that whole thing maybe even shifting a whole quarter in terms of the pressure points that we expected to see in the business. And so at this juncture, when we think about the year, calling the year neutral, we don't think it gets worse in terms of the impact on our company and the balance between price and cost, but we think the year is neutral. And we think the pressure point in Q3 are going to be probably as great as what we expected in Q2 as a result, quite frankly, of seeing commodity prices continue to run. And once again, we're running to obviously catch up with that in terms of the things that we're doing around taking prices up in the market as well as working on things to take cost out of the organization.

And so I would really attribute it to the team being proactive, putting in the restructuring early in the downturn, and then really doing an effective job of running the business as well as managing cost. 
In terms of the expectation going forward, yes, I think it's reasonable to say that as this business improves, we approached 25% return on sales in our Aerospace business back in 2019 prior to the downturn. And our goal is certainly to get back to those numbers. But I do think something north of 20% is where really we'd expect this business to perform.

And I'd say that our Aerospace business probably is not too much of an outlier from what you've seen from others in the market. Clearly, the commercial side of the house continues to be under pretty significant pressure, while we're certainly seeing revenue passenger kilometers return, those markets are still running well below where they ran in 2019. We did see a little bit of an improvement in aftermarket in the quarter as that business certainly off dramatically last year. 
And so I'd say that the commercial OE continues to be weak. Commercial aftermarket is still weak versus where we've been historically, but improving. And really, on the military side of the house, I'd say pretty much no change. And if think about that business being kind of a low single-digit grower is kind of our outlook for the military market, and we think that's pretty much consistent with what we think the outlook is going to be over the near term as well. 
So a lot of the -- once again, the margin piece, really, I'd say, is mostly a function of our team's ability to execute. It wasn't in any way driven by, let's say, a dramatic mix shift to aftermarket business overall."

But maybe you could just give us a little bit of color on that dynamic? And do you think we're somewhat caught up on inventory relative to where the demand is?"

But then there are certainly certain segments of the market where we're woefully short. And good point -- case in point would be what's happening today in the residential market. 
Currently, in the residential markets in Electrical, we're well short of where we should be, and our distributors have not been able to restock. I think the fact that we're building fairly sizable backlog is a reflection of the fact that some of these end markets would like to have more inventory than they're currently sitting on. But in aggregate, I do think that inventories are probably largely in line with our view and our outlook and our previous outlook for the market going forward other than in certain of the subsegments of the market."

And it is, to your point, I'd say the deal activity has certainly heated up, and the pipeline today is probably about as full as it's been in some time. And I'd say we do have capacity, depending upon which segment of the business you're talking about. I'd say that one of the good things about being kind of an organization that works across multiple businesses and industries is that -- and doing the deal at the size that we've done is that none of these deals are going to be so big that they're going to really consume the capacity of the entire company. 
And so if you're talking about some of the things that we've done recently in Aerospace, they may be a little bit full on the Fuel and Motion side of the business, but we have capacity maybe on the other side. The same thing would be true in Electrical. 
We really haven't done very large deals in Electrical. We've done very strategic deals. We've done deals that I think are outstanding additions to the portfolio. But I'd say, by and large, in our Electrical business, we have plenty of capacity, organizationally, to go out and find opportunities and to bring them in and integrate them in, and that will not be a bottleneck or a limiter in terms of our ability to actually go out and do transaction. And we continue to say from a priority standpoint, we continue to be focused on Electrical and Aerospace as the 2 places that we'll likely deploy capital."

So on the M&A-focused question specifically, I'd say that if you just think about it strategically, we've laid out as a company these 3 kind of major secular growth trends of electrification, energy transition, digitalization. So that will be kind of",666,"Yes. So on the M&A-focused question specifically, I'd say that if you just think about it strategically, we've laid out as a company these 3 kind of major secular growth trends of electrification, energy transition, digitalization. So that will be kind of a good kind of framework when you think about where we're likely to deploy M&A dollars in terms of following these strategic kind of growth vectors that we think are important to the company. If you think about acquiring a company like Green Motion, think about acquiring a company like Tripp Lite, which is really in data centers and 5G expansion. And so as you think about what we've done, they ought to be really thought about as an expression of the strategy in the areas that we said that we'd like to really take the future of the company. 
In addition to that, if you think about it geographically, we have huge opportunities. So outside of the Americas market, to really round out the business portfolio and participate, as we mentioned, like in China and some of these very large markets that have been historically closed to us. We have those kinds of opportunities in Asia still. We have some of those opportunities that still remain in Europe. 
And so there will be some geographic plays where we'll actually do things to augment, supplement the portfolio as a way of participating in markets that we have historically essentially not played in as fully as we do, let's say, in the North America market. 
So I think you're going to find that there's a pretty wide set of opportunities that we have to continue to look at ways of growing the company through M&A in our Electrical business based upon these broader strategic platforms as well as the geographic expansion and filling some of these product gaps and some of these other emerging markets of the world. 
The other question that you had with respect to kind of the Global business and why the increase in the guide. I'd say, one, I mean, you just think about it on a relative basis, the Global markets fell more than the Americas business. And so the comp is a little easier there. 
But also, in some of these global markets, specifically in Europe, for example, they're now coming back. The reopening of these markets is also coming into the business at a time when, once again, the markets are ramping. And so the same kind of reopening kind of phenomenon that took place in the U.S. off of a higher base, because they didn't close as much, is now starting to take place in markets across Europe. And as I said, it's every place. I mean, it's not just in these historical hot segments of data centers and residential, we're seeing it in commercial institutional, we're seeing it in industrial. We're seeing it in utility. And so really, it's a broad set of end markets that are really responding nicely in Europe, and quite frankly, in Asia as well as these economies continue to open. 
Our underlying growth in Asia and our underlying growth in the European pieces that make up the Global business, those markets, I'd say, both performed very well. The one segment that, if you recall, that we report inside of Global that tend to be or will be more of a later cycle play will be what's happening in our kraft Heinz business, which is kind of the place where we really get most of our oil and gas exposure. That market is starting to see a number of green shoots. Still certainly not back to levels that it was at historically. But we think second half of this year and into '22, that market also starts to come back and should help continue to drive growth in the Global segment. So it's really kind of a broad range of these end markets, most of which that are doing well right now."

As I said earlier, we anticipated that we would have seen the worst of it in Q2, and it looks like a lot of those pressure points have been pushed out into Q3 into the second half of the year. 
And once again, I think as a general rule, we talk about being neutral between price and cost. And I don't think there's any reason to suggest that, that won't be the case, that price cost will continue to be neutral. It does, as you can imagine, put a little pressure on our incrementals as well as you don't typically get a normal incremental on commodity inflation. And so in terms of how it impacts incrementals, it obviously puts downward pressure on incrementals. But having said that, we still think 30%, from a planning perspective, is the right way to think about incrementals for the company. 
On price stickiness, I'd say that typically speaking, if you're in an inflationary environment, and the commodity costs are up, the price is going to be sticky. And so in this kind of environment, it's never easy to get price. But I'd say, in this kind of environment, it's very understandable that prices are going to go up. It's very well publicized. Everybody's dealing with the same challenges. And so I would imagine that price will be very, very sticky in this environment given the supply shortages across the board.  The fact that markets are doing well, really today, I'd say almost across the board. And so as I said, it's never easy, but this is probably one of the easiest times, at least in my professional career, to actually pass on price because, essentially, the environmental factors are essentially warranting it. We're seeing labor inflation as well. And so all of these things bode well for at least the price environment and suggesting prices will likely be sticky through this part of the cycle for some time to come."

And as you think about some of the big investments that have to go into energy transition first, which is obviously a really big one, and then that obviously involves things like grid hardening and grid resiliency due to climate change and some of the weather-related events that we've seen. And so we like the utility market, and we think that, that market will certainly be a growth market into the future. I will say that we've not yet seen, once again, these big inflection points that we would expect to see in the utility market. We think most of that growth is still out in front of us. Those markets, as you know, they tend to move more slowly. We have, over the last number of years, seen more investments going into the distribution side of utility, which certainly plays to our strength. But the bigger plays that we think around grid hardening, grid resilience, energy transition, the things that utilities are going to have to make fairly sizable investments in, we think most of that growth is still out in front of us."

And it's obviously one of the most exciting segments that we're in. And certainly, the acquisition of a company like Tripp Lite just strengthens our hand there in terms of what data centers represent for the company overall. And I'd say it's the one market I'd say that we have, very clearly, for some time now, seen global strength, which we see it in every region of the world, and we see it across really almost every segment of data centers, whether that's the on-prem, whether it's the colo operators, whether it's the hyperscale. Data center market just continues to price to the upside. 
And as we've said before, that those markets, it can be lumpy. There could be a quarter or 2 or, even a year or so where a particular hyperscale player will take the time to consolidate and not expand. And so the business can be lumpy, at least specifically in hyperscale. But the projections for that market and what we've experienced is that it continues to surprise on the upside with respect to growth. I think this year, we're talking about high teens kind of growth in the data center market. And I said, as we've looked at that market, and we looked at our own forecast for that market, it's a big piece of what's performing better than what we originally anticipated when we put our guidance out for the year. 
And once again, this whole idea of more data, more storage, more compute, the world is more connected. And so we think it's just a trend that's going to continue for a very long time into the future."

We'll start on Page 3 with highlights for the quarter and by noting that our team delivered record results in Q3 despite kind of the well-publicized supply chain challenges in this environment. We had strong execution across all of our businesses. And as we focused on controlling what we could control. And as you can see, we posted an all-time record for adjusted EPS of $1.75. And Supply chain constraints did have an impact on our revenue, but we still posted 8% growth in the quarter. And for the third quarter in a row, we delivered record segment margins at 19.9% in Q3. It was an all-time record and an increase of 230 basis points over prior year. 
On top of record margins, we're also pleased with our incremental margins, which were 46% in the quarter, due to actions that we took to mitigate inflationary costs, the portfolio changes that we have undertaken and savings from restructuring programs. We did have a bit of help from favorable mix as well in the quarter. And while revenues were lighter than expected in our Electrical Americas segment, we're very pleased to see the strength in orders and the growing backlog. Overall demand remains very strong. For the Electrical businesses overall, orders were up 17% on a rolling 12-month basis, and our backlog was up more than 50%, another all-time record. 
Next, on Page 4, we summarize our Q3 results, and I'll notice a few points here. First, on 9% revenue growth, we increased our operating profit by 23%, which reflects strong operating leverage and benefits from our portfolio actions. Second, our acquisitions increased revenues by 7%, which was fully offset by the sale of Hydraulics. We're naturally pleased to have replaced the Hydraulics revenue with a collection of businesses that are, I'd say, higher growth, higher margin and have more earnings consistency. And last, our margins of 19.9% were well above our guidance range of 19% to 19.4% as our team did an outstanding job of executing despite the lower-than-expected revenues. 
Moving to Page 5, we have the results of our Electrical Americas segment. Revenues were up 9%, including 1% organic and 8% from the acquisition of Tripp Lite. Organic sales growth was driven by strength in data centers and residential markets, partially offset by weakness in large industrial projects and sales to utilities. As I mentioned earlier, revenues were impacted by supply chain constraints. 
Our Electrical Americas segment suffered from the general supply chain constraints that we're all feeling, but was actually disproportionately impacted by a few unique suppliers who are especially impactful to this business. We're naturally addressing these and other supply challenges and expect to do better in Q4. 
Operating margins continue to be strong at 21.7% and were up 40 basis points from Q2. This is consistent with our expectations, and we're doing a good job of getting price to offset inflation. I'd say the biggest highlight in this segment is the continued growth in orders and in backlog. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 17% organically, and this was an acceleration from up 13% in Q2. The strongest segments were utility and residential markets and the backlog is up more than 50% from last year and up 9% from Q2. Both, I'd say, are encouraging signs and support our expectations that the miss shipments will simply be pushed into future quarters. 
Turning to Page 6. We summarize our Electrical Global segment results, which I'd say were just strong across the board. Organic growth was 18% with broad strength in really all end markets and currency added 1%. We also posted all-time record operating margins of 20.1% and had very strong incremental margins of nearly 40%. The margin performance was driven by volume leverage, strong cost control, and savings once again from restructuring actions. Orders were very strong, up 17% organically on a rolling 12-month basis, with particular strength in the quarter in industrial, commercial and institutional markets. Like our Americas segment, the backlog is up more than 50% and at record levels. 
Before we move to the industrial businesses, here's the way I'd summarize the performance of our electrical businesses. When you add the 2 together, they delivered solid organic growth of 8%, built a sizable backlog, which strengthens our outlook for future quarters and the improved margins by 110 basis points. So on balance, I'd say, a very strong set of quarterly results for our Electrical businesses. 
Moving to Page 7. We have the financial results of our Aerospace segment. Revenues were up 38%, 4% organic and 33% from the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems and 1% from currency. Organic growth was primarily due to higher sales in commercial markets partially offset by weakness in military markets. Operating margins were 22%, up 350 basis points from last year and 100 basis points sequentially. This strong performance gives us confidence that as aerospace markets continue to recover, we'll meet or exceed the 24% margin targets that have been set for this segment. 
In the quarter, we also had strong organic incremental margins, which were driven by favorable mix, primarily from the growth of commercial aftermarket business and as a result, once again from savings from the restructuring actions that we've taken. And by the way, Q3 was the first full quarter where Cobham Mission Systems were part of the company, and we're very pleased with the financial performance of the business. and the integration process is going very smoothly. 
As we look to the future, we're seeing encouraging signs of recovery in this segment with both orders and backlog now trending positively. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 4%, primarily with strength in the business segment and our backlog has increased by 5%. 
Next on Page 8, we have the results of our Vehicle segment. Organic revenues increased 11% with solid growth in North America Class A truck business and strength in South America that more than offset the weakness in North America light vehicle markets. And as you're all well aware, light vehicle production has been severely impacted by supply chain constraints. 
Operating margins were 18% and we generated very strong incremental margins of more than 50%. In addition to strong execution, we also had some favorable mix in the quarter. Specifically in North America, the truck business benefited from strong aftermarket, where sales were up some 40% and attractive aftermarket margins. And our North America light vehicle motor business also benefited from favorable mix as customers prior viritize programs with more of our content, more full-size pickups and SUVs and fewer small cars. So good mix, good volume growth and savings from the multiyear restructuring program all contributed to very strong quarterly operating results here. 
Turning to Page 9. You'll see the financial results of our eMobility segment, where revenues increased 6% organically. Light vehicle business, customer production levels were reduced by supply chain constraints here as well. And given the nature of the products that we sell in this segment, they were more significantly impacted by the semiconductor shortages that we've all read about. As a result, our backlog is up significantly here. 
Operating margins were negative 9.5%, once again due to heavy R&D investments and start-up costs associated with new programs. We continue to be pleased with the progress in this business, which is on program is worth nearly $600 million of mature year revenue. And we expect to see a significant ramp up in revenues in 2023, which positions us well to achieve our long-term revenue target of $2 billion to $4 billion by 2030. 
On Page 10, we provide an update at our organic growth and operating margins for the year. With supply chain constraints in Q3 continuing into Q4, we now expect overall organic revenue growth of 9% to 11% for 2021. For Electrical Americas, we expect 5% to 7% growth. And you'll note the implied guidance for Q4 is actually 7% to 9%, which is a solid step-up from the 1% in Q3. 
Organic revenues in Aerospace are expected to be roughly flat with strength in commercial markets being offset by weakness in military markets. And the other segments had some minor reductions in revenue as well, but just minor. Despite slightly lower organic revenue growth outlook, we're increasing our operating margin guidance by 20 basis points from 18.6% to 19%. And I'd note that with this guidance, we're on track to generate strong incremental margins of approximately 40% for 2021, which we see naturally is outstanding performance given the current inflationary environment. 
Moving to Page 11. We have the remaining items of our guidance for the year. We expect full year adjusted EPS between $6.59 to $6.69. At the midpoint, this represents 35% growth over 2020. We're also delivering significant margin improvement, up 240 basis points from last year at the midpoint of our increased margin guidance. So I'm pleased that we have strong operating performance in the face of what we call store supply chain challenges and the businesses are doing well. 
Next, given more active M&A activities, we now expect share repurchase to be between $375 million and $425 million. And lastly, our Q4 guidance includes earnings between $1.68 and $1.78, organic revenue growth between 7% and 9% and segment margins between 18.8% and 19.2%, an increase of 160 basis points at the midpoint versus prior year. So overall, once again, a strong 2021 with solid revenue growth, strong orders and good execution, allowing us to deliver record margins. 
Next, on Page 12, we did want to provide some preliminary assumptions for our end markets for 2022. And as you can see, we're expecting attractive growth in nearly all of our markets with very good growth in data centers and industrial facilities in our Electrical business and our Commercial Aerospace business and certainly in all Vehicle markets. We'll provide more detailed color on organic revenue growth assumptions when we provide our 2022 guidance in February, but we did want to share some of our preliminary thinking here. 
We would also expect to see carryover benefits from pricing actions taken, which should also help our year-over-year growth next year. And lastly, on Page 13, we provide just some summary thoughts here. And I'd say, first, I'm proud of the record quarter results and particularly our strong margin performance. Our team has demonstrated that we can manage through a challenging operating environment, supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures and still improve margins and EPS. In the long-term secular growth trends of electrification, energy transition and digitalization are playing out just as we expected or maybe even better. 
We also see 2021 as a transformative year for Eaton in terms of portfolio management. We're a higher growth, higher margin and less cyclical company today. And with strong year-to-date performance, we're well on our track to deliver a very strong 2021 with double-digit organic revenue growth and 35% adjusted EPS growth. And I'd also add, we have great momentum going into the Q4 and into next year. We have strong order growth. We have a full backlog and many of our end markets are poised for recovery. And you'll recall that at the beginning of the year, we set medium-term targets of 4% to 6% organic revenue growth annually, 400 to 500 basis points improvement in margins and 11% to 13% annual growth in adjusted EPS. 
And so evaluating our progress about 1 year in, I'd say that we're running ahead of expectations. And with that summary, I'm pleased to turn it back over to Yan and to open the session up for Q&A."

And certainly, if you take a look at the performance of the business this year and the backlog that we're building in 17% order intake, you can certainly make a case for that business performing better than the 4% to 6% number that we laid out. And you'll also recall, by the way, as we laid out those targets for growth for the company that the businesses are all running towards higher growth numbers. And we hedge those numbers back at the corporate level, recognizing that things happen in the world that you don't often anticipate and expect. I mean, Q3 is a great example of that with some of the supply chain constraints and there's always a number of uncertainties out there. And so I think, yes, that's certainly a possibility that the electrical segments could perform better than that. We have internal plans that would suggest better performance than that. But once again, given the amount of uncertainties that we're dealing with, especially in today's supply chain environment, we still think for planning purposes, those are still reasonable assumptions to make but there could be upside."

No, pricing, as we talked about a little bit at the Laguna Conference as well, I mean our expectation continues to be that our businesses will fully offset inflation with price. We are living in an environment today where I'd say it's never easy to get price, but it's probably easier today given some of the supply chain constraints that we're all dealing with and it's probably ever been, certainly in my professional career. And so I'd say that our thinking really hasn't changed with respect to pricing. We have good mechanisms in place. Our pricing typically lags inflation by a quarter or 2 depending upon which segment of the market we're serving. We naturally have experienced more inflation as we came through Q3 and than we originally anticipated. And as a result, we, like others have had to go to the market for additional price. But by and large, this pattern continues, and then we would expect that -- as we look forward to 2022, we would expect to once again more than fully offset the inflationary pressures that we experienced this year, and maybe it's going to add a little bit of a tailwind next year. But by and large, our long-term kind of expectation on price versus inflation is to fully offset it, and that's what we're tracking to for this year."

Certainly, if you take a look at it on balance, our Electrical business grew some 8% in the quarter when you combined the 2, but very different performance in our Electrical Global versus the Americas business, which is where we had clearly, our biggest supply chain constraints. And I mentioned in my opening commentary, we have a number of unique suppliers in that business that really resulted in revenues being below what we anticipated. And so as we think about it and you try to quantify the impact in the quarter, our backlog grew in the quarter by $280 million. If you look at the shippable piece of that piece that in the quarter, we could say it's order of magnitude something north of $100 million, let's call it, $130 million of revenue. If you simply look at the shippable backlog and in the quarter itself. So we could have very easily posted, I would say, a 9% growth number and in the Electrical Americas business in the quarter, but for the supply chain constraints."

And as you know, our North America Electrical business has really posted probably 10 years in a row of share gain. And so we do have a very strong position in the market, and we have great supplier relationships in general. I'd say that in our case, what was a little bit unique is that there were a few suppliers that we have that support our Electrical Americas business, who are suppliers that we have that are perhaps not suppliers to others in the industry that had some challenges that we're working through together. And so as I talked about, if you see it in the growth in the backlog, what sales could easily been, but for the supply chain challenges, I think that number one becomes a 9% number which I think you'd agree is much more in line with what you've seen from some of the others in the industry. And so we're absolutely confident that it's timing. It's tied to very specific supplier issues that we are clearly focused on and working. We generally speaking, I said, have very supportive and strong supplier relationships, and it's not about one of our competitors being overallocated and thus being underallocated. These are just suppliers that are unique to our business that are working through some particular issues in their own kind of operations that they need to be worked through. And so yes, so I'd say, by and large, it's timing. We'll get through this. And we're talking about growth numbers of around 8% or so, and in Q4, and we're setting up well for 2022. And you can see it in our Electrical Global business, I mean, they grew 18% in the quarter. And so I think that -- and on aggregate, when you look at our Global Electrical business, our growth is very much in line with others in the industry, and we would have been better but for the supply chain issues that we're having in North America. So the franchise is in good shape, nothing to worry about. We really just see it as timing."

And we -- it's too early to make a call and give you specific guidance around what our assumptions are around burning down backlog and getting to more of a historical level. A lot of that will be highly dependent upon the supply chain environment and how that unfolds during the course of Q4 and into the first part of next year. I will say that as we think about the supply chain challenges in general, we think we'll probably be dealing with supply chain challenges through the first half of next year. And if you think about semiconductors or some of the electronic components, we think it's maybe it's more like a 2023 before those issues become fully resolved.

And to your opening commentary, you mean it is an unusual year where you have all of your end markets that you're expecting to see some growth in. And so we're feeling very good about next year as a result of that. And I'd say that if you think about specifically whether it's residential markets, orders are strong. If you look at some of the macro indicators around whether it's housing starts or the affordability index of housing, there are some macro indicators that would suggest that these markets should naturally slow down. that you can't keep posting these huge double-digit growth numbers for an indefinite period of time. And so I'd say it's really more of the macro indicators that we're looking at in residential that would have us suggesting that the market is flattish in 2022, not at all consistent with the order growth that we're seeing today, which continues to be strong and not at all consistent with the back order growth in the backlog and the back order growth is also quite strong in residential. And so we'll have to see how it plays out. But certainly, at some point, that market will slowdown and that's what's reflected in kind of that outlook for the year. I'd say, in general, the data centers continues to be extraordinarily strong and there's no reason that would suggest that data centers would in any way back up. And so we're comfortable with the data center forecast around the world as people continue to consume process and store increasing amounts of data. 
Utility markets, I mean we think utility markets are poised for growth as well as they continue to invest in grid hardening and weather hardening and all these events that we're seeing around the world, weather-related events that. We'll continue to drive investments in the utility markets. If you think about today, what's going on today in the industrial markets, and as you -- we all deal with these labor shortages around the world, is certainly going to be an increased appetite, we believe, for investing in automation and factories and equipment. And so -- and if we talk about these broader trends around energy transition investments in electric vehicle charging infrastructure to support all these electric vehicles that are going to ultimately be produced and sold around the world. And so I think we are in this a little bit of a, call it, a Goldilocks period with respect to a number of our end markets that most of the indicators are pointing positive as we think about the future. global vehicle markets, if you think about the challenges that they've experienced this year and all the demand that was unmet, I mean that's another market that's just well positioned to grow next year in commercial aerospace will come back. Military markets, you say, what could go wrong? What are you worried about? We continue to be worried about supply chain constraints. That's still a bit of an unknown and uncertain we worry a little bit about what's happening in Washington. But by and large, we think that's net positive in terms of these infrastructure builds that once again, haven't been baked into our thinking, in terms of whether or not we get these big infrastructure spending bills that will come out, that will certainly support many of our end markets. And so I mean, we can certainly talk ourselves into maybe a scenario that's less optimistic. But by and large, looking at the macro indicators and how our company is positioned, we feel very good about not just '22, but really the medium-term outlook."

And so I think in any business, there's always a balance of goods and bags, and we did call out mix as a positive. But there's also, as I mentioned, a lot of other challenges that we're dealing with as we try to keep our factories fully staffed, fully running and productive given some of the supply chain constraints that we've had. And so now I'd say that mostly, it's just been good execution. Our teams, as you know, we called it relatively early. We anticipated that we were going to have a revenue issue due to supply chain. And our teams at that point went to work on the things that we can control, the things that we can do to maximize our performance and deliver our earnings despite the supply chain challenges. And so I think we've really just seen good execution. The other place that we're seeing better benefits, quite frankly, than we originally anticipated. It was in our restructuring programs. We're running ahead of schedule and some of the benefits associated with restructuring -- you'll see in the Q that we file that we've taken the spending up on restructuring by about about $40 million and it's going to deliver $30 million more benefits than we originally anticipated. And so our teams are really just laser focused on executing, controlling the things that we don't -- we can control and managing the things that we can to the best of our ability.

Or are you doing some things proactively in terms of qualifying new suppliers, making adjustments to your supply chain, given all that transpired in 2021?"

And therefore, we just took more of our capital dollars and put them acquisitions as opposed to buybacks. So I wouldn't read anything into it in terms of capital allocation strategy changes.

There's obviously the big headline deals of Cobham and Tripp Lite, but we've done a number of other deals during the course of the year as well. In our Electrical business, JVs that we've signed in the China market. We acquired a green Motion business in Europe. And so we have been very active this year in the M&A market. I'd say, from a portfolio transformation standpoint, I think it's 1 of the most transformational in the history of the company. And so -- and we continue to be focused on opportunities. We are, in fact, seeing a better deal flow today than we certainly have in the last couple of years. Valuations in many cases, are still stretched. What I will commit to you and promise you that we'll remain disciplined. You've seen the kind of multiples that we're paying for acquisitions and the type of assets that we're acquiring, and we won't lose our way. We'll continue to be focused on those kinds of assets, focusing on our electrical business, focusing in our e-mobility focusing in our Aerospace business. But we are seeing a better deal flow today. And given the trade-off between a value-creating acquisition that's highly strategic and buying back shares, we're obviously leaning in towards spending those M&A dollars to grow the portfolio."

And so there has been this year and a little bit of pressure on margins as a result of not recovering the full margin on the commodity cost increase. And so that is certainly something that's held margins back a bit

175265,1685545945,2421649,"Eaton Corporation plc, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Eaton Corporation plc","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Yan. We'll start on Page 3 with highlights for the quarter and by noting that our team delivered record results in Q3 despite kind of the well-publicized supply chain challenges in this environment. We had strong execution across all of our",1938,"Okay. Thanks, Yan. We'll start on Page 3 with highlights for the quarter and by noting that our team delivered record results in Q3 despite kind of the well-publicized supply chain challenges in this environment. We had strong execution across all of our businesses and as we focused on controlling what we could control. And as you can see, we posted an all-time record for adjusted EPS of $1.75. Supply chain constraints did have an impact on our revenue, but we still posted 8% growth in the quarter. And for the third quarter in a row, we delivered record segment margins at 19.9% in Q3. It was an all-time record and an increase of 230 basis points over prior year.
On top of record margins, we're also pleased with our incremental margins, which were 46% in the quarter, due to actions that we took to mitigate inflationary costs, the portfolio changes that we have undertaken, and savings from restructuring programs. We did have a bit of help from favorable mix as well in the quarter. And while revenues were lighter than expected in our Electrical Americas segment, we're very pleased to see the strength in orders and the growing backlog. Overall demand remains very strong. For the Electrical businesses overall, orders were up 17% on a rolling 12-month basis, and our backlog was up more than 50%, another all-time record.  
Next, on Page 4, we summarize our Q3 results, and I'll notice a few points here. First, on 9% revenue growth, we increased our operating profit by 23%, which reflects strong operating leverage and benefits from our portfolio actions. Second, our acquisitions increased revenues by 7%, which was fully offset by the sale of Hydraulics. We're naturally pleased to have replaced the Hydraulics revenue with a collection of businesses that are, I'd say, higher growth, higher margin, and have more earnings consistency.  
And last, our margins of 19.9% were well above our guidance range of 19% to 19.4% as our team did an outstanding job of executing despite the lower-than-expected revenues.  
Moving to Page 5, we have the results of our Electrical Americas segment. Revenues were up 9%, including 1% organic and 8% from the acquisition of Tripp Lite. Organic sales growth was driven by strength in data centers and residential markets, partially offset by weakness in large industrial projects and sales to utilities. As I mentioned earlier, revenues were impacted by supply chain constraints.
Our Electrical Americas segment suffered from the general supply chain constraints that we're all feeling, but was actually disproportionately impacted by a few unique suppliers who are especially impactful to this business. We're naturally addressing these and other supply challenges and expect to do better in Q4.  
Operating margins continue to be strong at 21.7% and were up 40 basis points from Q2. This is consistent with our expectations, and we're doing a good job of getting price to offset inflation. 
I'd say the biggest highlight in this segment is the continued growth in orders and in backlog. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 17% organically, and this was an acceleration from up 13% in Q2. The strongest segments were utility and residential markets and the backlog is up more than 50% from last year and up 9% from Q2. Both, I'd say, are encouraging signs and support our expectations that the missed shipments will simply be pushed into future quarters.  
Turning to Page 6. We summarize our Electrical Global segment results, which I'd say were just strong across the board. Organic growth was 18% with broad strength in really all end markets and currency added 1%. We also posted all-time record operating margins of 20.1% and had very strong incremental margins of nearly 40%. The margin performance was driven by volume leverage, strong cost control, and savings once again from restructuring actions. Orders were very strong, up 17% organically on a rolling 12-month basis, with particular strength in the quarter in industrial, commercial and institutional markets. Like our Americas segment, the backlog is up more than 50% and at record levels.
Before we move to the industrial businesses, here's the way I'd summarize the performance of our electrical businesses. When you add the 2 together, they delivered solid organic growth of 8%, built a sizable backlog, which strengthens our outlook for future quarters and they improved margins by 110 basis points. So on balance, I'd say, a very strong set of quarterly results for our Electrical businesses.  
Moving to Page 7. We have the financial results of our Aerospace segment. Revenues were up 38%; 4% organic and 33% from the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems and 1% from currency. Organic growth was primarily due to higher sales in commercial markets partially offset by weakness in military markets. Operating margins were 22%, up 350 basis points from last year and 100 basis points sequentially. This strong performance gives us confidence that as aerospace markets continue to recover, we'll meet or exceed the 24% margin targets that have been set for this segment.  
In the quarter, we also had strong organic incremental margins, which were driven by favorable mix, primarily from the growth of commercial aftermarket business and as a result, once again from savings from the restructuring actions that we've taken. And by the way, Q3 was the first full quarter where Cobham Mission Systems were part of the company, and we're very pleased with the financial performance of the business and the integration process is going very smoothly.  
As we look to the future, we're seeing encouraging signs of recovery in this segment with both orders and backlog now trending positively. On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 4%, primarily with strength in the business segment and our backlog has increased by 5%.  
Next on Page 8, we have the results of our Vehicle segment. Organic revenues increased 11% with solid growth in North America Class A truck business and strength in South America that more than offset the weakness in North America light vehicle markets. And as you're all well aware, light vehicle production has been severely impacted by supply chain constraints. 
Operating margins were 18% and we generated very strong incremental margins of more than 50%. In addition to strong execution, we also had some favorable mix in the quarter. Specifically of note, North America, the truck business benefited from strong aftermarket, where sales were up some 40% and attractive aftermarket margins. And our North America light vehicle motor business also benefited from favorable mix as customers prioritize programs with more of our content, more full-sized pickups and SUVs and fewer small cars. So good mix, good volume growth and savings from the multiyear restructuring program all contributed to very strong quarterly operating results here.  
Turning to Page 9. You'll see the financial results of our eMobility segment, where revenues increased 6% organically. Light vehicle business, customer production levels were reduced by supply chain constraints here as well. And given the nature of the products that we sell in this segment, they were more significantly impacted by the semiconductor shortages that we've all read about. As a result, our backlog is up significantly here.  
Operating margins were a negative 9.5%, once again due to heavy R&D investments and start-up costs associated with new programs. We continue to be pleased with the progress in this business, which is one program is worth nearly $600 million of mature year revenue. And we expect to see a significant ramp up in revenues in 2023, which positions us well to achieve our long-term revenue target of $2 billion to $4 billion by 2030.  
On Page 10, we provide an update at our organic growth and operating margins for the year. With supply chain constraints in Q3 continuing into Q4, we now expect overall organic revenue growth of 9% to 11% for 2021. For Electrical Americas, we expect 5% to 7% growth. And you'll note the implied guidance for Q4 is actually 7% to 9%, which is a solid step-up from the 1% in Q3.  
Organic revenues in Aerospace are expected to be roughly flat with strength in commercial markets being offset by weakness in military markets. And the other segments had some minor reductions in revenue as well, but just minor. Despite slightly lower organic revenue growth outlook, we're increasing our operating margin guidance by 20 basis points from 18.6% to 19%. And I'd note that with this guidance, we're on track to generate strong incremental margins of approximately 40% for 2021, which we see naturally is outstanding performance given the current inflationary environment.  
Moving to Page 11. We have the remaining items of our guidance for the year. We expect full year adjusted EPS between $6.59 to $6.69. At the midpoint, this represents 35% growth over 2020. We're also delivering significant margin improvement, up 240 basis points from last year at the midpoint of our increased margin guidance. So I'm pleased that we have strong operating performance in the face of what we call store supply chain challenges and the businesses are doing well.  
Next, given more active M&A activities, we now expect share repurchase to be between $375 million and $425 million. And lastly, our Q4 guidance includes earnings between $1.68 and $1.78, organic revenue growth between 7% and 9%, and segment margins between 18.8% and 19.2%, an increase of 160 basis points at the midpoint versus prior year. So overall, once again, a strong 2021 with solid revenue growth, strong orders and good execution, allowing us to deliver record margins.
Next, on Page 12, we did want to provide some preliminary assumptions for our end markets for 2022. And as you can see, we're expecting attractive growth in nearly all of our markets with very good growth in data centers and industrial facilities in our Electrical business and our Commercial Aerospace business, and certainly, in all Vehicle markets. We'll provide more detailed color on organic revenue growth assumptions when we provide our 2022 guidance in February, but we did want to share some of our preliminary thinking here. We would also expect to see carryover benefits from pricing actions taken, which should also help our year-over-year growth next year. 
And lastly, on Page 13, we provide just some summary thoughts here. And I'd say, first, I'm proud of the record quarter results and particularly our strong margin performance. Our team has demonstrated that we can manage through a challenging operating environment, supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures, and still improve margins and EPS. And the long-term secular growth trends of electrification, energy transition and digitalization are playing out just as we expected or maybe even better. 
We also see 2021 as a transformative year for Eaton in terms of portfolio management. We're a higher-growth, higher-margin and less cyclical company today. And with strong year-to-date performance, we're well on our track to deliver a very strong 2021 with double-digit organic revenue growth and 35% adjusted EPS growth. 
And I'd also add, we have great momentum going into the Q4 and into next year. We have strong order growth. We have a full backlog, and many of our end markets are poised for recovery. And you'll recall that at the beginning of the year, we set medium-term targets of 4% to 6% organic revenue growth annually, 400 to 500 basis points improvement in margins and 11% to 13% annual growth in adjusted EPS.  
And so evaluating our progress about 1 year in, I'd say that we're running ahead of expectations. And with that summary, I'm pleased to turn it back over to Yan and to open the session up for Q&A."

And certainly, if you take a look at the performance of the business this year and the backlog that we're building in 17% order intake, you can certainly make a case for that business performing better than the 4% to 6% number that we laid out. And you'll also recall, by the way, as we laid out those targets for growth for the company, that the businesses are all running towards higher growth numbers. And we hedge those numbers back at the corporate level, recognizing that things happen in the world that you don't often anticipate and expect. I mean, Q3 is a great example of that with some of the supply chain constraints and there's always a number of uncertainties out there. And so I think, yes, that's certainly a possibility that the electrical segments could perform better than that. We have internal plans that would suggest better performance than that. But once again, given the amount of uncertainties that we're dealing with, especially in today's supply chain environment, we still think for planning purposes, those are still reasonable assumptions to make, but there could be upside."

No, pricing, as we talked about a little bit at the Laguna Conference as well, I mean our expectation continues to be that our businesses will fully offset inflation with price. We are living in an environment today where I'd say it's never easy to get price, but it's probably easier today given some of the supply chain constraints that we're all dealing with than it's probably ever been, certainly in my professional career. 
And so I'd say that our thinking really hasn't changed with respect to pricing. We have good mechanisms in place. Our pricing typically lags inflation by a quarter or 2, depending upon which segment of the market we're serving. We naturally have experienced more inflation as we came through Q3 than we originally anticipated. And as a result, we, like others, have had to go to the market for additional price. But by and large, this pattern continues, and then we would expect that -- as we look forward to 2022, we would expect to once again more than fully offset the inflationary pressures that we experienced this year, and maybe it's going to add a little bit of a tailwind next year. But by and large, our long-term kind of expectation on price versus inflation is to fully offset it, and that's what we're tracking to for this year."

Certainly, if you take a look at on balance, our Electrical business grew some 8% in the quarter when you combine the 2, but very different performance in our Electrical Global versus the Americas business, which is where we had, clearly, our biggest supply chain constraints. And I mentioned in my opening commentary, we have a number of unique suppliers in that business that really resulted in revenues being below what we anticipated. 
And so as we think about it and you try to quantify the impact in the quarter, our backlog grew in the quarter by $280 million. If you look at the shippable piece of that piece that in the quarter, we could say it's order of magnitude something north of $100 million, let's call it, $130 million of revenue. If you simply look at the shippable backlog and in the quarter itself. So we could have very easily posted, I would say, a 9% growth number and in the Electrical Americas business in the quarter, but for the supply chain constraints."

And as you know, our North America Electrical business has really posted probably 10 years in a row of share gain. And so we do have a very strong position in the market, and we have great supplier relationships in general. 
I'd say that in our case, what was a little bit unique is that there were a few suppliers that we have that support our Electrical Americas business, who are suppliers that we have that are perhaps not suppliers to others in the industry that had some challenges that we're working through together. And so as I talked about, if you see it in the growth in the backlog, what sales could have easily been, but for the supply chain challenges, I think that, number one, becomes a 9% number which I think you'd agree is much more in line with what you've seen from some of the others in the industry. 
And so we're absolutely confident that it's timing. It's tied to very specific supplier issues that we are clearly focused on and working. We, generally speaking, like I said, have very supportive and strong supplier relationships, and it's not about one of our competitors being over-allocated and us being under-allocated. These are just suppliers that are unique to our business that are working through some particular issues in their own kind of operations that they need to be worked through. 
And so yes, so I'd say, by and large, it's timing. We'll get through this. And we're talking about growth numbers of around 8% or so in Q4, and we're setting up well for 2022. And you could see it in our Electrical Global business. I mean, they grew 18% in the quarter. And so I think that -- and on aggregate, when you look at our Global Electrical business, our growth is very much in line with others in the industry, and we would have been better but for these supply chain issues that we're having in North America. So the franchise is in good shape, nothing to worry about. We really just see it as timing."

I guess, first question, does that 2022 kind of preliminary color, that's market demand, and then anything on price and backlog consumption is sort of incremental? 
And then follow on to that, in other kind of cyclical environments, what would you view as kind of the bandwidth to be able to convert backlog in any given year? Like is that something that is kind of naturally stage gated by throughput even without supply chain constraints?"

Backlog reduction is clearly something that we're trying to think through right now as we develop our plan for next year. And we -- it's too early to make a call and give you specific guidance around what our assumptions are around burning down backlog and getting to more of a historical level. A lot of that will be highly dependent upon the supply chain environment and how that unfolds during the course of Q4 and into the first part of next year. 
I will say that as we think about the supply chain challenges in general, we think we'll probably be dealing with supply chain challenges through the first half of next year. And if you think about semiconductors or some of the electronic components, we think maybe it's more like a 2023 before those issues become fully resolved. And so we'll give you more guidance in February when we lay out kind of our plan for the year. But at this juncture, we're not -- in those market outlooks, it does not necessarily assume burn down in backlog, but it would include price."

And to your opening commentary, you mean it is an unusual year where you have all of your end markets that you're expecting to see some growth in. And so we're feeling very good about next year as a result of that. And I'd say that if you think about specifically whether it's residential markets, orders are strong. If you look at some of the macro indicators around whether it's housing starts or the affordability index of housing, there are some macro indicators that would suggest that these markets should naturally slow down, that you can't keep posting these huge double-digit growth numbers for an indefinite period of time. 
And so I'd say it's really more the macro indicators that we're looking at in residential that would have us suggesting that the market is flattish in 2022, not at all consistent with the order growth that we're seeing today, which continues to be strong; and not at all consistent with the back order growth, and the backlog and the back order growth is also quite strong in residential. And so we'll have to see how it plays out. But certainly, at some point, that market will slowdown and that's what's reflected in kind of that outlook for the year. 
I'd say, in general, the data centers continues to be extraordinarily strong and there's no reason that would suggest that data centers would in any way back up. And so we're comfortable with the data center forecast around the world as people continue to consume, process and store increasing amounts of data. 
Utility markets, I mean, we think utility markets are poised for growth as well as they continue to invest in grid hardening in weather hardening and all these events that we're seeing around the world, weather-related events that will continue to drive investments in the utility markets. If you think about today, what's going on today in the industrial markets, and as you -- we all deal with these labor shortages around the world, is certainly going to be an increased appetite, we believe, for investing in automation and factories and equipment. And so -- and if we talk about these broader trends around energy transition and investments in electric vehicle charging infrastructure to support all these electric vehicles that are going to ultimately be produced and sold around the world. 
And so I think we are in this a little bit of a, call it, a Goldilocks period with respect to a number of our end markets that most of the indicators are pointing positive as we think about the future. Global vehicle markets, if you think about the challenges that they've experienced this year and all the demand that was unmet, I mean, that's another market that's just well positioned to grow next year and commercial aerospace will come back. Military markets, we say, what could go wrong? What are you worried about? We continue to be worried about supply chain constraints. That's still a bit of an unknown and uncertain. We worry a little bit about what's happening in Washington. But by and large, we think that's net positive. In terms of these infrastructure bills that, once again, haven't even been baked into our thinking. In terms of whether or not we get these big infrastructure spending bills that will come out, that will certainly support many of our end markets. 
And so I mean, we can certainly talk ourselves into maybe a scenario that's less optimistic. But by and large, looking at the macro indicators and how our company is positioned, we feel very good about not just '22, but really the medium-term outlook."

We're obviously dealing with a lot of other, I'd say, extraordinary costs that we would normally not have in the business around money we're spending to expedite, materials and  labor inefficiencies in our factories. And so I think in any business, there's always a balance of goods and bads, and we did call out mix as a positive. But there's also, as I mentioned, a lot of other challenges that we're dealing with as we try to keep our factories fully staffed, fully running and productive given some of the supply chain constraints that we've had. 
And so now I'd say that mostly, it's just been good execution. Our teams, as you know, we called it relatively early. We anticipated that we were going to have a revenue issue due to supply chain. And our teams, at that point, went to work on the things that we can control, the things that we can do to maximize our performance and deliver our earnings despite these supply chain challenges. And so I think we've really just seen good execution. 
The other place that we're seeing better benefits, quite frankly, than we originally anticipated was in our restructuring programs. We're running ahead of schedule and some of the benefits associated with restructuring, you'll see in the Q that we file that we've taken the spending up on restructuring by about $40 million, and it's going to deliver $30 million more benefits than we originally anticipated. And so our teams are really just laser focused on executing, controlling the things that we don't -- we can control and managing the things that we can to the best of our ability.
