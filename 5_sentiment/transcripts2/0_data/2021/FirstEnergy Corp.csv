Before I get into our results, I wanted to kick off the call with a few words on a critical area of focus for FirstEnergy. Taking appropriate actions to address our recent challenges and fostering a strong culture of compliance, ethics and integrity. We are deeply committed to creating a culture in which compliance is endemic in second nature and where our leaders prioritize and encourage open and transparent communications with all of our stakeholders. This focus is absolutely essential for our success as an organization.
Our commitment starts at the top and extends throughout the organization. We are working to ensure that every leader is actively engaged in setting the proper tone and creating an environment where not only our words, but our actions align with our core values and behaviors. We're building a world-class compliance function to underpin this effort, including bringing on Hyun Park as our new Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer in January. Hyun is the right person to step into this role at this time, and he will be instrumental in driving this cultural shift.
We will also be appointing a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, who will manage a dedicated team of compliance professionals and enhance our efforts to improve our compliance function by shifting from a decentralized to a more centralized model. In addition, we'll be designating compliance ambassadors throughout the company to act as boots on the ground, ensuring the entire organization understands the critical importance of compliance and what it means for each individual.
We are also making significant changes in our approach to political and legislative engagement and advocacy. Our activity in this space will be much more limited than it has been in the past, with closer alignment to our strategic goals and with additional oversight and significantly more robust disclosure. With this additional transparency, my goal is to make it crystal clear exactly what efforts we support. These efforts, together with enhanced policies and procedures will help to bring additional clarity around appropriate behaviors at FirstEnergy. And through enhanced communications, training and most importantly, our actions, we are dedicated to reemphasizing that every employee at every level has the responsibility to consistently act in accordance with our core values and behaviors and to speak up if they see inappropriate behavior anywhere in the organization.
At the same time, we're taking decisive actions to rebuild our reputation and brand and focus on the future. This includes the decisions recently made with respect to Ohio that I'll talk about shortly. And while we don't control the timeline related to the DOJ and SEC, we will continue to cooperate fully with these government investigations and remain focused on the matters that we can control.
Chris will address a number of actions the board has underway in a more detailed manner later in this call. But be assured that both management and the Board will be relentless and take the steps needed to position our company for long-term success.
Now turning to earnings. Today, we reported 2020 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.39 per share. On Tuesday, we announced several proactive steps we're taking to resolve a range of regulatory proceedings affecting our Ohio utilities. These include our previously announced agreement with the Ohio Attorney General, along with the decision not to seek recovery of lost distribution revenues. This resulted in a charge of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. Absent this charge, our 2020 operating earnings would have been $2.54 per share. Well above the midpoint of our most recent guidance range and reflective of our strong performance last year.
While this was a difficult decision, we are confident it was the right decision. We believe resolving these matters in a comprehensive manner is a critical step to demonstrate our commitment to transparency and integrity in every aspect of our business, while taking steps toward removing uncertainty relating to our current Ohio regulatory matters.
And in the interest of providing additional transparency, today's investor materials will include more information about regulatory ROEs in each of the states we serve. We remain excited about the significant investment opportunities that will continue to drive solid earnings and growth in the years ahead. When we have further clarity in Ohio, and with the ongoing government investigations, we intend to resume providing a long-term growth rate that should be consistent with traditional utility growth rates and similar to what we have provided in the past. For now, we are focusing on this year and we have introduced 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.
We have made these disclosures early, so you would have time to absorb them before this call. Because we have a lot of ground to cover today, including: Our solid operational performance last year, even in the face of the pandemic; our strategy for 2021 and beyond, including our commitment to building shareholder value; and the work we're doing to position the company for the future.
Our fundamental performance continues to be excellent. We continued making demonstrable progress on our strategic goals, and we had an exceptional year from a safety perspective, even with about half of our employees working from home and the others adopting new health and safety protocols, the FirstEnergy team has remained laser-focused on providing safe and reliable service to our 6 million customers. I am deeply proud of the team's resilience and commitment, especially in light of the turbulence that marked the year.
Our results in 2020 reflect our commitment to strong operations as well as the stability provided by our diverse footprint and our wires focused platform. Last year, we also successfully executed our plan to invest $3 billion in our distribution and transmission systems as we continued our reliability and grid mod program to benefit customers. We believe our robust long-term organic growth opportunities are well aligned with the focus on electrification and the critical role the grid plays in supporting the transition to a carbon-neutral economy.
These opportunities and our goals that support them are included in our strategic plan, published last month and available on our website. I hope you have taken some time to review it. This updated plan addresses our unwavering commitment to transparency and accountability and identifies old goals for key areas of our business. These goals are aligned with our core values and behaviors, our regulatory strategy and our commitments to our customers, communities and investors as well as the environmental stewardship.
Among these objectives outlined in the plan is our pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This ambitious goal reflects our transformation to a regulated electric utility and our responsibility to help create a sustainable energy future. The strategic plan also addresses our continued commitment to build a more diverse and inclusive workplace. We've had a DNI focused KPI for 3 years now and we are taking even more aggressive steps to make progress in this area. We're excited to pursue a 30% increase in our number of racially and ethnically underrepresented employees by 2025, both overall and at the supervisor and above level. We believe this will help accelerate our transformation into an innovative, diverse and sustainable company and drive an important shift in our corporate culture. We recently completed our fourth company-wide survey of all employees.
Overall, I'm proud to say we scored relatively well on many fronts, but we certainly have more work to do. One area identified for improvement is listening and valuing the opinions of our employees. We want employees to feel empowered to voice their opinion on important issues, and my team with guidance and support from the Board of Directors is addressing this head on. We view this work as central to strengthening our compliance program and a culture of ethics, integrity and accountability.
I'd like to explain my approach to driving this change, and perhaps we could use the company's safety culture as an analogy. Several years ago, we had concerns that our safety culture was trending in the wrong direction. Management led a significant effort with our employees to put in place new programs and training. And to consistently demonstrate that safety is and will always be an unwavering core value. These efforts ultimately instituted a cultural shift in how we all understood the critical importance of safety. We want that very same cultural shift to occur as it relates to compliance and ethics. And we want our employees to know that we value and welcome their opinions. As we look ahead, I feel confident in our path forward. We have a strong foundation.
Our fundamentals are solid, and our strategies are proven. And we are building on that with a relentless focus on making FirstEnergy a better company as we work to rebuild trust, work to achieve financial results and deliver for our customers and investors. We recognize that changes won't happen overnight. They happen over time, just like the evolution in our safety culture I spoke about earlier, I'm confident we will emerge a stronger, better FirstEnergy.
Now I'll turn it over to Chris Pappas, who can address the specific and significant actions that the Board and management are taking to address the current challenges and set FirstEnergy on the right path for a successful future."

First, I'd like to reiterate the Board's strong support of Steve, and recognize the hard work he and the rest of the team are doing. We commend their willingness to learn from the past and their absolute commitment to take this company forward on a new path, all while executing the company's strategy and keeping operations and financial results on solid footing.
The Board and management team are focused on a critical objective: To move forward from the past actions of certain former executives; and to take the steps necessary to improve the tone at the top culture of ethics and integrity and the way we do business.
Steve talked about a lot of the important work that is being driven by the new management team. Likewise, the Board is committed to strengthening every part of FirstEnergy's culture and taking the necessary steps to reestablish credibility. Together, we have made much progress on the issues that confronted the company several months ago. And at the same time, we recognize there is more work to do.
I'd like to recap some of the steps that the Board has been actively engaged in to drive improvements in our culture of compliance. First, the Board promptly put in place an independent committee with external counsel to oversee the internal investigation and to monitor the status of the various regulatory and legal matters facing the company. The independent committee which currently is made up of the entire board, meets frequently and regularly.
The Board act as swiftly in the removal of 5 executives. Named Steve Strah is acting CEO, established an Executive Director role and expanded the role of the Board's share, all to assist management and the Board with the dynamics we faced in the first months of the investigation. The Board unequivocally endorsed the principle of full cooperation with both the DOJ and the SEC on the matters related to the investigation. And through our own internal investigation led by independent counsel, has supported intensive analysis. The Board established a compliance oversight subcommittee of the Audit committee with independent counsel and leading compliance advisers to analyze and improve the compliance policy and culture at FirstEnergy. Steve mentioned some initial output from this work earlier. In addition, the Board established a number of working groups to oversee and support various work streams, including communications, recruiting and financial flexibility.
And to that point, management has initiated a project called FirstEnergy forward, a transformational effort to change the way the company does business. The objective of this project is to transform the company for the future, but it will also provide near-term financial flexibility. Jon will discuss this later on the call. We know there is particular interest in the status of the internal investigation. Hopefully, my earlier comments give you a sense of the intensity and the magnitude of the work that has occurred within the company and with the benefit of extensive external independent support.
Our internal investigation continues to be thorough and robust. And includes assistance from external law firms who are supported by several other consultants. The ongoing investigation has not resulted in any new material items not previously disclosed. In the course of the internal investigation, we did identify certain transactions, which, in some instances, extended back 10 years or more, including vendor services that were either improperly classified, misallocated to certain of utility or transmission companies or lacked proper supporting documentation. These transactions result in amounts collected from customers that were immaterial to FirstEnergy, and our utility and transmission companies will be working with the appropriate regulatory agencies to address these amounts.
Our internal investigation will also continue to address any due developments in connection with the ongoing DOJ and SEC investigations. More importantly, we are increasing our focus on another critical aspect of our work, moving FirstEnergy forward. The fresh perspective of Hyun Park and a new Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, will be invaluable to creating an environment for the entire team is committed to embracing the right behaviors and embedding a strong culture of compliance.
To further that effort, we also announced this morning that we have hired John Somerhalder as Vice Chairman of the Board. It is my pleasure to welcome John to the Board in his new role. He will also join the executive team, on a transitional basis as Executive Director, and act in advisory capacity to support efforts to achieve the company's priorities: Restore its reputation; and strengthen its overall governance and compliance functions. John is a 40-year industry executive with extensive energy experience in navigating complex challenges and driving strong corporate governance.
Bringing John into this full-time role means that I will step back from the Executive Director position I've held since October 6 and return to my regular duties as an independent board member by April 1. And importantly, we will continue to fully support the management team as it transitions FirstEnergy to the future as a more resilient company.
Despite the challenges the company has faced, FirstEnergy's operating fundamentals are strong. And we have a great platform of assets. Together, we have put in place a robust plan to move forward and to position Firstenergy as an industry leader. One, we know it can be and one that will deliver excellent value to its customers and shareholders. We look forward to working together alongside with management in this effort.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jon Taylor for a financial update."

Today, I will review our financial results and expectations and provide an update on several other financial matters.This morning, we reported fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $0.45 per share with operating earn",1225,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our financial results and expectations and provide an update on several other financial matters.
This morning, we reported fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $0.45 per share with operating earnings of $0.32 per share. Our operating results include the charge at our Ohio utilities that Steve mentioned earlier, absent this charge, our results reflect continued rate base growth related to our transmission and distribution investment programs, a favorable mix of customer usage, reflecting the impact of our residential customers staying at home and higher expenses, mostly associated with the pandemic.
Additional fourth quarter data is available in the supporting materials on our website. So in light of our lengthy agenda for this call, I'm going to focus on our results for the full year of 2020.
As Steve mentioned, we reported 2020 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.39 per share, which compared to 2019 GAAP results of $1.70 per share and operating earnings of $2.55 per share.
In our distribution business, in addition to the $0.15 charge at our Ohio utilities, results for 2020 as compared to 2019, reflect the absence of rider DMR in Ohio, which was in place for the first half of 2019 and higher operating costs. These were partially offset by higher revenues from increased residential usage as well as earnings from our distribution enhancement programs.
Although total weather-adjusted sales decreased 2% in 2020, normal usage from our residential customers increased 5% for the year, which from an earnings perspective, more than offset the 6% decrease in commercial and industrial loan. While this shift has moderated as the pandemic wears on, we have seen higher weather-adjusted residential usage relative to our latest forecast in the 2% to 4% range with flat to slightly higher C&I usage.
In our transmission business, approximately $550 million in rate base growth drove stronger results, which were partially offset by higher financing costs, the impact of transmission rate true-ups and the absence of tax benefits recognized in 2019.
And finally, at our corporate segment, full year 2020 results primarily reflect higher corporate expenses, higher interest costs and a lower consolidated tax rate. Today, we are providing 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, and first quarter operating earnings guidance in the range of $0.62 to $0.72 per share. Our expectations for the year include capital investments of up to $3 billion, with 100% of the $1.2 billion in transmission investment, and approximately 40% of the $1.7 billion in distribution investment being recovered in a formula rate.
Our transmission plan includes continued expansion of our energizing the future program. In New Jersey, we filed an uncontested settlement agreement with FERC on February 2 in our forward-looking formula rate case. In December, FERC accepted our proposed tariff revisions for the transmission assets of West Penn Power, Mon Power, and Potomac Edison as well as the new Keystone Appalachian transmission company known as CATCO, pending the outcome of the settlement and hearing process. Those entities move to a forward-looking formula rate structure effective January 1 this year, subject to refund.
Other key drivers for 2021 include the impact from the base distribution case at JCP&L, continued investment in our distribution enhancement programs and lower operating costs. We expect these drivers to be partially offset by higher interest expense, which includes close to $0.04 per share, associated with the step-up on $4 billion of holding company bonds, and $0.05 per share associated with our revolver borrowings that I'll address in a moment.
Additionally, our load forecast has a more typical usage profile for our residential customers, and a slower recovery to pre pandemic levels for our C&I customers.
Equity remains a part of our overall financing plan, and we are affirming our plan to issue up to $600 million in equity annually in '22 and '23, and we will flex these plans as needed. We remain committed to maintaining adequate liquidity for our distribution and transmission subsidiaries. At year-end, our liquidity was approximately $3 billion, with $1.7 billion of cash on hand and $1.3 billion of undrawn capacity under our credit facilities.
We currently have $2.2 billion of short-term borrowings, of which approximately $2.1 billion was incurred in November as a proactive measure to increase our cash position to preserve financial flexibility. And we have committed to our bank group that as we work through our financing plan, we expect to reduce short-term borrowings with the timing and amount dependent on a number of factors. Our current maturities of long-term debt remain manageable with only $74 million maturing in 2021.
We remain in close contact with the rating agencies who are intensely focused on governance and the actions we are taking to strengthen our compliance environment and controls. Improving our credit metrics at FirstEnergy, while committed -- committing to return to investment-grade as quickly as possible and maintaining the strong credit ratings at our utilities are key priorities. We are targeting future FFO to debt metrics in the 12% to 13% range at the consolidated level as we work to address some of the uncertainties that Chris and Steve mentioned.
We know how important the dividend continues to be for our investors in accordance with our target payout ratio of 55% to 65%. The Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 in December, payable March 1. And as we mentioned on our third quarter call, our intent is to hold the 2021 dividend flat to the 2020 level of $1.56 per share, subject to ongoing Board review and approval. The Board will obviously need to consider the entire landscape of the investigation process before each quarterly dividend is declared.
Finally, Chris mentioned that we've kicked off a project, FE Forward, that I see transforming first energy into a more efficient and effective industry leader, delivering superior customer value and shareholder returns. In partnership with McKenzie, employees across FirstEnergy are challenging organizational traditions, conventional wisdom and cultural norms. At the same time, we are focused on modernizing our management practices, processes and digital and technology platforms to deliver a superior customer experience and a much more nimble organization for the future. While we view this as a transformational effort, we expect to naturally deliver efficiencies that will help us address whatever comes our way in the future, while meeting all of our regulatory commitments.
Beyond these benefits, we expect that this transformation will provide us the ability to reinvest in our business, our customers and our employees to become a better technology-enabled leader in the industry, committed to innovation, investments in emerging technologies and to support a smarter and cleaner electric grid. While this project is not the only step in our journey, it's a critical one.
The 8-week information gathering phase of the project included intense and robust employee engagement to better understand how we work and how we can do it better through the use of more modern technology, digital and mobility tools and the use of data and analytics. As we enter into the next phase of this effort, we will again engage employees throughout the company to review and assess each opportunity and build out the plans to transform FirstEnergy. Over the next few months, we will build out specific actions for the future, which we look forward to sharing."

In some instance, I would tell you that we're operating on late '90s and early 2000 vintage platforms. And so we see a lot of opportunity for efficiency there. Integration of systems, digital tools to drive efficiencies, use of automation and data analytics around asset health, maintenance work, whether it be repair, replace decisions, vegetation management programs, procurement. And so we're excited about the opportunity. We just finished Phase I of the project, and I think our employees are very excited. I think they see this as a real opportunity.

Before I get into our results, I wanted to kick off the call with a few words on a critical area of focus for FirstEnergy. Taking appropriate actions to address our recent challenges and fostering a strong culture of compliance, ethics and integrity, we are deeply committed to creating a culture in which compliance is endemic in second nature and where our leaders prioritize and encourage open and transparent communications with all of our stakeholders. This focus is absolutely essential for our success as an organization. 
Our commitment starts at the top and extends throughout the organization. We are working to ensure that every leader is actively engaged in setting the proper tone and creating an environment where not only our words, but our actions align with our core values and behaviors. We're building a world-class compliance function to underpin this effort, including bringing on Hyun Park as our new Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer in January. Hyun is the right person to step into this role at this time, and he will be instrumental in driving this cultural shift. 
We will also be appointing a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, who will manage a dedicated team of compliance professionals and enhance our efforts to improve our compliance function by shifting from a decentralized to a more centralized model. In addition, we'll be designating compliance ambassadors throughout the company to act as boots on the ground, ensuring the entire organization understands the critical importance of compliance and what it means for each individual. 
We are also making significant changes in our approach to political and legislative engagement and advocacy. Our activity in this space will be much more limited than it has been in the past, with closer alignment to our strategic goals and with additional oversight and significantly more robust disclosure. With this additional transparency, my goal is to make it crystal clear exactly what efforts we support. These efforts, together with enhanced policies and procedures, will help to bring additional clarity around appropriate behaviors at FirstEnergy. And through enhanced communications, training, and most importantly, our actions, we are dedicated to reemphasizing that every employee at every level has the responsibility to consistently act in accordance with our core values and behaviors and to speak up if they see inappropriate behavior anywhere in the organization. 
At the same time, we're taking decisive actions to rebuild our reputation and brand and focus on the future. This includes the decisions recently made with respect to Ohio that I'll talk about shortly. And while we don't control the time line related to the DOJ and SEC, we will continue to cooperate fully with these government investigations and remain focused on the matters that we can control. 
Chris will address a number of actions the Board has underway in a more detailed manner later in this call. But be assured that both management and the Board will be relentless and take the steps needed to position our company for long-term success. 
Now turning to earnings. Today, we reported 2020 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.39 per share. On Tuesday, we announced several proactive steps we're taking to resolve a range of regulatory proceedings affecting our Ohio utilities. These include our previously announced agreement with the Ohio Attorney General, along with the decision not to seek recovery of lost distribution revenues. This resulted in a charge of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. Absent this charge, our 2020 operating earnings would have been $2.54 per share. Well above the midpoint of our most recent guidance range and reflective of our strong performance last year. While this was a difficult decision, we are confident it was the right decision. We believe resolving these matters in a comprehensive manner is a critical step to demonstrate our commitment to transparency and integrity in every aspect of our business, while taking steps toward removing uncertainty relating to our current Ohio regulatory matters. 
And in the interest of providing additional transparency, today's investor materials will include more information about regulatory ROEs in each of the states we serve. We remain excited about the significant investment opportunities that will continue to drive solid earnings and growth in the years ahead. When we have further clarity in Ohio, and with the ongoing government investigations, we intend to resume providing a long-term growth rate that should be consistent with traditional utility growth rates and similar to what we have provided in the past. For now, we are focusing on this year and we have introduced 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. 
We have made these disclosures early, so you would have time to absorb them before this call. Because we have a lot of ground to cover today, including: our solid operational performance last year, even in the face of the pandemic; our strategy for 2021 and beyond, including our commitment to building shareholder value; and the work we're doing to position the company for the future. 
Our fundamental performance continues to be excellent. We continued making demonstrable progress on our strategic goals, and we had an exceptional year from a safety perspective. Even with about half of our employees working from home and the others adopting new health and safety protocols, the FirstEnergy team has remained laser focused on providing safe and reliable service to our 6 million customers. I am deeply proud of the team's resilience and commitment, especially in light of the turbulence that marked the year. 
Our results in 2020 reflect our commitment to strong operations as well as the stability provided by our diverse footprint and our wires-focused platform. Last year, we also successfully executed our plan to invest $3 billion in our distribution and transmission systems as we continued our reliability in grid mod program to benefit customers. We believe our robust long-term organic growth opportunities are well aligned with the focus on electrification and the critical role the grid plays in supporting the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. 
These opportunities and our goals that support them are included in our strategic plan, published last month and available on our website. I hope you have taken some time to review it. This updated plan addresses our unwavering commitment to transparency and accountability and identifies old goals for key areas of our business. These goals are aligned with our core values and behaviors, our regulatory strategy and our commitments to our customers, communities and investors as well as environmental stewardship. 
Among these objectives outlined in the plan is our pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This ambitious goal reflects our transformation to a regulated electric utility and our responsibility to help create a sustainable energy future. The strategic plan also addresses our continued commitment to build a more diverse and inclusive workplace. We've had a D&I-focused KPI for 3 years now and we are taking even more aggressive steps to make progress in this area. We're excited to pursue a 30% increase in our number of racially and ethnically underrepresented employees by 2025, both overall and at the supervisor and above level. We believe this will help accelerate our transformation into an innovative, diverse and sustainable company and drive an important shift in our corporate culture. We recently completed our fourth company-wide survey of all employees. 
Overall, I'm proud to say we scored relatively well on many fronts, but we certainly have more work to do. One area identified for improvement is listening and valuing the opinions of our employees. We want employees to feel empowered to voice their opinion on important issues and my team, with guidance and support from the Board of Directors, is addressing this head-on. We view this work as central to strengthening our compliance program and a culture of ethics, integrity and accountability. 
I'd like to explain my approach to driving this change, and perhaps we could use the company's safety culture as an analogy. Several years ago, we had concerns that our safety culture was trending in the wrong direction. Management led a significant effort with our employees to put in place new programs and training. And to consistently demonstrate that safety is and will always be an unwavering core value. These efforts ultimately instituted a cultural shift in how we all understood the critical importance of safety. We want that very same cultural shift to occur as it relates to compliance and ethics. And we want our employees to know that we value and welcome their opinions. As we look ahead, I feel confident in our path forward. We have a strong foundation. Our fundamentals are solid, and our strategies are proven. And we are building on that with a relentless focus on making FirstEnergy a better company as we work to rebuild trust, work to achieve financial results and deliver for our customers and investors. We recognize that changes won't happen overnight. They happen over time, just like the evolution in our safety culture I spoke about earlier. I'm confident we will emerge a stronger, better FirstEnergy. 
Now I'll turn it over to Chris Pappas, who can address the specific and significant actions that the Board and management are taking to address the current challenges and set FirstEnergy on the right path for a successful future."

First, I'd like to reiterate the Board's strong support of Steve and recognize the hard work he and the rest of the team are doing. We commend their willingness to learn from the past and their absolute commitment to take this company forward on a new path, all while executing the company's strategy and keeping operations and financial results on solid footing. 
The Board and management team are focused on a critical objective: to move forward from the past actions of certain former executives; and to take the steps necessary to improve the tone at the top, culture of ethics and integrity and the way we do business. 
Steve talked about a lot of the important work that is being driven by the new management team. Likewise, the Board is committed to strengthening every part of FirstEnergy's culture and taking the necessary steps to reestablish credibility. Together, we have made much progress on the issues that confronted the company several months ago. And at the same time, we recognize there is more work to do. 
I'd like to recap some of the steps that the Board has been actively engaged in to drive improvements in our culture of compliance. First, the Board promptly put in place an independent committee with external counsel to oversee the internal investigation and to monitor the status of the various regulatory and legal matters facing the company. The independent committee, which currently is made up of the entire board, meets frequently and regularly. 
The Board acted as swiftly in the removal of 5 executives, named Steve Strah as acting CEO, established an Executive Director role and expanded the role of the Board's share, all to assist management and the Board with the dynamics we faced in the first months of the investigation. The Board unequivocally endorsed the principle of full cooperation with both the DOJ and the SEC on the matters related to the investigation. And through our own internal investigation, led by independent counsel, has supported intensive analysis. The Board established a compliance oversight subcommittee of the Audit Committee with independent counsel and leading compliance advisers to analyze and improve the compliance policy and culture at FirstEnergy. Steve mentioned some initial output from this work earlier. 
In addition, the Board established a number of working groups to oversee and support various work streams, including communications, recruiting and financial flexibility. And to that point, management has initiated a project called FirstEnergy Forward, a transformational effort to change the way the company does business. The objective of this project is to transform the company for the future, but it will also provide near-term financial flexibility. Jon will discuss this later on the call. We know there is particular interest in the status of the internal investigation. Hopefully, my earlier comments give you a sense of the intensity and the magnitude of the work that has occurred within the company and with the benefit of extensive external independent support. 
Our internal investigation continues to be thorough and robust. And includes assistance from external law firms who are supported by several other consultants. The ongoing investigation has not resulted in any new material items not previously disclosed. In the course of the internal investigation, we did identify certain transactions, which, in some instances, extended back 10 years or more, including vendor services that were either improperly classified, misallocated to certain of utility or transmission companies or lacked proper supporting documentation. These transactions result in amounts collected from customers that were immaterial to FirstEnergy, and our utility and transmission companies will be working with the appropriate regulatory agencies to address these amounts. 
Our internal investigation will also continue to address any due developments in connection with the ongoing DOJ and SEC investigations. More importantly, we are increasing our focus on another critical aspect of our work, moving FirstEnergy forward. The fresh perspective of Hyun Park and a new Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer will be invaluable to creating an environment where the entire team is committed to embracing the right behaviors and embedding a strong culture of compliance. 
To further that effort, we also announced this morning that we have hired John Somerhalder as Vice Chairman of the Board. It is my pleasure to welcome John to the Board in his new role. He will also join the executive team on a transitional basis as Executive Director and act in advisory capacity to support efforts to achieve the company's priorities: restore its reputation and strengthen its overall governance and compliance functions. John is a 40-year industry executive with extensive energy experience in navigating complex challenges and driving strong corporate governance. Bringing John into this full-time role means that I will step back from the Executive Director position I've held since October and return to my regular duties as an independent Board member by April 1. And importantly, we will continue to fully support the management team as it transitions FirstEnergy to the future as a more resilient company. 
Despite the challenges the company has faced, FirstEnergy's operating fundamentals are strong, and we have a great platform of assets. Together, we have put in place a robust plan to move forward and to position FirstEnergy as an industry leader. One, we know it can be and one that will deliver excellent value to its customers and shareholders. We look forward to working together alongside with management in this effort. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jon Taylor for a financial update."
293515,704050765,2215561,"FirstEnergy Corp., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,"Earnings Calls","FirstEnergy Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our financial results and expectations and provide an update on several other financial matters. This morning, we reported fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $0.45 per share with operating ear",1358,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our financial results and expectations and provide an update on several other financial matters. 
This morning, we reported fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $0.45 per share with operating earnings of $0.32 per share. Our operating results include the charge at our Ohio utilities that Steve mentioned earlier. Absent this charge, our results reflect continued rate base growth related to our transmission and distribution investment programs, a favorable mix of customer usage reflecting the impact of our residential customers staying at home and higher expenses mostly associated with the pandemic. 
Additional fourth quarter data is available in the supporting materials on our website. So in light of our lengthy agenda for this call, I'm going to focus on our results for the full year of 2020. 
As Steve mentioned, we reported 2020 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.39 per share, which compared to 2019 GAAP results of $1.70 per share and operating earnings of $2.55 per share. 
In our distribution business, in addition to the $0.15 charge at our Ohio utilities, results for 2020 as compared to 2019 reflect the absence of Rider DMR in Ohio, which was in place for the first half of 2019 and higher operating costs. These were partially offset by higher revenues from increased residential usage as well as earnings from our distribution enhancement programs. 
Although total weather-adjusted sales decreased 2% in 2020, normal usage from our residential customers increased 5% for the year, which from an earnings perspective more than offset the 6% decrease in commercial and industrial loan. While this shift has moderated as the pandemic wears on, we have seen higher weather-adjusted residential usage relative to our latest forecast in the 2% to 4% range with flat to slightly higher C&I usage. 
In our transmission business, approximately $550 million in rate base growth drove stronger results, which were partially offset by higher financing costs, the impact of transmission rate true-ups and the absence of tax benefits recognized in 2019. 
And finally, at our corporate segment, full year 2020 results primarily reflect higher corporate expenses, higher interest costs and a lower consolidated tax rate. Today, we are providing 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share and first quarter operating earnings guidance in the range of $0.62 to $0.72 per share. Our expectations for the year include capital investments of up to $3 billion, with 100% of the $1.2 billion in transmission investment and approximately 40% of the $1.7 billion in distribution investment being recovered in a formula rate. 
Our transmission plan includes continued expansion of our Energizing the Future program. In New Jersey, we filed an uncontested settlement agreement with FERC on February 2 in our forward-looking formula rate case. In December, FERC accepted our proposed tariff revisions for the transmission assets of West Penn Power, Mon Power, and Potomac Edison as well as the new Keystone Appalachian Transmission Company known as KATCo, pending the outcome of the settlement and hearing process. Those entities moved to a forward-looking formula rate structure effective January 1 this year, subject to refund. 
Other key drivers for 2021 include the impact from the base distribution case at JCP&L, continued investment in our distribution enhancement programs and lower operating costs. We expect these drivers to be partially offset by higher interest expense, which includes close to $0.04 per share associated with the step-up on $4 billion of holding company bonds, and $0.05 per share associated with our revolver borrowings that I'll address in a moment. 
Additionally, our load forecast has a more typical usage profile for our residential customers and a slower recovery to pre pandemic levels for our C&I customers. 
Equity remains a part of our overall financing plan, and we are affirming our plan to issue up to $600 million in equity annually in '22 and '23, and we will flex these plans as needed. We remain committed to maintaining adequate liquidity for our distribution and transmission subsidiaries. At year-end, our liquidity was approximately $3 billion, with $1.7 billion of cash on hand and $1.3 billion of undrawn capacity under our credit facilities. 
We currently have $2.2 billion of short-term borrowings, of which approximately $2.1 billion was incurred in November as a proactive measure to increase our cash position to preserve financial flexibility. And we have committed to our bank group that as we work through our financing plan, we expect to reduce short-term borrowings with the timing and amount dependent on a number of factors. Our current maturities of long-term debt remain manageable with only $74 million maturing in 2021. 
We remain in close contact with the rating agencies who are intensely focused on governance and the actions we are taking to strengthen our compliance environment and controls. Improving our credit metrics at FirstEnergy, while committed -- committing to return to investment grade as quickly as possible and maintaining the strong credit ratings at our utilities are key priorities. We are targeting future FFO to debt metrics in the 12% to 13% range at the consolidated level as we work to address some of the uncertainties that Chris and Steve mentioned. 
We know how important the dividend continues to be for our investors in accordance with our target payout ratio of 55% to 65%. The Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 in December, payable March 1. And as we mentioned on our third quarter call, our intent is to hold the 2021 dividend flat to the 2020 level of $1.56 per share, subject to ongoing Board review and approval. The Board will obviously need to consider the entire landscape of the investigation process before each quarterly dividend is declared. 
Finally, Chris mentioned that we've kicked off a project, FE Forward, that I see transforming FirstEnergy into a more efficient and effective industry leader, delivering superior customer value and shareholder returns. In partnership with McKenzie, employees across FirstEnergy are challenging organizational traditions, conventional wisdom and cultural norms. At the same time, we are focused on modernizing our management practices, processes and digital and technology platforms to deliver a superior customer experience and a much more nimble organization for the future. While we view this as a transformational effort, we expect to naturally deliver efficiencies that will help us address whatever comes our way in the future, while meeting all of our regulatory commitments. Beyond these benefits, we expect that this transformation will provide us the ability to reinvest in our business, our customers and our employees to become a better technology-enabled leader in the industry, committed to innovation, investments in emerging technologies and to support a smarter and cleaner electric grid. While this project is not the only step in our journey, it's a critical one. 
The 8-week information gathering phase of the project included intense and robust employee engagement to better understand how we work and how we can do it better through the use of more modern technology, digital and mobility tools and the use of data and analytics. As we enter into the next phase of this effort, we will again engage employees throughout the company to review and assess each opportunity and build out the plans to transform FirstEnergy. Over the next few months, we will build out specific actions for the future, which we look forward to sharing.
Before we open up the call to Q&A, we wanted to provide a recent update, which we disclosed in our 10-K this morning. We received a letter dated February 16, 2021, from Icahn Capital, informing the company that Carl Icahn is making a filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and has an intention to acquire voting securities of FirstEnergy an amount exceeding $184 million, but less than $920 million, depending on various factors, including market conditions. We do not know whether Carl Icahn and his affiliates have acquired shares of FirstEnergy common stock and/or derivatives, and we do not know his intentions with respect to our company. The letter represents our only contact with Icahn Capital and we don't have any additional information to share. 
With that, we can then open up for questions."

In some instance, I would tell you that we're operating on late '90s and early 2000 vintage platforms. And so we see a lot of opportunity for efficiency there. Integration of systems, digital tools to drive efficiencies, use of automation and data analytics around asset health, maintenance work, whether it be repair, replace decisions, vegetation management programs, procurement. And so we're excited about the opportunity. We just finished Phase 1 of the project, and I think our employees are very excited. I think they see this as a real opportunity.

It's Eileen Mikkelsen, and I'm Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs. As Steve mentioned, we have begun the process of outreach to various regulatory stakeholders in the state of Ohio, trying to express to them our interest in moving forward in a clear, transparent, cohesive fashion, but also taking time to listen, listen to what is important to the various regulatory stakeholders and using that listening exercise to collectively craft a solution that will move us forward for our customers and for the state of Ohio as well as the company.
In terms of early returns, I think folks are very interested in moving forward with this process. As you might expect, their enthusiasm is tempered a bit by let's wait and see. To put our money where our mouth is in terms of our ability to listen and work collectively with these people. And we're willing to run the gates to do that in order to gain the trust and support of the stakeholders in order to move us forward in the regulatory process here in Ohio."

And I hope you're getting that impression more broadly, not just around the cooperation, but more broadly around the dynamics of compliance improvement, the activities of the Board, the bringing on of a new Executive Director and Vice Chair with extensive experience in the energy and utility space, John Somerhalder, who will be a great add, the bringing on of Hyun Park, the eventual onboarding of a new compliance and ethics officer, the changes that the company is making in its compliance and ethics program as part of the work of the subcommittee of the Audit Committee. All of these things in concert are moving the company forward in a way that FirstEnergy is going to emerge from this as a, we think, stronger and a different and better company.

Just so we're clear on our current approach, under my leadership, we've made some significant changes immediately. So we've ceased all political contributions, and we're evaluating what our path forward will be when playing in that space, I would say. And that also includes 501(c)(4)s. You can count on us not contributing to any 501(c)(4) that is politically focused, and that's going to form the basis of our activity going forward. So what we're doing is we're working internally and we're working with our Board of Directors to get clarity around what our internal expectations are, what our philosophy and pathway will be moving ahead. And the way I look at it, we're going to get involved in items of this kind, in which we could look at every employee directly in the eye and explain the why behind the what of what we're doing in this arena. So what we're working on, at least from our standpoint, is that great reduction in 501(c)(4) giving anyway. So it's going to be a nonfactor for us.
And then secondly, we're going to be working with the subcommittee of our Audit Committee from a compliance standpoint to make sure that we have the reporting that we need internally that will satisfy us and then we'll work to form something that we will publish in our fact book and in other areas. That's our current thinking."

And so that reduced the funding obligation for those years.
With respect to your question around costs, I actually think we're going to see cost decline -- operating cost decline year-over-year because we're not anticipating as much, what I'll call, pandemic costs that we incurred in 2020. If you think about all the personal protective equipment, all the contractors and bad debt expense for our receivables that we incurred in 2020, although we expect that to continue at some rate, but not to the rate that we saw in 2020.

As Jon will discuss, our results reflect the continued successful implementation of our investment strategies, higher weather-adjusted load in our residential class and strong financial discipline in managing our operating expenses. 
Last month, I was honored to be named FirstEnergy's CEO and appointed to the Board of Directors. I greatly appreciate the trust and confidence the Board has placed in me since I was named President last May and acting CEO in October. I have great pride in FirstEnergy and the work our employees do to serve our customers and communities. It's my privilege to continue leading the company as we navigate our current challenges and position our business for long-term stability and success. 
As we work to move FirstEnergy forward, my priorities are the continued safety of our employees and customers, ensuring that ethics accountability and integrity are deeply ingrained in our culture and supported by a strong corporate compliance program. Executing FE Forward, our transformational effort to capitalize on our potential deliver long-term results and maximize near-term financial flexibility; and continuing our investments in infrastructure growth opportunities from electrification, grid modernization and renewable integration to benefit our customers. 
During today's call, I'll provide an update on the Department of Justice investigation, regulatory matters and our FE Forward initiative and other business developments. John Somerhalder, will join us for an update on the Board and management's work towards instilling a culture of compliance built upon the highest standards of ethics and integrity. Then Jon Taylor will review our results and other financial topics before we open it up for your questions. 
As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we are committed to taking decisive actions to rebuild our reputation and focus on the future and continuing to cooperate with the ongoing government investigations. We have begun discussions with the DOJ regarding the resolution of this matter, including the possibility of FirstEnergy entering into a deferred prosecution agreement. We can't currently predict the timing outcome or the impact of the possible resolution with the DOJ. Our goal is to take a holistic and transparent approach with a range of stakeholders across the spectrum of matters under review. This approach is consistent with the changes we're making in our political and legislative engagement and advocacy. For example, we are stopping all contributions to 501(c)(4)s; we paused all other political disbursements, including from our political action committee; and we've limited our participation in the political process. We have also suspended and/or terminated various political consulting relationships. 
In addition, we'll be expanding our disclosures around political spending in order to provide increased transparency. For example, we have committed to post updates on our website on our corporate political activity, relationship with trade associations and our corporate political activity policy, which is under revision. A comprehensive and open approach is also the cornerstone in our regulatory activity. 
In Ohio, we continue taking proactive steps to reduce the regulatory uncertainty affecting our utilities in the state. This includes our decision in late March to credit our Ohio utility customers approximately $27 million. This comprises the revenues that were collected through the decoupling mechanism authorized under Ohio law plus interest. The partial settlement with the Ohio Attorney General to stop collections of decoupling revenues and our decision not to seek recovery of lost distribution revenues from our Ohio customers. Together, these actions fully address the requirements approved in Ohio House Bill 128 as well as the related rate impact of House Bill 6 on our customers. These are important steps to put this matter behind us. 
In other Ohio regulatory matters, we proactively updated our testimony in the ESP quadrennial review case to provide prospective seat values on an individual company basis. We are engaged in settlement discussions with interested parties on this matter as well as the 2017, 2018 and 2019 seat cases that were consolidated into this proceeding. During our last call, we mentioned that we were proactively engaging with our regulators to refund customers for certain vendor payments. Those conversations are underway in each affected jurisdiction. In Ohio, at the PUCO's request, the scope of our annual audit of Rider DCR has been expanded to include a review of these payments. 
Outside of Ohio, our state regulatory activity is concentrated on customer-focused initiatives that will support the transition to a cleaner climate. For example, on March 1, JCP&L filed a petition with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, seeking approval for its proposed EV-driven program. If approved, the 4-year $50 million program would offer incentives and rate structures to support the development of EV charging infrastructure throughout our New Jersey service territory, in an effort to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and provide benefits to our residential, commercial and industrial customers. And in late March, the Pennsylvania PUC approved our 5-year $390 million energy efficiency and conservation plan, which supports the PUC's consumption reduction targets. 
In other recent developments, last week, FERC approved our uncontested JCP&L forward-looking formula rate settlement without any modifications. In March, we closed the transaction to sell JCP&L's 50% interest in the Yards Creek pump storage hydro plant and received proceeds of $155 million. And we also announced plans to sell Penelec's Waverly, New York distribution assets, which serves about 3,800 customers to a local coop. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, will simplify Penelec's business by solely focusing on Pennsylvania customers. 
During our fourth quarter call, we introduced you to FE Forward, our company-wide effort to transform FirstEnergy into a more resilient, effective industry leader, delivering superior customer value and shareholder returns. We expect the FE Forward initiatives to provide a more modern experience for our customers with efficiencies in operating and capital expenditures that can be strategically reinvested into our business, supporting our growth and investments in a smarter and cleaner electric grid while also maintaining affordable electric bills. During the first phase of the project, we evaluated our processes, business practices and cultural norms to understand where we can improve. While our safety and reliability performance is strong, we found opportunities in many areas to enhance and automate processes take a more strategic focus on operating expenditures and modernize experiences for our customers and employees. We've identified more than 300 opportunities and now we are diving deeper into these ideas, developing detailed executable plans as we prepare for implementation beginning later this quarter. 
Examples of this work include improving the planning and scheduling through integration of systems to allow our employees to deliver their best to our customers; leveraging advanced technologies such as drones and satellite imagery to improve our vegetation management programs; using predictive analytics and web-based tools to provide our customers with more self-service options and improve their experience; and leverage purchasing power to optimize payment terms. As part of these efforts, we intend to evaluate the appropriate cadence to initiate rate cases on a state-by-state basis to best support our customer-focused strategic priorities. We will also remain focused on emerging technologies, smart grid, electric vehicle infrastructure and our customers' evolving energy needs as we think through how to reduce our carbon footprint. 
We're off to a great start this year and yesterday, we reaffirmed our 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. Our leadership team is committed to upholding our core values and behaviors and executing on our proven strategies as we put our customers at the center of everything we do. We will take the appropriate steps to deliver on our promise to make FirstEnergy a better company, one that is respected by our customers, the investment community, regulators and our employees. 
Thank you for your time and confidence. Now I'll turn the call over to John Somerhalder."

I'd like to start by sharing my impressions of FirstEnergy after almost 2 months in his role. This is a company with a firm foundation, including a commitment to improve in the area of governance and compliance a commitment to customers by embracing innovation and technology to help ensure the strength, resilience and reliability of its transmission and distribution businesses, a deep-seated and strong safety culture and a strong potential to deliver significant value to investors through customer-focused growth. 
Since joining the team, I've been supporting senior leadership in advancing the company's priorities, strengthening our governance and compliance functions and enhancing our relationships with external stakeholders, including regulators and the financial community. Steve spoke about our business priorities, so I will focus my remarks today on our compliance work, including remedial actions. 
First, I'd like to update you on our internal investigation, which has revealed no new material issues since our last earnings call. The focus of the internal investigation has transitioned from a proactive investigation to continued cooperation with the ongoing government investigations. Management and the Board with the assistance of the Compliance Subcommittee of the Audit Committee have been working together to build a best-in-class compliance program. Through these efforts, we have identified improvement opportunities in 5 broad categories, including governance, risk management, training and communications, concerns management and third-party management. As part of these efforts, FirstEnergy is embracing a commitment to enhancing its compliance culture to be best-in-class. 
Some of the actions completed to date include hiring our Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, Hyun Park, in January; Antonio Fernandez, who joined as Vice President and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer last week; and myself. On the Board side, Jesse Lynn and Andrew Teno, joined us from Icahn Capital in March. And the Board has nominated a new independent member, Melvin Williams , for election at the Annual Shareholders Meeting when Sandy Pianalto's term ends next month. I believe the insights and experience of these new leaders are helping to round out a very committed and confident Board and management team. 
In March, the Board affirmed our confidence in Steve by naming him CEO. Steve has consistently demonstrated the integrity, leadership skills strategic acumen and deep knowledge of our businesses needed to position FirstEnergy for long-term success and stability. These changes, along with the Board's reinforcement of and the executive team's commitment to setting the appropriate tone at the top, will support a culture of compliance going forward. For instance, we recently held an event where the Chairman and the Chair of the Compliance Subcommittee addressed the company's top 140 leaders regarding the expectations to act with integrity in everything we do. Our legal department recently completed training on up the ladder reporting, and we have enhanced our onboarding process for new employees and for third parties on expectations around our code of business conduct. 
Over the course of the next few months, there will be many more steps the company will take to enhance our compliance program, such as continuing to build the new, more centralized compliance organization under Antonio's leadership; addressing our processes, policies and controls, which include additional oversight for political contributions; continuing to emphasize our values and expectations in ongoing communications with our employees; incorporating compliance into our goals and performance metrics and holding all employees regardless of title to the same standards; enhancing the channels for incident reporting and developing thorough and objective processes to investigate and address allegations of misconduct; and ensuring increased communications with and training of employees with respect to our commitment to ethical standards and integrity of our business procedures, compliance requirements, our code of business conduct and other company policies; and understanding and utilizing the process for reporting suspected violations of law or code of business conduct. 
We have also enhanced our internal controls around disbursements to require additional approvals, targeted reviews of any suspicious payments and a reassessment of approval levels across the entire company. Additionally, in the area of disbursements, we will update and clarify policies and procedures, conduct training and institute a regular audit program that reviews payments and services performed. A detailed list of the corrective actions we are taking can be found on Pages 8 and 9 of our first quarter fact book. Over the next several months, we expect to make significant progress in the areas of compliance led by Antonio's organization, where it will continue to be overseen by the Board and the newly established management steering committee for ethics and compliance. Through these efforts, we expect the material weakness associated with the tone at the top to be remediated by the time we file our fourth quarter earnings. 
Our leaders are continuing to elevate the importance of compliance and working to regain the trust of employees and our stakeholders by modeling appropriate behavior and consistently communicating that compliance and ethics are core values, just like safety. We are committed to ensuring that employees understand what is expected of them and are comfortable reporting ethical violations without fear repercussions. By continually emphasizing the importance of compliance to our strategies and future, as well as demonstrating that we are setting the right tone at the top, we strive to bolster confidence among our employees that the management team and the Board are taking the proper decisive actions to move the company forward. I believe we have learned a lot from recent challenges and are taking the right actions to emerge as a better, stronger company with a bright future. 
Now I'll turn the floor over to Jon Taylor for a review of first quarter results and a financial update."

Also note that we continue to provide more robust disclosures on ROEs, including more granular sensitivities. 
Yesterday, we announced GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share for the first quarter of 2021 and operating earnings of $0.69 per share, which was at the upper end of our guidance range. GAAP results for 2021 include 2 special items: regulatory charges related to customer refunds associated with previously collected Ohio decoupling revenues; and expenses associated with the investigation. In our distribution business, our results for the first quarter of this year as compared to 2020 reflect higher residential usage on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis, as well as growth from incremental riders and rate increases, including DCR and grid modernization in Ohio; the distribution system improvement charge in Pennsylvania; and the implementation of our base rate case settlement in New Jersey. These drivers were partially offset by $0.10 per share related to the absence of Ohio decoupling revenues and our decision to forgo the collection of lost distribution revenues from our residential and commercial customers. 
Our total distribution deliveries for the first quarter of 2021 decreased 2% on a weather-adjusted basis as compared to the last year, reflecting an increase in residential sales of 2% as customers continue to spend more time at home in the first quarter of 2021; a decline of 7% in commercial sales; and in our industrial class, first quarter load decreased 3%. It's worth noting that total distribution deliveries through the first quarter are consistent with our internal load forecast, with residential demand 2% higher versus our forecast, while industrial load is down 2%. 
In our Regulated Transmission business, earnings decreased as a result of higher net financing costs, which included an adjustment to previously capitalized interest. partially offset by the impact of rate base growth at our ATSI and MAIT subsidiaries. Finally, in our Corporate segment, results reflect lower operating expenses offset by the absence of a first quarter 2020 pension OPEB credit related to Energy Harbor's emergence from bankruptcy as well as higher interest expense. 
We are off to a solid start for the year and are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share for 2021. We've also introduced second quarter guidance of $0.48 to $0.58 per share. In addition, our strong focus on cash helped drive a $125 million increase in adjusted cash from operations and $185 million increase in free cash flow versus our internal plan for the first quarter. 
As to a couple of other financial updates, our 2021 debt financing plan remains on track. In March, FirstEnergy Transmission issued $500 million in senior notes and a strong, well-supported bond offering that showcase the strength of our transmission business. The deal was oversubscribed and on par with an investment-grade offering. We used the proceeds to repay $500 million in short-term borrowings under the FET revolving credit facility. In addition, we repaid $250 million at the FirstEnergy Holding Company. We also successfully issued $200 million in first mortgage bonds at Mon Power in April that was also very well supported. This supports our earlier commitment to reduce short-term borrowings and as well as our goal to improve our credit metrics at FirstEnergy, return to investment grade as quickly as possible and maintain the strong credit ratings at our utilities. We continue to provide the rating agencies with regular updates on our business, and we are working with them to develop a clear outline of what is needed to return FirstEnergy to investment-grade credit ratings. 
Key milestones include governance and compliance changes at our company, resolution of the DOJ investigation and solid credit metrics. As to more longer-term financing needs through the execution of FE Forward, we have reduced our debt financing plan by approximately $1 billion through 2023, mainly at the FirstEnergy and FirstEnergy Transmission holding companies. Additionally, as we have previously mentioned, equity is an important part of our overall financing plan, with plans to raise up to $1.2 billion of equity over 2022 and 2023. As we said previously, we'll flex these plans as needed, and we are also exploring various alternatives to raise equity capital in a manner that could be more value-enhancing to all stakeholders. These actions, combined with new rates at JCP&L, and our 60%-plus formula rate capital investment program, will generate $150 million to $200 million of incremental cash flow each year, while maintaining relatively flat adjusted debt levels through 2023, all of which will support our targeted 12% to 13% FFO to debt range. 
Turning to our pension, our funding status was 81% at March 31, up from 78% at the end of last year, resulting in a $500 million reduction in our unfunded pension obligation, which improves our adjusted debt position with the rating agencies. The extended funding time frame permitted under the American Rescue Plan, together with the modification of interest rate stabilization rules, means that we do not expect any funding requirements for the foreseeable future, assuming our plan achieves a 7.5% expected return on assets. Although we plan to make contributions into the pension next year, this legislation provides us with additional discretion and flexibility to make voluntary contributions as we assess our capital allocation plans. As Steve mentioned, discussions have begun with the Department of Justice. While no contingency has been reflected in our consolidated financial statements, we believe that it is probable we will incur a loss in connection with the resolution of this investigation. However, we cannot yet reasonably estimate the amount. 
Finally, last month, President Biden introduced the American Jobs Plan, which includes a corporate tax increase and proposed minimum tax as well as potential opportunities related to proposed infusion into the electric vehicle infrastructure and the energy grid. Clearly, it's very early in the process, but the corporate tax provision could be slightly cash positive for us if implemented in its current form. Our solid first quarter results and expectations for the year reflect our strong operating fundamentals and the continued success of our strategies to modernize and enhance our distribution and transmission systems. As we move our company forward, we are laser-focused on unlocking opportunities and increasing value for our shareholders, customers and employees.

And look, the issue is not going to go away, climate and some of the planning in United States is progressing forward, and we all have to do our part. As you look at the overall goals and you look at our ESG greenhouse gas reduction goals, we have already placed out there a goal of a 30% reduction in carbon from 2019 levels by the year 2030, and we are on our way to achieving that.

When we look at the impact, if in fact, with this supplemental [ NOPR ] that FERC issued, which really maybe puts to rest this issue of the 50 basis point incentive that transmission organizations have been given for participation in RTOs. If we quantify that, it's probably between $0.04 and $0.05 for us on a total basis across all our transmission organizations. 
But I think it's also important to recognize this is just a supplemental notice of proposed rule making, has to go through a comment, reply comment period and then take FERC action. And I would also point out that at the same time, FERC really initiated technical conference with respect to transmission incentives related to performance rate making, shared savings mechanisms in order to incent transmission and that meeting is scheduled to occur in September of 2021. So I think there's some puts and takes on what may happen with transmission ROEs. And of course, as you might expect, we're going to stay very actively engaged in all of those discussions."

Yesterday, we reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share and operating earnings of $0.69 per share, which is in the upper end of our guidance range. As Jon will discuss, our results reflect the continued successful implementation of our investment strategies, higher weather-adjusted load in our residential class and strong financial discipline in managing our operating expenses. 
Last month, I was honored to be named FirstEnergy's CEO and appointed to the Board of Directors. I greatly appreciate the trust and confidence the Board has placed in me since I was named President last May and acting CEO in October. I have great pride in FirstEnergy and the work our employees do to serve our customers and communities. It's my privilege to continue leading the company as we navigate our current challenges and position our business for long-term stability and success. 
As we work to move FirstEnergy forward, my priorities are the continued safety of our employees and customers, ensuring that ethics accountability and integrity are deeply ingrained in our culture and supported by a strong corporate compliance program. Executing FE Forward, our transformational effort to capitalize on our potential deliver long-term results and maximize near-term financial flexibility; and continuing our investments in infrastructure growth opportunities from electrification, grid modernization and renewable integration to benefit our customers. 
During today's call, I'll provide an update on the Department of Justice investigation, regulatory matters and our FE Forward initiative and other business developments. John Somerhalder, will join us for an update on the Board and management's work towards instilling a culture of compliance built upon the highest standards of ethics and integrity. Then Jon Taylor will review our results and other financial topics before we open it up for your questions. 
As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we are committed to taking decisive actions to rebuild our reputation and focus on the future and continuing to cooperate with the ongoing government investigations. We have begun discussions with the DOJ regarding the resolution of this matter, including the possibility of FirstEnergy entering into a deferred prosecution agreement. We can't currently predict the timing outcome or the impact of the possible resolution with the DOJ. Our goal is to take a holistic and transparent approach with a range of stakeholders across the spectrum of matters under review. This approach is consistent with the changes we're making in our political and legislative engagement and advocacy. For example, we are stopping all contributions to 501(c)(4)s; we paused all other political disbursements, including from our political action committee; and we've limited our participation in the political process. We have also suspended and/or terminated various political consulting relationships. 
In addition, we'll be expanding our disclosures around political spending in order to provide increased transparency. For example, we have committed to post updates on our website on our corporate political activity, relationship with trade associations and our corporate political activity policy, which is under revision. A comprehensive and open approach is also the cornerstone in our regulatory activity. 
In Ohio, we continue taking proactive steps to reduce the regulatory uncertainty affecting our utilities in the state. This includes our decision in late March to credit our Ohio utility customers approximately $27 million. This comprises the revenues that were collected through the decoupling mechanism authorized under Ohio law plus interest. The partial settlement with the Ohio Attorney General to stop collections of decoupling revenues and our decision not to seek recovery of lost distribution revenues from our Ohio customers. Together, these actions fully address the requirements approved in Ohio House Bill 128 as well as the related rate impact of House Bill 6 on our customers. These are important steps to put this matter behind us. 
In other Ohio regulatory matters, we proactively updated our testimony in the ESP quadrennial review case to provide prospective seat values on an individual company basis. We are engaged in settlement discussions with interested parties on this matter as well as the 2017, 2018 and 2019 seat cases that were consolidated into this proceeding. During our last call, we mentioned that we were proactively engaging with our regulators to refund customers for certain vendor payments. Those conversations are underway in each affected jurisdiction. In Ohio, at the PUCO's request, the scope of our annual audit of Rider DCR has been expanded to include a review of these payments. 
Outside of Ohio, our state regulatory activity is concentrated on customer-focused initiatives that will support the transition to a cleaner climate. For example, on March 1, JCP&L filed a petition with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, seeking approval for its proposed EV-driven program. If approved, the 4-year $50 million program would offer incentives and rate structures to support the development of EV charging infrastructure throughout our New Jersey service territory, in an effort to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and provide benefits to our residential, commercial and industrial customers. And in late March, the Pennsylvania PUC approved our 5-year $390 million energy efficiency and conservation plan, which supports the PUC's consumption reduction targets. 
In other recent developments, last week, FERC approved our uncontested JCP&L forward-looking formula rate settlement without any modifications. In March, we closed the transaction to sell JCP&L's 50% interest in the Yards Creek pump storage hydro plant and received proceeds of $155 million. And we also announced plans to sell Penelec's Waverly, New York distribution assets, which serves about 3,800 customers to a local coop. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, will simplify Penelec's business by solely focusing on Pennsylvania customers. 
During our fourth quarter call, we introduced you to FE Forward, our company-wide effort to transform FirstEnergy into a more resilient, effective industry leader, delivering superior customer value and shareholder returns. We expect the FE Forward initiatives to provide a more modern experience for our customers with efficiencies in operating and capital expenditures that can be strategically reinvested into our business, supporting our growth and investments in a smarter and cleaner electric grid while also maintaining affordable electric bills. During the first phase of the project, we evaluated our processes, business practices and cultural norms to understand where we can improve. While our safety and reliability performance is strong, we found opportunities in many areas to enhance and automate processes take a more strategic focus on operating expenditures and modernize experiences for our customers and employees. We've identified more than 300 opportunities and now we are diving deeper into these ideas, developing detailed executable plans as we prepare for implementation beginning later this quarter. 
Examples of this work include improving the planning and scheduling through integration of systems to allow our employees to deliver their best to our customers; leveraging advanced technologies such as drones and satellite imagery to improve our vegetation management programs; using predictive analytics and web-based tools to provide our customers with more self-service options and improve their experience; and leverage purchasing power to optimize payment terms. As part of these efforts, we intend to evaluate the appropriate cadence to initiate rate cases on a state-by-state basis to best support our customer-focused strategic priorities. We will also remain focused on emerging technologies, smart grid, electric vehicle infrastructure and our customers' evolving energy needs as we think through how to reduce our carbon footprint. 
We're off to a great start this year and yesterday, we reaffirmed our 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. Our leadership team is committed to upholding our core values and behaviors and executing on our proven strategies as we put our customers at the center of everything we do. We will take the appropriate steps to deliver on our promise to make FirstEnergy a better company, one that is respected by our customers, the investment community, regulators and our employees. 
Thank you for your time and confidence. Now I'll turn the call over to John Somerhalder."

I'd like to start by sharing my impressions of FirstEnergy after almost 2 months in his role. This is a company with a firm foundation, including a commitment to improve in the area of governance and compliance a commitment to customers by embracing innovation and technology to help ensure the strength, resilience and reliability of its transmission and distribution businesses, a deep-seated and strong safety culture and a strong potential to deliver significant value to investors through customer-focused growth. 
Since joining the team, I've been supporting senior leadership in advancing the company's priorities, strengthening our governance and compliance functions and enhancing our relationships with external stakeholders, including regulators and the financial community. Steve spoke about our business priorities, so I will focus my remarks today on our compliance work, including remedial actions. 
First, I'd like to update you on our internal investigation, which has revealed no new material issues since our last earnings call. The focus of the internal investigation has transitioned from a proactive investigation to continued cooperation with the ongoing government investigations. Management and the Board with the assistance of the Compliance Subcommittee of the Audit Committee have been working together to build a best-in-class compliance program. Through these efforts, we have identified improvement opportunities in 5 broad categories, including governance, risk management, training and communications, concerns management and third-party management. As part of these efforts, FirstEnergy is embracing a commitment to enhancing its compliance culture to be best-in-class. 
Some of the actions completed to date include hiring our Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, Hyun Park, in January; Antonio Fernandez, who joined as Vice President and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer last week; and myself. On the Board side, Jesse Lynn and Andrew Teno, joined us from Icahn Capital in March. And the Board has nominated a new independent member, Melvin Williams , for election at the Annual Shareholders Meeting when Sandy Pianalto's term ends next month. I believe the insights and experience of these new leaders are helping to round out a very committed and confident Board and management team. 
In March, the Board affirmed our confidence in Steve by naming him CEO. Steve has consistently demonstrated the integrity, leadership skills strategic acumen and deep knowledge of our businesses needed to position FirstEnergy for long-term success and stability. These changes, along with the Board's reinforcement of and the executive team's commitment to setting the appropriate tone at the top, will support a culture of compliance going forward. For instance, we recently held an event where the Chairman and the Chair of the Compliance Subcommittee addressed the company's top 140 leaders regarding the expectations to act with integrity in everything we do. Our legal department recently completed training on up the ladder reporting, and we have enhanced our onboarding process for new employees and for third parties on expectations around our code of business conduct. 
Over the course of the next few months, there will be many more steps the company will take to enhance our compliance program, such as continuing to build the new, more centralized compliance organization under Antonio's leadership; addressing our processes, policies and controls, which include additional oversight for political contributions; continuing to emphasize our values and expectations in ongoing communications with our employees; incorporating compliance into our goals and performance metrics and holding all employees regardless of title to the same standards; enhancing the channels for incident reporting and developing thorough and objective processes to investigate and address allegations of misconduct; and ensuring increased communications with and training of employees with respect to our commitment to ethical standards and integrity of our business procedures, compliance requirements, our code of business conduct and other company policies; and understanding and utilizing the process for reporting suspected violations of law or code of business conduct. 
We have also enhanced our internal controls around disbursements to require additional approvals, targeted reviews of any suspicious payments and a reassessment of approval levels across the entire company. Additionally, in the area of disbursements, we will update and clarify policies and procedures, conduct training and institute a regular audit program that reviews payments and services performed. A detailed list of the corrective actions we are taking can be found on Pages 8 and 9 of our first quarter fact book. Over the next several months, we expect to make significant progress in the areas of compliance led by Antonio's organization, where it will continue to be overseen by the Board and the newly established management steering committee for ethics and compliance. Through these efforts, we expect the material weakness associated with the tone at the top to be remediated by the time we file our fourth quarter earnings. 
Our leaders are continuing to elevate the importance of compliance and working to regain the trust of employees and our stakeholders by modeling appropriate behavior and consistently communicating that compliance and ethics are core values, just like safety. We are committed to ensuring that employees understand what is expected of them and are comfortable reporting ethical violations without fear repercussions. By continually emphasizing the importance of compliance to our strategies and future, as well as demonstrating that we are setting the right tone at the top, we strive to bolster confidence among our employees that the management team and the Board are taking the proper decisive actions to move the company forward. I believe we have learned a lot from recent challenges and are taking the right actions to emerge as a better, stronger company with a bright future. 
Now I'll turn the floor over to Jon Taylor for a review of first quarter results and a financial update."

We have provided new disclosures in 3 main areas within our investor fact book. Our steps to support a cleaner, smarter grid and the movement to more green and renewable resources; additional disclosures on our balance sheet, including our funds from operations target and the steps we're taking to achieve our goals; and third, enhanced ESG disclosures. Also note that we continue to provide more robust disclosures on ROEs, including more granular sensitivities. 
Yesterday, we announced GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share for the first quarter of 2021 and operating earnings of $0.69 per share, which was at the upper end of our guidance range. GAAP results for 2021 include 2 special items: regulatory charges related to customer refunds associated with previously collected Ohio decoupling revenues; and expenses associated with the investigation. In our distribution business, our results for the first quarter of this year as compared to 2020 reflect higher residential usage on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis, as well as growth from incremental riders and rate increases, including DCR and grid modernization in Ohio; the distribution system improvement charge in Pennsylvania; and the implementation of our base rate case settlement in New Jersey. These drivers were partially offset by $0.10 per share related to the absence of Ohio decoupling revenues and our decision to forgo the collection of lost distribution revenues from our residential and commercial customers. 
Our total distribution deliveries for the first quarter of 2021 decreased 2% on a weather-adjusted basis as compared to the last year, reflecting an increase in residential sales of 2% as customers continue to spend more time at home in the first quarter of 2021; a decline of 7% in commercial sales; and in our industrial class, first quarter load decreased 3%. It's worth noting that total distribution deliveries through the first quarter are consistent with our internal load forecast, with residential demand 2% higher versus our forecast, while industrial load is down 2%. 
In our Regulated Transmission business, earnings decreased as a result of higher net financing costs, which included an adjustment to previously capitalized interest. partially offset by the impact of rate base growth at our ATSI and MAIT subsidiaries. Finally, in our Corporate segment, results reflect lower operating expenses offset by the absence of a first quarter 2020 pension OPEB credit related to Energy Harbor's emergence from bankruptcy as well as higher interest expense. 
We are off to a solid start for the year and are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share for 2021. We've also introduced second quarter guidance of $0.48 to $0.58 per share. In addition, our strong focus on cash helped drive a $125 million increase in adjusted cash from operations and $185 million increase in free cash flow versus our internal plan for the first quarter. 
As to a couple of other financial updates, our 2021 debt financing plan remains on track. In March, FirstEnergy Transmission issued $500 million in senior notes and a strong, well-supported bond offering that showcase the strength of our transmission business. The deal was oversubscribed and on par with an investment-grade offering. We used the proceeds to repay $500 million in short-term borrowings under the FET revolving credit facility. In addition, we repaid $250 million at the FirstEnergy Holding Company. We also successfully issued $200 million in first mortgage bonds at Mon Power in April that was also very well supported. This supports our earlier commitment to reduce short-term borrowings and as well as our goal to improve our credit metrics at FirstEnergy, return to investment grade as quickly as possible and maintain the strong credit ratings at our utilities. We continue to provide the rating agencies with regular updates on our business, and we are working with them to develop a clear outline of what is needed to return FirstEnergy to investment-grade credit ratings. 
Key milestones include governance and compliance changes at our company, resolution of the DOJ investigation and solid credit metrics. As to more longer-term financing needs through the execution of FE Forward, we have reduced our debt financing plan by approximately $1 billion through 2023, mainly at the FirstEnergy and FirstEnergy Transmission holding companies. Additionally, as we have previously mentioned, equity is an important part of our overall financing plan, with plans to raise up to $1.2 billion of equity over 2022 and 2023. As we said previously, we'll flex these plans as needed, and we are also exploring various alternatives to raise equity capital in a manner that could be more value-enhancing to all stakeholders. These actions, combined with new rates at JCP&L, and our 60%-plus formula rate capital investment program, will generate $150 million to $200 million of incremental cash flow each year, while maintaining relatively flat adjusted debt levels through 2023, all of which will support our targeted 12% to 13% FFO to debt range. 
Turning to our pension, our funding status was 81% at March 31, up from 78% at the end of last year, resulting in a $500 million reduction in our unfunded pension obligation, which improves our adjusted debt position with the rating agencies. The extended funding time frame permitted under the American Rescue Plan, together with the modification of interest rate stabilization rules, means that we do not expect any funding requirements for the foreseeable future, assuming our plan achieves a 7.5% expected return on assets. Although we plan to make contributions into the pension next year, this legislation provides us with additional discretion and flexibility to make voluntary contributions as we assess our capital allocation plans. As Steve mentioned, discussions have begun with the Department of Justice. While no contingency has been reflected in our consolidated financial statements, we believe that it is probable we will incur a loss in connection with the resolution of this investigation. However, we cannot yet reasonably estimate the amount. 
Finally, last month, President Biden introduced the American Jobs Plan, which includes a corporate tax increase and proposed minimum tax as well as potential opportunities related to proposed infusion into the electric vehicle infrastructure and the energy grid. Clearly, it's very early in the process, but the corporate tax provision could be slightly cash positive for us if implemented in its current form. Our solid first quarter results and expectations for the year reflect our strong operating fundamentals and the continued success of our strategies to modernize and enhance our distribution and transmission systems. As we move our company forward, we are laser-focused on unlocking opportunities and increasing value for our shareholders, customers and employees.

We had our first broad-based meeting, March 31 of this past quarter, very well attended, represented by folks that represent really all of our customer groups. And in the course of that discussion, we are talking about the quadrennial review, the seat cases, both historical and prospective as well as many, many other matters. 
I would say that in the course of those discussions, I think the parties expressed to us generally in appreciation for the approach that we were taking in Ohio to resolving these matters. And also, generally an appreciation for the actions that the company has taken to date in Ohio to move past the issues that we currently face."

And I think we're well positioned for that. 
I believe there's other factors that will come into consideration as the administration goes through the necessary next steps. We have to have a very thoughtful transition embedded in this plan. There are economic impacts, potential reliability impacts for the T&D systems that we want to stay mindful of. And look, the issue is not going to go away, climate and some of the planning in United States is progressing forward, and we all have to do our part. As you look at the overall goals and you look at our ESG greenhouse gas reduction goals, we have already placed out there a goal of a 30% reduction in carbon from 2019 levels by the year 2030, and we are on our way to achieving that. And we have a carbon neutrality goal in 2050. So I think our goal, our business plan, our strategy is consistent with what the bid administration proposed. But I think there's a lot of work to do to take it from a policy statement to on-the-ground improvements."

When we look at the impact, if in fact, with this supplemental [ NOPR ] that FERC issued, which really maybe puts to rest this issue of the 50 basis point incentive that transmission organizations have been given for participation in RTOs. If we quantify that, it's probably between $0.04 and $0.05 for us on a total basis across all our transmission organizations. 
But I think it's also important to recognize this is just a supplemental notice of proposed rule making, has to go through a comment, reply comment period and then take FERC action. And I would also point out that at the same time, FERC really initiated technical conference with respect to transmission incentives related to performance rate making, shared savings mechanisms in order to incent transmission and that meeting is scheduled to occur in September of 2021.

As Jon will discuss, our results reflect the continued successful implementation of our investment strategies, higher weather-adjusted load in our residential class and strong financial discipline in managing our operating expenses.  
Last month, I was honored to be named FirstEnergy's CEO and appointed to the Board of Directors. I greatly appreciate the trust and confidence the Board has placed in me since I was named President last May and acting CEO in October. I have great pride in FirstEnergy and the work our employees do to serve our customers and communities. It's my privilege to continue leading the company as we navigate our current challenges and position our business for long-term stability and success.  
As we work to move FirstEnergy forward, my priorities are the continued safety of our employees and customers, ensuring that ethics accountability and integrity are deeply ingrained in our culture and supported by a strong corporate compliance program. Executing FE Forward, our transformational effort to capitalize on our potential, deliver long-term results and maximize near-term financial flexibility and continuing our investments in infrastructure growth opportunities from electrification, grid modernization and renewable integration to benefit our customers.  
During today's call, I'll provide an update on the Department of Justice investigation, regulatory matters and our FE Forward initiative and other business developments. John Somerhalder will join us for an update on the Board and management's work towards instilling a culture of compliance built upon the highest standards of ethics and integrity. Then Jon Taylor will review our results and other financial topics before we open it up for your questions.  
As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we are committed to taking decisive actions to rebuild our reputation and focus on the future and continuing to cooperate with the ongoing government investigations. We have begun discussions with the DOJ regarding the resolution of this matter, including the possibility of FirstEnergy entering into a deferred prosecution agreement. We can't currently predict the timing, outcome or the impact of the possible resolution with the DOJ. 
Our goal is to take a holistic and transparent approach with a range of stakeholders across the spectrum of matters under review. This approach is consistent with the changes we're making in our political and legislative engagement and advocacy. For example, we are stopping all contributions to 501(c)(4)s; we paused all other political disbursements, including from our political action committee; and we've limited our participation in the political process. We have also suspended and/or terminated various political consulting relationships.  
In addition, we'll be expanding our disclosures around political spending in order to provide increased transparency. For example, we have committed to post updates on our website on our corporate political activity, relationship with trade associations and our corporate political activity policy, which is under revision. A comprehensive and open approach is also the cornerstone in our regulatory activity.  
In Ohio, we continue taking proactive steps to reduce the regulatory uncertainty affecting our utilities in the state. This includes our decision in late March to credit our Ohio utility customers approximately $27 million. This comprises the revenues that were collected through the decoupling mechanism authorized under Ohio law plus interest, the partial settlement with the Ohio Attorney General to stop collections of decoupling revenues and our decision not to seek recovery of lost distribution revenues from our Ohio customers. Together, these actions fully address the requirements approved in Ohio House Bill 128 as well as the related rate impact of House Bill 6 on our customers. These are important steps to put this matter behind us.  
In other Ohio regulatory matters, we proactively updated our testimony in the ESP quadrennial review case to provide prospective seat values on an individual company basis. We are engaged in settlement discussions with interested parties on this matter as well as the 2017, 2018 and 2019 seat cases that were consolidated into this proceeding.  
During our last call, we mentioned that we were proactively engaging with our regulators to refund customers for certain vendor payments. Those conversations are underway in each affected jurisdiction. In Ohio, at the PUCO's request, the scope of our annual audit of Rider DCR has been expanded to include a review of these payments. 
Outside of Ohio, our state regulatory activity is concentrated on customer-focused initiatives that will support the transition to a cleaner climate. For example, on March 1, JCP&L filed a petition with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, seeking approval for its proposed EV-driven program. If approved, the 4-year $50 million program would offer incentives and rate structures to support the development of EV charging infrastructure throughout our New Jersey service territory, in an effort to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and provide benefits to our residential, commercial and industrial customers. And in late March, the Pennsylvania PUC approved our 5-year $390 million energy efficiency and conservation plan, which supports the PUC's consumption reduction targets.  
In other recent developments, last week, FERC approved our uncontested JCP&L forward-looking formula rate settlement without any modifications. In March, we closed the transaction to sell JCP&L's 50% interest in the Yards Creek pump storage hydro plant and received proceeds of $155 million. And we also announced plans to sell Penelec's Waverly, New York distribution assets, which serves about 3,800 customers to a local co-op. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, will simplify Penelec's business by solely focusing on Pennsylvania customers.  
During our fourth quarter call, we introduced you to FE Forward, our company-wide effort to transform FirstEnergy into a more resilient, effective industry leader, delivering superior customer value and shareholder returns. We expect the FE Forward initiatives to provide a more modern experience for our customers with efficiencies in operating and capital expenditures that can be strategically reinvested into our business, supporting our growth and investments in a smarter and cleaner electric grid, while also maintaining affordable electric bills. 
During the first phase of the project, we evaluated our processes, business practices and cultural norms to understand where we can improve. While our safety and reliability performance is strong, we found opportunities in many areas to enhance and automate processes, take a more strategic focus on operating expenditures and modernize experiences for our customers and employees. We've identified more than 300 opportunities and now we are diving deeper into these ideas, developing detailed executable plans as we prepare for implementation beginning later this quarter.  
Examples of this work include improving the planning and scheduling through integration of systems to allow our employees to deliver their best to our customers; leveraging advanced technologies such as drones and satellite imagery to improve our vegetation management programs; using predictive analytics and web-based tools to provide our customers with more self-service options and improve their experience; and leverage purchasing power to optimize payment terms. 
As part of these efforts, we intend to evaluate the appropriate cadence to initiate rate cases on a state-by-state basis to best support our customer-focused strategic priorities. We will also remain focused on emerging technologies, smart grid, electric vehicle infrastructure and our customers' evolving energy needs as we think through how to reduce our carbon footprint.  
We're off to a great start this year. And yesterday, we reaffirmed our 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. Our leadership team is committed to upholding our core values and behaviors and executing on our proven strategies as we put our customers at the center of everything we do. We will take the appropriate steps to deliver on our promise to make FirstEnergy a better company, one that is respected by our customers, the investment community, regulators and our employees.  
Thank you for your time and confidence. Now I'll turn the call over to John Somerhalder."

I'd like to start by sharing my impressions of FirstEnergy after almost 2 months in this role. This is a company with a firm foundation, including a commitment to improve in the area of governance and compliance, a commitment to customers by embracing innovation and technology to help ensure the strength, resilience and reliability of its transmission and distribution businesses, a deep-seated and strong safety culture and a strong potential to deliver significant value to investors through customer-focused growth.  
Since joining the team, I've been supporting senior leadership in advancing the company's priorities, strengthening our governance and compliance functions and enhancing our relationships with external stakeholders, including regulators and the financial community. Steve spoke about our business priorities. So I will focus my remarks today on our compliance work, including remedial actions.  
First, I'd like to update you on our internal investigation, which has revealed no new material issues since our last earnings call. The focus of the internal investigation has transitioned from a proactive investigation to continued cooperation with the ongoing government investigations. Management and the Board with the assistance of the Compliance Subcommittee of the Audit Committee have been working together to build a best-in-class compliance program. 
Through these efforts, we have identified improvement opportunities in 5 broad categories, including governance, risk management, training and communications, concerns management and third-party management. As part of these efforts, FirstEnergy is embracing a commitment to enhancing its compliance culture to be best-in-class. Some of the actions completed to date include hiring our Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, Hyun Park, in January; Antonio Fernandez, who joined as Vice President and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer last week; and myself. 
On the Board side, Jesse Lynn and Andrew Teno  joined us from Icahn Capital in March. And the Board has nominated a new independent member, Melvin Williams , for election at the Annual Shareholders Meeting when Sandy Pianalto's term ends next month. I believe the insights and experience of these new leaders are helping to round out a very committed and confident Board and management team.  
In March, the Board affirmed our confidence in Steve by naming him CEO. Steve has consistently demonstrated the integrity, leadership skills strategic acumen and deep knowledge of our businesses needed to position FirstEnergy for long-term success and stability. These changes, along with the Board's reinforcement of and the executive team's commitment to setting the appropriate tone at the top, will support a culture of compliance going forward. 
For instance, we recently held an event where the Chairman and the Chair of the Compliance Subcommittee addressed the company's top 140 leaders regarding the expectations to act with integrity in everything we do. Our legal department recently completed training on up-the-ladder reporting, and we have enhanced our onboarding process for new employees and for third parties on expectations around our code of business conduct. 
Over the course of the next few months, there will be many more steps the company will take to enhance our compliance program, such as continuing to build the new, more centralized compliance organization under Antonio's leadership; addressing our processes, policies and controls, which include additional oversight for political contributions; continuing to emphasize our values and expectations in ongoing communications with our employees; incorporating compliance into our goals and performance metrics and holding all employees regardless of title to the same standards; enhancing the channels for incident reporting and developing thorough and objective processes to investigate and address allegations of misconduct; and ensuring increased communications with and training of employees with respect to our commitment to ethical standards and integrity of our business procedures, compliance requirements, our code of business conduct and other company policies; and understanding and utilizing the process for reporting suspected violations of law or code of business conduct.  
We have also enhanced our internal controls around disbursements to require additional approvals, targeted reviews of any suspicious payments and a reassessment of approval levels across the entire company. Additionally, in the area of disbursements, we will update and clarify policies and procedures, conduct training and institute a regular audit program that reviews payments and services performed. 
A detailed list of the corrective actions we are taking can be found on Pages 8 and 9 of our first quarter fact book. Over the next several months, we expect to make significant progress in the areas of compliance led by Antonio's organization, where it will continue to be overseen by the Board and the newly established management steering committee for ethics and compliance. Through these efforts, we expect the material weakness associated with the tone at the top to be remediated by the time we file our fourth quarter earnings.  
Our leaders are continuing to elevate the importance of compliance and working to regain the trust of employees and our stakeholders by modeling appropriate behavior and consistently communicating that compliance and ethics are core values, just like safety. We are committed to ensuring that employees understand what is expected of them and are comfortable reporting ethical violations without fear of repercussions. By continually emphasizing the importance of compliance to our strategies and future as well as demonstrating that we are setting the right tone at the top, we strive to bolster confidence among our employees that the management team and the Board are taking the proper decisive actions to move the company forward. I believe we have learned a lot from recent challenges and are taking the right actions to emerge as a better, stronger company with a bright future.  
Now I'll turn the floor over to Jon Taylor for a review of first quarter results and a financial update."

Before I review the quarter, You have probably noticed a new look to the materials posted to our website. We have provided new disclosures in 3 main areas within our investor fact book: our steps to support a cleaner, smarter grid and the movement to more green and renewable resources; additional disclosures on our balance sheet, including our funds from operations target and the steps we're taking to achieve our goals; and third, enhanced ESG disclosures. Also note that we continue to provide more robust disclosures on ROEs, including more granular sensitivities. 
Yesterday, we announced GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share for the first quarter of 2021 and operating earnings of $0.69 per share, which was at the upper end of our guidance range. GAAP results for 2021 include 2 special items: regulatory charges related to customer refunds associated with previously collected Ohio decoupling revenues; and expenses associated with the investigation. 
In our distribution business, our results for the first quarter of this year as compared to 2020 reflect higher residential usage on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis as well as growth from incremental riders and rate increases, including DCR and grid modernization in Ohio, the distribution system improvement charge in Pennsylvania and the implementation of our base rate case settlement in New Jersey. These drivers were partially offset by $0.10 per share related to the absence of Ohio decoupling revenues and our decision to forgo the collection of lost distribution revenues from our residential and commercial customers. 
Our total distribution deliveries for the first quarter of 2021 decreased 2% on a weather-adjusted basis as compared to the last year, reflecting an increase in residential sales of 2% as customers continue to spend more time at home in the first quarter of 2021; a decline of 7% in commercial sales; and in our industrial class, first quarter load decreased 3%. It's worth noting that total distribution deliveries through the first quarter are consistent with our internal load forecast, with residential demand 2% higher versus our forecast, while industrial load is down 2%. 
In our Regulated Transmission business, earnings decreased as a result of higher net financing costs, which included an adjustment to previously capitalized interest, partially offset by the impact of rate base growth at our ATSI and MAIT subsidiaries. 
Finally, in our Corporate segment, results reflect lower operating expenses offset by the absence of a first quarter 2020 pension OPEB credit related to Energy Harbor's emergence from bankruptcy as well as higher interest expense. 
We are off to a solid start for the year and are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share for 2021. We've also introduced second quarter guidance of $0.48 to $0.58 per share. In addition, our strong focus on cash helped drive a $125 million increase in adjusted cash from operations and $185 million increase in free cash flow versus our internal plan for the first quarter. 
As to a couple of other financial updates, our 2021 debt financing plan remains on track. In March, FirstEnergy Transmission issued $500 million in senior notes and a strong, well-supported bond offering that showcase the strength of our transmission business. The deal was oversubscribed and on par with an investment-grade offering. We used the proceeds to repay $500 million in short-term borrowings under the FET revolving credit facility. In addition, we repaid $250 million at the FirstEnergy Holding Company. We also successfully issued $200 million in first mortgage bonds at Mon Power in April that was also very well supported. This supports our earlier commitment to reduce short-term borrowings as well as our goal to improve our credit metrics at FirstEnergy, return to investment grade as quickly as possible and maintain the strong credit ratings at our utilities. We continue to provide the rating agencies with regular updates on our business, and we are working with them to develop a clear outline of what is needed to return FirstEnergy to investment-grade credit ratings. 
Key milestones include governance and compliance changes at our company, resolution of the DOJ investigation and solid credit metrics. As to more longer-term financing needs through the execution of FE Forward, we have reduced our debt financing plan by approximately $1 billion through 2023, mainly at the FirstEnergy and FirstEnergy Transmission holding companies. Additionally, as we have previously mentioned, equity is an important part of our overall financing plan, with plans to raise up to $1.2 billion of equity over 2022 and 2023. As we said previously, we'll flex these plans as needed, and we are also exploring various alternatives to raise equity capital in a manner that could be more value-enhancing to all stakeholders. 
These actions, combined with new rates at JCP&L and our 60%-plus formula rate capital investment program, will generate $150 million to $200 million of incremental cash flow each year, while maintaining relatively flat adjusted debt levels through 2023, all of which will support our targeted 12% to 13% FFO to debt range. 
Turning to our pension, our funding status was 81% at March 31, up from 78% at the end of last year, resulting in a $500 million reduction in our unfunded pension obligation, which improves our adjusted debt position with the rating agencies. The extended funding time frame permitted under the American Rescue Plan, together with the modification of interest rate stabilization rules, means that we do not expect any funding requirements for the foreseeable future, assuming our plan achieves a 7.5% expected return on assets. Although we plan to make contributions into the pension next year, this legislation provides us with additional discretion and flexibility to make voluntary contributions as we assess our capital allocation plans. 
As Steve mentioned, discussions have begun with the Department of Justice. While no contingency has been reflected in our consolidated financial statements, we believe that it is probable we will incur a loss in connection with the resolution of this investigation. However, we cannot yet reasonably estimate the amount. 
Finally, last month, President Biden introduced the American Jobs Plan, which includes a corporate tax increase and proposed minimum tax as well as potential opportunities related to proposed infusion into the electric vehicle infrastructure and the energy grid. Clearly, it's very early in the process, but the corporate tax provision could be slightly cash positive for us if implemented in its current form. 
Our solid first quarter results and expectations for the year reflect our strong operating fundamentals and the continued success of our strategies to modernize and enhance our distribution and transmission systems. As we move our company forward, we are laser-focused on unlocking opportunities and increasing value for our shareholders, customers and employees.

We have -- being a fully regulated transmission and distribution company in a 5-state area with the diversity of assets that we have that may well be impacted, of course, in the transition in whatever form it takes to cleaner energy will certainly benefit our company. And I think we're well positioned for that. 
I believe there's other factors that will come into consideration as the administration goes through the necessary next steps. We have to have a very thoughtful transition embedded in this plan. There are economic impacts, potential reliability impacts for the T&D systems that we want to stay mindful of. And look, the issue is not going to go away. Climate and some of the planning in the United States is progressing forward, and we all have to do our part. 
As you look at the overall goals and you look at our ESG greenhouse gas reduction goals, we have already placed out there a goal of a 30% reduction in carbon from 2019 levels by the year 2030, and we are on our way to achieving that. And we have a carbon neutrality goal in 2050. So I think our goal, our business plan, our strategy is consistent with what the Biden administration proposed. But I think there's a lot of work to do to take it from a policy statement to on-the-ground improvements."

Thank you. When we look at the impact, if in fact, with this supplemental NOPR that FERC issued, which really maybe puts to rest this issue of the 50 basis point incentive that transmission organizations have been given for participation in RTOs. If we quantify that, it's probably between $0.04 and $0.05 for us on a total basis across all our transmission organizations. 
But I think it's also important to recognize this is just a supplemental notice of proposed rule making. It has to go through a comment, reply comment period, and then take FERC action. And I would also point out that at the same time, FERC really initiated a technical conference with respect to transmission incentives related to performance rate making, shared savings mechanisms in order to incent transmission. And that meeting is scheduled to occur in September of 2021. So I think there's some puts and takes on what may happen with transmission ROEs. And of course, as you might expect, we're going to stay very actively engaged in all of those discussions."

Yesterday afternoon, we reported second quarter earnings of $0.11 per share, which includes the impact of the deferred prosecution agreement that I'll discuss in a moment. Operating earnings were $0.59 per share, which is above the top end of our earnings guidance. These strong operational results reflect a customer-focused investment strategy in our regulated distribution and transmission businesses, solid financial discipline and the continued shift in higher weather-adjusted demand from our residential customers. 
We're pleased with our performance as well as a substantial progress we've made to transform FirstEnergy and position our company for the future. We have taken critical steps to build a best-in-class compliance program, while identifying and driving initiatives to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders. Our leadership team is committed to modeling the behaviors and the humility necessary to restore trust with our stakeholders. We look forward to continuing this work and achieving the milestones that will mark our progress. 
I'll start our call today with an update on the DOJ and other investigations related to House Bill 6, and John Somerhalder will join us for a brief discussion on Board activity and the progress of our compliance program. I'll come back to review recent business developments, and then Jon Taylor will discuss our second quarter results and other financial matters. before we open it up to your questions. 
Yesterday, we announced that we've entered into an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio to resolve the DOJ investigation into FirstEnergy. This deferred prosecution agreement was filed in federal court. Under the 3-year deferred prosecution agreement, we agreed to pay $230 million, which will be funded with cash on hand. Half of these funds is designated for the U.S. Treasury and the other half is being directed to the benefit of utility customers by the Ohio Development Service Agency. No portion of the fine will be recovered from customers. We also agreed to the government's single charge of honest services wire fraud, which will be eventually dismissed, provided we abide by all the terms of the agreement. 
In accordance with the agreement, we will provide regular reports to the government regarding our compliance program as well as internal controls and policies, and continued efforts to build on the comprehensive compliance initiatives we've rolled out this year. In its decision to defer prosecution, the U.S. Attorney's Office acknowledged our substantial cooperation with the investigation along with our significant remedial actions, which include establishing an executive director position at the Board level as well as a compliance-focused Board subcommittee; hiring a new Chief Legal Officer and a new Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer; working to establish a culture of ethics, integrity and accountability at every level of the organization; and reviewing and revising political activity and lobbying and consulting policies, which will include robust disclosures about our lobbying activities. 
The conduct that took place at our company was wrong and unacceptable. Our Board, the management team and the entire FirstEnergy organization have done extensive work and are committed to make the necessary changes to move on from this. Our progress on these efforts, along with the DPA, demonstrate that we are making meaningful headway in navigating through this period, and we are positioned to move forward as a stronger, integrity-bound organization. We will continue to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigations, audits and related matters as we work to resolve these issues and rebuild trust with our employees, customers, regulators and investors. We are intently focused on fostering a strong culture of compliance and ethics and assuring that we have robust processes in place designed to ensure that nothing like this happens again. 
In May, we held our first compliance town hall with employees to discuss what compliance, ethics and integrity mean at FirstEnergy, and the importance of building a culture of trust where everyone is comfortable with speaking up when something doesn't feel right. In the weeks following the town hall, our management team has responded to employee questions and concerns and we are committed to continuing this conversation and engagement. Next week, we plan to hold another town hall meeting with employees, where we will introduce our updated mission statement, reinforcing the role of uncompromising integrity as the cornerstone of FirstEnergy's identity and business strategies. We will also refresh our core values to better reflect the importance of integrity, together with safety, diversity, equity and inclusion, performance excellence and stewardship. These values will be embedded in our practices and processes and become ingrained in the way we work. Additionally, we updated our code of business conduct, which John Somerhalder, will speak to in a moment. 
We also continue to strengthen our leadership team with 2 more new hires. Michael Montaque joined us earlier this month as Vice President, Internal Audit. And yesterday, we announced that Soubhagya Parija has been named Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, effective August 16. These 2 experienced professionals represent another important step as we strengthen our key internal functions, and I'm confident that they will help us develop best-in-class audit and enterprise risk programs. 
Now John Somerhalder will join us to provide an update on Board matters and other facets of our compliance program. Then I'll be back to discuss FE Forward and review some regulatory updates."

Our progress with the DOJ builds on the substantial steps we have taken to enhance our Board, strengthen our leadership team, ensure we have a best-in-class compliance program and significantly modify our approach to political engagement as we work to regain the trust of our stakeholders. 
I'll start with a review of recent Board changes. As you know, Jesse Lynn and Andrew Teno joined the Board from Icon Capital in March, but they do not currently have voting rights, pending regulatory approval. I'm pleased to note that FERC approved our request for voting rights last week. The process in Maryland continues as we have communicated FERC's recent action to the commission. Melvin Williams was elected to the Board at our annual meeting in May and last month, we added 2 more independent directors: Lisa Winston Hicks and Paul Kaleta. Jesse, Melvin, Lisa and Paul comprise our Special Litigation Committee. This committee has full and binding authority to determine the company's action with respect to the pending shareholder derivative litigation. I'd also note that with the formation of the Special Litigation Committee, the Board has dissolved the Demand Review Committee. 
As previously discussed, the company's internal investigation has now been transitioned from a proactive to a response mode, and in light of the significant review investigation and related actions accomplished by the Independent Review Committee, the Board has also dissolved that committee. The many proactive actions taken by the Board and management over the past year have improved our governance and put us in a strong position to remediate the material weakness associated with our tone at the top, by the time we file our fourth quarter results. 
Over the last several quarters, we've talked a lot about the work we're doing to elevate our ethics and compliance program and reinforce our values and expectations with all employees. We continue to make timely progress in this area, and our new, more centralized compliance organization is taking shape under Antonio Fernandez, who joined the company in April as our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. Yesterday, we published our updated internal code of business conduct, The Power of Integrity, which will be supported by ongoing education around behaviors and the importance of reporting ethical violations. And we have continued to strengthen our policies, processes and internal controls, including those around 501(c)(4)s, other corporate engagement and advocacy, and business disbursements. 
While the transformation of our culture and our steps to restore trust with all stakeholders will be long-term endeavors, this team has started building a stronger company, built around the foundation of ethics, honesty and accountability. Now I'll turn it back to Steve."

The comprehensive assessment and recalibration of our ethics and compliance program has been running on a parallel path to FE Forward, our transformational effort to enhance value for all stakeholders by investing in modern and distinctive experiences that will improve the way we do business. We have improved our programmatic efforts to mature our ethics and compliance program into the FE Forward work. In this way, we can leverage FE Forward's rigor to implement changes quickly and efficiently, embed ethics and compliance into our operational culture and ensure we sustain a comprehensive transformation well into the future. 
FE Forward has entered its third phase, which is a full-scale effort to execute our implementation plans. The program is expected to deliver value and resilience, including cumulative free cash flow improvements of approximately $800 million from 2021 through 2023 and an annual run rate CapEx efficiencies of about $300 million in 2024 and beyond. At the same time, we expect the program to build on our strong operations and business fundamentals as we reinvest a portion of our efficiencies into strategic opportunities to better serve our customers, and support a smarter and cleaner electric grid. To ensure our organizational structure supports these improvements over the long term, we realigned our business units last month around 5 pillars: finance and strategy; human resources and corporate services; legal; operations; and customer experience. This new structure reflects a best-in-class model and supports operational excellence, clarity and decision-making, and accountability and less complexity. 
As part of this new organizational structure, we've created a customer experience function that will truly understand our customers' evolving expectations so we can develop solutions and drive benefits to customers. We've also created a new position, Vice President, Transformation to shepherd the FE Forward initiatives across our company, while also developing customer-focused emerging technology opportunities. The development of executable plans, a best-in-class compliance program and critical organizational changes will position the company to move forward in a positive sustainable direction. 
I'll just take a moment now and review recent regulatory matters, starting in Ohio. First, in July, the PUCO approved our filing to return approximately $27 million to our Ohio utility customers, representing all revenues that were previously collected through the decoupling mechanism plus interest. Our Ohio utilities have filed supplemental testimony in the quadrennial review of our ESP IV. We are committed to working with a broad range of parties in Ohio to resolve the range of issues that are still pending here. 
We held our first full-scale collaborative meeting on March 31 and have since received further feedback from participants. We are preparing for another collaborative meeting in the next few weeks. We are also working through regulatory audits in Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the FERC. Finally, in April, the New Jersey BPU approved JCP&L's 3-year $203 million energy efficiency and conservation plan, which includes a return on certain costs as well as the ability to recover lost distribution revenues. 
As for our financial results, we're pleased with our strong performance in the first half of the year. we are reaffirming our 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, and we expect to be at the top half of that range. We are also introducing third quarter guidance of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. We remain focused on executing our plans, maintaining our costs and building on this positive momentum. We are making substantial progress to transform FirstEnergy, live up to our values and deliver long-term value to all of our stakeholders. 
Thank you for your time. And now I'll turn the call over to Jon Taylor for a review of second quarter results and the financial update."

Yesterday, we announced GAAP earnings of $0.11 per share for the second quarter of 2021 and operating earnings of $0.59 per share. As Steve mentioned, this exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Special item",960,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced GAAP earnings of $0.11 per share for the second quarter of 2021 and operating earnings of $0.59 per share. As Steve mentioned, this exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Special items in the second quarter of 2021 include investigation and other related costs, which include the impact from the deferred prosecution agreement, as well as regulatory charges and state tax legislative changes. 
In our distribution business, 2021 second quarter results as compared to 2020 reflect growth from our capital investment programs, rate increases and lower expenses, primarily related to the absence of pandemic-related expenses we incurred in the second quarter of last year, partially offset by the absence of Ohio decoupling and lost distribution revenues in the second quarter of 2020, which we stopped collecting earlier this year. Total distribution deliveries increased on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis compared to the second quarter of 2020, when many of the pandemic-related restrictions were in full effect. However, the mix of customer usage resulted in a flat year-over-year earnings impact. 
Second quarter 2021 weather-adjusted residential sales were 6% lower than the same period last year, when many of our customers were under strict stay-at-home orders. However, as we look at trends, weather-adjusted residential usage over the past few quarters has been on average, about 4% higher than pre-pandemic levels, and in fact, the second quarter of this year was close to 8% higher than weather-adjusted usage we saw in the second quarter of 2019. We think more permanent work-from-home initiatives could impact our longer-term load forecast and we will be watching closely to see if this structural shift in our residential customer class continues. 
Weather-adjusted deliveries to commercial customers increased 8% and industrial load increased 11% as compared to the second quarter of 2020. Despite the increase in commercial activity this spring, weather-adjusted demand in this customer class continues to lag pre-pandemic levels by an average of about 6%. Looking at the industrial class, we are encouraged by the steady recovery in demand over the past year. In fact, this quarter, industrial load was only slightly down compared to the second quarter of 2019. We continue to see higher load from the shale gas industry, but that was offset by lower load in other industrial sectors such as steel, auto and mining, which have not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. 
In our Regulated Transmission segment, higher net financing costs in the second quarter of 2021, primarily related to our revolving credit facility borrowings, were more than offset by the impact of higher transmission investment at MAIT and ATSI related to our Energizing the Future program. Our transmission investments drove year-over-year rate base growth of 7%. And in our Corporate segment, results reflect the absence of discrete tax benefits recognized in the second quarter of 2020 and as well as higher interest expense. 
For the first half of 2021, operating earnings were $1.28 per share compared to $1.23 per share in the first half of 2020. This increase was the result of continued investments in our transmission and distribution systems, weather-related sales and lower expenses. And consistent with our second quarter results, the positive drivers for the first half of this year more than offset the absence of $0.13 of decoupling and lost distribution revenues that were recognized in the first half of 2020, but are no longer in place this year. Additionally, our continued focus on financial discipline, together with strong financial results, helped drive a $196 million increase in adjusted cash from operations versus our internal plan; and a $264 million increase above the first 6 months of last year, building on the improvements we noted on our first quarter earnings call. 
As for capital markets activity, we continue making good progress on this year's debt financing plan, with 5 of our 6 debt transactions complete, all with pricing similar to investment-grade companies. In May, we issued $150 million in senior notes at Toledo Edison and MAIT with pricing at 2.65% and 2.55%, respectively. And in June, we issued $500 million in senior notes at JCP&L that priced at 2.75%. 
In addition, we made progress on our commitment to reduce short-term debt during the second quarter by repaying $950 million under our revolving credit facilities, bringing our borrowings down to $500 million as of June 30. And earlier this week, we repaid the remaining $500 million under these facilities. While we did obtain a waiver for our credit facilities related to the DPA, this repayment was voluntary and not required by the bank group. We plan to operate on a normal course going forward and we'll utilize the revolving credit facilities on an as-needed basis as we have done historically. 
As you know, we have 2 revolving credit facilities, one for FE Corp., which is shared with our utility companies; and one for FET, both expiring in December of 2022. Over the next few months, we plan to work with our bank group to evaluate and refinance these bank facilities with the goal of completing this initiative before the end of the year. And finally, we continue to consider alternatives to our equity needs. We continue to think through options that include a minority sale of distribution and/or transmission assets, which would raise substantial proceeds and eliminate all of our expected non-SIP equity needs, ensure the execution of our balance sheet improvement plans and provide funding for strategic CapEx and customer-focused emerging technologies that support the transition to a cleaner electric grid. Based on our current time frame, we expect to provide you with an update in the fourth quarter. 
As always, thank you for your time and your interest in FirstEnergy. I'd be happy to take your questions."

And then just as a follow-up, media's reported Mon Power is the potential sale options. So can you maybe just confirm what states you see as noncore to the overall enterprise?

And so providing balance sheet support at an efficient cost is the #1 priority. 
With respect to the different assets. I'm not going to get into specifics, but I will tell you that we've made a tremendous amount of progress since the first quarter. We are getting more and more comfortable with a minority interest sale in one of our assets, and we're fairly confident that that's the right path forward. We think we can do this in a way that limits dilution to shareholders, but can raise a significant amount of capital that would eliminate all of our current equity needs it would achieve our priorities around the balance sheet, provide funding for additional CapEx opportunities, all acknowledging the fact that we have additional headwinds that we're going to face."

This is truly a humbling moment for our company in terms of the DPA, the accountability that we stepped up and took as a company. So we're humbled by it, but we do view it as a very positive step for the company, with many more steps down the path to restore confidence and trust. Along the way within the DPA, obviously, we paid a significant penalty for accountability. And we take that on and acknowledge that. We're also going to continue to stay very focused as a team to remain fully compliant with all the requirements of the DPA and fulfilling those requirements will be very, very important for us as well as continued cooperation with the DOJ. 
Globally, I believe this is really an inflection point, not only for me as the leader of the organization, but for our company in general. We have a great opportunity as we walk through this challenge, really to show that we can create a much better company and a much better path forward. So we're really looking forward to do that. And you will see that change and it will be at its center, having ethics and integrity at every level within this organization. So I just wanted to make those statements on the DPA. 
As it pertains to Ohio, it's a good question. We have a collaborative underway right now. We've had one meeting. We're hoping to organize another meeting within the next several weeks. So we want to respect that process and not speculate too much. But we're confident that we can make significant progress in terms of restoring trust and confidence in the regulatory process. So it's our hope that we can put everything that's on the collective agenda for the collaborative on the table, discuss it, deal with it and be able to come up with a reasonable solution. 
Relative to our ESP IV, our base rate case question that we get from time to time, I believe those are one of the elements that are on the table that we're very willing to discuss. I would also point back just a little bit hard to what we have accomplished in Ohio with regard to not pursuing lost distribution revenue, the refund of decoupling. We have the reestablishment of the 2024 base rate case requirement. And I think the DPA now that it's behind us, will open up more opportunities for a pathway forward in Ohio."

So we're excited about the infrastructure program that might be coming forward. We're excited about leveraging our transmission system and embracing renewables as they approach the system as an opportunity. 
On the distribution side of the house, I'm particularly excited about some of the programs that we have going on right now with smart grid, smart meter programs. I also believe that our company, as well as the utility industry, can play a central and key role relative to the infrastructure build-out for electric vehicles, battery storage and other emerging technologies. So I think that all represents a great opportunity for us. 
I also try to keep the customer in the center of that equation. So as these emerging technologies are lowering in costs, I think that's good for customers. And once again, I think a company like ours could install these technologies in the best way possible on the T&D system to maximize their value at a low cost."

Yesterday afternoon, we reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.11 per share, which includes the impact of the deferred prosecution agreement that I'll discuss in a moment. Operating earnings were $0.59 per share, which is above the top end of our earnings guidance. These strong operational results reflect a customer-focused investment strategy in our regulated distribution and transmission businesses, solid financial discipline and the continued shift in higher weather-adjusted demand from our residential customers.  
We're pleased with our performance as well as the substantial progress we've made to transform FirstEnergy and position our company for the future. We have taken critical steps to build a best-in-class compliance program, while identifying and driving initiatives to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders. Our leadership team is committed to modeling the behaviors and the humility necessary to restore trust with our stakeholders. We look forward to continuing this work and achieving the milestones that will mark our progress.  
I'll start our call today with an update on the DOJ and other investigations related to House Bill 6, and John Somerhalder will join us for a brief discussion on Board activity and the progress of our compliance program. I'll come back to review recent business developments, and then Jon Taylor will discuss our second quarter results and other financial matters before we open it up to your questions.  
Yesterday, we announced that we've entered into an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio to resolve the DOJ investigation into FirstEnergy. This deferred prosecution agreement was filed in federal court. Under the 3-year deferred prosecution agreement, we agreed to pay $230 million, which will be funded with cash on hand. Half of these funds is designated for the U.S. Treasury and the other half is being directed to the benefit of utility customers by the Ohio Development Service Agency. No portion of the fine will be recovered from customers. We also agreed to the government's single charge of honest services wire fraud, which will be eventually dismissed, provided we abide by all the terms of the agreement.  
In accordance with the agreement, we will provide regular reports to the government regarding our compliance program as well as internal controls and policies, and continued efforts to build on the comprehensive compliance initiatives we've rolled out this year. In its decision to defer prosecution, the U.S. Attorney's Office acknowledged our substantial cooperation with the investigation, along with our significant remedial actions, which include establishing an executive director position at the Board level as well as a compliance-focused Board subcommittee; hiring a new Chief Legal Officer and a new Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer; working to establish a culture of ethics, integrity and accountability at every level of the organization; and reviewing and revising political activity and lobbying and consulting policies, which will include robust disclosures about our lobbying activities.  
The conduct that took place at our company was wrong and unacceptable. Our Board, the management team and the entire FirstEnergy organization have done extensive work and are committed to make the necessary changes to move on from this. Our progress on these efforts, along with the DPA, demonstrate that we are making meaningful headway in navigating through this period, and we are positioned to move forward as a stronger, integrity-bound organization. 
We will continue to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigations, audits and related matters as we work to resolve these issues and rebuild trust with our employees, customers, regulators and investors. We are intently focused on fostering a strong culture of compliance and ethics and assuring that we have robust processes in place designed to ensure that nothing like this happens again.  
In May, we held our first compliance town hall with employees to discuss what compliance, ethics and integrity mean at FirstEnergy, and the importance of building a culture of trust where everyone is comfortable with speaking up when something doesn't feel right. In the weeks following the town hall, our management team has responded to employee questions and concerns, and we are committed to continuing this conversation and engagement. 
Next week, we plan to hold another town hall meeting with employees, where we will introduce our updated mission statement, reinforcing the role of uncompromising integrity as the cornerstone of FirstEnergy's identity and business strategies. We will also refresh our core values to better reflect the importance of integrity, together with safety, diversity, equity and inclusion, performance excellence and stewardship. These values will be embedded in our practices and processes and become ingrained in the way we work. Additionally, we updated our code of business conduct, which John Somerhalder will speak to in a moment.  
We also continue to strengthen our leadership team with 2 more new hires. Michael Montaque joined us earlier this month as Vice President, Internal Audit. And yesterday, we announced that Soubhagya Parija has been named Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, effective August 16. These 2 experienced professionals represent another important step as we strengthen our key internal functions, and I'm confident that they will help us develop best-in-class audit and enterprise risk programs.  
Now John Somerhalder will join us to provide an update on Board matters and other facets of our compliance program. Then I'll be back to discuss FE Forward and review some regulatory updates."

Our progress with the DOJ builds on the substantial steps we have taken to enhance our Board, strengthen our leadership team, ensure we have a best-in-class compliance program and significantly modify our approach to political engagement as we work to regain the trust of our stakeholders. 
I'll start with a review of recent Board changes. As you know, Jesse Lynn and Andrew Teno joined the Board from Icahn Capital in March, but they do not currently have voting rights, pending regulatory approval. I'm pleased to note that FERC approved our request for voting rights last week. The process in Maryland continues as we have communicated FERC's recent action to the commission. 
Melvin Williams was elected to the Board at our annual meeting in May and last month, we added 2 more independent directors: Lisa Winston Hicks and Paul Kaleta. Jesse, Melvin, Lisa and Paul comprise our Special Litigation Committee. This committee has full and binding authority to determine the company's action with respect to the pending shareholder derivative litigation. I'd also note that with the formation of the Special Litigation Committee, the Board has dissolved the Demand Review Committee.  
As previously discussed, the company's internal investigation has now been transitioned from a proactive to a response mode. And in light of the significant review investigation and related actions accomplished by the Independent Review Committee, the Board has also dissolved that committee. The many proactive actions taken by the Board and management over the past year have improved our governance and put us in a strong position to remediate the material weakness associated with our tone at the top by the time we file our fourth quarter results.  
Over the last several quarters, we've talked a lot about the work we're doing to elevate our ethics and compliance program and reinforce our values and expectations with all employees. We continue to make timely progress in this area, and our new, more centralized compliance organization is taking shape under Antonio Fernandez, who joined the company in April as our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. 
Yesterday, we published our updated internal code of business conduct, The Power of Integrity, which will be supported by ongoing education around behaviors and the importance of reporting ethical violations. And we have continued to strengthen our policies, processes and internal controls, including those around 501(c)(4)s, other corporate engagement and advocacy, and business disbursements.  
While the transformation of our culture and our steps to restore trust with all stakeholders will be long-term endeavors, this team has started building a stronger company, built around the foundation of ethics, honesty and accountability. Now I'll turn it back to Steve."

The comprehensive assessment and recalibration of our ethics and compliance program has been running on a parallel path to FE Forward, our transformational effort to enhance value for all stakeholders by investing in modern and distinctive experiences that will improve the way we do business. We have improved our programmatic efforts to mature our ethics and compliance program into the FE Forward work. In this way, we can leverage FE Forward's rigor to implement changes quickly and efficiently, embed ethics and compliance into our operational culture and ensure we sustain a comprehensive transformation well into the future.  
FE Forward has entered its third phase, which is a full-scale effort to execute our implementation plans. The program is expected to deliver value and resilience, including cumulative free cash flow improvements of approximately $800 million from 2021 through 2023, and an annual run rate CapEx efficiencies of about $300 million in 2024 and beyond. At the same time, we expect the program to build on our strong operations and business fundamentals as we reinvest a portion of our efficiencies into strategic opportunities to better serve our customers and support a smarter and cleaner electric grid.  
To ensure our organizational structure supports these improvements over the long term, we realigned our business units last month around 5 pillars: finance and strategy; human resources and corporate services; legal; operations; and customer experience. This new structure reflects a best-in-class model and supports operational excellence, clarity and decision-making and accountability and less complexity. 
As part of this new organizational structure, we've created a customer experience function that will truly understand our customers' evolving expectations so we can develop solutions and drive benefits to customers. We've also created a new position, Vice President, Transformation to shepherd the FE Forward initiatives across our company, while also developing customer-focused emerging technology opportunities. The development of the executable plans, a best-in-class compliance program and critical organizational changes will position the company to move forward in a positive sustainable direction.  
I'll just take a moment now and review recent regulatory matters, starting in Ohio. First, in July, the PUCO approved our filing to return approximately $27 million to our Ohio utility customers, representing all revenues that were previously collected through the decoupling mechanism plus interest. Our Ohio utilities have filed supplemental testimony in the quadrennial review of our ESP IV. We are committed to working with a broad range of parties in Ohio to resolve the range of issues that are still pending here.  
We held our first full-scale collaborative meeting on March 31 and have since received further feedback from participants. We are preparing for another collaborative meeting in the next few weeks. We are also working through regulatory audits in Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the FERC. Finally, in April, the New Jersey BPU approved JCP&L's 3-year $203 million energy efficiency and conservation plan, which includes a return on certain costs as well as the ability to recover lost distribution revenues.  
As for our financial results, we're pleased with our strong performance in the first half of the year. We are reaffirming our 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, and we expect to be at the top half of that range. We are also introducing third quarter guidance of $0.70 to $0.80 per share. We remain focused on executing our plans, maintaining our costs and building on this positive momentum. We are making substantial progress to transform FirstEnergy, live up to our values and deliver long-term value to all of our stakeholders.  
Thank you for your time. And now I'll turn the call over to Jon Taylor for a review of second quarter results and the financial update."

Yesterday, we announced GAAP earnings of $0.11 per share for the second quarter of 2021 and operating earnings of $0.59 per share. As Steve mentioned, this exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Special item",959,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced GAAP earnings of $0.11 per share for the second quarter of 2021 and operating earnings of $0.59 per share. As Steve mentioned, this exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Special items in the second quarter of 2021 include investigation and other related costs, which include the impact from the deferred prosecution agreement, as well as regulatory charges and state tax legislative changes.  
In our distribution business, 2021 second quarter results, as compared to 2020, reflect growth from our capital investment programs, rate increases and lower expenses, primarily related to the absence of pandemic-related expenses we incurred in the second quarter of last year, partially offset by the absence of Ohio decoupling and lost distribution revenues in the second quarter of 2020, which we stopped collecting earlier this year. Total distribution deliveries increased on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis compared to the second quarter of 2020, when many of the pandemic-related restrictions were in full effect. However, the mix of customer usage resulted in a flat year-over-year earnings impact.  
Second quarter 2021 weather-adjusted residential sales were 6% lower than the same period last year, when many of our customers were under strict stay-at-home orders. However, as we look at trends, weather-adjusted residential usage over the past few quarters has been, on average, about 4% higher than pre-pandemic levels, and in fact, the second quarter of this year was close to 8% higher than weather-adjusted usage we saw in the second quarter of 2019. We think more permanent work-from-home initiatives could impact our longer-term load forecast, and we'll be watching closely to see if this structural shift in our residential customer class continues.  
Weather-adjusted deliveries to commercial customers increased 8% and industrial load increased 11% as compared to the second quarter of 2020. Despite the increase in commercial activity this spring, weather-adjusted demand in this customer class continues to lag pre-pandemic levels by an average of about 6%.
Looking at the industrial class, we are encouraged by the steady recovery in demand over the past year. In fact, this quarter, industrial load was only slightly down compared to the second quarter of 2019. We continue to see higher load from the shale gas industry, but that was offset by lower load in other industrial sectors such as steel, auto and mining, which have not fully recovered to pre-pandemic level .
In our Regulated Transmission segment, higher net financing costs in the second quarter of 2021, primarily related to our revolving credit facility borrowings, were more than offset by the impact of higher transmission investment at MAIT and ATSI related to our Energizing the Future program. Our transmission investments drove year-over-year rate base growth of 7%. And in our Corporate segment, results reflect the absence of discrete tax benefits recognized in the second quarter of 2020, as well as higher interest expense.  
For the first half of 2021, operating earnings were $1.28 per share compared to $1.23 per share in the first half of 2020. This increase was the result of continued investments in our transmission and distribution systems, weather-related sales and lower expenses. And consistent with our second quarter results, the positive drivers for the first half of this year more than offset the absence of $0.13 of decoupling and lost distribution revenues that were recognized in the first half of 2020 but are no longer in place this year. 
Additionally, our continued focus on financial discipline, together with strong financial results, helped drive a $196 million increase in adjusted cash from operations versus our internal plan; and a $264 million increase above the first 6 months of last year, building on the improvements we noted on our first quarter earnings call.  
As for capital markets activity, we continue making good progress on this year's debt financing plan, with 5 of our 6 debt transactions complete, all with pricing similar to investment-grade companies. In May, we issued $150 million in senior notes at Toledo Edison and MAIT, with pricing at 2.65% and 2.55%, respectively. And in June, we issued $500 million in senior notes at JCP&L that's priced at 2.75%.  
In addition, we made progress on our commitment to reduce short-term debt during the second quarter by repaying $950 million under our revolving credit facilities, bringing our borrowings down to $500 million as of June 30. And earlier this week, we repaid the remaining $500 million under these facilities. While we did obtain a waiver for our credit facilities related to the DPA, this repayment was voluntary and not required by the bank group. We plan to operate on a normal course going forward and we'll utilize the revolving credit facilities on an as-needed basis as we have done historically.  
As you know, we have 2 revolving credit facilities, one for FE Corp., which is shared with our utility companies; and one for FET, both expiring in December of 2022. Over the next few months, we plan to work with our bank group to evaluate and refinance these bank facilities with the goal of completing this initiative before the end of the year. 
And finally, we continue to consider alternatives to our equity needs. We continue to think through options that include a minority sale of distribution and/or transmission assets, which would raise substantial proceeds and eliminate all of our expected non-SIP equity needs, ensure the execution of our balance sheet improvement plans and provide funding for strategic CapEx and customer-focused emerging technologies that support the transition to a cleaner electric grid. Based on our current time frame, we expect to provide you with an update in the fourth quarter.  
As always, thank you for your time and your interest in FirstEnergy. I'd be happy to take your questions."

I mean have your base, I guess, equity needs increased? 
And then just as a follow-up, media has reported Mon Power as the potential sale option. So can you maybe just confirm what states you see as noncore to the overall enterprise? And how we should maybe think about potential sizing of a smaller utility like Mon Power versus a minority stake versus a potential larger optimization like, just saying, JCP&L as an example?"

We likely will face some additional headwinds with different types of litigation. We got some things cooking in Ohio that we need to deal with. And so providing balance sheet support at an efficient cost is the #1 priority. 
With respect to the different assets, I'm not going to get into specifics, but I will tell you that we've made a tremendous amount of progress since the first quarter. We are getting more and more comfortable with a minority interest sale in one of our assets, and we're fairly confident that that's the right path forward. We think we can do this in a way that limits dilution to shareholders, but can raise a significant amount of capital that would eliminate all of our current equity needs. It would achieve our priorities around the balance sheet, provide funding for additional CapEx opportunities, all acknowledging the fact that we have additional headwinds that we're going to face."

I think I'm going to start just with a few comments on the DPA, and then quickly move to Ohio. This is truly a humbling moment for our company in terms of the DPA, the accountability that we stepped up and took as a company. So we're humbled by it, but we do view it as a very positive step for the company, with many more steps down the path to restore confidence and trust. 
Along the way within the DPA, obviously, we paid a significant penalty for accountability. And we take that on and acknowledge that. We're also going to continue to stay very focused as a team to remain fully compliant with all the requirements of the DPA and fulfilling those requirements will be very, very important for us as well as continued cooperation with the DOJ. 
Globally, I believe this is really an inflection point, not only for me as the leader of the organization, but for our company in general. We have a great opportunity as we walk through this challenge, really to show that we can create a much better company and a much better path forward. So we're really looking forward to do that. And you will see that change, and it will be at its center, having ethics and integrity at every level within this organization. So I just wanted to make those statements on the DPA. 
As it pertains to Ohio, it's a good question. We have a collaborative underway. Right now, we've had one meeting. We're hoping to organize another meeting within the next several weeks. So we want to respect that process and not speculate too much. But we're confident that we can make significant progress in terms of restoring trust and confidence in the regulatory process. So it's our hope that we can put everything that's on the collective agenda for the collaborative on the table, discuss it, deal with it and be able to come up with a reasonable solution. 
Relative to our ESP IV, our base rate case question that we get from time to time, I believe those are one of the elements that are on the table that we're very willing to discuss. I would also point back just a little bit, Shar, to what we have accomplished in Ohio with regard to not pursuing lost distribution revenue, the refund of decoupling. We have the reestablishment of the 2024 base rate case requirement. And I think the DPA, now that it's behind us, will open up more opportunities for a pathway forward in Ohio."

On the distribution side of the house, I'm particularly excited about some of the programs that we have going on right now with smart grid, smart meter programs. I also believe that our company, as well as the utility industry, can play a central and key role relative to the infrastructure build-out for electric vehicles, battery storage and other emerging technologies. So I think that all represents a great opportunity for us. 
I also try to keep the customer in the center of that equation. So as these emerging technologies are lowering in costs, I think that's good for customers.

We had another strong quarter, and I'm excited to talk to you about our progress on many different fronts. 
Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share. Our operating earnings were $0.82 per share, which is above the top end of our guidance range. 
Our customer-focused strategies, positive mix of weather-adjusted load, great operational performance and financial discipline continue to drive solid results. Furthermore, I'm proud of our progress to resolve important legacy issues and strengthen all aspects of our company. 
In Ohio, we continue to take a collaborative approach, and we're engaged in settlement discussions with a broad range of parties to resolve several of our pending cases before the PUCO. Our meetings continue to be productive, and we're making good progress. We are also making progress on the Ohio corporate separation, DMR and DCR audits. The corporate separation audit report was filed on September 13 and showed no findings of major noncompliance. The expanded DCR audit report is due by November 19. And we continue to work through the DMR audit, which is now due on December 16. 
Since our last earnings call, we've taken additional steps to strengthen our compliance program and instill a culture focused on ethics, integrity and accountability across our organization. These include: a new compliance and ethics program charter and policies in multiple areas; instructor-led Business Code of Conduct Awareness training for senior leadership and individuals with significant roles in our control environment; training on the concepts of our new internal Code of Conduct for everyone in leadership, with training for all employees planned in the first quarter of 2022; and publishing our new corporate engagement report. 
Additionally, we have started to develop a new integrated risk management platform to enhance our ethics and compliance, audit and risk functions. The new tool will help us streamline case management of ethics and compliance concerns, manage the life cycle of corporate policies, assess and respond to risks, and report on our compliance with internal controls and regulatory requirements across the organization. 
As we've discussed, over the last 12 months, our Board and management team acted quickly and decisively, adding additional independent board members, making changes in our management structure, establishing effective controls, reinforcing our culture change, and building a best-in-class ethics and compliance program. Our relentless focus in these areas resulted in remediation of the material weakness in internal controls associated with our tone at the top. 
While this is an important step, we continue driving these cultural changes and keeping compliance and integrity at the center of everything we do. We are working every day to continue rebuilding stakeholder trust and confidence in FirstEnergy and to ensure that our employees can be proud of our company and our mission. 
Yesterday, we announced another key hire to enhance our leadership team. Camilo Serna will join FirstEnergy on November 8 as our new Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs. Camilo brings a great depth of experience, developing and implementing state and federal regulatory strategies. His experience will be invaluable as we build a smarter electric grid and support the transition to a cleaner energy future. 
We continued taking steps to achieve these goals. For example, last month, JCP&L submitted a proposal to PJM and the New Jersey BPU for transmission investments that would connect clean energy generated from the state's offshore wind farms to the power grid, while minimizing the impact on the environment and communities. We expect a decision on this proposal, which supports the clean energy investments driven by the New Jersey Energy Master Plan in the second half of 2022. 
In West Virginia, we recognize our responsibility to operate our 2 regulated fossil plants for the benefit of our customers in the state. Later this year, we intend to file an effluent limitation guideline or ELG plan that calls for additional capital expenditures at the 2 plants to comply with environmental rules and to ensure that they can continue to operate beyond 2028. 
At the same time, we intend to begin discussing with stakeholders our plans for a timely clean energy transition. As a part of that transition, later this year, we plan to file with the West Virginia Public Service Commission for 50 megawatts of utility scale solar generation. 
Our wind connection and solar proposals support core components of our climate strategy, building a more climate-resilient energy system that meets our customers' changing needs, enables the transition to a carbon-neutral economy and powers a sustainable and prosperous future for our stakeholders. 
In the other recent regulatory activity, this month, our ATSI transmission subsidiary reached a settlement with parties to a FERC proceeding that will address legacy issues associated with ATSI's move from MISO to PJM in 2011 and provide for partial recovery of the MISO transmission project costs that will be allocated to ATSI in the future. 
It's an exciting time for our company. We have a robust long-term pipeline to modernize our transmission network, and we plan to continue embracing renewables. In our distribution business, we're incorporating emerging smart technologies and building a technologically advanced distribution platform. And our industry will play a key role in the infrastructure build-out for electric vehicles, battery storage and other technologies. 
We're pleased with our strong performance through the first 9 months of 2021. As we close out the year, we are raising and narrowing our operating earnings guidance from $2.40 to $2.60 per share to $2.55 to $2.65 per share. The midpoint of this range represents a 9% increase over 2020 operating earnings results. 
Finally, I can't pass the call over to Jon without acknowledging that it's been one year since I stepped into my leadership role under very sobering circumstances. It's been a challenging year on many fronts. And I want to publicly thank our employees for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our customers. I continue to be impressed by the grit and the resilience of the entire team. Together, we are building positive, sustainable momentum, and creating a new FirstEnergy that is a forward thinking and industry-leading company. 
Thank you for your attention this morning. Now Jon will provide a review of third quarter results and a financial update."

Yesterday, we announced GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share for the third quarter of 2021 and operating earnings of $0.82 per share. As Steve mentioned, this exceeded the top end of our guidance range. 
In our distribution business, results for the third quarter of 2021 as compared to last year reflect the absence of Ohio decoupling and lost distribution revenue, which totaled $0.04 per share, as well as lower weather-related usage. These were partially offset by higher revenues from our capital investment programs, new rates from our JCP&L distribution base rate case and lower operating expenses. 
Consistent with the trends we've discussed over the last few quarters, total distribution deliveries increased on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis compared to the third quarter of 2020. While weather was hotter than normal in our region this summer, it was cooler in the third quarter of 2020. 
Weather-adjusted residential sales for the third quarter of 2021 were essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2020 as many of our customers continued to work from home. Comparing our results to the pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of 2019, weather-adjusted residential usage was nearly 6% higher this quarter. 
While the commercial and industrial classes have not yet recovered to levels we saw before the pandemic, they are starting to trend in the right direction. Weather-adjusted commercial deliveries increased 3% while industrial load was up nearly 4% compared to the third quarter of 2020. Industrial load increased in most of the sectors in our service territory this quarter, led by steel, chemical and fabricated metal. 
In our regulated transmission business, we continue to see benefits from higher transmission investments at our MAIT and ATSI subsidiaries as part of our Energizing the Future program. However, this was offset by higher interest from the debt issuance at FET earlier this year and a prior year formula rate true-up. And in the Corporate segment, results reflect lower O&M and benefit expenses. 
For the first 9 months of 2021, operating earnings were $2.10 per share compared to $2.07 per share in the first 9 months of 2020. The increase was driven by our ongoing investments in our distribution and transmission systems, higher weather-related usage and lower expenses. These items more than offset the $0.17 of decoupling and lost distribution revenues recognized in the first 9 months of 2020. 
Our strong results and financial discipline have resulted in year-to-date adjusted cash from operations of $2.4 billion, which represents an increase of $600 million versus last year. While we expect a few offsets in the fourth quarter, we now expect cash from operations of approximately $2.8 billion for the year, which includes approximately $300 million of investigation and other related costs. The largest of which is associated with the $230 million EPA settlement. 
Earlier this month, we successfully restructured our revolving credit facilities from a 2-facility model to 6, fulfilling our commitment to complete this action before the end of the year. The 2021 credit facilities provide for aggregate commitments of $4.5 billion and are available until October of 2026, with 2 separate 1-year extensions. The credit facilities and their sublimits are detailed in the strategic and financial highlights. 
We are also pleased that following the restructuring of these facilities, S&P issued a one notch upgrade to the 10 distribution companies and the 3 transmission companies. While we're glad to return to investment-grade ratings for these companies with all 3 rating agencies, we remain committed to improving our balance sheet and the overall credit profile at the parent company. 
We previously communicated that we were targeting FFO to debt in the 12% to 13% range. We're raising that target to be solidly at 13%, which will provide ample cushion to the new Moody's threshold of 12%. And we expect to set the company on a firm glide path to mid-teens. 
On a number of recent calls, we've communicated that we're contemplating a minority asset sale as we consider alternatives to raise equity capital. Currently, we are engaged in a process to sell a minority interest in our transmission holding company, FirstEnergy Transmission, which owns ATSI, MAIT and TrAILCo. The interest is very strong and preliminary indications are very supportive of our financial plan and targets. But given where we are in the process, we can't comment any further on the details. 
We continue to evaluate all options to raise equity capital in an efficient manner to support our longer-term outlook, which includes traditional rate base growth and formula rate investments, planned rate case activity, and incremental and strategic CapEx that supports the transition to a cleaner electric grid. We are optimistic that we'll be in a position to share our overall financing plan and our longer-term outlook within the next couple of weeks. In fact, you may have noticed that we've expanded the information in the appendix of our strategic and financial highlights document. Given the current status of the proposed asset sale, we recognize that the fact book will be more relevant once we can include the outcome from that transaction. 
During the fourth quarter, we expect to provide you with 2022 guidance and a detailed capital plan, along with the runway of our FFO to debt target, longer-term capital forecasts, and targeted rate base and earnings growth rates. 
As always, thank you for your time and your interest in FirstEnergy. I'll be happy to take your questions."

So I see that moving ahead. 
Beyond the offshore wind, I believe, as we seek and end up receiving greater clarity on the clean energy transition that the U.S. is going to continue to move ahead on, I think that's going to provide us great opportunities both in the T&D environment to continue to invest and embrace renewables. And we're certainly very excited about that opportunity beyond that. It's also taking emerging technologies that are coming towards us that are much more affordable for customers, such as smart meter and other items, in which we're going to prepare a T&D platform for renewables over time. And I think those opportunities not only exist on the transmission system, but they exist in each one of our jurisdictions. 
So I think it's very -- we've talked about this before. It's very important that we keep the customer in the center of that equation in which we can enrich the value we're providing them, but we keep affordability in mind.

And I think that will provide a greater opportunity to invest into the future. 
And once again, I think all of these pieces, while we can't be more definitive today, I think they're starting to align nicely. Not only the minority stake consideration working towards some type of settlement in Ohio that once again will help our business and relieve some level of uncertainty out in the market, I think all of these pieces are starting to work forward very nicely. 
Our main concern is we continue to do that is -- just to make sure that we keep our company between the guard rail, so to speak. We have to continue to execute. We've got to continue to keep our employees and the public safe, be concerned with our reliability, ensure that financially that we're performing not only for shareholders, but all stakeholders. And we feel very good about where we're at right now, even though, as I said earlier, we have work to do."

Our op",1044,"Thank you, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We had another strong quarter, and I'm excited to talk to you about our progress on many different fronts.
Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share. Our operating earnings were $0.82 per share, which is above the top end of our guidance range. Our customer-focused strategies, positive mix of weather-adjusted load, great operational performance and financial discipline continue to drive solid results. Furthermore, I'm proud of our progress to resolve important legacy issues and strengthen all aspects of our company.
In Ohio, we continue to take a collaborative approach, and we're engaged in settlement discussions with a broad range of parties to resolve several of our pending cases before the PUCO. Our meetings continue to be productive, and we're making good progress. We are also making progress on the Ohio corporate separation, DMR and DCR audits. The corporate separation audit report was filed on September 13 and showed no findings of major noncompliance. The expanded DCR audit report is due by November 19. And we continue to work through the DMR audit, which is now due on December 16.
Since our last earnings call, we've taken additional steps to strengthen our compliance program and instill a culture focused on ethics, integrity and accountability across our organization. These include: a new Compliance & Ethics Program Charter and policies in multiple areas; instructor-led business Code of Conduct awareness training for senior leadership and individuals with significant roles in our control environment; training on the concepts of our new internal Code of Conduct for everyone in leadership, with training for all employees planned in the first quarter of 2022; and publishing our new corporate engagement report.
Additionally, we have started to develop a new integrated risk management platform to enhance our ethics and compliance, audit and risk functions. The new tool will help us streamline case management of ethics and compliance concerns, manage the life cycle of corporate policies, assess and respond to risks, and report on our compliance with internal controls and regulatory requirements across the organization.
As we've discussed, over the last 12 months, our Board and management team acted quickly and decisively, adding additional independent board members, making changes in our management structure, establishing effective controls, reinforcing our culture change and building a best-in-class ethics and compliance program. Our relentless focus in these areas resulted in remediation of the material weakness in internal controls associated with our tone at the top. 
While this is an important step, we continue driving these cultural changes and keeping compliance and integrity at the center of everything we do. We are working every day to continue rebuilding stakeholder trust and confidence in FirstEnergy and to ensure that our employees can be proud of our company and our mission.
Yesterday, we announced another key hire to enhance our leadership team. Camilo Serna will join FirstEnergy on November 8 as our new Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs. Camilo brings a great depth of experience, developing and implementing state and federal regulatory strategies. His experience will be invaluable as we build a smarter electric grid and support the transition to a cleaner energy future.
We continue taking steps to achieve these goals. For example, last month, JCP&L submitted a proposal to PJM and the New Jersey BPU for transmission investments that would connect clean energy generated from the state's offshore wind farms to the power grid, while minimizing the impact on the environment and communities. We expect a decision on this proposal, which supports the clean energy investments driven by the New Jersey Energy Master Plan in the second half of 2022.
In West Virginia, we recognize our responsibility to operate our 2 regulated fossil plants for the benefit of our customers in the state. Later this year, we intend to file an effluent limitation guideline, or ELG plan, that calls for additional capital expenditures at the 2 plants to comply with environmental rules and to ensure that they can continue to operate beyond 2028.
At the same time, we intend to begin discussing with stakeholders our plans for a timely clean energy transition. As a part of that transition, later this year, we plan to file with the West Virginia Public Service Commission for 50 megawatts of utility scale solar generation.
Our wind connection and solar proposals support core components of our climate strategy, building a more climate-resilient energy system that meets our customers' changing needs, enables the transition to a carbon-neutral economy and powers a sustainable and prosperous future for our stakeholders.
In the other recent regulatory activity, this month, our ATSI transmission subsidiary reached a settlement with parties to a FERC proceeding that will address legacy issues associated with ATSI's move from MISO to PJM in 2011 and provide for partial recovery of the MISO transmission project costs that will be allocated to ATSI in the future.
It's an exciting time for our company. We have a robust long-term pipeline to modernize our transmission network, and we plan to continue embracing renewables. In our distribution business, we're incorporating emerging smart technologies and building a technologically advanced distribution platform. And our industry will play a key role in the infrastructure build-out for electric vehicles, battery storage and other technologies.
We're pleased with our strong performance through the first 9 months of 2021. As we close out the year, we are raising and narrowing our operating earnings guidance from $2.40 to $2.60 per share to $2.55 to $2.65 per share. The midpoint of this range represents a 9% increase over 2020 operating earnings results.
Finally, I can't pass the call over to Jon without acknowledging that it's been one year since I stepped into my leadership role under very sobering circumstances. It's been a challenging year on many fronts. And I want to publicly thank our employees for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our customers. I continue to be impressed by the grit and the resilience of the entire team. Together, we are building positive, sustainable momentum, and creating a new FirstEnergy that is a forward thinking and industry-leading company.
Thank you for your attention this morning. Now Jon will provide a review of third quarter results and a financial update."

Yesterday, we announced GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share for the third quarter of 2021 and operating earnings of $0.82 per share. As Steve mentioned, this exceeded the top end of our guidance range.
In our distribution business, results for the third quarter of 2021 as compared to last year reflect the absence of Ohio decoupling and lost distribution revenue, which totaled $0.04 per share as well as lower weather-related usage. These were partially offset by higher revenues from our capital investment programs, new rates from our JCP&L distribution base rate case and lower operating expenses.
Consistent with the trends we've discussed over the last few quarters, total distribution deliveries increased on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis compared to the third quarter of 2020. While weather was hotter than normal in our region this summer, it was cooler in the third quarter of 2020.
Weather-adjusted residential sales for the third quarter of 2021 were essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2020 as many of our customers continue to work from home. Comparing our results to the pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of 2019, weather-adjusted residential usage was nearly 6% higher this quarter.
While the commercial and industrial classes have not yet recovered to levels we saw before the pandemic, they are starting to trend in the right direction. Weather-adjusted commercial deliveries increased 3% while industrial load was up nearly 4% compared to the third quarter of 2020. Industrial load increased in most of the sectors in our service territory this quarter, led by steel, chemical and fabricated metal.
In our regulated transmission business, we continue to see benefits from higher transmission investments at our MAIT and ATSI subsidiaries as part of our Energizing the Future program. However, this was offset by higher interest from the debt issuance at FET earlier this year and a prior year formula rate true-up. And in the Corporate segment, results reflect lower O&M and benefit expenses.
For the first 9 months of 2021, operating earnings were $2.10 per share compared to $2.07 per share in the first 9 months of 2020. The increase was driven by our ongoing investments in our distribution and transmission systems, higher weather-related usage and lower expenses. These items more than offset the $0.17 of decoupling and lost distribution revenues recognized in the first 9 months of 2020.
Our strong results and financial discipline have resulted in year-to-date adjusted cash from operations of $2.4 billion, which represents an increase of $600 million versus last year. While we expect a few offsets in the fourth quarter, we now expect cash from operations of approximately $2.8 billion for the year, which includes approximately $300 million of investigation and other related costs, the largest of which is associated with the $230 million EPA settlement.
Earlier this month, we successfully restructured our revolving credit facilities from a 2-facility model to 6, fulfilling our commitment to complete this action before the end of the year. The 2021 credit facilities provide for aggregate commitments of $4.5 billion and are available until October of 2026, with 2 separate 1-year extensions. The credit facilities and their sublimits are detailed in the strategic and financial highlights.
We are also pleased that following the restructuring of these facilities, S&P issued a one notch upgrade to the 10 distribution companies and the 3 transmission companies. While we're glad to return to investment-grade ratings for these companies with all 3 rating agencies, we remain committed to improving our balance sheet and the overall credit profile at the parent company.
We previously communicated that we were targeting FFO to debt in the 12% to 13% range. We're raising that target to be solidly at 13%, which will provide ample cushion to the new Moody's threshold of 12%. And we expect to set the company on a firm glide path to mid-teens.
On a number of recent calls, we've communicated that we're contemplating a minority asset sale as we consider alternatives to raise equity capital. Currently, we are engaged in a process to sell a minority interest in our transmission holding company, FirstEnergy Transmission, which owns ATSI, MAIT and TrAILCo. The interest is very strong and preliminary indications are very supportive of our financial plan and targets. But given where we are in the process, we can't comment any further on the details.
We continue to evaluate all options to raise equity capital in an efficient manner to support our longer-term outlook, which includes traditional rate base growth and formula rate investments, planned rate case activity, and incremental and strategic CapEx that supports the transition to a cleaner electric grid. We are optimistic that we'll be in a position to share our overall financing plan and our longer-term outlook within the next couple of weeks. In fact, you may have noticed that we've expanded the information in the appendix of our strategic and financial highlights document. Given the current status of the proposed asset sale, we recognize that the fact book will be more relevant once we can include the outcome from that transaction.
During the fourth quarter, we expect to provide you with 2022 guidance and a detailed capital plan, along with the runway of our FFO-to-debt target, longer-term capital forecasts, and targeted rate base and earnings growth rates.
As always, thank you for your time and your interest in FirstEnergy. I'll be happy to take your questions."

Our commercial and industrial loads, they're basically demand-based. And we see commercial and industrial coming back to normal slowly. But right now, we're trying to figure out whether or not they'll get to pre-pandemic levels. So that's kind of the ongoing assumptions that we're working on.

So I see that moving ahead.
Beyond the offshore wind, I believe, as we seek and end up receiving greater clarity on the clean energy transition that the U.S. is going to continue to move ahead on, I think that's going to provide us great opportunities both in the T&D environment to continue to invest and embrace renewables. And we're certainly very excited about that opportunity. Beyond that, it's also taking emerging technologies that are coming towards us that are much more affordable for customers, such as smart meter and other items, in which we're going to prepare a T&D platform for renewables over time. And I think those opportunities not only exist on the transmission system, but they exist in each one of our jurisdictions.
So I think it's very -- we've talked about this before. It's very important that we keep the customer in the center of that equation in which we can enrich the value we're providing them, but we keep affordability in mind.

And the way I like to think about that is, look, our company has faced significant uncertainty in the last 18-month period. And we've done what is prudent in terms of just ensuring that we can maintain financial flexibility in the present tense and then increase it in the future tense, if you will. And I think we've done a very good job of managing that.
I believe our transmission investment opportunities, while we curtailed them slightly this year, I think you'll see us continue to ramp that up incrementally just to make sure also that we stay within our sweet spot within that. In other words, we don't want to go too far in terms of burdening customers in terms of cost. But once again, we are seeing continued reliability improvement. So I think that's really important for us.
When you factor in the potential for a minority stake sale within the transmission business, I think that's only going to, if executed, fortify our company moving ahead, strengthen our business platform, strengthen our balance sheet. And I think that will provide a greater opportunity to invest into the future.
And once again, I think all of these pieces, while we can't be more definitive today, I think they're starting to align nicely. Not only the minority stake consideration working towards some type of settlement in Ohio that once again will help our business and relieve some level of uncertainty out in the market, I think all of these pieces are starting to work forward very nicely.
Our main concern is we continue to do that is -- just to make sure that we keep our company between the guardrail, so to speak. We have to continue to execute. We've got to continue to keep our employees and the public safe, be concerned with our reliability, ensure that financially that we're performing not only for shareholders, but all stakeholders. And we feel very good about where we're at right now, even though, as I said earlier, we have work to do."

Our op",1043,"Thank you, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We had another strong quarter, and I'm excited to talk to you about our progress on many different fronts.
Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share. Our operating earnings were $0.82 per share, which is above the top end of our guidance range. Our customer-focused strategies, positive mix of weather-adjusted load, great operational performance and financial discipline continue to drive solid results. Furthermore, I'm proud of our progress to resolve important legacy issues and strengthen all aspects of our company.
In Ohio, we continue to take a collaborative approach, and we're engaged in settlement discussions with a broad range of parties to resolve several of our pending cases before the PUCO. Our meetings continue to be productive, and we're making good progress. We are also making progress on the Ohio corporate separation, DMR and DCR audits. The corporate separation audit report was filed on September 13 and showed no findings of major noncompliance. The expanded DCR audit report is due by November 19. And we continue to work through the DMR audit, which is now due on December 16.
Since our last earnings call, we've taken additional steps to strengthen our compliance program and instill a culture focused on ethics, integrity and accountability across our organization. These include: a new Compliance & Ethics Program Charter and policies in multiple areas; instructor-led business Code of Conduct awareness training for senior leadership and individuals with significant roles in our control environment; training on the concepts of our new internal Code of Conduct for everyone in leadership, with training for all employees planned in the first quarter of 2022; and publishing our new corporate engagement report.
Additionally, we have started to develop a new integrated risk management platform to enhance our ethics and compliance, audit and risk functions. The new tool will help us streamline case management of ethics and compliance concerns, manage the life cycle of corporate policies, assess and respond to risks, and report on our compliance with internal controls and regulatory requirements across the organization.
As we've discussed, over the last 12 months, our Board and management team acted quickly and decisively, adding additional independent board members, making changes in our management structure, establishing effective controls, reinforcing our culture change and building a best-in-class ethics and compliance program. Our relentless focus in these areas resulted in remediation of the material weakness in internal controls associated with our tone at the top. 
While this is an important step, we continue driving these cultural changes and keeping compliance and integrity at the center of everything we do. We are working every day to continue rebuilding stakeholder trust and confidence in FirstEnergy and to ensure that our employees can be proud of our company and our mission.
Yesterday, we announced another key hire to enhance our leadership team. Camilo Serna will join FirstEnergy on November 8 as our new Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs. Camilo brings a great depth of experience, developing and implementing state and federal regulatory strategies. His experience will be invaluable as we build a smarter electric grid and support the transition to a cleaner energy future.
We continue taking steps to achieve these goals. For example, last month, JCP&L submitted a proposal to PJM and the New Jersey BPU for transmission investments that would connect clean energy generated from the state's offshore wind farms to the power grid, while minimizing the impact on the environment and communities. We expect a decision on this proposal, which supports the clean energy investments driven by the New Jersey Energy Master Plan in the second half of 2022.
In West Virginia, we recognize our responsibility to operate our 2 regulated fossil plants for the benefit of our customers in the state. Later this year, we intend to file an effluent limitation guideline, or ELG plan, that calls for additional capital expenditures at the 2 plants to comply with environmental rules and to ensure that they can continue to operate beyond 2028.
At the same time, we intend to begin discussing with stakeholders our plans for a timely clean energy transition. As a part of that transition, later this year, we plan to file with the West Virginia Public Service Commission for 50 megawatts of utility scale solar generation.
Our wind connection and solar proposals support core components of our climate strategy, building a more climate-resilient energy system that meets our customers' changing needs, enables the transition to a carbon-neutral economy and powers a sustainable and prosperous future for our stakeholders.
In other recent regulatory activity, this month, our ATSI transmission subsidiary reached a settlement with parties to a FERC proceeding that will address legacy issues associated with ATSI's move from MISO to PJM in 2011 and provide for partial recovery of the MISO transmission project costs that will be allocated to ATSI in the future.
It's an exciting time for our company. We have a robust long-term pipeline to modernize our transmission network, and we plan to continue embracing renewables. In our distribution business, we're incorporating emerging smart technologies and building a technologically advanced distribution platform. And our industry will play a key role in the infrastructure build-out for electric vehicles, battery storage and other technologies.
We're pleased with our strong performance through the first 9 months of 2021. As we close out the year, we are raising and narrowing our operating earnings guidance from $2.40 to $2.60 per share to $2.55 to $2.65 per share. The midpoint of this range represents a 9% increase over 2020 operating earnings results.
Finally, I can't pass the call over to Jon without acknowledging that it's been one year since I stepped into my leadership role under very sobering circumstances. It's been a challenging year on many fronts. And I want to publicly thank our employees for their hard work and unwavering dedication to our customers. I continue to be impressed by the grit and the resilience of the entire team. Together, we are building positive, sustainable momentum, and creating a new FirstEnergy that is a forward thinking and industry-leading company.
Thank you for your attention this morning. Now Jon will provide a review of third quarter results and a financial update."

Yesterday, we announced GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share for the third quarter of 2021 and operating earnings of $0.82 per share. As Steve mentioned, this exceeded the top end of our guidance range.
In our distribution business, results for the third quarter of 2021 as compared to last year reflect the absence of Ohio decoupling and lost distribution revenue, which totaled $0.04 per share as well as lower weather-related usage. These were partially offset by higher revenues from our capital investment programs, new rates from our JCP&L distribution base rate case and lower operating expenses.
Consistent with the trends we've discussed over the last few quarters, total distribution deliveries increased on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis compared to the third quarter of 2020. While weather was hotter than normal in our region this summer, it was cooler in the third quarter of 2020.
Weather-adjusted residential sales for the third quarter of 2021 were essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2020 as many of our customers continue to work from home. Comparing our results to the pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of 2019, weather-adjusted residential usage was nearly 6% higher this quarter.
While the commercial and industrial classes have not yet recovered to levels we saw before the pandemic, they are starting to trend in the right direction. Weather-adjusted commercial deliveries increased 3% while industrial load was up nearly 4% compared to the third quarter of 2020. Industrial load increased in most of the sectors in our service territory this quarter, led by steel, chemical and fabricated metal.
In our regulated transmission business, we continue to see benefits from higher transmission investments at our MAIT and ATSI subsidiaries as part of our Energizing the Future program. However, this was offset by higher interest from the debt issuance at FET earlier this year and a prior year formula rate true-up. And in the Corporate segment, results reflect lower O&M and benefit expenses.
For the first 9 months of 2021, operating earnings were $2.10 per share compared to $2.07 per share in the first 9 months of 2020. The increase was driven by our ongoing investments in our distribution and transmission systems, higher weather-related usage and lower expenses. These items more than offset the $0.17 of decoupling and lost distribution revenues recognized in the first 9 months of 2020.
Our strong results and financial discipline have resulted in year-to-date adjusted cash from operations of $2.4 billion, which represents an increase of $600 million versus last year. While we expect a few offsets in the fourth quarter, we now expect cash from operations of approximately $2.8 billion for the year, which includes approximately $300 million of investigation and other related costs, the largest of which is associated with a $230 million DPA settlement.
Earlier this month, we successfully restructured our revolving credit facilities from a 2-facility model to 6, fulfilling our commitment to complete this action before the end of the year. The 2021 credit facilities provide for aggregate commitments of $4.5 billion and are available until October of 2026, with 2 separate 1-year extensions. The credit facilities and their sub-limits are detailed in the strategic and financial highlights.
We are also pleased that following the restructuring of these facilities, S&P issued a one notch upgrade to the 10 distribution companies and the 3 transmission companies. While we're glad to return to investment-grade ratings for these companies with all 3 rating agencies, we remain committed to improving our balance sheet and the overall credit profile at the parent company.
We previously communicated that we were targeting FFO to debt in the 12% to 13% range. We're raising that target to be solidly at 13%, which will provide ample cushion to the new Moody's threshold of 12%. And we expect to set the company on a firm glide path to mid-teens.
On a number of recent calls, we've communicated that we're contemplating a minority asset sale as we consider alternatives to raise equity capital. Currently, we are engaged in a process to sell a minority interest in our transmission holding company, FirstEnergy Transmission, which owns ATSI, MAIT and TrAILCo. The interest is very strong and preliminary indications are very supportive of our financial plan and targets. But given where we are in the process, we can't comment any further on the details.
We continue to evaluate all options to raise equity capital in an efficient manner to support our longer-term outlook, which includes traditional rate base growth and formula rate investments, planned rate case activity, and incremental and strategic CapEx that supports the transition to a cleaner electric grid. We are optimistic that we'll be in a position to share our overall financing plan and our longer-term outlook within the next couple of weeks. In fact, you may have noticed that we've expanded the information in the appendix of our strategic and financial highlights document. Given the current status of the proposed asset sale, we recognize that the fact book will be more relevant once we can include the outcome from that transaction.
During the fourth quarter, we expect to provide you with 2022 guidance and a detailed capital plan, along with the runway of our FFO-to-debt target, longer-term capital forecasts, and targeted rate base and earnings growth rates.
As always, thank you for your time and your interest in FirstEnergy. I'll be happy to take your questions."

Our commercial and industrial loads, they're basically demand-based. And we see commercial and industrial coming back to normal slowly.

So I see that moving ahead.
Beyond the offshore wind, I believe, as we seek and end up receiving greater clarity on the clean energy transition that the U.S. is going to continue to move ahead on, I think that's going to provide us great opportunities both in the T&D environment to continue to invest and embrace renewables. And we're certainly very excited about that opportunity. Beyond that, it's also taking emerging technologies that are coming towards us that are much more affordable for customers, such as smart meter and other items, in which we're going to prepare a T&D platform for renewables over time. And I think those opportunities not only exist on the transmission system, but they exist in each one of our jurisdictions.
So I think it's very -- we've talked about this before. It's very important that we keep the customer in the center of that equation in which we can enrich the value we're providing them, but we keep affordability in mind.

First one is, I know you trimmed it earlier this year in April. And at the time, you referenced some uncertainty about the DOJ investigation as well as the balance sheet constraints. Do you see opportunity to reverse those cuts? Or should we think of those as more permanent?
And then the second question is, if you do move forward with the sale of minority interest in the business, would that impact the CapEx plans longer term? Or do you think that's unrelated to the ownership?"

And the way I like to think about that is, look, our company has faced significant uncertainty in the last 18-month period. And we've done what is prudent in terms of just ensuring that we can maintain financial flexibility in the present tense and then increase it in the future tense, if you will. And I think we've done a very good job of managing that.
I believe our transmission investment opportunities, while we curtailed them slightly this year, I think you'll see us continue to ramp that up incrementally just to make sure also that we stay within our sweet spot within that. In other words, we don't want to go too far in terms of burdening customers in terms of cost. But once again, we are seeing continued reliability improvement. So I think that's really important for us.
When you factor in the potential for a minority stake sale within the transmission business, I think that's only going to, if executed, fortify our company moving ahead, strengthen our business platform, strengthen our balance sheet. And I think that will provide a greater opportunity to invest into the future.
And once again, I think all of these pieces, while we can't be more definitive today, I think they're starting to align nicely. Not only the minority stake consideration working towards some type of settlement in Ohio that once again will help our business and relieve some level of uncertainty out in the market, I think all of these pieces are starting to work forward very nicely.
Our main concern is we continue to do that is -- just to make sure that we keep our company between the guardrail, so to speak. We have to continue to execute. We've got to continue to keep our employees and the public safe, be concerned with our reliability, ensure that financially that we're performing not only for shareholders, but all stakeholders. And we feel very good about where we're at right now, even though, as I said earlier, we have work to do."
