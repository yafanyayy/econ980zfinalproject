We are pleased to have you as a new member of our Tyson Foods family and appreciate your leadership. I want to thank everyone listening for your interest in Tyson Foods. And I want to thank our 139,000 dedicated team members who come to",2203,"Thank you, Megan. We are pleased to have you as a new member of our Tyson Foods family and appreciate your leadership. I want to thank everyone listening for your interest in Tyson Foods. And I want to thank our 139,000 dedicated team members who come to work every day to help keep each other safe and feed the world. Your work is raising the world's expectations for how much good food can do. 
Earlier today, we released our first quarter results for fiscal 2021. We delivered strong operating earnings performance, exceeding $1 billion in operating income for the quarter. This performance was driven by higher earnings in our Prepared Foods, Beef and Chicken segments and demonstrates our effectiveness in addressing customer and consumer needs while continuing to manage the ongoing effects of a global pandemic. 
I am exceptionally proud of our global team for their contributions to this strong result. 
Fundamental to our results are the considerable investments that we have made to safeguard the health, safety and wellness of our global team members. This remains our top priority. 
We also continue to monitor consumer trends. The pandemic spurred changes in consumer demand patterns and created new operational complexities for our team. We have risen to the challenge that these changes have created. We flex our footprint to adapt to shifting channel demand, scaling retail production up dramatically and innovating with attractive retail offerings. 
Our investments into insights, innovation and R&D are helping us win with consumers. As demonstration, we now have delivered 10 consecutive quarters of retail volume growth across our core business lines. As we navigate continued market volatility, we are focused on operational excellence and disciplined cost management. 
During the quarter, we realized cost savings and progressively improved our order fulfillment results. We are also on track relative to our stated capital allocation objectives and have prioritized key growth investments to diversify our asset base. 
Looking forward, I am confident that our team is executing on the right priorities to meet our commitments and drive shareholder value creation. 
Turning to Slide 4, team member health and safety is and will continue to be our top priority. We have an intense focus on team member well-being as a fundamental driver of engagement and satisfaction across our enterprise. 
This quarter, we announced the hiring of a Chief Medical Officer. We welcome Dr. Claudia Coplein in January and look forward to her additional leadership in ensuring that our organization continues to remain vigilant and aggressive towards overall team member wellness. 
We have also hired 200 new nurses and administrative staff, bringing the total occupational health staff to almost 600 team members. With these resources, we are advancing our health and safety priorities to support our vaccine rollout and build our wellness programs. 
We're also opening 7 pilot health clinics for team members and their families this year to increase their access to health care in the communities where we operate. 
I'm exceptionally pleased to report that our advanced preparations and investments have allowed us to start COVID-19 vaccinations on a limited basis as vaccines have become available. We've extended our ongoing partnership with Matrix Medical, a leading clinical services provider, to prepare for broad vaccine distribution and to ensure the U.S. team members are educated across multiple languages about the COVID-19 vaccine. This is part of our ongoing effort to ensure our team members to have information and access to the best protections available. 
In addition to supporting vaccine deployment, we continue to use testing as a major component of our COVID-19 monitoring strategy and part of our health and safety measures to protect team members. We are testing thousands of team members every week and currently estimate that we have tested more than half our workforce. Our always on testing strategy is another proactive step in our efforts to search for and fight the virus. The result of our proactive approach has been a dramatic reduction in COVID-19 occurrence within our plans. A strong accomplishment given the surge in cases nationally. 
As we look forward to the prospect of recovery in the months ahead, we have an incredible opportunity through our leading position in sustainability and social responsibility to drive a more sustainable future for our company and our planet. We are excited for the upcoming publication of our annual sustainability report later this spring, which will show continued progress across our 3 key focus areas, including empowering people, conserving natural resources and cultivating innovation in agriculture. As I consider our impact on these important objectives, I'm very proud of how our teams continue to drive progress in their tireless efforts towards elastic change. 
Since February of 2020, Tyson has donated nearly 90 million meals to 800 relief efforts in our communities, and we will continue to support those local communities where help is needed. 
We will also improve our environmental footprint as we feed the world. In fact, we were the first across our peer group to announce greenhouse gas reduction targets that were accepted by the science-based targets initiative, a bold commitment to achieving a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. 
We are also committed to leading in the advancement of animal welfare outcomes with transparency. To this end, we recently partnered with the University of Arkansas division of agriculture to fund research and animal welfare and commercial broiler farms, which will guide industry efforts to continuously improve welfare for the birds entrusted to our care. 
These initiatives and many more to come, solidify Tyson's position as a leader within this space, and our consistent progress is being recognized. We ranked #1 in the food production category on the 2021 Fortune Magazine World's Most Admired Companies list. This is our fifth consecutive year in a row to receive that recognition. 
Turning now to Slide 6. While we've experienced an operating environment that has seen pockets of volatility over the past few quarters, we are starting to see consumer behavior stabilize within the retail and foodservice channels. Our diverse protein portfolio continues to be well positioned to support current consumption patterns. 
Consistent with our experience last year, continued strength in at home consumption is delivering historically higher retail and e-commerce sales. We continue to outperform peers with stronger retail volume growth. Our total Tyson and core business lines have posted 10 consecutive quarters of growth and 4 straight quarters of double digit expansion, continuing to outpace total food and beverage. Volumes in core business lines were up nearly 14% during the latest 13 weeks and 19% during the latest 52 weeks. Our growth during these periods was driven in large part by our ability to bring incremental households into our brand and product lines. Total Tyson household penetration reached 81%, and we continue to see an increased number of shopping trips that included a Tyson product, up 11% versus a year ago. 
As consumers increase their reliance on low to no contact buying methods during the quarter, we experienced e-commerce sales growth of 89% in the latest 13 weeks compared to last year. This equated to approximately $330 million of sales through our e-commerce channel partners. 
We expect e-commerce channels to remain very relevant moving forward as consumers maintain and shift to convenient, low to no contact buying methods. 
Foodservice volumes were still down relative to pre-COVID-19 levels, but our channel and category mix sets us up well for a recovery as nationwide vaccination efforts are expected to drive more away-from-home protein consumption occasions. It's important to note that some food service operators have adapted very well to the current environment and have embraced drive through and take out. Many of these operators are not seeing the volume declines others have. And some are even outpacing historical pre-COVID-19 performance. Winning with consumers by meeting their needs is core to our strategy, and new innovations are a big part of that. 
Turning to Slide 7. We're excited to share some new product launches that are showing signs of early success. Our Air Fried chicken lines has been in market for just over a year and is already showing great momentum with very strong repeat purchase rates. We're proud of how our innovation capabilities help us meet consumers' health and wellness needs and have driven new buyers to the category. Approximately 11% of volumes from the Air Fried lines initial launch period were generated by new consumers. 
Jimmy Dean, one of our iconic billion-dollar brands, recently extended into the breakfast burrito category, a natural progression for an industry-leading product line rooted in convenience and tasty offerings across breakfast occasions. 
We're seeing strong incremental Jimmy Dean volumes from this product offering as well as solid repeat purchase rates. 
And just last month, we launched new alternative protein offerings under the Jimmy Dean Label, including the plant-based patty croissant, which is already exceeding our original demand forecast, recognized and trusted brands like Jimmy Dean, provide a powerful platform to offer plant-based options, which is an illustration of our One Tyson strategy in action. 
Each of these exciting product launches reaffirms Tyson's ability to bring innovative and on-trend products to market as part of our overall growth strategy. This innovation engine creates synergies across not only the retail channel, also food service. 
Turning to Slide 8. We are also making progress on several other key strategic areas that will create long-term shareholder value. First, the core part of Tyson's strategy is operational excellence. We strive to produce high-quality products with efficient operations and top-notch customer service. We are working aggressively to realize improvement opportunities, especially in our chicken segment. 
Later in the call, Stewart will share additional detail on our actions to improve operating results in the Chicken segment. 
In general, through our ongoing financial fitness, we are pursuing significant cost savings opportunities across our business. 
Next, we are making the organic investments necessary to meet growing global protein demand. Our international platform increasingly provides an opportunity to grow overall sales and margins by leveraging our global production capabilities to reach an international customer base. We're using our One Tyson framework to identify synergy opportunities and to maximize the value from farm to table at the global level. 
Because of our existing depth of experience in protein production, brand management and global customer relationships, we believe we have the right recipe for growth and the right to win in these attractive international markets. 
Overall, we estimate that approximately 60% of our capital expenditures are going toward growth objectives. An area of increased investment is value-added capacity expansion and automation technology, which will support increased sales, high-efficiency processing and better customer service, among others. 
In addition, we're using technology to improve employee health and safety, animal well-being and environmental management. 
Lastly, our capital allocation priorities build financial strength allowing us to continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders. We have disciplined processes to ensure that investments we make optimize our returns and drive long-term shareholder value. 
We're also committed to return cap to shareholders. Our business performance has allowed us to increase our dividend per share each year for the last 9 years. 
I'd like to move now to a review of our first quarter fiscal 2021 performance for the total company, which is captured on Slide 9. We delivered sales of $10.5 billion in the quarter, slightly down versus the same period last year. Volumes were lower primarily due to foodservice volumes, partially offset by higher retail volumes. 
Note also that the $320 million charge related to our poultry litigation accrual was recorded as a reduction of sales in the quarter. We delivered operating income of over $1 billion during the quarter up 24% versus the same period a year ago. The company experienced strong operating income performance in Beef and Prepared Foods, while the Pork segment and the Chicken business showed signs of improvement. Total company operating income margin was 9.5%. Performance resulted in $1.94 in earnings per share for the quarter, an increase of approximately 28% versus the same period last year. 
In line with our focus on team member health and safety, we incurred $120 million of direct incremental COVID-19 cost during the first quarter. These costs have not been adjusted out of our results and include items such as PPE, testing, medical partnerships, product downgrades, donations as well as enhanced employee pay and benefits. 
Overall, our business performed well during the quarter, while showing profitability and operational improvements on a year-over-year basis in key areas. Our retail business has seen continued and strong performance as a result of our depth of brand and product offerings based on our growing share positions and increasing presence within consumer shopping carts, we believe we're well positioned for continued strength at retail. 
We're also partnering with our foodservice customers to ensure they are prepared to meet increasing channel demand as the COVID-19 vaccination rollout continues and consumers gradually become more active away from home. 
Finally, our team and business has performed, but we certainly still have growth and execution opportunities ahead that we are actively pursuing. I will now turn the call over to Stewart. He will share our detailed financial performance before I return to provide closing remarks."

Starting with Prepared Foods sales were $2.1 billion for the quarter, roughly flat versus the same period last year, reflecting higher retail and lower foodservice sales. Total volume was down $0.09. Segment ope",1648,"Thanks, Dean, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Prepared Foods sales were $2.1 billion for the quarter, roughly flat versus the same period last year, reflecting higher retail and lower foodservice sales. Total volume was down $0.09. 
Segment operating income was $266 million for the quarter, up 48% versus prior year. This substantial improvement in profitability was driven by strong retail performance, lower commercial spending as a result of continued strength in retail demand and lapping of issues experienced as a result of our ERP rollout last year. 
Offsetting these improvements were higher costs related to commodity price increases and other input cost inflation, along with covered related costs and impacts on our manufacturing efficiency. 
As demand gradually normalizes post-COVID, we expect higher levels of commercial spending in order to meet our category growth objectives and negative mix impacts from higher foodservice volumes. As this shift occurs, we expect some benefits from improving fixed cost deleverage as volumes increase back to historical levels. 
Operating margins for the segment were 12.6% for the first quarter, an improvement of more than 400 basis points versus the comparable period. We're also happy to see our business operations stabilizing in key areas, which has allowed us to improve our service levels as well as fill rates with our customers. 
Moving on to our Chicken segment. First quarter results show an improved operating income relative to the same period last year. Segment sales were $2.8 billion for the quarter, down 14% versus prior year, in large part because of a $320 million reduction in sales from the poultry litigation accrual. Volumes were down 7% relative to the same period last year, primarily due to lost foodservice sales but were offset by bright spots in our retail value-added categories as well as strong sales to certain national account QSR chains. 
Sales and volumes continue to be impacted by both channel shifts and intermittent operational issues resulting from the pandemic. Including higher absenteeism at our production facilities. Segment operating income was $104 million for the quarter, up 33% versus the same quarter last year. The operating income improvement was driven by price increases on certain products and cost-saving initiatives as we continue working to improve the competitiveness of our Chicken operations. 
We also saw a positive impact from derivatives of approximately $70 million in the quarter. Operating margins for the segment improved 90 basis points to 3.3% for the first quarter. We are driving actions in 3 areas within our Chicken business in order to restore top tier performance, being the employer of choice, improving operational performance and our relentless focus on serving our customers' needs. Higher levels of absenteeism and turnover have created inefficiency in our operations as they leave us short of team members to fully stop our plants and also drive higher levels of overtime pay. 
As a result, we're implementing a range of measures designed to enhance the attractiveness of our production-related roles, including the increased pay and the use of automation and technology to supplement some of the more difficult and high turn over jobs. 
Next, our process flow and the plant has not been optimal, and we've been working steadily to correct this. Clearly, the disruptions caused by COVID have not helped, but we're starting to see improvement and expect that to continue during the year. This will be the source of considerable savings over time. 
Lastly, COVID channel shifts and volatile demand have negatively impacted our order fulfillment rates. Changes we've made to plant operations in response to COVID are yielding improvements, and we expect that further improvements will result as we reduce our staffing gaps and drive operational flow improvements. This is, of course, in addition to the benefits expected as foodservice begins to recover. 
Moving to the Beef segment. First quarter results show an improvement relative to the same period last year. Segment sales were approximately $4 billion for the quarter, up 4% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers include strong domestic and export demand for beef products with volumes up 5.6% for the quarter. 
Segment operating income was $528 million for the quarter, up 45% versus the prior year. Operating income improvement was driven by higher volumes as we lapped the prior year impacts of our [ Finney County ] plant fire. We also realized a $55 million gain related to recoveries from the cattle supplier fraud offset by higher COVID-related operating costs. These higher costs were mostly driven by bonuses paid to our frontline team members. 
Note also that the comparable period last year was revised down by $68 million associated with the cattle supplier of fraud affecting the year-over-year comparison. Operating margins for the segment improved 370 basis points to 13.2% for the first quarter. 
Now let's move on to the Pork segment on Slide 14. First quarter results show a softening relative to the same period last year. Segment sales were $1.4 billion for the quarter, up about 4% versus the comparable period last year. These sales drivers for the segment included lower volumes as a result of temporary idling of one of our production facilities, offset by stronger demand. 
Volumes were down 3% for the quarter relative to the same period last year. Segment operating income was $116 million for the quarter, down 40% versus the comparable period. Operating income degradation was driven by production inefficiencies, the temporary idling of the previously mentioned production facility and COVID-related operating costs. 
We also experienced higher live animal costs, which was not fully offset by price. Operating margins for the segment declined by 590 basis points to 8.1% for the first quarter. 
Moving to Slide 15. I'll share the quarterly results impact on certain cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion, up nearly $500 million versus the prior year. Liquidity strengthened to $4.2 billion as of January 2, 2021. Gross debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.6x was down slightly compared to prior year-end. And on a net debt basis, we were at 2x aided by the strong cash flows in this quarter. 
Net interest expense totaled $108 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5%. Capital expenditures came in at $289 million. We paid $159 million of dividends during the quarter and purchased $17 million of shares related to our employee stock plans. 
Turning now to a discussion on our financial outlook. Clearly, an important headline this quarter is the sharp rise in grain costs. Grain futures for 2021 have continued to strengthen due to diminished stocks to use expectations for corn and soybeans and strong export demand, particularly from China. We expect hedging and pricing actions will allow our team to mitigate some grain cost impacts moving ahead. But at this time, it is difficult to estimate just how much can be mitigated through those actions. As a reminder, a $0.10 per bushel move in corn price or a $10 per ton move in soybean meal translates into an approximate change of $25 million in cost of goods sold. 
We've also seen some recent inflationary pressure in our freight costs, largely due to a shortage of drivers. In our international and export businesses, these freight dynamics are manifesting themselves through increased container costs. Our team's efforts to mitigate future freight and transportation risks will continue to ensure our products are shipped efficiently and effectively to meet customer needs. 
Lastly, looking at our assumptions related to the adequacy of live animal inventory, live cattle inventories remain ample to support our beef business, and we believe hog inventories will remain adequate despite a small decrease in supply. 
Having said that, both cattle and hog futures have moved higher since October, and we're working to minimize the impact to our business, particularly in the Prepared Foods segment where retail prices do not move as dynamically. 
Slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. We expect to deliver annual revenues at the top end of our previous range of $42 billion to $44 billion supported by our strong first quarter performance. 
We also expect our directional annual guidance versus last year of improved operating margins in prepared foods and lower operating margins in pork to hold. At current grain prices, operating margins in chicken will likely be lower than prior year. 
Because of stronger-than-expected performance in Beef and current market conditions, we expect beef to deliver an operating margin similar to last year's 10.1% or marginally lower. Key risks of this guidance include rate rates as well as labor availability and costs across all segments. Grain costs in the Chicken segment, raw material costs for our Prepared Foods business and continued export market strength. We are revising our capital expenditures outlook to $1.3 to $1.5 billion as we continue to build capacity across our network. 
As we noted last quarter, the majority of the spend will be toward capacity expansions in chicken, case-ready beef and pork, Prepared Foods and international. 
Net interest expense is expected to be lower than our previous outlook at approximately $430 million, which reflects a recent term loan repayment of $750 million that occurred during our second quarter. 
Our outlook on effective tax rate is unchanged, but we will continue to monitor the potential implications of legislation from the new administration. Our expectations related to liquidity are unchanged, although we expect our liquidity to decrease from $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter based on the term loan repayment as well as our seasonally higher cash usage during our second quarter. 
Finally, we have continued to invest in health and safety and well-being of our team members. And our COVID-related costs, which totaled $120 million in the quarter are now expected to be approximately $440 million for the year. It remains to be seen what portion of these costs will be permanent. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Dean."

You may also know that we've made an investment in a joint venture with Jacob turns in our beef and pork business to take a lot of the byproduct and make that ready and more ready for renewable diesel. That's a great partnership and progressing well. We do see strong demand for all of the animal byproducts that could be going into that space, and we think it's a promising part of the business."

Your work is raising the world's expectations for how much good food can do. 
Earlier today, we released our first quarter results for fiscal 2021. We delivered strong operating earnings performance, exceeding $1 billion in operating income for the quarter. This performance was driven by higher earnings in our Prepared Foods, Beef and Chicken segments and demonstrates our effectiveness in addressing customer and consumer needs while continuing to manage the ongoing effects of a global pandemic. 
I am exceptionally proud of our global team for their contributions to this strong result. 
Fundamental to our results are the considerable investments that we have made to safeguard the health, safety and wellness of our global team members. This remains our top priority. 
We also continue to monitor consumer trends. The pandemic spurred changes in consumer demand patterns and created new operational complexities for our team. We have risen to the challenge that these changes have created. We flexed our footprint to adapt to shifting channel demand, scaling retail production up dramatically and innovating with attractive retail offerings. 
Our investments into insights, innovation and R&D are helping us win with consumers. As demonstration, we now have delivered 10 consecutive quarters of retail volume growth across our core business lines. As we navigate continued market volatility, we are focused on operational excellence and disciplined cost management. 
During the quarter, we realized cost savings and progressively improved our order fulfillment results. We are also on track relative to our stated capital allocation objectives and have prioritized key growth investments to diversify our asset base. 
Looking forward, I am confident that our team is executing on the right priorities to meet our commitments and drive shareholder value creation. 
Turning to Slide 4, team member health and safety is and will continue to be our top priority. We have an intense focus on team member well-being as a fundamental driver of engagement and satisfaction across our enterprise. 
This quarter, we announced the hiring of a Chief Medical Officer. We welcome Dr. Claudia Coplein in January and look forward to her additional leadership in ensuring that our organization continues to remain vigilant and aggressive towards overall team member wellness. 
We have also hired 200 new nurses and administrative staff, bringing the total occupational health staff to almost 600 team members. With these resources, we are advancing our health and safety priorities to support our vaccine rollout and build our wellness programs. 
We're also opening 7 pilot health clinics for team members and their families this year to increase their access to health care in the communities where we operate. 
I'm exceptionally pleased to report that our advanced preparations and investments have allowed us to start COVID-19 vaccinations on a limited basis as vaccines have become available. We've extended our ongoing partnership with Matrix Medical, a leading clinical services provider, to prepare for broad vaccine distribution and to ensure that U.S. team members are educated across multiple languages about the COVID-19 vaccine. This is part of our ongoing effort to ensure our team members to have information and access to the best protections available. 
In addition to supporting vaccine deployment, we continue to use testing as a major component of our COVID-19 monitoring strategy and part of our health and safety measures to protect team members. We are testing thousands of team members every week and currently estimate that we have tested more than half our workforce. Our always-on testing strategy is another proactive step in our efforts to search for and fight the virus. The result of our proactive approach has been a dramatic reduction in COVID-19 occurrence within our plants. A strong accomplishment given the surge in cases nationally. 
As we look forward to the prospect of recovery in the months ahead, we have an incredible opportunity through our leading position in sustainability and social responsibility to drive a more sustainable future for our company and our planet. We are excited for the upcoming publication of our annual sustainability report later this spring, which will show continued progress across our 3 key focus areas, including empowering people, conserving natural resources and cultivating innovation in agriculture. As I consider our impact on these important objectives, I'm very proud of how our teams continue to drive progress in their tireless efforts towards elastic change. 
Since February of 2020, Tyson has donated nearly 90 million meals to 800 relief efforts in our communities, and we will continue to support those local communities where help is needed. 
We will also improve our environmental footprint as we feed the world. In fact, we were the first across our peer group to announce greenhouse gas reduction targets that were accepted by the Science Based Targets initiative, a bold commitment to achieving a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. 
We are also committed to leading in the advancement of animal welfare outcomes with transparency. To this end, we recently partnered with the University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture to fund research and animal welfare and commercial broiler farms, which will guide industry efforts to continuously improve welfare for the birds entrusted to our care. 
These initiatives and many more to come, solidify Tyson's position as a leader within this space, and our consistent progress is being recognized. We ranked #1 in the food production category on the 2021 Fortune Magazine World's Most Admired Companies list. This is our fifth consecutive year in a row to receive that recognition. 
Turning now to Slide 6. While we've experienced an operating environment that has seen pockets of volatility over the past few quarters, we are starting to see consumer behavior stabilize within the retail and foodservice channels. Our diverse protein portfolio continues to be well positioned to support current consumption patterns. 
Consistent with our experience last year, continued strength in at-home consumption is delivering historically higher retail and e-commerce sales. We continue to outperform peers with stronger retail volume growth. Our total Tyson and core business lines have posted 10 consecutive quarters of growth and 4 straight quarters of double digit expansion, continuing to outpace total food and beverage. Volumes in core business lines were up nearly 14% during the latest 13 weeks and 19% during the latest 52 weeks. Our growth during these periods was driven in large part by our ability to bring incremental households into our brand and product lines. Total Tyson household penetration reached 81%, and we continue to see an increased number of shopping trips that included a Tyson product, up 11% versus a year ago. 
As consumers increase their reliance on low-to-no-contact buying methods during the quarter, we experienced e-commerce sales growth of 89% in the latest 13 weeks compared to last year. This equated to approximately $330 million of sales through our e-commerce channel partners. 
We expect e-commerce channels to remain very relevant moving forward as consumers maintain and shift to convenient, low-to-no-contact buying methods. 
Foodservice volumes were still down relative to pre-COVID-19 levels, but our channel and category mix sets us up well for a recovery as nationwide vaccination efforts are expected to drive more away-from-home protein consumption occasions. It's important to note that some foodservice operators have adapted very well to the current environment and have embraced drive-through and takeout. Many of these operators are not seeing the volume declines others have. And some are even outpacing historical pre-COVID-19 performance. Winning with consumers by meeting their needs is core to our strategy, and new innovations are a big part of that. 
Turning to Slide 7. We're excited to share some new product launches that are showing signs of early success. Our Air Fried Chicken lines has been in-market for just over a year and is already showing great momentum with very strong repeat purchase rates. We're proud of how our innovation capabilities help us meet consumers' health and wellness needs and have driven new buyers to the category. Approximately 11% of volumes from the Air Fried lines initial launch period were generated by new consumers. 
Jimmy Dean, one of our iconic billion-dollar brands, recently extended into the breakfast burrito category, a natural progression for an industry-leading product line rooted in convenience and tasty offerings across breakfast occasions. 
We're seeing strong incremental Jimmy Dean volumes from this product offering as well as solid repeat purchase rates. 
And just last month, we launched new alternative protein offerings under the Jimmy Dean Label, including the plant-based patty croissant, which is already exceeding our original demand forecast. Recognized and trusted brands like Jimmy Dean, provide a powerful platform to offer plant-based options, which is an illustration of our One Tyson strategy in action. 
Each of these exciting product launches reaffirms Tyson's ability to bring innovative and on-trend products to market as part of our overall growth strategy. This innovation engine creates synergies across, not only the retail channel, but also food service. 
Turning to Slide 8. We are also making progress on several other key strategic areas that will create long-term shareholder value. First, the core part of Tyson's strategy is operational excellence. We strive to produce high-quality products with efficient operations and top-notch customer service. We are working aggressively to realize improvement opportunities, especially in our Chicken segment. 
Later in the call, Stewart will share additional detail on our actions to improve operating results in the Chicken segment. In general, through our ongoing financial fitness, we are pursuing significant cost savings opportunities across our business. 
Next, we are making the organic investments necessary to meet growing global protein demand. Our international platform increasingly provides an opportunity to grow overall sales and margins by leveraging our global production capabilities to reach an international customer base. We're using our One Tyson framework to identify synergy opportunities and to maximize the value from farm to table at the global level. 
Because of our existing depth of experience in protein production, brand management and global customer relationships, we believe we have the right recipe for growth and the right to win in these attractive international markets. 
Overall, we estimate that approximately 60% of our capital expenditures are going toward growth objectives. An area of increased investment is value-added capacity expansion and automation technology, which will support increased sales, high-efficiency processing and better customer service, among others. In addition, we're using technology to improve employee health and safety, animal well-being and environmental management. 
Lastly, our capital allocation priorities build financial strength allowing us to continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders. We have disciplined processes to ensure that investments we make optimize our returns and drive long-term shareholder value. We are also committed to return cap to shareholders. Our business performance has allowed us to increase our dividend per share each year for the last 9 years. 
I'd like to move now to a review of our first quarter fiscal 2021 performance for the total company, which is captured on Slide 9. We delivered sales of $10.5 billion in the quarter, slightly down versus the same period last year. Volumes were lower primarily due to reduced foodservice volumes, partially offset by higher retail volumes. 
Note also that the $320 million charge related to our poultry litigation accrual was recorded as a reduction of sales in the quarter. We delivered an operating income of over $1 billion during the quarter, up 24% versus the same period a year ago. The company experienced strong operating income performance in Beef and Prepared Foods, while the Pork segment softened and the Chicken business showed signs of improvement. Total company operating income margin was 9.5%. This strong performance resulted in $1.94 in earnings per share for the quarter, an increase of approximately 28% versus the same period last year. 
In line with our focus on team member health and safety, we incurred $120 million of direct incremental COVID-19 cost during the first quarter. These costs have not been adjusted out of our results and include items such as PPE, testing, medical partnerships, product downgrades, donations as well as enhanced employee pay and benefits. 
Overall, our business performed well during the quarter, while showing profitability and operational improvements on a year-over-year basis in key areas. Our retail business has seen continued strong performance as a result of our depth of brand and product offerings based on our growing share positions and increasing presence within consumer shopping carts, we believe we're well positioned for continued strength at retail. 
We're also partnering with our foodservice customers to ensure they are prepared to meet increasing channel demand as the COVID-19 vaccination rollout continues and consumers gradually become more active away from home. 
Finally, I'm proud of how our team and business performed, but we certainly still have growth and execution opportunities ahead that we are actively pursuing. I will now turn the call over to Stewart. He will share our detailed financial performance before I return to provide closing remarks."
190636,701785098,2205682,"Tyson Foods, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Tyson Foods, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dean, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.1 billion for the quarter, roughly flat versus the same period last year, reflecting higher retail and lower foodservice sales. Total volume was down 9%. Segment opera",1643,"Thanks, Dean, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.1 billion for the quarter, roughly flat versus the same period last year, reflecting higher retail and lower foodservice sales. Total volume was down 9%. 
Segment operating income was $266 million for the quarter, up 48% versus prior year. This substantial improvement in profitability was driven by strong retail performance, lower commercial spending as a result of continued strength in retail demand and lapping of issues experienced as a result of our ERP rollout last year. 
Offsetting these improvements were higher costs related to commodity price increases and other input cost inflation, along with COVID-related costs and impacts on our manufacturing efficiency. 
As demand gradually normalizes post-COVID, we expect higher levels of commercial spending in order to meet our category growth objectives and negative mix impacts from higher foodservice volumes. As this shift occurs, we expect some benefits from improving fixed cost deleverage as volumes increase back to historical levels. 
Operating margins for this segment were 12.6% for the first quarter, an improvement of more than 400 basis points versus the comparable period. We're also happy to see our business operations stabilizing in key areas, which has allowed us to improve our service levels as well as fill rates with our customers. 
Moving on to our Chicken segment. First quarter results show an improved operating income relative to the same period last year. Segment sales were $2.8 billion for the quarter, down 14% versus prior year, in large part because of a $320 million reduction in sales from the poultry litigation accrual. Volumes were down 7% relative to the same period last year, primarily due to lost foodservice sales, but were offset by bright spots in our retail value-added categories as well as strong sales to certain national account QSR chains. 
Sales and volumes continue to be impacted by both channel shifts and intermittent operational issues resulting from the pandemic, including higher absenteeism at our production facilities. Segment operating income was $104 million for the quarter, up 33% versus the same quarter last year. The operating income improvement was driven by price increases on certain products and cost-saving initiatives as we continue working to improve the competitiveness of our Chicken operations.  
We also saw a positive impact from derivatives of approximately $70 million in the quarter. Operating margins for the segment improved 90 basis points to 3.3% for the first quarter. We are driving actions in 3 areas within our Chicken business in order to restore top tier performance, being the employer of choice, improving operational performance and our relentless focus on serving our customers' needs. Higher levels of absenteeism and turnover have created inefficiency in our operations as they leave us short of team members to fully stop our plants and also drive higher levels of overtime pay.  
As a result, we're implementing a range of measures designed to enhance the attractiveness of our production-related roles, including increased pay and the use of automation and technology to supplement some of the more difficult and high turnover jobs.  
Next, our process flow in the plant has not been optimal, and we've been working steadily to correct this. Clearly, the disruptions caused by COVID have not helped, but we're starting to see improvement and expect that to continue during the year. This will be the source of considerable savings over time.  
Lastly, COVID channel shifts and volatile demand have negatively impacted our order fulfillment rates. Changes we've made to plant operations in response to COVID are yielding improvements, and we expect that further improvements will result as we reduce our staffing gaps and drive operational flow improvements. This is, of course, in addition to the benefits expected as foodservice begins to recover.  
Moving to the Beef segment. First quarter results show an improvement relative to the same period last year. Segment sales were approximately $4 billion for the quarter, up 4% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers include strong domestic and export demand for beef products with volumes up 5.6% for the quarter.  
Segment operating income was $528 million for the quarter, up 45% versus the prior year. Operating income improvement was driven by higher volumes as we lapped the prior year impacts of our Finney County plant fire. We also realized a $55 million gain related to recoveries from the cattle supplier fraud offset by higher COVID-related operating costs. These higher costs were mostly driven by bonuses paid to our frontline team members.  
Note also that the comparable period last year was revised down by $68 million associated with the cattle supplier of fraud affecting the year-over-year comparison. Operating margins for the segment improved 370 basis points to 13.2% for the first quarter.  
Now let's move on to the Pork segment on Slide 14. First quarter results show a softening relative to the same period last year. Segment sales were $1.4 billion for the quarter, up about 4% versus the comparable period last year. These sales drivers for the segment included lower volumes as a result of temporary idling of one of our production facilities, offset by stronger demand.  
Volumes were down 3% for the quarter relative to the same period last year. Segment operating income was $116 million for the quarter, down 40% versus the comparable period. Operating income degradation was driven by production inefficiencies, the temporary idling of the previously mentioned production facility and COVID-related operating costs.  
We also experienced higher live animal costs, which was not fully offset by price. Operating margins for the segment declined by 590 basis points to 8.1% for the first quarter.  
Moving to Slide 15. I'll share the quarterly results impact on certain cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion, up nearly $500 million versus the prior year. Liquidity strengthened to $4.2 billion as of January 2, 2021. Gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 2.6x was down slightly compared to prior year-end. And on a net debt basis, we were at 2x aided by the strong cash flows in this quarter.  
Net interest expense totaled $108 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5%. Capital expenditures came in at $289 million. We paid $159 million of dividends during the quarter and purchased $17 million of shares related to our employee stock plans.  
Turning now to a discussion on our financial outlook. Clearly, an important headline this quarter is the sharp rise in grain costs. Grain futures for 2021 have continued to strengthen due to diminished stocks for use expectations for corn and soybeans and strong export demand, particularly from China. We expect hedging and pricing actions will allow our team to mitigate some grain cost impacts moving ahead. But at this time, it is difficult to estimate just how much can be mitigated through those actions. As a reminder, a $0.10 per bushel move in corn price or a $10 per ton move in soybean meal translates into an approximate change of $25 million in cost of goods sold.  
We've also seen some recent inflationary pressure in our freight costs, largely due to a shortage of drivers. In our international and export businesses, these freight dynamics are manifesting themselves through increased container costs. Our team's efforts to mitigate future freight and transportation risks will continue to ensure our products are shipped efficiently and effectively to meet customer needs.  
Lastly, looking at our assumptions related to the adequacy of live animal inventory, live cattle inventories remain ample to support our beef business, and we believe hog inventories will remain adequate despite a small decrease in supply.  
Having said that, both cattle and hog futures have moved higher since October, and we're working to minimize the impact to our business, particularly in the Prepared Foods segment where retail prices do not move as dynamically.  
Slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. We expect to deliver annual revenues at the top end of our previous range of $42 billion to $44 billion supported by our strong first quarter performance.  
We also expect our directional annual guidance versus last year of improved operating margins in Prepared Foods and lower operating margins in Pork to hold. At current grain prices, operating margins in Chicken will likely be lower than prior year.  
Because of stronger-than-expected performance in Beef and current market conditions, we expect Beef to deliver an operating margin similar to last year's 10.1% or marginally lower. Key risks to this guidance include break rates as well as labor availability and costs across all segments; grain costs in the Chicken segment; raw material costs for our Prepared Foods business and continued export market strength. We are revising our capital expenditures outlook to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion as we continue to build capacity across our network.  
As we noted last quarter, the majority of the spend will be toward capacity expansions in Chicken, Case Ready, Beef and Pork, Prepared Foods and International.  
Net interest expense is expected to be lower than our previous outlook at approximately $430 million, which reflects a recent term loan repayment of $750 million that occurred during our second quarter.  
Our outlook on effective tax rate is unchanged, but we will continue to monitor the potential implications of legislation from the new administration. Our expectations related to liquidity are unchanged, although we expect our liquidity to decrease from $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter based on the term loan repayment as well as our seasonally higher cash usage during our second quarter.  
Finally, we have continued to invest in health and safety and well-being of our team members. And our COVID-related costs, which totaled $120 million in the quarter are now expected to be approximately $440 million for the year. It remains to be seen what portion of these costs will be permanent.  
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Dean."

Before we get started, I'd like to welcome Donnie King to the earnings call and congratulate him on his recent promotion to Chief Operating Officer. I would also like to thank our 140,000 team members for their continued efforts and resilience. They are what makes this company an incredible place to work, and I am proud of their focus on raising the world's expectations for how much good food can do. 
Earlier today, we released our second quarter results for fiscal 2021. We delivered a solid operating earnings performance, recording $739 million in adjusted operating income for the quarter, which represents a 43% increase relative to the same period last year. We delivered $1.34 in adjusted earnings per share, a 68% increase from the same period last year. These results were reinforced by our sound performance in retail, our continuing efforts to ensure the safety of our team members, our partnership with customers to enable recovery and our focused execution to overcome inflationary headwinds. Our results in the quarter reflect our continued focus on team member health and safety. This is our top priority, and I'm proud of the progress that we have made on our comprehensive safety, health and wellness agenda along with our recent vaccine deployment efforts. 
We also saw improvement in the foodservice channel during the quarter. We've been working closely with our customers to support foodservice recovery. As consumer demand patterns continue to create operational complexities, we've taken action to make our organization more responsive to demand signals and customer needs to accelerate our speed to market. 
Agility is increasingly important as we look to extend the gains that we have achieved in the retail channel. We continue to drive retail volume growth across our core business lines. Delivering growth in the recent quarter is particularly notable as we are now comparing to a prior quarter that included some benefit from initial COVID-19 pantry loading. 
As we navigate market volatility and rising inflationary pressures, we're focused on operational excellence and disciplined cost management. Our balance sheet is strong, and we've continued to invest in our business. We have prioritized capacity expansion and automation technology investments and have significantly increased our capital allocated to both of these areas. 
As an example, our Humboldt production facility in Tennessee has recently commenced operations, and our team shipped the first saleable product in late April. To support growth in case-ready beef and pork, we are also excited for the reopening of our Columbia, South Carolina plant as well as the grand opening of our Eagle Mountain, Utah plant, both occurring later this year. We are expanding capacity in our international operations and have 6 sites where new capacity is currently under construction, positioning our international business for continued growth and profitability in the future. 
As we look at the balance of the year, we realized that we had a challenging second half ahead as inflationary pressure has continued to build. We also have several bright spots, notably our performance in the retail channel and the continued strength in our Beef segment. Looking past the inflationary headwinds that are impacting our input costs, I'm confident that our team is executing on the right priorities to meet our commitments and drive shareholder value creation. 
Turning to Slide 4. Team member health and safety is and will continue to be our top priority. Through our partnership with Matrix Medical and our local communities, over 42,000 of our team members have been vaccinated since February. As of today, we've offered on-site vaccination clinics at over 100 locations in more than 30 states. 
We've also launched a pilot project to enhance health and wellness of our team members. This involves the opening of 7 clinics that will enable team members and their families to receive easier access to high-quality health care services. Our first facility opened recently in Newbern, Tennessee. 
Turning now to Slide 5. Our total Tyson and core business lines have posted 11 consecutive quarters of volume and share growth. Notably, our team delivered volume growth in Q2 despite the unusually strong demand associated with pantry loading that occurred during the comparable quarter last year. 
Sales volume for Tyson core business lines are up 12.7%, and total Tyson is up 8.5% in the latest 52 weeks. Our share growth has been strongest in breakfast sausage, hot dogs, frozen value-added poultry in frozen protein breakfast. Our growth during these periods was driven in large part by our ability to bring incremental households into our brand and product lines. Total Tyson household penetration reached 81% for the latest 52 weeks. 
Also, consumers continue to rely on low-to-no-contact buying methods. As a result, we experienced e-commerce sales growth of 105% in the latest 13 weeks compared with last year. This equated to approximately $425 million of sales through our e-commerce channel partners. 
Turning to Slide 6. Innovation is important to our success in both the retail and food service channels. And we've continued to invest in the launch and scaling of new product innovations. On this slide, we have 3 examples of how our product innovation is tied to meaningful consumer insights. In a recent survey, nearly half of American's expressed dissatisfaction with available plant-based options for the grill. This insight spurred our recent nationwide Raised & Rooted launch, which includes 3 new products to meet increasing demand for plant-based protein options. We're also excited for our recent launch of alternative protein offerings in the Europe and Asia Pacific markets, which will support growing global demand for protein. 
Our Jimmy Dean Breakfast Nuggets are another example of our ability to pair brand and category leadership in frozen breakfast with our unique production capabilities to deliver protein-dense offerings that complement Tyson's current product portfolio. 
Finally, annual servings per capita for breaded chicken sandwiches of restaurants are up 14%, and our products in this space have enabled us to capitalize on the growing popularity. 
Moving to Chart 7. As we continue to navigate complex consumer dynamics overall, we're closely monitoring several factors to effectively engage with our customers and consumers in support of the overall recovery. Protein has remained relevant throughout the pandemic, with 54% of consumers indicating a deliberate intent to increase protein intake within their daily diet and 20% indicating that they are consuming animal protein more often than they were a year ago. 
In addition to overall protein consumption, we're closely monitoring reopening and recovery patterns. Approximately 76% of the U.S. states are now at 75% or more capacity for in-restaurant dining. With vaccine rollouts and consumer mobility improving, away-from-home traffic is gradually increasing on a sequential basis. Currently, QSR and C-stores are leading the recovery as consumers are very comfortable with ordering takeout. 
While we are seeing some challenges in our international markets, progress against COVID domestically should continue to improve consumer confidence and mobility in the second half. The U.S. economy is improving rapidly in part due to government stimulus. While we expect some degree of elevated retail consumption to remain post COVID, our success in growing retail share and driving relevant innovation will allow us to meet the strong demand for protein and serve our customers across all channels. 
I'll now turn the call over to Donnie to walk us through the segment operating results in detail."

Average sales price was up substantially during the period due to the favorable mix and the benefit of higher retail volume. Our reported price improvement also reflects actions that we have taken to cover the inflationary pressure we have experienced from higher grain, labor and freight cost. 
Despite our efforts in the quarter, we did not fully offset the inflationary impacts as a substantial portion of our business is contracted on a fixed annual price basis, with terms negotiated and locked ahead of the recent surge in grain cost. 
Adjusted operating income was $6 million during the second quarter and $110 million for the fiscal year-to-date, down versus both comparable periods. Fiscal year-to-date operating income was negatively impacted by $145 million of higher feed ingredient costs as well as $95 million of increased grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases. 
For the second quarter, feed ingredients were $135 million higher by grow-out expenses, and outside meat purchases were $60 million higher. Segment performance also reflects net derivative gains during the second quarter of $40 million and $110 million for the fiscal year-to-date, both versus the respective comparable periods. These gains are associated with realized gains as well as open positions. 
Last quarter, we shared our imperatives for improving Chicken operating results, which are captured on Slide 9. Our goal has not changed. We remain committed to restoring top-tier performance. The first imperative is related to being the employer of choice. Despite implementing pay rate increases, we continue to deal with elevated absenteeism and turnover. We are implementing a range of initiatives to improve the team member experience and achieve the status of the employer of choice, including flexible work schedules and a competitive wage rate. At this time, we estimate our average base pay plus benefits for domestic production workers is valued at over $22 per hour. 
The second imperative relates to our strategy to improve overall operational performance. Although we have made some progress improving our plant performance, we're not where we plan to be at this stage. Our strategy to improve our operational performance includes restoring our production volume to full capacity. However, we have struggled to raise the harvest to full capacity due to upstream supply issues, including issues caused by lower hatchability rates. 
Consequently, we have offset raw material shortages with outside meat purchases at a higher level than we have historically. With the recent move in market prices, our cost disadvantage from outside purchases has widened. To compensate for cost headwind, we are working to recover our historical advantage on live costs, reduce the number of pounds we are sourcing in the open market and to increase our plant efficiency as we gradually store volume over the balance of the year. 
The final imperative relates to serving our customers. Our focus is to deliver the highest levels of service to our customers, especially with respect to order fill rates. When our customers are successful, we are successful. We are sustaining share gains in retail value added as we start to lap the COVID-19 surge and are also leading foodservice recovery and growth. At the same time, our sales team is working to recover raw material and supply chain cost inflation via pricing. 
To sum all these imperatives is a restoration of our Chicken business to top-tier competitiveness and the coveted position of being our customers' go-to supplier. Acknowledging the uncertainty associated with the continued COVID-19 recovery, we are increasingly confident in our ability to bring our adjusted operating income margin back to at least 5% to 7% range over time. 
Moving to Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.2 billion for the quarter, up 4% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was down 4% in the quarter as growth in the retail channel was offset by a reduction in foodservice volumes. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by the partial pass-through of raw material costs, lower commercial spending and better sales mix. 
Segment operating income was $217 million for the quarter, up 14% versus prior year. For the first half, operating income was $483 million, up 30%. Operating margins for the segment were 10% for the second quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points versus the comparable period. Improvement in operating income was driven by the mix benefit of strong retail performance, lower commercial spending and pricing pass-throughs, which more than offset higher operating and raw material costs. 
In the second half, demand is expected to remain elevated at retail, with volumes continuing to exceed pre-COVID levels and foodservice showing sequential improvement. Overall, we're seeing an accelerating inflationary environment that is creating a meaningful headwind for Prepared Foods in the back half of the year. 
We're seeing raw material costs of up over 15% as well as increases in logistics, packaging and labor. To offset inflationary pressure, we're focused on pricing, revenue management, commercial spend optimization while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through marketing and trade support. 
Moving to the Beef segment. Segment sales were approximately $4 billion for the quarter, up 2% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers include a strong domestic and export demand for beef products, with average sales price up 7.5% for the quarter. Sales volume for the quarter was down due to the severe winter weather and production inefficiencies related to the challenging labor environment. 
Segment operating income was $445 million for the quarter. Operating income improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cutout, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. Operating margin for the segment improved 790 basis points to 11% for the second quarter. Our Beef segment performance has been driven by favorable supply and demand dynamics, which look to persist deeper into the year. 
On beef supply, slightly higher domestic production for the calendar year is being more than offset by lower imports and higher exports, resulting in lower projected domestic availability for the full year. Adequate supply, coupled with continued strong domestic and export demand with sustained cutout values in our strong segment results. 
Now let's move on to Pork segment on Slide 12. Second quarter results reflect the benefit of strong retail demand and higher exports, which were more than offset by higher hog cost and operating expenses. Segment sales were $1.5 billion for the quarter, up 17% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to stronger demand, partially offset by lower volumes due to production inefficiencies. Average sales price increased by over 17%, while volumes were down slightly relative to the same period last year. 
Segment adjusted operating income was $67 million for the quarter, down 28% versus the comparable period. Overall operating margins for the segment declined by 280 basis points to 4.5% for the quarter. The operating income decline was driven by lower volumes, higher hog costs and increased labor and freight cost. To improve our operating income results for the segment, we have implemented several actions to alleviate production constraints and to improve our volume throughput. 
As we look ahead, we are closely monitoring hog supply estimates. Recent USDA projections show a historically sharp drop in hog supply. The sharp decline in supply and strong demand for certain pork items have pushed the cutout up 59% from the end of December. As it stands now, pork cutout is at the highest level for this time of year since 2014. Looking at the overall calendar year, lower projected 2021 pork production and continued robust consumer demand are expected to support hog prices at well above 2020 levels. 
Finally, Slide 13 captures some highlights related to our International business. We continue to invest behind our international platform, which provides an opportunity to grow our sales and our margin by leveraging global production capabilities to see consumers abroad. We're using our One Tyson framework to identify opportunities to maximize the value of our products and capabilities from farm to table at a global level. Our existing depth of experience in protein production, brand management and global customer relationships creates the right recipe for growth and positions us with the right to win internationally. 
I'll now turn the call over to Stewart to provide additional detail on our financial performance."

Turning now to a summary of our total company financial results. We're pleased with our year-over-year growth in sales, adjusted operating income and earnings per share.

We're pleased with our year-over-year growth in sales, adjusted operating income and earnings per share. We performed well despite a challenging operating environment that spanned tough labor availability, significant inflationary pressures in raw material costs, global supply chain challenges and an evolving demand backdrop. 
Adjusted operating income was up 43% during the second quarter due to strong performance in our Beef business, along with growth in Prepared Foods earnings, partially offset by softness in Chicken and Pork. For the first half of fiscal 2021, we delivered adjusted operating income growth of 32%. Adjusted EPS grew nearly 70% during the second quarter driven by higher operating income. Fiscal year-to-date adjusted EPS was up 41% on a year-to-date basis. 
Slide 15 bridges our total company sales for the first half. Ongoing retail strength drove much of our sales results. We delivered growth across all our reporting segments in the retail channel. Overall, retail accounted for $700 million in sales improvement during the first half and over $260 million in the second quarter versus comparable periods. 
Moving to foodservice. Sales declined over $400 million in the first half compared to the same period last year, but improved $69 million in the second quarter. Foodservice recovery was most evident during the second quarter in higher Chicken and Prepared Foods sales versus the same period last year. 
Our foodservice mix in chicken indexes to QSRs, which saw volumes above pre-COVID levels during the period. In Prepared Foods, we are seeing recovery in foodservice foot traffic and strong sales into the distribution channel. 
Exports were up over 5% versus the comparable period, led by Beef where sales improved nearly $100 million for the first half. China is a key driver of beef export strength. Lastly, we've seen some strength in industrial, particularly in pork as renewable fuels continue to drive growth in fat and oils demand. In addition, the pace and shape of foodservice recovery will affect the composition of our channel and segment sales in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Slide 16 shows the bridge for adjusted operating income for the first half. Lower volumes, primarily from production inefficiencies and foodservice, were $100 million headwind on gross margin in the first half. Price/mix benefited during the first half from price recovery of raw material cost inflation, improved mix, strong Beef segment performance and continued retail strength across segments. Adjusted operating income was burdened by $664 million in cost of goods sold pressure for the period. This amount reflects significant raw material and supply chain cost inflation. 
Of the total, feed ingredients, grower costs and outside meat purchases associated with the Chicken segment contributed $240 million of pressure. Other large contributors included freight and labor costs. Year-to-date, SG&A benefited from the $54 million loss in fiscal 2020 compared to a $55 million gain in fiscal 2020. 
Slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Given continued strength in the Beef segment and our expectations for ongoing foodservice recovery, we are raising our sales guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver annual revenues in the range of $44 billion to $46 billion. This guidance reflects our expectation of partial price recovery relative to continued feed ingredient and supply chain cost inflation. At the segment level, we expect our directional annual guidance of lower operating margins in Chicken and Pork versus the prior year to hold. Because of stronger-than-expected performance in Beef and current market conditions, we are raising our guidance on the Beef segment. We now expect segment earnings to be up versus prior year. 
Finally, we are lowering our guidance in Prepared Foods due to back half inflationary pressures and now expect the segment's earnings to be flat versus the prior year. risks to this guidance include freight rates, labor cost, grain costs in the Chicken segment, raw material costs for our Prepared Foods business and continued export market strength along with price volatility in commodity meats. 
Our capital expenditures outlook of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion remains unchanged, but we now expect to be at the lower end of the range. Net interest expense is expected to be lower than our previous outlook at approximately $420 million. This update reflects an incremental term loan repayment of $750 million relative to our prior guidance that resulted in the early payoff of our $1.5 billion term loan, offset by $500 million of new indebtedness associated with a new bilateral term loan facility. 
Our outlook on effective tax rate is unchanged. We will continue to monitor the potential implications of any new legislation but do not currently expect to see impacts to our adjusted rate this fiscal year. 
Our expectations related to liquidity are also unchanged. As we noted last quarter, liquidity decreased from $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, ending the second quarter at $2.6 billion. 
Finally, our coverage-related costs, which totaled $95 million in the quarter and now expected to be approximately $365 million for the year. 
Turning to Slide 18. With our strong operational performance for the first half of 2021, we've seen an increase in operating cash flows. We have prioritized deleveraging through the first half, consistent with our priority to maintain a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility. Investing organically in our business has been an important priority, which will increase our production capacity and our market capabilities as well as modernize our operations while providing strong returns. We will continue to explore paths to optimize our portfolio through M&A. We have a disciplined approach which focuses on returns and generation of shareholder value. 
Finally, we're committed to return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In short, we view the cash-generation capabilities of this business as both strong and diverse, and we expect our deployment to deliver strong shareholder return. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Dean."

To grow above the market, our team is focused on working closely with our customers to enable foodservice recovery and support ongoing retail demand. We've also increased investment in value-added capacity expansions and automation technology, which will support increased sales, high-efficiency processing and more agile customer service.

Well, let me start with, as we started the fiscal year, we had one objective, and that was to simply be the best chicken company as we move forward. And we obviously recognized that's not where we were and -- or where we are. And so we began to work on that. 
And as we get into -- as we got into this, we started seeing good results, particularly in Q1. However, in January, we saw -- the recovery slowed down driven by volume constraints due primarily to chick availability from an unexpected decline in hatch. 
The winter storm Yuri affected our operations broadly, significant event. We essentially lost a week across our entire poultry enterprise, and more broadly, across the rest of the businesses as well. 
As a result of these supply shortages, we compensated with outside meat purchases, which has driven our cost up as market price rallied sharply, particularly after the first quarter. At the same time, cost inflation accelerated with grain and the highest in the last 6 years. Wage increases and freight cost also impacted us. And as I mentioned earlier, we contracted a large share of our portfolio in the fall and early winter before the prices began to increase materially. 
We're continuing to deal with turnover and absenteeism. And -- but what I would tell you, despite these headwinds, the fundamentals of our business looking forward are actually quite good. Customer and consumer demand is strong, sustained demand in retail and foodservice recovery with ongoing chicken sandwich promotions. So the outlook in -- alongside the operational improvements that we're making and the pricing opportunities that we have are quite good. 
So -- but very specifically, I think about this business in the 7 levers of this business -- or this business model. And the levers are price. We simply need to be -- to get paid fair market value. We certainly can't eat all the inflation that we're experiencing now. We've got to get volume back under as our business is growing. And we got to get the harvest numbers back up for our business. And we have to continue to get more FP capacity online. 
We've had great improvement in mix. We're still struggling with absenteeism. And then we need to make sure our spend is in balance with the volume at which we're processing. 
And finally, we need to return our live production spread. Our historical spreads to the industry, we need to regain those spreads. 
So what I can tell you is we know where we are really, and we're not happy with where we are. And we fully understand that we can't talk our way through our poor performance. We do have a great plan in place to be the best chicken company, and we've made great progress, and we'll accelerate that in the back half of the year. 
I'll tell you, we have a great team in place. Everybody knows what they're doing. And we're not afraid. We're not discouraged. We're a little bit delayed from the -- some of the winter and some of the activities inflation in Q2, but we're very optimistic about this business as we move forward."

And great role performance, but we're not seeing the -- those maternal characteristics such as egg production and hatch, mainly hatch. And so we've got some of those issues going on. 
But in terms of the weather, it's a little hard in February with the Uri, with the impact of that, with all the power outages and so forth. We had egg sitting on a farm without power. So we saw a loss of embryos as a result of that. 
So from February into March, think about this, those animals that were -- those chicks that were impacted also went through the grow-out cycle. And they had issues as they went through there. So the initial impact was very expensive. But you think about the knock-on effects of that, it's -- those persisted all the way through April, and we're just now clearing ourselves to that. 
But the other side of this or the view of this is they are -- in terms of hatch, it is improving. It will improve marginally as we move forward. As we elevate -- if you think about our business and our breeder performance, we have a spread for the best of the worst. So just elevating and tightening that spread will give us improvement. Seasonally, we'll get a little bit of improvement. And the knock-on effects from the winter storm will give us a little improvement. 
So we're not going to be all the way bright. It will take us time to work the males that we're changing out. We'll have a new male in place everywhere, let's call it fall. And -- but it'll take a full year to see this come back to bright, but we're confident in that. And so that's where we are."

I covered off on a number of those things in terms of -- it will be improving sequentially. But we're changing out of male that, quite frankly, we made a bad decision on. And we'll not be all the way bright until, let's call it midyear of '22, but we'll sequentially get better between between now and then and hatch. That will help us in supply and supply that we, quite frankly, need today. 
We're too dependent on the outside purchase of meat right now. And we've -- the market has run up in there. So it's the ability to pass on that cost in the marketplace is next to impossible. And so we need to get our own animals in place. And by the way, that outside purchase is predominantly breast meat and -- but we have good sales for the back half of the chicken, all the rendered products that come with that. Of course, you see the wing markets that are well over -- that are over $3 right now. 
But in terms of getting to the 5% to 7%, and when I say 5% to 7%, I'm talking about 5% to 7% in a business that's growing, growing top line, growing bottom line. And so we've got to staff the plants. I mean that's an imperative here. And we have to compete with the very best, and competing in this example is we need to have a cost structure that is best in class. And quite frankly, we haven't had that. And -- but we're well on the road. We have -- much like we did in 2008, we have a path forward. We're looking at those big rocks. Most of them would be in labor yield spend. Volume is certainly a big component of that as well. 
And we've got to service customers better. Quite honestly, we have not serviced our customers well in almost, well, 2.5 years. I talked about the SAP cutover and then COVID of last year. And so we got to do that better for our customers, and that certainly helps us. 
And then that puts us in a position to continue to grow our business. We're being very successful right now with growth in the business. And when we service the customer in full all the time across all channels, then we get the opportunity to grow our business at even a higher rate. So all those things are -- all those things that would get you to the 5% to 7% and growing, but it's a fundamental. It's the fundamentals of the business that we have to get in order. And we're very much aware of those. We're very much aware where our gaps are to each one of those cost components. And so -- and we've got a good team working on. So more to come."

If you think about our capital allocation in 3 big planks, first, we've been focused on building financial strength. And that's certainly true. As you pointed out, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is looking good. 
We do have more debt coming due later this year. And of course, we have a term loan that's outstanding. So it's about $1 billion between those 2. 
Then think about investing in the business. M&A is opportunistic. But of course, we have and we'll continue to be pretty disciplined there from a return standpoint. Where you have seen increased capital deployment has been around CapEx. We did earlier this year guide that we would be as high as $1.5 billion. We haven't been able to get some of the projects away as quickly as we have wanted. But you might take away from that early guidance that we have an appetite to invest behind our company in organic kinds of investments. 
And there are lots of strong opportunities in automation and then other profit improvement areas in our business. And notably, lots of opportunity for us to invest in new capacity in our business. We've got a number of new plants that are coming online in the prepared remarks. We talked about 6 different sites in our International business where we're we're investing in new capacity. 
Donnie spoke about a couple of new plants coming online in the U.S., Humboldt just come online. So more capital is going against capacity, and that is needed for a growing business. 
And then lastly, of course, 10 years of dividend growth, we have not been shy to share that cash to shareholders, and we expect to continue to do that in the future. So I think step back, we've got a well-thought-out, well-balanced approach to capital allocation."

But we still see tremendous continued retail strength in Prepared Foods. And with 11 straight quarters of growth in our core business lines, we're able to command a strong presence there. 
And as it relates to pricing, it's -- we are obviously experiencing high input costs from the Pork business. And that will ultimately get passed along. Most of our pricing in retail specifically, we're in a position where we interact with our partner customers quite frequently, and they see what we're experiencing there and we're able to pass some of that on. 
We are -- we do expect in the next half to be increasing map spend. It's going to be a requirement, obviously, to remain competitive in the marketplace. Those investments have paid off in the past, taking us to, as you read and heard, 81% household penetration. That's something that we can leverage long term. 
In Prepared Foods, the other thing to really keep in mind is that foodservice is coming back. So we've mentioned that 75% of the areas which recovered at about 75%. While we've seen about a 10% dropout in restaurants, those are getting backfilled with ghost kitchens and a variety of other creative models that -- and ultimately, in addition to restaurants to fill that void that we think that business is going to recover strong. 
It's a lower-margin business. So we'll see that balancing out not only due to throughput in the restaurants, but also channel-filling as we get prepared for the full recovery. 
And last thing I mentioned about foodservice is that, please keep in mind, it's obviously regional and it's very different across channels. So clearly, we've not seen a recovery in K-12 that we had expected. In some areas of the world that impact our business, specifically in Europe, they're still buckling under the pressures of COVID. So foodservice hasn't recovered quite as much as we'd want. But with that, I'll have Stewart to talk about margin outlook."

As we look at that business, it's a growing category for -- predominantly for our retail customers. 
So we started in late April with FP-type products flowing through Humboldt. It'll be July, late July before we actually are harvesting any animals in Humboldt. It will be incremental. It will help us from a flexibility of our footprint. There is Humboldt are actually all across our fresh portfolio and help us declog and streamline some of our operations. 
Now the question around buy versus grow, we still support buy versus growth. It's still a good program, and we will continue to use that. What I've tried to portray is that we move too far on to buy instead of growing our own. And we were late, quite honestly, to be able to get the animals down and grow. But we started this year. And if you look at the Q1 numbers, we were seeing pretty nice performance in Q1. And then we get into January, and hatch really hit us and then the storm in February. And so we're still processing all of that to understand what it means. 
But long term, we'll be fine. But buy versus grow is still a good strategy. We're just overdependent upon it right now. If you think about the marketplace, historically, the market would be around $1.10, $1.20, maybe even inching up from there for jumbo boneless skinless breast meat. As of Friday, it was $2.11. So pretty significant increase in the market. And so trying to get pricing around that, you got to be -- that's a little tricky. But certainly, all of our models would indicate that growing would be the right course in this market environment."

If I look at some of the differences, if I go back to 2015, for example, our volume -- our harvest volume in pounds sold is flat to 2015. So that's problem one. If you think about in this time frame, we purchased Keystone, which I think it was like 4.5 million chickens a week from that. So we've essentially rationalized that volume through all of our locations. 
Our capacity utilization is in the low 80s from a harvest perspective. So if you -- I mean if you look at the numbers today and you look at a 20% opportunity on top of that with all the latent capacity, there's a lot of upside from a cost perspective as you look at that. 
At the same time, our volumes remain flat, our operational costs have risen, let's call it, a 5% CAGR. We -- on flat volume. And quite honestly, our customers aren't willing to pay for our inefficiencies, and we don't expect them to. 
We've seen pretty significant price increase. If you think from 2015 to 2021, it looks like probably $500 million worth of price decreases because of the market dynamics. And we've had a couple of special events: the SAP cutover in and then COVID-19 in 2020. 
So a long story short, there is -- we got a higher cost then we get lower volume. And you can put together very simplistically what we have to do to get this business right, to get it to 5% to 7%. And then -- and I say 5% to 7%, that's where we're going. But I want to point out that it's 5% through 7% and growing our business, meaning FP business.

But when you break it down at the business level, you're going to see a very different dynamic, obviously, in Prepared Foods been covered that for the back half of the year. 
The only other thing I'd point out just as a modeling tip is the cost of grains has gone up substantially. And even since the beginning of this quarter, you will see the grain has shot up. Think back to the data that we gave you during the prepared remarks for grain cost. In the first quarter, we were sort of $10 million or so higher than last year. In the second quarter, we were $135 million higher than the same quarter last year. That's reflecting that higher cost of grain coming through. 
Yes, we're hedging, but you need -- those hedges sort of roll. So the further you get out at some point, you start actually taking that higher cost of grain. And that's what you're seeing as you look through those numbers. So the second half of the year is going to be bearing grain costs that are a lot higher, and our ability to offset that will be dependent on Donnie's price recovery.

And -- but we're also looking at different shift models so that our workforce today wants us to be able to tell them exactly when they start to work and exactly when they get off. And very few are interested in a 6-day week or a surprise based on customer/consumer demand. 
Of course, we're investing heavily in terms of automation and technology to try to to eliminate the more difficult, higher-turnover jobs. But I would say across Chicken, Beef Pork, Prepared in terms of -- it takes about 6 days right now to get 5 days worth of work done. And so it's impact in capacity and cost."

Before we get started, I'd like to welcome Donnie King to the earnings call and congratulate him on his recent promotion to Chief Operating Officer. I would also like to thank our 140,000 team members for their continued efforts and resilience. They are what makes this company an incredible place to work, and I am proud of their focus on raising the world's expectations for how much good food can do.  
Earlier today, we released our second quarter results for fiscal 2021. We delivered a solid operating earnings performance, recording $739 million in adjusted operating income for the quarter, which represents a 43% increase relative to the same period last year. We delivered $1.34 in adjusted earnings per share, a 68% increase from the same period last year. These results were reinforced by our solid performance in retail, our continuing efforts to ensure the safety of our team members, our partnership with customers to enable recovery and our focused execution to overcome inflationary headwinds. Our results in the quarter reflect our continued focus on team member health and safety. This is our top priority, and I'm proud of the progress that we have made on our comprehensive safety, health and wellness agenda along with our recent vaccine deployment efforts.  
We also saw improvement in the foodservice channel during the quarter. We've been working closely with our customers to support foodservice recovery. As consumer demand patterns continue to create operational complexities, we've taken action to make our organization more responsive to demand signals and customer needs to accelerate our speed to market.  
Agility is increasingly important as we look to extend the gains that we have achieved in the retail channel. We continue to drive retail volume growth across our core business lines. Delivering growth in the recent quarter is particularly notable as we are now comparing to a prior quarter that included some benefit from initial COVID-19 pantry loading.  
As we navigate market volatility and rising inflationary pressures, we're focused on operational excellence and disciplined cost management. Our balance sheet is strong, and we've continued to invest in our business. We have prioritized capacity expansion and automation technology investments and have significantly increased our capital allocated to both of these areas.  
As an example, our Humboldt production facility in Tennessee has recently commenced operations, and our team shipped the first saleable product in late April. To support growth in case-ready beef and pork, we are also excited for the reopening of our Columbia, South Carolina plant as well as the grand opening of our Eagle Mountain, Utah plant, both occurring later this year. We are expanding capacity in our international operations and have 6 sites where new capacity is currently under construction, positioning our international business for continued growth and profitability in the future.  
As we look at the balance of the year, we realized that we had a challenging second half ahead as inflationary pressure has continued to build. We also have several bright spots, notably our performance in the retail channel and the continued strength in our Beef segment. Looking past the inflationary headwinds that are impacting our input costs, I'm confident that our team is executing on the right priorities to meet our commitments and drive shareholder value creation.  
Turning to Slide 4. Team member health and safety is and will continue to be our top priority. Through our partnership with Matrix Medical and our local communities, over 42,000 of our team members have been vaccinated since February. As of today, we've offered on-site vaccination clinics at over 100 locations in more than 30 states.  
We've also launched a pilot project to enhance health and wellness of our team members. This involves the opening of 7 clinics that will enable team members and their families to receive easier access to high-quality health care services. Our first facility opened recently in Newbern, Tennessee.  
Turning now to Slide 5. Our total Tyson and core business lines have posted 11 consecutive quarters of volume and share growth. Notably, our team delivered volume growth in Q2 despite the unusually strong demand associated with pantry loading that occurred during the comparable quarter last year.  
Sales volume for Tyson core business lines are up 12.7%, and total Tyson is up 8.5% in the latest 52 weeks. Our share growth has been the strongest in breakfast sausage, hot dogs, frozen value-added poultry and frozen protein breakfast. Our growth during these periods was driven in large part by our ability to bring incremental households into our brand and product lines. Total Tyson household penetration reached 81% for the latest 52 weeks.  
Also, consumers continue to rely on low-to-no-contact buying methods. As a result, we experienced e-commerce sales growth of 105% in the latest 13 weeks compared with last year. This equated to approximately $425 million of sales through our e-commerce channel partners.  
Turning to Slide 6. Innovation is important to our success in both the retail and food service channels. And we've continued to invest in the launch and scaling of new product innovations. On this slide, we have 3 examples of how our product innovation is tied to meaningful consumer insights. In a recent survey, nearly half of American's expressed dissatisfaction with available plant-based options for the grill. This insight spurred our recent nationwide Raised & Rooted launch, which includes 3 new products to meet increasing demand for plant-based protein options. We're also excited for our recent launch of alternative protein offerings in the Europe and Asia Pacific markets, which will support growing global demand for protein.  
Our Jimmy Dean Breakfast Nuggets are another example of our ability to pair brand and category leadership in frozen breakfast with our unique production capabilities to deliver protein-dense offerings that complement Tyson's current product portfolio.  
Finally, annual servings per capita for breaded chicken sandwiches in restaurants are up 14%, and our products in this space have enabled us to capitalize on the growing popularity.  
Moving to Chart 7. As we continue to navigate complex consumer dynamics overall, we're closely monitoring several factors to effectively engage with our customers and consumers in support of the overall recovery. Protein has remained relevant throughout the pandemic, with 54% of consumers indicating a deliberate intent to increase protein intake within their daily diet and 20% indicating that they are consuming animal protein more often than they were a year ago.  
In addition to overall protein consumption, we're closely monitoring reopening and recovery patterns. Approximately 76% of the U.S. states are now at 75% or more capacity for in-restaurant dining. With vaccine rollouts and consumer mobility improving, away-from-home traffic is gradually increasing on a sequential basis. Currently, QSR and C-stores are leading the recovery as consumers are very comfortable with ordering takeout.  
While we are seeing some challenges in our international markets, progress against COVID domestically should continue to improve consumer confidence and mobility in the second half. The U.S. economy is improving rapidly in part due to government stimulus. While we expect some degree of elevated retail consumption to remain post COVID, our success in growing retail share and driving relevant innovation will allow us to meet the strong demand for protein and serve our customers across all channels.  
I'll now turn the call over to Donnie to walk us through the segment operating results in detail."
190636,711126563,2278279,"Tyson Foods, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, May 10, 2021",2021-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Tyson Foods, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dean. I will start with the Chicken segment performance captured on Slide 8. Sales were $3.6 billion for the second quarter, up 5%. Overall volumes were down in the quarter primarily due to COVID-related production inefficiencies. Severe winter we",1428,"Thanks, Dean. I will start with the Chicken segment performance captured on Slide 8. Sales were $3.6 billion for the second quarter, up 5%. Overall volumes were down in the quarter primarily due to COVID-related production inefficiencies. Severe winter weather also impacted volumes, operating costs and production efficiencies in the quarter.  
Average sales price was up substantially during the period due to the favorable mix and the benefit of higher retail volume. Our reported price improvement also reflects actions that we have taken to cover the inflationary pressure we have experienced from higher grain, labor and freight cost.  
Despite our efforts in the quarter, we did not fully offset the inflationary impacts as a substantial portion of our business is contracted on a fixed annual price basis, with terms negotiated and locked ahead of the recent surge in grain cost.  
Adjusted operating income was $6 million during the second quarter and $110 million for the fiscal year-to-date, down versus both comparable periods. Fiscal year-to-date operating income was negatively impacted by $145 million of higher feed ingredient costs as well as $95 million of increased grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases.  
For the second quarter, feed ingredients were $135 million higher, but grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases were $60 million higher. Segment performance also reflects net derivative gains during the second quarter of $40 million and $110 million for the fiscal year-to-date, both versus the respective comparable periods. These gains are associated with realized gains as well as open positions.  
Last quarter, we shared our imperatives for improving Chicken operating results, which are captured on Slide 9. Our goal has not changed. We remain committed to restoring top-tier performance. The first imperative is related to being the employer of choice. Despite implementing pay rate increases, we continue to deal with elevated absenteeism and turnover. We are implementing a range of initiatives to improve the team member experience and achieve the status of the employer of choice, including flexible work schedules and a competitive wage rate. At this time, we estimate our average base pay plus benefits for domestic production workers is valued at over $22 per hour.  
The second imperative relates to our strategy to improve overall operational performance. Although we have made some progress improving our plant performance, we're not where we plan to be at this stage. Our strategy to improve our operational performance includes restoring our production volume to full capacity. However, we have struggled to raise the harvest to full capacity due to upstream supply issues, including issues caused by lower hatchability rates.  
Consequently, we have offset raw material shortages with outside meat purchases at a higher level than we have historically. With the recent move in market prices, our cost disadvantage from outside purchases has widened. To compensate for cost headwind, we are working to recover our historical advantage on live costs, reduce the number of pounds we are sourcing in the open market and to increase our plant efficiency as we gradually store volume over the balance of the year.  
The final imperative relates to serving our customers. Our focus is to deliver the highest levels of service to our customers, especially with respect to order fill rates. When our customers are successful, we are successful. We are sustaining share gains in retail value added as we start to lap the COVID-19 surge and are also leading foodservice recovery and growth. At the same time, our sales team is working to recover raw material and supply chain cost inflation via pricing.  
To sum all these imperatives is a restoration of our Chicken business to top-tier competitiveness and the coveted position of being our customers' go-to supplier. Acknowledging the uncertainty associated with the continued COVID-19 recovery, we are increasingly confident in our ability to bring our adjusted operating income margin back to at least 5% to 7% range over time.  
Moving to Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.2 billion for the quarter, up 4% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was down 4% in the quarter as growth in the retail channel was offset by a reduction in foodservice volumes. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by the partial pass-through of raw material costs, lower commercial spending and better sales mix.  
Segment operating income was $217 million for the quarter, up 14% versus prior year. For the first half, operating income was $483 million, up 30%. Operating margins for the segment were 10% for the second quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points versus the comparable period. Improvement in operating income was driven by the mix benefit of strong retail performance, lower commercial spending and pricing pass-throughs, which more than offset higher operating and raw material costs.  
In the second half, demand is expected to remain elevated at retail, with volumes continuing to exceed pre-COVID levels and foodservice showing sequential improvement. Overall, we're seeing an accelerating inflationary environment that is creating a meaningful headwind for Prepared Foods in the back half of the year.  
We're seeing raw material costs up over 15% as well as increases in logistics, packaging and labor. To offset inflationary pressure, we're focused on pricing, revenue management, commercial spend optimization while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through marketing and trade support.  
Moving to the Beef segment. Segment sales were approximately $4 billion for the quarter, up 2% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers include a strong domestic and export demand for beef products, with average sales price up 7.5% for the quarter. Sales volume for the quarter was down due to the severe winter weather and production inefficiencies related to the challenging labor environment.  
Segment operating income was $445 million for the quarter. Operating income improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cutout, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. Operating margin for the segment improved 790 basis points to 11% for the second quarter. 
Our Beef segment performance has been driven by favorable supply and demand dynamics, which look to persist deeper into the year. On beef supply, slightly higher domestic production for the calendar year is being more than offset by lower imports and higher exports, resulting in lower projected domestic availability for the full year. Adequate supply, coupled with continued strong domestic and export demand with sustained cutout values in our strong segment results.  
Now let's move on to Pork segment on Slide 12. Second quarter results reflect the benefit of strong retail demand and higher exports, which were more than offset by higher hog cost and operating expenses. Segment sales were $1.5 billion for the quarter, up 17% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to stronger demand, partially offset by lower volumes due to production inefficiencies. Average sales price increased by over 17%, while volumes were down slightly relative to the same period last year.  
Segment adjusted operating income was $67 million for the quarter, down 28% versus the comparable period. Overall operating margins for the segment declined by 280 basis points to 4.5% for the quarter. The operating income decline was driven by lower volumes, higher hog costs and increased labor and freight cost.  
To improve our operating income results for the segment, we have implemented several actions to alleviate production constraints and to improve our volume throughput.  
As we look ahead, we are closely monitoring hog supply estimates. Recent USDA projections show a historically sharp drop in hog supply. The sharp decline in supply and strong demand for certain pork items have pushed the cutout up 59% from the end of December. As it stands now, pork cutout is at the highest level for this time of year since 2014.  
Looking at the overall calendar year. Lower projected 2021 pork production and continued robust consumer demand are expected to support hog prices at well above 2020 levels.  
Finally, Slide 13 captures some highlights related to our International business. We continue to invest behind our international platform, which provides an opportunity to grow our sales and our margin by leveraging global production capabilities to see consumers abroad. We're using our One Tyson framework to identify opportunities to maximize the value of our products and capabilities from farm to table at a global level. Our existing depth of experience in protein production, brand management and global customer relationships creates the right recipe for growth and positions us with the right to win internationally.  
I'll now turn the call over to Stewart to provide additional detail on our financial performance."

We're pleased with our year-over-year growth in sales, adjusted operating income and earnings per share. We performed well despite a challenging operating environment that spanned tough labor availability, significant inflationary pressures in raw material costs, global supply chain challenges and an evolving demand backdrop. 
Adjusted operating income was up 43% during the second quarter due to strong performance in our Beef business, along with growth in Prepared Foods earnings, partially offset by softness in Chicken and Pork. For the first half of fiscal 2021, we delivered adjusted operating income growth of 32%. Adjusted EPS grew nearly 70% during the second quarter driven by higher operating income. Fiscal year-to-date adjusted EPS was up 41% on a year-to-date basis. 
Slide 15 bridges our total company sales for the first half. Ongoing retail strength drove much of our sales results. We delivered growth across all our reporting segments in the retail channel. Overall, retail accounted for $700 million in sales improvement during the first half and over $260 million in the second quarter versus comparable periods. 
Moving to foodservice. Sales declined over $400 million in the first half compared to the same period last year but improved $69 million in the second quarter. Foodservice recovery was most evident during the second quarter in higher Chicken and Prepared Foods sales versus the same period last year. 
Our foodservice mix in chicken indexes to QSRs, which saw volumes above pre-COVID levels during the period. In Prepared Foods, we are seeing recovery in foodservice foot traffic and strong sales into the distribution channel. 
Exports were up over 5% versus the comparable period, led by Beef where sales improved nearly $100 million for the first half. China is a key driver of beef export strength. 
Lastly, we've seen some strength in industrial, particularly in pork as renewable fuels continue to drive growth in fat and oils demand. In addition, the pace and shape of foodservice recovery will affect the composition of our channel and segment sales in the second half of the fiscal year. 
Slide 16 shows the bridge for adjusted operating income for the first half. Lower volumes, primarily from production inefficiencies and foodservice were $100 million headwind on gross margin in the first half. Price/mix benefited during the first half from price recovery of raw material cost inflation, improved mix, strong Beef segment performance and continued retail strength across segments. Adjusted operating income was burdened by $664 million in cost of goods sold pressure for the period. This amount reflects significant raw material and supply chain cost inflation. 
Of the total, feed ingredients, grower costs and outside meat purchases associated with the Chicken segment contributed $240 million of pressure. Other large contributors included freight and labor costs. Year-to-date, SG&A benefited from the $54 million loss in fiscal 2020 compared to a $55 million gain in fiscal 2021, associated with the capital supplier [ front ] and certain reductions in trade spend and travel costs.
Slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Given continued strength in the Beef segment and our expectations for ongoing foodservice recovery, we are raising our sales guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver annual revenues in the range of $44 billion to $46 billion. This guidance reflects our expectation of partial price recovery relative to continued feed ingredient and supply chain cost inflation. At the segment level, we expect our directional annual guidance of lower operating margins in Chicken and Pork versus the prior year to hold. Because of stronger-than-expected performance in Beef and current market conditions, we are raising our guidance on the Beef segment. We now expect segment earnings to be up versus prior year. 
Finally, we are lowering our guidance in Prepared Foods due to back half inflationary pressures and now expect the segment's earnings to be flat versus the prior year. Risks to this guidance include freight rates, labor cost, grain costs in the Chicken segment, raw material costs for our Prepared Foods business and continued export market strength along with price volatility in commodity meats. 
Our capital expenditures outlook of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion remains unchanged, but we now expect to be at the lower end of the range. Net interest expense is expected to be lower than our previous outlook at approximately $420 million. This update reflects an incremental term loan repayment of $750 million relative to our prior guidance that resulted in the early payoff of our $1.5 billion term loan, offset by $500 million of new indebtedness associated with a new bilateral term loan facility. 
Our outlook on effective tax rate is unchanged. We will continue to monitor the potential implications of any new legislation but do not currently expect to see impacts to our adjusted rate this fiscal year. 
Our expectations related to liquidity are also unchanged. As we noted last quarter, liquidity decreased from $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, ending the second quarter at $2.6 billion. 
Finally, our COVID-related costs, which totaled $95 million in the quarter are now expected to be approximately $365 million for the year. 
Turning to Slide 18. With our strong operational performance for the first half of 2021, we've seen an increase in operating cash flows. We have prioritized deleveraging through the first half, consistent with our priority to maintain a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility. Investing organically in our business has been an important priority, which will increase our production capacity and our market capabilities as well as modernize our operations while providing strong returns. We will continue to explore paths to optimize our portfolio through M&A. We have a disciplined approach, which focuses on returns and generation of shareholder value. 
Finally, we're committed to return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In short, we view the cash-generation capabilities of this business as both strong and diverse. And we expect our deployment to deliver strong shareholder return.

And we obviously recognized that's not where we were and -- or where we are. And so we began to work",535,"Sure. Well, let me start with, as we started the fiscal year, we had one objective, and that was to simply be the best chicken company as we move forward. And we obviously recognized that's not where we were and -- or where we are. And so we began to work on that. 
And as we get into -- as we got into this, we started seeing good results, particularly in Q1. However, in January, we saw -- the recovery slowed down driven by volume constraints due primarily to chick availability from an unexpected decline in hatch. 
The winter storm Yuri affected our operations broadly, a significant event. We essentially lost a week across our entire poultry enterprise and, more broadly, across the rest of the businesses as well. 
As a result of these supply shortages, we compensated with outside meat purchases, which has driven our cost up as market price rallied sharply, particularly after the first quarter. At the same time, cost inflation accelerated with grain and the highest in the last 6 years. Wage increases and freight cost also impacted us. And as I mentioned earlier, we contracted a large share of our portfolio in the fall and early winter before the prices began to increase materially. 
We're continuing to deal with turnover and absenteeism. And -- but what I would tell you, despite these headwinds, the fundamentals of our business looking forward are actually quite good. Customer and consumer demand is strong, sustained demand in retail and foodservice recovery with ongoing chicken sandwich promotions. So the outlook in -- alongside the operational improvements that we're making and the pricing opportunities that we have are quite good. 
So -- but very specifically, I think about this business in the 7 levers of this business -- or this business model. And the levers are price. We simply need to be -- to get paid fair market value. We certainly can't eat all the inflation that we're experiencing now. We've got to get volume back under as our business is growing. And we got to get the harvest numbers back up for our business. And we have to continue to get more FP capacity online. 
We've had great improvement in mix. We're still struggling with absenteeism. And then we need to make sure our spend is in balance with the volume at which we're processing. 
And finally, we need to return our live production spread. Our historical spreads to the industry, we need to regain those spreads. 
So what I can tell you is we know where we are really, and we're not happy with where we are. And we fully understand that we can't talk our way through our poor performance. We do have a great plan in place to be the best chicken company, and we've made great progress. And we'll accelerate that in the back half of the year. 
I'll tell you, we have a great team in place. Everybody knows what they're doing. And we're not afraid. We're not discouraged. We're a little bit delayed from the -- some of the winter and some of the activities inflation in Q2, but we're very optimistic about this business as we move forward."

We changed one of the males that we were using in our business. And great role performance, but we're not seeing the -- those maternal characteristics such as egg production and hatch, mainly hatch. And so we've got some of those issues going on. 
But in terms of the weather, it's a little hard in February with the Uri, with the impact of that, with all the power outages and so forth. We had egg sitting on a farm without power. So we saw a loss of embryos as a result of that. 
So from February into March, think about this: those animals that were -- those chicks that were impacted also went through the grow-out cycle. And they had issues as they went through there. So the initial impact was very expensive. But you think about the knock-on effects of that, it's -- those persisted all the way through April, and we're just now clearing ourselves to that. 
But the other side of this or the view of this is they are -- in terms of hatch, it is improving. It will improve marginally as we move forward. As we elevate -- if you think about our business and our breeder performance, we have a spread for the best to the worst. So just elevating and tightening that spread will give us improvement. Seasonally, we'll get a little bit of improvement. And the knock-on effects from the winter storm will give us a little improvement. 
So we're not going to be all the way bright. It will take us time to work with the males that we're changing out. We'll have a new male in place everywhere. Let's call it fall. And -- but it'll take a full year to see this come back to bright, but we're confident in that. And so that's where we are."

And we'll not be all the way bright until, let's call it midyear of '22, but will sequentially get better between  now and then and hatch. That will help us in supply and supply that we, quite frankly, need today. 
We're too dependent on the outside purchase of meat right now. And we've -- the market has run up in there. So it's the ability to pass on that cost in the marketplace is next to impossible. And so we need to get our own animals in place. And by the way, that outside purchase is predominantly breast meat and -- but we have good sales for the back half of the chicken, all the rendered products that come with that. Of course, you see the wing markets that are well over -- that are over $3 right now. 
But in terms of getting to the 5% to 7%, and when I say 5% to 7%, I'm talking about 5% to 7% in a business that's growing, growing top line, growing bottom line. And so we've got to staff the plants. I mean that's an imperative here. And we have to compete with the very best, and competing in this example is we need to have a cost structure that is best in class. And quite frankly, we haven't had that. And -- but we're well on the road. We have -- much like we did in 2008, we have a path forward. We're looking at those big rocks. Most of them would be in labor yield spend. Volume is certainly a big component of that as well. 
And we've got to service customers better. Quite honestly, we have not serviced our customers well in almost, well, 2.5 years. I talked about the SAP cutover and then COVID of last year. And so we got to do that better for our customers. And that certainly helps us. 
And then that puts us in a position to continue to grow our business. We're being very successful right now with growth in the business. And when we service the customer in full all the time across all channels, then we get the opportunity to grow our business at even a higher rate. So all those things are -- all those things that would get you to the 5% to 7% and growing, but it's a fundamental. It's the fundamentals of the business that we have to get in order. And we're very much aware of those. We're very much aware where our gaps are to each one of those cost components. And so -- and we've got a good team working on it. So more to come."

We do have more debt coming due later this year. And of course, we have a term loan that's outstanding. So it's about $1 billion between those 2. 
Then think about investing in the business. M&A is opportunistic. But of course, we have and we'll continue to be pretty disciplined there from a return standpoint. Where you have seen increased capital deployment has been around CapEx. We did earlier this year guide that we would be as high as $1.5 billion. We haven't been able to get some of the projects away as quickly as we have wanted. But you might take away from that early guidance that we have an appetite to invest behind our company in organic kinds of investments. 
And there are lots of strong opportunities in automation and then other profit improvement areas in our business. And notably, lots of opportunity for us to invest in new capacity in our business. We've got a number of new plants that are coming online in the prepared remarks. We talked about 6 different sites in our International business where we're  investing in new capacity. 
Donnie spoke about a couple of new plants coming online in the U.S., Humboldt just come online. So more capital is going against capacity, and that is needed for a growing business. 
And then lastly, of course, 10 years of dividend growth, we have not been shy to share that cash with shareholders, and we expect to continue to do that in the future. So I think step back, we've got a well-thought-out, well-balanced approach to capital allocation."

And as it relates to pricing, it's -- we are obviously experiencing high input costs from the Pork business. And that will ultimately get passed along. Most of our pricing in retail specifically, we're in a position where we interact with our partner customers quite frequently, and they see what we're experiencing there and we're able to pass some of that on. 
We are -- we do expect in the next half to be increasing map spend. It's going to be a requirement obviously to remain competitive in the marketplace. Those investments have paid off in the past, taking us to, as you read and heard, 81% household penetration. That's something that we can leverage long term. 
In Prepared Foods, the other thing to really keep in mind is that foodservice is coming back. So we've mentioned that 75% of the areas which we cover recovered at about 75%. While we've seen about a 10% dropout in restaurants, those are getting backfilled with ghost kitchens and a variety of other creative models that -- and ultimately, in addition to restaurants to fill that void that we think that business is going to recover strong. 
It's a lower-margin business. So we'll see that balancing out not only due to throughput in the restaurants, but also channel-filling as we get prepared for the full recovery. 
And last thing I mentioned about foodservice is that, please keep in mind, it's obviously regional and it's very different across channels. So clearly, we've not seen a recovery in K-12 that we had expected. In some areas of the world that impact our business, specifically in Europe, they're still buckling under the pressures of COVID. So foodservice hasn't recovered quite as much as we'd want.

As we look at that business, it's a growing category for -- predominantly for our retail customers.

It will help us from a flexibility of our footprint. There is Humboldt, are actually all across our fresh portfolio and help us declog and streamline some of our operations. 
Now the question around buy versus grow, we still support buy versus growth. It's still a good program, and we will continue to use that. What I've tried to portray is that we move too far on to buy instead of growing our own. And we were late, quite honestly, to be able to get the animals down and grow. But we started this year. And if you look at the Q1 numbers, we were seeing pretty nice performance in Q1. And then we get into January, and hatch really hit us and then the storm in February. And so we're still processing all of that to understand what it means.

If you think about the marketplace, historically, the market would be around $1.10, $1.20, maybe even inching up from there for jumbo boneless skinless breast meat. As of Friday, it was $2.11. So pretty significant increase in the market. And so trying to get pricing around that. You got to be -- that's a little tricky. But certainly, all of our models would indicate that growing would be the right course in this market environment."

The good news/bad news is that we've been down this road before. If I look at some of the differences, if I go back to 2015, for example, our volume -- our harvest volume in pounds sold is flat to 2015. So that's problem one. If you think about in this time frame, we purchased Keystone, which I think it was like 4.5 million chickens a week from that. So we've essentially rationalized that volume through all of our locations. 
Our capacity utilization is in the low 80s from a harvest perspective. So if you -- I mean if you look at the numbers today and you look at a 20% opportunity on top of that with all the latent capacity, there's a lot of upside from a cost perspective as you look at that. 
At the same time, our volumes remain flat, our operational costs have risen, let's call it, a 5% CAGR. We -- on flat volume. And quite honestly, our customers aren't willing to pay for our inefficiencies, and we don't expect them to. 
We've seen pretty significant price increase. If you think from 2015 to 2021, it looks like probably $500 million worth of price decreases because of the market dynamics. And we've had a couple of special events: the SAP cutover in and then COVID-19 in 2020. 
So a long story short, there is -- we got a higher cost then we get lower volume. And you can put together very simplistically what we have to do to get this business right, to get it to 5% to 7%. And then -- and I say 5% to 7%, that's where we're going. But I want to point out that it's 5% through 7% and growing our business, meaning FP business. It could be -- it would mean harvesting animals to support that business. And so we think we got a lot of upside, and the future looks a lot brighter than it does today."

First of all, you already point out that the mix is a big impact. Place to go for press a little bit more detail is an acute in the segment detail in Note 14 because you're going to be able to take away from that chart that a heavy influence on this number is Beef. And that is why you're going to see the movement looking like you're getting coverage, which you are in total. But when you break it down at the business level, you're going to see a very different dynamic, obviously. And Prepared Foods has been covered that for the back half of the year. 
The only other thing I'd point out just as a modeling tip is the cost of grains has gone up substantially. And even since the beginning of this quarter, you will see the grain has shot up. Think back to the data that we gave you during the prepared remarks for grain cost. In the first quarter, we were sort of $10 million or so higher than last year. In the second quarter, we were $135 million higher than the same quarter last year. That's reflecting that higher cost of grain coming through. 
Yes, we're hedging, but you need -- those hedges sort of roll. So the further you get out at some point, you start actually taking that higher cost of grain. And that's what you're seeing as you look through those numbers. So the second half of the year is going to be bearing grain costs that are a lot higher, and our ability to offset that will be dependent on Donnie's price recovery. But we've given you our best estimates in the guidance that we've laid out. There are some areas of fairly significant inflation in the back half."

As many of you know, I've been a Tyson team member for close to 4 decades. And in that time, I've led every business segment. We've always believed in our mission and the vision of John W. Tyson, who founded this company nearly a century",1650,"Thank you, Megan. As many of you know, I've been a Tyson team member for close to 4 decades. And in that time, I've led every business segment. We've always believed in our mission and the vision of John W. Tyson, who founded this company nearly a century ago because he wanted to find a better way to feed a growing country. 
Today, on my first earnings call as CEO, I am incredibly proud to stand alongside our team members to continue that legacy. It's an interesting time to be in this industry and we have a leadership team that together can capitalize on the strengths of this company and the opportunities ahead. 
Let's begin with a view of our overall performance this quarter. First, our retail performance. 12 consecutive quarters of retail share gains in our core business lines. It's driven by strength of our brands, along with solid execution from our team. We are in a market that has demonstrated strong demand for protein and people are reaching most for brands they trust. Our billion-dollar brands: Tyson, Jimmy D and Hillshire Farms have driven strong share growth with consumers buying more than ever before. 
Second, we saw in the third quarter growing volume in foodservice channel as reopening and recovery continue. We saw uptake from outlets nationwide, reflected in our sales, which we were up $1.3 billion for the quarter. Our broad production and distribution work is well positioned to meet this growing demand. 
Third, the diversity of our portfolio demonstrated its value during the quarter. Led by Beef, we delivered an exceptional result as a strong U.S. export demand, coupled with ample cattle supply, supported elevated margins in that business. 
Fourth, we continue to build financial strength. This quarter, we used higher operating cash flow to reduce debt. The steps we've taken position us with a very strong balance sheet and high levels of liquidity. 
And finally, we are investing in future growth across our portfolio. We're in the process of bringing 12 new plants online globally to address capacity constraints and growing demand. In all, Tyson delivered a strong quarter. As we look to the future, we want to build on these strengths. 
Let's look at how we plan to do that. First, we have built a solid footing to drive consistent results. Our strengths include a diverse portfolio, well-known, trusted brands, scale in meaningful markets and an exceptionally strong balance sheet. Second, labor is our #1 challenge, so we have continued our focus on improving our team member experience without optimizing their health and safety. We are accelerating efforts to make Tyson the most sought after place to work because we know how important team members are to our business. 
One of the way that we're doing this is to accelerate our investments in automation and technology. This not only helps us to eliminate more difficult, hard-to-fill tasks but also reskill our labor profile to enable their contribution to more value-added activities. 
Third, we are actively working to recover volume from pandemic close. And in doing so, improve the reliability we offer our customers. Dynamic and evolving channel demand continues to create operational complexities. We took steps earlier this year to make our organization more responsive to demand signals and to accelerate our speed to market by getting our sales teams closer to their customers. There is more to do, however, and so our work here continues. 
Fourth, our focus on operational excellence and disciplined cost management is especially important during periods of continued market volatility and increasing inflationary pressures. As you will hear today, we continue to be laser-focused in making progress in restoring the competitiveness of our Chicken segment. We are also accelerating actions across our enterprise to become more operationally excellent. 
Finally, we will continue to optimize our balance sheet, which will give us optionality as we prioritize the delivery of shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 5. We improved our sales and earnings performance this quarter. The results demonstrate the benefit of our multi-protein multichannel portfolio. Sales improved 25% in third quarter and 8% year-to-date, reflecting the improved volumes, which are up 10% for the quarter and flat year-to-date. It also reflects effective pricing strategies in all of our segments during this inflationary environment. 
We delivered strong operating earnings performance, resulting in approximately $1.4 billion in operating income for the quarter. This represents an 81% increase compared to prior year and translates to $2.70 in earnings per share. 
Our earnings reflect our 3 key priorities: one, to be the go-to supplier for customers and consumers; two, to be the most sought after place to work; and three, to be operationally excellent. We want to be the most sought after place to work. This starts with an unrelenting focus on safety every minute, every shift, every day. 
Health and safety have been and will continue to be our top priority. We have a history of using all the tools at our disposal to protect our team members and the vaccine is no different. As many of you will have seen, last week, we announced that Tyson will require COVID-19 vaccinations for our entire U.S. workforce by November 1. We do this now because the Delta variant is more contagious and getting vaccinated is the single most effective thing people can do to protect themselves, their families and their communities. 
We have raised wages in many markets to ensure we're competitive and are exploring other ways to make Tyson the most sought after place to work in the communities where we operate. For example, we are piloting childcare facilities at some of our plants, and we have opened medical clinics to make health care more accessible to team members and their families. 
Finally, we are accelerating investments in automation and advanced technologies to make team members' jobs easier. We look forward to providing more detail on automation and technology road map at our upcoming Investor Day. 
We're taking aggressive actions to add new capacity to meet demand, adjust our product mix by plant and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. We're listening to our customers and are committed to improving reliability of supply. 
In the third quarter, we improved volume levels across all segments. In Prepared Foods, we continue to optimize our product portfolio, remove processing and supply chain complexity and prioritize products with the highest demand, resulting in lower cost and better service to our customers. 
In Beef, ample cattle supply, heavier animal weights and strong demand have driven volumes higher year-to-date. In Pork, our volumes are up year-to-date versus pandemic lows. We are pleased to have additional capacity coming online at Eagle Mountain, Utah and Columbia, South Carolina. Both facilities are expected to grow our prepackaged beef and pork products. 
In Chicken, volume declined year-to-date despite improved food service demand led by QSRs. We also saw a sustained retail demand, including the frozen value-added poultry category. Limited capacity and persistent labor challenges have impacted customer fill rates in this segment. However, our new plant in Humboldt, Tennessee continues to ramp up production, including harvest capacity. This ramp-up is helping us improve customer fill rates. 
Chicken remains a top priority for me and for our company. We continue to execute against our road map to bring operating income margin to at least the 5% to 7% range by mid fiscal '22. Our goal has not changed and we remain committed to restoring top-tier performance. We are making progress. The first imperative is to be the most sought after place to work. 
I've outlined the investments we're making to enhance our team member experience in my earlier comments. The second imperative is to improve operational performance. Last quarter, we highlighted the impact of lower hatch rates on our chicken operations. We have begun to deploy new mail parent stock where the stock has been deployed, hatch rates are improving. 
We expect the full rollout of this breeder stock to be complete this fall with harvest capacity improvements occurring by mid fiscal '22. Our rate of outside meat purchases has declined 25% versus last quarter and will continue to decline as hatch rates and utilization improve. We have identified opportunities to reduce mix complexity across our chicken footprint, which will help us operate more efficiently. 
The final imperative is to service our customers on time and in full. We're pleased by the continued share performance of our value-added products like Tyson Chicken Nuggets, Crispy Strips and Air Freight. We gained share during the third quarter in the last 52 weeks. 
Looking ahead, we expect further growth. And as a result, we're investing in line upgrades and increased capacity to drive branded product growth. We have increased prices to help offset significant raw material and supply chain cost inflation. Pricing improved nearly 16% in the quarter versus the comparable period last year. 
We will staff our plants, service our customers, grow our business and be the best chicken company, period. Part of being customer-centric means being as efficient as possible in taking cost out where you can without compromising our ability to execute against our strategic and operational priorities. 
We have ongoing efforts across the business to reduce costs, but we must also find new innovative ways to be better and stronger. This means investing in advances like automation and artificial intelligence to deliver productivity gains and have already delivered strong productivity gains in fiscal year '21. Across our business, we are looking to build upon the strength of those actions in the months and years to come, which we will detail at the Investor Day later this year. 
These improvements come at a time when we are investing heavily in capacity expansions across segments to better partner with our customers and meet long-term demand. I'll now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail."

Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. Sales were up approximately 25% in the third quarter.

Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. Sales were up approximately 25% in the third quarter. Volumes were up 9.7%, primarily due to strength in retail and the ongoing food service recovery. Average sales price was also up about 17%, largely due to strong results in our Beef segment the mix benefit from retail volume and a partial recovery of raw material inflation in net sales price. 
Operating income was up 81% in the third quarter due to continued strong performance in our Beef business. Chicken and Prepared Foods also improved their respective segment earnings while pork earnings were down versus the comparable period a year ago. 
Year-to-date, operating income for the total company improved by 49%. Earnings per share grew 93% in the third quarter due largely to strength in operating income, specifically within our Beef segment. EPS is up 61% on a year-to-date basis. 
We performed well despite a challenging operating environment that spans tough labor availability, significant inflation pressures on raw material costs, global supply chain challenges and an evolving demand backdrop on all reporting segments, which, in aggregate, accounted for more than $1 billion in sales improvement over the year-to-date period and more than $300 million in the third quarter versus the respective comparable periods. 
Moving to foodservice. Sales improved by approximately $1.3 billion in the third quarter, leading to a year-to-date improvement for the channel of nearly $1 billion compared to the same period last year versus the comparable period, led by Beef where sales improved by more than $350 million on a year-to-date basis, driver of Beef export strength. 
We've also seen some strength in industrial, particularly in Beef and Pork. And finally, year-to-date sales grew [ 79 ] [indiscernible] in our international business. This business is a growth priority for Tyson and we continue to invest to develop in new markets to meet growing global consumer demand for protein products. 
Current capacity expansions across 7 international locations are expected to dramatically increase our fully -- These investments are fully aligned -- And when complete, will enhance our international processing capacity by close to 30% versus fiscal 2020. Overall, we're pleased with the company's top line [indiscernible] 
We are carefully managing the current inflationary pressures through pricing actions as well as commercial and operational excellence with emphasis on productivity and cost. We know that our price recovery efforts relative to inflation must be matched by equal aggressiveness on productivity. 
Slide [indiscernible] production inefficiencies and low labor availability resulted flat to the comparable period a year ago. However, we are encouraged by the volume improvement we are seeing across our segments in the third quarter. Mix benefited substantially in the year-to-date period from price recovery of raw material cost inflation, improved mix, strong Beef segment performance and continued retail strength across segments. 
Operating income was partially offset by $2.2 billion in increased cost of goods sold for the period, reflecting meaningful inflation in raw material and supply chain costs. Feed ingredients, labor, packaging and freight are all key components of this COGS increase, which we're working to mitigate. 
On a comparative basis, SG&A benefited from the $56 million loss in the year-to-date fiscal 2020 period as compared to a $55 million gain in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 associated with the cattle supplier incident. This was in addition to certain reductions in trade spend and travel costs. 
Moving into the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $3.5 billion for the third quarter, up 12%. Volumes were also up in the quarter due to continued strength in retail, improving demand through foodservice and segment-wide operational improvements. These were partially offset by COVID-related production inefficiencies. 
Average sales price was up 15% in the quarter due to favorable mix, sustained retail volume and strong supply and demand fundamentals. Our reported price improvement also reflects actions we took to cover the inflationary pressure seen from higher grain, labor and freight costs. 
Our conversations with customers on widespread inflationary pressures have been productive. We'll continue to partner with customers to ensure we receive a fair return on our products while working to deliver service levels and fill rates that meet or exceed their expectations. 
Operating income was $27 million in the third quarter and $137 million on a fiscal year-to-date basis, both stronger than comparable periods a year ago. This represents an operating margin of 1.3% year-to-date. 
Fiscal year-to-date operating income was negatively impacted by $410 million of higher feed ingredient costs as well as $210 million of increased grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases. For the third quarter, feed ingredients were $270 million higher, while grow out expenses and outside meat purchases were $110 million higher. 
Segment performance also reflects net derivative gains during the third quarter of $125 million and $235 million on a year-to-date basis, both versus the respective comparable periods. These results are associated with realized gains as well as open positions. 
Moving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 14% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was up 4.5% in the quarter, with strength in the retail channel and continued recovery in foodservice. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by the pass-through of raw material costs, lower commercial spending and better sales mix. 
Segment operating income was $150 million for the quarter, up over 3% versus the prior year. Year-to-date operating income was $633 million, up 23% versus the prior year period. Operating margins for the segment was 6.5% for the third quarter, a decline of 60 basis points versus the comparable year ago period. 
The slowdown in segment operating margins versus the same quarter last year were driven by significant increases in raw material input costs. However, on a year-to-date basis, our operating margin of 9.6% was up 170 basis points versus last year driven by favorable pricing and lower commercial spend. 
Demand for the balance of the year is expected to remain elevated at retail with volumes continuing to exceed pre-COVID levels and foodservice continuing to recover. During the third quarter, core business lines experienced volume share growth of 90 basis points, while dollar share grew 70 basis points. 
We continue to believe that the ongoing inflationary environment will create a meaningful headwind in for Prepared Foods in the upcoming quarter. Raw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging and labor are all challenging our cost of production. To offset inflationary pressure, we're focused on pricing, revenue management and commercial spend optimization while ensuring the continued build of brand equity through marketing and trade support. 
Moving to the Beef segment. Segment sales were over $4.9 billion for the quarter, up 36% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers included strong domestic and export demand for beef products with average sales price up 12% for the quarter. We had ample livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies. 
Mounting drought conditions in the Western United States cattle growing region as well as elevated costs for grain also drove some cattle supply liquidation. We have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal '22 and and currently believe it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs. 
Sales volume for the quarter was up year-over-year due to continued strong demand in contrast to a soft comparable period a year ago, driven by lower production volumes. We delivered segment operating income of $1.1 billion for the quarter. This improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cutout, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. 
Operating margins for the segment improved 520 basis points to 22.6% for the third quarter. While our Beef segment experienced tremendous results on a year-to-date basis, we're still not at optimal levels of capacity throughput within our beef plants due to labor challenges. Meanwhile, drought conditions and elevated grain prices are creating incremental costs and risks for cattle producers. Until these conditions stabilize and within the constraints I've mentioned, we will work to maximize our beef processing capacity to provide a reliable outlet for our livestock farmers and adequate product supply for customers and consumers. 
Now let's move on to the Pork segment on Slide 16. Third quarter results reflect higher hog costs and operating expenses that weren't fully offset through for cut out. Segment sales were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 54% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand partially offset by a challenging labor environment. Average sales price increased more than 39%, while volumes were also up relative to the same period last year. 
Segment operating income was $67 million for the quarter, down 37% versus the comparable period. Overall, Operating margins for the segment declined by 570 basis points to 3.9% for the quarter. The operating income decline was driven by higher hog costs and increased labor and freight costs. Through the end of this calendar year, lower projected 2021 Pork production and strong consumer demand are expected to support hog prices well above 2020 levels. 
Slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Given the continued strength in our Beef segment and ongoing inflationary pressures that are partially being recovered through price, we're raising our sales guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver annual revenues in the range of $46 billion to $47 billion. At the segment level, we expect our directional annual guidance to hold. Key risks to this guidance include freight rates, labor cost and availability, grain costs in the Chicken segment, raw material costs for each of our businesses and continued export market strength along with price volatility in commodity meats. 
We're slightly realizing our outlook on effective tax rate to approximately 22.5%. We'll continue to monitor the potential implications of new legislation but we do not currently expect to see impacts to our adjusted rate this fiscal year. While our expectations related to liquidity are also unchanged, liquidity during the third quarter improved substantially to $3.4 billion and has since benefited from $1.2 billion of pretax proceeds from the divestiture of our patriates business in early July. Finally, we expect our covered related costs, which totaled $55 million in the quarter to be approximately $325 million for the year. As a reminder, some of the costs that were previously described as COVID-related have evolved to become structural. 
Turning to Slide 18. In pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we have substantially delevered our business over the past 12 months, reducing leverage to 1.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Investing organically in our business will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities. 
Each of these levers individually and in aggregate, will support strong return generation for our shareholders. We will also continue to explore costs to optimize our portfolio through M&A through the lens of value creation and shareholder return. Finally, we are committed to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. In short, we view the cash generation capabilities of this business is both strong and diverse, and we expect our capital allocation framework to deliver solid returns for our shareholders in the future. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Donnie."

As we think about -- as we look forward, the fundamentals of our business look good going forward. And we have a strong retail and foodservice demand. We haven't changed our approach. Chicken is is our top priority for me and for our company. We continue to execute our plan. That hasn't changed and that starts with staffing our plants and servicing our customers, and we have to be the most competitive chicken business. But we also want to grow the business. And we are committed to top-tier performance. We're committed to the 5% to 7% AOI by mid-FY '22 that we talked about earlier. And we're committed to kind of the most thought after place to work, and we talked a lot about that in the prepared remarks. We've increased wages, and this includes benefits up to $22 an hour. We've instituted a flexible work schedules and shifts. We're piloting childcare and on-site health clinics for our team members and their families. We're solving transportation problems for our team members. We're investing heavily in automation and technology and trying to automate those most difficult and higher turnover jobs. I talked last time, just so you understand the the basis of it, the 7 levers of our business in Chicken are: price, volume, mix, labor, yield, spend and live. And so let me touch on each of those for a moment. In our live operations, the planned improved hatch is well underway. The new malls will be in place by this fall, as we talked about in 2Q. We will see harvest capacity increase by mid fiscal '22. So here's kind of the formula that's better hash equals more birds, which equals more volume, which equals better service, which equals a better cost structure, which equals better performance and ultimately, better results for us. But until then, to your point in your question, we are improving hatch and harvest volume now. Even these headwinds, we are better than an average company by a sizable margin in our live production area, and we'll get sequentially better between now and mid '22. If I look at spend, we talked a lot last time about outside purchases and Stewart mentioned earlier that we've decreased that by 25%, although at a higher price. The thing that is challenging now is we're paying a lot over time because of inefficiency associated with labor, which is absenteeism and turnover. We've had inflation on all inputs. We believe grain and our cost of goods will crest in early Q4. In fact, it has based on the forward-looking curves. This is in our cost of goods. We've seen great improvements in our cost management and our execution by our team. Much of that has been masked by inflation and then go to labor. Labor is our single biggest issue we face, not only in Chicken but also in our other businesses. We've increased wages and created flexible shifts, childcare own type clinic. The Delta variant has been a disruptor. We were on a good trajectory. And then the Delta variant showed up, and we've taken a step back as a result of that. We've got plans to mitigate that but the health and safety of our team members are our highest priority. We are more inefficient than we have historically been. Certainly, a big part of what we have to solve. But essentially, it takes us -- I will tell you that the execution has improved sequentially through the year. Our volumes up in the quarter. That's head, that's waste. That's our finished goods sales. Volume is negatively impacted by harvesting below plan, which we talked about as a result of Hatch. We started this year with a plan to grow the business and grow our head and grow our sales. But our byproducts and export sales are our biggest misses from a volume perspective. We will see volume increase between now and mid '22. That's in hatch, that's in head harvested. From a mix standpoint, we've added volume. Value-added volume is very strong. That's ready parry products. That's our frozen value-added branded products. That's the heart and soul of our business in Chicken. We are at capacity with strong retail and foodservice demand. As Stewart referenced earlier, we're adding lines and -- our pricing is up 16% in the quarter. Most of this increase came in June and even more in July. We work with our customers, and they've been very responsive. Our relationships are -- We've been successful in [Audio Gap] at the same time, it has continued to escalate. And and pricing will certainly lag the cost in this scenario. We're just simply asking for fair market value for these products. But long story short, better. We are performing better. We have a great deal of inflation led by green, but that we've gotten pricing around us. And so -- as we move into every month and quarter from here, I would expect that 7% that we talked about by mid-'22."

Actually, if you look at inflation, the biggest driver for Prepared Foods has been the input cost of  commodities. And of course, for Prepared Foods, that mostly is Pork. You've got that, of course, along with the increase in map spend, which I referred to later. So in terms of thinking about price, I mean, what Donnie is saying is when we think that commodities are going up or any inputs are going up, we're going to match that with pricing. That pricing may not follow exactly the track of input inflation. But you also need to think about how that input inflation can move along. While we've got labor cost increases, which are going into our it's our workforce, you should think about those as more permanent of course. But you've seen the cycles around commodities and you'll have to take a view of what you think for the cost of Pork will do over the price over the course of next year. If Pork comes off, then that will be a help to us. It or it doesn't come off, then I think Donnie's point is that we will continue to take price to match the nature of the cost that's coming to us."

Irresponsible not to protect our team members in every way that we could. Now, there could be some short-term impacts but I think they certainly will be offset by a long-term benefit in doing this.

As many of you know, I've been a Tyson team member for close to 4 decades. And in that time, I've led every business segment. We've always believed in our mission and the vision of John W. Tyson, who founded this company nearly a century",1647,"Thank you, Megan. As many of you know, I've been a Tyson team member for close to 4 decades. And in that time, I've led every business segment. We've always believed in our mission and the vision of John W. Tyson, who founded this company nearly a century ago, because he wanted to find a better way to feed a growing country.  
Today, on my first earnings call as CEO, I am incredibly proud to stand alongside our team members to continue that legacy. It's an interesting time to be in this industry and we have a leadership team that together can capitalize on the strengths of this company and the opportunities ahead.  
Let's begin with a view of our overall performance this quarter. First, our retail performance. 12 consecutive quarters of retail share gains in our core business lines. It's driven by strength of our brands, along with solid execution from our team. We are in a market that has demonstrated strong demand for protein and people are reaching most for brands they trust. Our billion-dollar brands: Tyson, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm have driven strong share growth with consumers buying more than ever before.  
Second, we saw in the third quarter growing volume in foodservice channel as reopening and recovery continue. We saw uptake from outlets nationwide, reflected in our sales, which we were up $1.3 billion for the quarter. Our broad production and distribution network is well positioned to meet this growing demand.  
Third, the diversity of our portfolio demonstrated its value during the quarter. Led by Beef, we delivered an exceptional result as a strong U.S. export demand, coupled with ample cattle supply, supported elevated margins in that business.  
Fourth, we continue to build financial strength. This quarter, we used higher operating cash flow to reduce debt. The steps we've taken position us with a very strong balance sheet and high levels of liquidity.  
And finally, we are investing in future growth across our portfolio. We're in the process of bringing 12 new plants online globally to address capacity constraints and growing demand. In all, Tyson delivered a strong quarter. As we look to the future, we want to build on these strengths. 
Let's look at how we plan to do that. First, we have built a solid footing to drive consistent results. Our strengths include a diverse portfolio, well-known trusted brands, scale in meaningful markets and an exceptionally strong balance sheet. Second, labor is our #1 challenge, so we have continued our focus on improving our team member experience without compromising their health and safety. We are accelerating efforts to make Tyson the most sought-after place to work because we know how important team members are to our business.  
One of the way that we're doing this is to accelerate our investments in automation and technology. This not only helps us to eliminate more difficult, hard-to-fill tasks but also reskill our labor profile to enable their contribution to more value-added activities.  
Third, we are actively working to recover volume from pandemic lows and in doing so, improve the reliability we offer our customers. Dynamic and evolving channel demand continues to create operational complexities. We took steps earlier this year to make our organization more responsive to demand signals and to accelerate our speed to market by getting our sales teams closer to their customers. There is more to do, however, and so our work here continues.  
Fourth, our focus on operational excellence and disciplined cost management is especially important during periods of continued market volatility and increasing inflationary pressures. As you will hear today, we continue to be laser-focused in making progress in restoring the competitiveness of our Chicken segment. We are also accelerating actions across our enterprise to become more operationally excellent.  
Finally, we will continue to optimize our balance sheet, which will give us optionality as we prioritize the delivery of shareholder value.  
Turning to Slide 5. We improved our sales and earnings performance this quarter. The results demonstrate the benefit of our multi-protein multichannel portfolio. Sales improved 25% in third quarter and 8% year-to-date, reflecting the improved volumes, which are up 10% for the quarter and flat year-to-date. It also reflects effective pricing strategies in all of our segments during this inflationary environment.  
We delivered strong operating earnings performance, resulting in approximately $1.4 billion in operating income for the quarter. This represents an 81% increase compared to prior year and translates to $2.70 in earnings per share.  
Our earnings reflect our 3 key priorities: one, to be the go-to supplier for customers and consumers; two, to be the most sought-after place to work; and three, to be operationally excellent. We want to be the most sought-after place to work. This starts with an unrelenting focus on safety every minute, every shift, every day.  
Health and safety have been and will continue to be our top priority. We have a history of using all the tools at our disposal to protect our team members and the vaccine is no different. As many of you will have seen, last week, we announced that Tyson will require COVID-19 vaccinations for our entire U.S. workforce by November 1. We do this now because the Delta variant is more contagious and getting vaccinated is the single most effective thing people can do to protect themselves, their families and their communities.  
We have raised wages in many markets to ensure we're competitive and are exploring other ways to make Tyson the most sought-after place to work in the communities where we operate. For example, we are piloting childcare facilities at some of our plants, and we have opened medical clinics to make health care more accessible to team members and their families.  
Finally, we are accelerating investments in automation and advanced technologies to make team members' jobs easier. We look forward to providing more detail on automation and technology road map at our upcoming Investor Day.  
We're taking aggressive actions to add new capacity to meet demand, adjust our product mix by plant and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. We're listening to our customers and are committed to improving reliability of supply.  
In the third quarter, we improved volume levels across all segments. In Prepared Foods, we continue to optimize our product portfolio, remove processing and supply chain complexity and prioritize products with the highest demand, resulting in lower cost and better service to our customers.  
In Beef, ample cattle supply, heavier animal weights and strong demand have driven volumes higher year-to-date. In Pork, our volumes are up year-to-date versus pandemic lows. We are pleased to have additional capacity coming online at Eagle Mountain, Utah and Columbia, South Carolina. Both facilities are expected to grow our prepackaged beef and pork products.  
In Chicken, volume declined year-to-date despite improved foodservice demand led by QSRs. We also saw a sustained retail demand, including the frozen value-added poultry category. Limited capacity and persistent labor challenges have impacted customer fill rates in this segment. However, our new plant in Humboldt, Tennessee continues to ramp up production, including harvest capacity. This ramp-up is helping us improve customer fill rates.  
Chicken remains a top priority for me and for our company. We continue to execute against our road map to bring operating income margin to at least the 5% to 7% range by mid fiscal '22. Our goal has not changed and we remain committed to restoring top-tier performance. We are making progress. The first imperative is to be the most sought-after place to work.  
I've outlined the investments we're making to enhance our team member experience in my earlier comments. The second imperative is to improve operational performance. Last quarter, we highlighted the impact of lower hatch rates on our chicken operations. We have begun to deploy new male parent stock. Where the stock has been deployed, hatch rates are improving. We expect the full rollout of this breeder stock to be complete this fall with harvest capacity improvements occurring by mid fiscal '22. 
Our rate of outside meat purchases has declined 25% versus last quarter and will continue to decline as hatch rates and utilization improve. We have identified opportunities to reduce mix complexity across our chicken footprint, which will help us operate more efficiently.  
The final imperative is to service our customers on time and in full. We're pleased by the continued share performance of our value-added products like Tyson Chicken Nuggets, Crispy Strips and Air Fried. We gained share during the third quarter in the last 52 weeks.  
Looking ahead, we expect further growth. And as a result, we're investing in line upgrades and increased capacity to drive branded product growth. We have increased prices to help offset significant raw material and supply chain cost inflation. Pricing improved nearly 16% in the quarter versus the comparable period last year.  
We will staff our plants, service our customers, grow our business and be the best chicken company, period. Part of being customer-centric means being as efficient as possible in taking cost out where you can without compromising our ability to execute against our strategic and operational priorities.  
We have ongoing efforts across the business to reduce costs, but we must also find new innovative ways to be better and stronger. This means investing in advances like automation and artificial intelligence to deliver productivity gains and competitive advantage. We have already delivered strong productivity gains in fiscal year '21. Across our business, we are looking to build upon the strength of those actions in the months and years to come, which we will detail at the Investor Day later this year.  
These improvements come at a time when we are investing heavily in capacity expansions across segments to better partner with our customers and meet long-term demand. I'll now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail."

Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. Sales were up approximately 25% in the third quarter. Volumes were up 9.7%, primarily due to strength in retail and the ongoing foodservice recovery. Average sales p",1934,"Thank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. Sales were up approximately 25% in the third quarter. Volumes were up 9.7%, primarily due to strength in retail and the ongoing foodservice recovery. Average sales price was also up about 17%, largely due to strong results in our Beef segment, the mix benefit from retail volume and a partial recovery of raw material inflation in net sales price.  
Operating income was up 81% in the third quarter due to continued strong performance in our Beef business. Chicken and Prepared Foods also improved their respective segment earnings while Pork earnings were down versus the comparable period a year ago.  
Year-to-date, operating income for the total company improved by 49%. Earnings per share grew 93% in the third quarter due largely to strength in operating income, specifically within our Beef segment. EPS is up 61% on a year-to-date basis.  
We performed well despite a challenging operating environment that spanned tough labor availability, significant inflation pressures on raw material costs, global supply chain challenges and an evolving demand backdrop. Slide 11 bridges our total company sales on a year-to-date basis. We delivered growth in the retail channel along all reporting segments, which, in aggregate, accounted for more than $1 billion in sales improvement over the year-to-date period and more than $300 million in the third quarter versus the respective comparable periods.  
Moving to foodservice. Sales improved by approximately $1.3 billion in the third quarter, leading to a year-to-date improvement for the channel of nearly $1 billion compared to the same period last year. Exports were up over 18% versus the comparable period, led by Beef, where sales improved by more than $350 million on a year-to-date basis. Asia has been a key driver of Beef export strength.  
We've also seen some strength in industrial, particularly in Beef and Pork. And finally, year-to-date sales grew $79 million or approximately 6% in our International business. This business is a growth priority for Tyson and we continue to invest to develop further capacities and capabilities in new markets to meet growing global consumer demand for protein products.
Current capacity expansions across 7 international locations are expected to dramatically increase our fully cooked production capabilities. These investments are fully aligned to our strategic growth priorities. And when complete, will enhance our international processing capacity by close to 30% versus fiscal 2020.
The overall, we're pleased with the company's top line growth year-to-date. We are carefully managing the current inflationary pressures through pricing actions as well as commercial and operational excellence with emphasis on productivity and cost. We know that our price recovery efforts relative to inflation must be matched by equal aggressiveness on productivity.
Slide 12 bridges year-to-date operating income. Production inefficiencies and low labor availability resulted in total company volumes roughly flat to the comparable period a year ago. However, we are encouraged by the volume improvement we are seeing across our segments in the third quarter. Price/mix benefited substantially in the year-to-date period from price recovery of raw material cost inflation, improved mix, strong Beef segment performance and continued retail strength across segments.
Operating income was partially offset by $2.2 billion in increased cost of goods sold for the period, reflecting meaningful inflation in raw material and supply chain costs. Feed ingredients, labor, packaging and freight are all key components of this COGS increase, which we're working to mitigate.  
On a comparative basis, SG&A benefited from the $56 million loss in the year-to-date fiscal 2020 period as compared to a $55 million gain in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 associated with the cattle supplier incident. This was in addition to certain reductions in trade spend and travel costs.  
Moving into the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $3.5 billion for the third quarter, up 12%. Volumes were also up in the quarter due to continued strength in retail, improving demand through foodservice and segment-wide operational improvements. These were partially offset by COVID-related production inefficiencies.  
Average sales price was up 15% in the quarter due to favorable mix, sustained retail volume and strong supply and demand fundamentals. Our reported price improvement also reflects actions we took to cover the inflationary pressure seen from higher grain, labor and freight costs. Our conversations with customers on widespread inflationary pressures have been productive. We'll continue to partner with customers to ensure we receive a fair return on our products while working to deliver service levels and fill rates that meet or exceed their expectations.  
Operating income was $27 million in the third quarter and $137 million on a fiscal year-to-date basis, both stronger than comparable periods a year ago. This represents an operating margin of 1.3% year-to-date.  
Fiscal year-to-date operating income was negatively impacted by $410 million of higher feed ingredient costs as well as $210 million of increased grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases. For the third quarter, feed ingredients were $270 million higher, while grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases were $110 million higher.  
Segment performance also reflects net derivative gains during the third quarter of $125 million and $235 million on a year-to-date basis, both versus the respective comparable periods. These results are associated with realized gains as well as open positions.  
Moving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 14% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was up 4.5% in the quarter, with strength in the retail channel and continued recovery in foodservice. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by the pass-through of raw material costs, lower commercial spending and better sales mix. Segment operating income was $150 million for the quarter, up over 3% versus the prior year. Year-to-date operating income was $633 million, up 23% versus the prior year period. Operating margins for the segment was 6.5% for the third quarter, a decline of 60 basis points versus the comparable year ago period.  
The slowdown in segment operating margins versus the same quarter last year were driven by significant increases in raw material input costs. However, on a year-to-date basis, our operating margin of 9.6% was up 170 basis points versus last year, driven by favorable pricing and lower commercial spend.  
Demand for the balance of the year is expected to remain elevated at retail with volumes continuing to exceed pre-COVID levels and foodservice continuing to recover. During the third quarter, core business lines experienced volume share growth of 90 basis points, while dollar share grew 70 basis points.  
We continue to believe that the ongoing inflationary environment will create a meaningful headwind for Prepared Foods in the upcoming quarter. Raw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging and labor are all challenging our cost of production. To offset inflationary pressure, we're focused on pricing, revenue management and commercial spend optimization while ensuring the continued build of brand equity through marketing and trade support.  
Moving to the Beef segment. Segment sales were over $4.9 billion for the quarter, up 36% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers included strong domestic and export demand for beef products with average sales price up 12% for the quarter. We had ample livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies. Mounting drought conditions in the Western United States cattle-growing region as well as elevated costs for grain also drove some cattle supply liquidation. We have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal '22 and currently believe it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs.  
Sales volume for the quarter was up year-over-year due to continued strong demand in contrast to a soft comparable period a year ago, driven by lower production volumes. We delivered segment operating income of $1.1 billion for the quarter. This improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cutout, which were partially offset by higher operating costs.  
Operating margins for the segment improved 520 basis points to 22.6% for the third quarter. While our Beef segment experienced tremendous results on a year-to-date basis, we're still not at optimal levels of capacity throughput within our beef plants due to labor challenges. Meanwhile, drought conditions and elevated grain prices are creating incremental costs and risks for cattle producers. Until these conditions stabilize and within the constraints I've mentioned, we will work to maximize our beef processing capacity to provide a reliable outlet for our livestock farmers and adequate product supply for customers and consumers.  
Now let's move on to the Pork segment on Slide 16. Third quarter results reflect higher hog costs and operating expenses that weren't fully offset through pork cutout. Segment sales were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 54% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand partially offset by a challenging labor environment. Average sales price increased more than 39%, while volumes were also up relative to the same period last year.  
Segment operating income was $67 million for the quarter, down 37% versus the comparable period. Overall, operating margins for the segment declined by 570 basis points to 3.9% for the quarter. The operating income decline was driven by higher hog costs and increased labor and freight costs. Through the end of this calendar year, lower projected 2021 pork production and strong consumer demand are expected to support hog prices well above 2020 levels.  
Slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Given the continued strength in our Beef segment and ongoing inflationary pressures that are partially being recovered through price, we're raising our sales guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver annual revenues in the range of $46 billion to $47 billion. At the segment level, we expect our directional annual guidance to hold. Key risks to this guidance include freight rates, labor cost and availability, grain costs in the Chicken segment, raw material costs for each of our businesses and continued export market strength along with price volatility in commodity meats.  
We're slightly realizing our outlook on effective tax rate to approximately 22.5%. We'll continue to monitor the potential implications of new legislation but we do not currently expect to see impacts to our adjusted rate this fiscal year. While our expectations related to liquidity are also unchanged, liquidity during the third quarter improved substantially to $3.4 billion and has since benefited from $1.2 billion of pretax proceeds from the divestiture of our Pet Treats business in early July. 
Finally, we expect our COVID-related costs, which totaled $55 million in the quarter, to be approximately $325 million for the year. As a reminder, some of the costs that were previously described as COVID-related have evolved to become structural.  
Turning to Slide 18. In pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we have substantially delevered our business over the past 12 months, reducing leverage to 1.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Investing organically in our business will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities.  
Each of these levers, individually and in aggregate, will support strong return generation for our shareholders. We will also continue to explore costs to optimize our portfolio through M&A through the lens of value creation and shareholder return. Finally, we are committed to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. In short, we view the cash generation capabilities of this business as both strong and diverse, and we expect our capital allocation framework to deliver solid returns for our shareholders in the future.  
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Donnie."

Let me start with this. As we think about -- as we look forward, the fundamentals of our business look good going forward. And we have a strong retail and foodservice demand.

As we think about -- as we look forward, the fundamentals of our business look good going forward. And we have a strong retail and foodservice demand. We haven't changed our approach. Chicken is our top priority for me and for our company, and we continue to execute our plan. That hasn't changed and that starts with staffing our plants and servicing our customers, and we have to be the most competitive Chicken business. 
But we also want to grow the business, and we are committed to top-tier performance. We're committed to the 5% to 7% AOI by mid-FY '22 that we talked about earlier. And we're committed to kind of the most sought-after place to work, and we talked a lot about that in the prepared remarks. We've increased wages, and this includes benefits up to $22 an hour. We've instituted a flexible work schedules and shifts. We're piloting childcare and on-site health clinics for our team members and their families. We're solving transportation problems for our team members. We're investing heavily in automation and technology and trying to automate those most difficult and higher turnover jobs. 
I talked last time, just so you understand the  basis of it, the 7 levers of our business in Chicken are: price, volume, mix, labor, yield, spend and live. And so let me touch on each of those for a moment. In our live operations, the planned improved hatch is well underway. The new males will be in place by this fall, as we talked about in 2Q. We will see harvest capacity increase by mid fiscal '22. 
So here's kind of the formula, that's better hatch equals more birds, which equals more volume, which equals better service, which equals a better cost structure, which equals better performance and ultimately, better results for us. But until then, to your point in your question, we are improving hatch and harvest volume now. Even these headwinds, we are better than an average company by a sizable margin in our live production area, and we'll get sequentially better between now and mid '22. 
If I look at spend, we talked a lot last time about outside purchases and Stewart mentioned earlier that we've decreased that by 25%, although at a higher price. The thing that is challenging now is we're paying a lot overtime because of inefficiency associated with labor, which is absenteeism and turnover. We've had inflation on all inputs. We believe grain and our cost of goods will crest in early Q4. In fact, it has based on the forward-looking curves. This is in our cost of goods. We've seen great improvements in our cost management and our execution by our team, much of that has been masked by inflation. 
And then go to labor. Labor is our single biggest issue we face not only in Chicken but also in our other businesses. We've increased wages and created flexible shifts, childcare, on-site clinics. The Delta variant has been a disruptor. We were on a good trajectory, and then the Delta variant showed up and we've taken a step back as a result of that. We've got plans to mitigate that but the health and safety of our team members are our highest priority. We are more inefficient than we have historically been. Certainly, a big part of what we have to solve. But essentially, it takes us 6 days to get 5 days worth of work. I will tell you that the execution has improved sequentially through the year. Our volume is up in the quarter, that's head, that's waste, that's our finished goods sales. Volume is negatively impacted by harvesting below plan, which we talked about as a result of hatch. We started this year with a plan to grow the business and grow our head and grow our sales. But our byproducts and export sales are our biggest misses from a volume perspective. 
We will see volume increase between now and mid '22. That's in hatch, that's in head harvested and that's in volume through our plants. From a mix standpoint, we've added volume. Value-added volume is very strong. That's ready-to-eat products, that's pre-fried products, that's our frozen value-added branded products. That's the heart and soul of our business in Chicken. 
We are at capacity with strong retail and foodservice demand. As Stewart referenced earlier, we're adding lines and plans to address very strong demand. Our pricing is up 16% in the quarter. Most of this increase came in June and even more in July. We work with our customers, and they've been very responsive. Our relationships are relationships are very strong with our customers. 
We've been successful in getting pricing. Grain also, at the same time, has continued to escalate. And pricing will certainly lag the cost in this scenario. We're just simply asking for fair market value for these products. But long story short, we are executing better. We are performing better. We have a great deal of inflation led by grain, but we've gotten pricing around us. And so as we move into every month and quarter from here, I would expect us to be sequentially better. And that 5% to 7% that we talked about by mid-'22, we're committed to that, and we stand with that number."

We were constricted in the middle, but based on the labor availability -- and I talked about this in Chicken earlier -- but in our Beef business, it essentially takes us 6 days to get 5 days worth of work. So the inefficiency associated with that allowed cattle to back up on the ranch and then feedlots. 
So here's what we know as we look into '22. Herd supplies are expected to be down about 0.5%. And June cattle on feed is projected to be up 1.9%. There has been some herd liquidation in the West and Northern Plains, which according to CattleFax, about 33% of the U.S. cow-calf production is in this drought area. But '22, '22 is looking good. Is it going to be at the same level in which we were -- where we are at '21? Probably not. I don't think it will be that good. I think it will be better than historical returns. But -- and I'm talking that 1% to 3%, which we talked about forever, it will be north of that, we think. But we think all in all, Beef will have a very nice year in '22. 
In terms of export, to the other part of your question, Asian growth is still solid. U.S. grain-fed beef is preferred around the world. And as you mentioned, key global beef suppliers are rebuilding herds in Australia and Brazil and Canada. So all of that is true. And so strong export demand for us as well as domestic."

Retail orders, for example, are up 30% versus pre-COVID levels. Foodservice is showing a sequential improvement as well. We have seen accelerating and unprecedented inflation. So what do we do about that? Well, we have significant foodservice pricing already in the market. Retail pricing will be in the market by September 5. Inflation is up about 14% during our 3Q and 9% year-to-date. We've had -- just like other businesses, we've had labor and absenteeism and turnover in the business, so we have a number of open positions. So that certainly has made us inefficient. And so we've got aggressive pricing going on, aggressive revenue management and commercial spend management will help mitigate a portion of these inflationary impacts.

But let's just talk about overall our view of capital allocation. First of all, we really feel great about the current position of our balance sheet. I mean liquidity was $3.4 billion coming out of the quarter. That was before we took the receipt of the $1.2 billion from pet, and we did repay about $500 million worth of debt subsequent to the end of the quarter. So the balance sheet is very healthy. 
From an investment standpoint, one of the things that we talked about both in the prepared remarks and in last quarter is that we expect to invest behind our business. We have significant opportunity to invest in expanding our capacity. And I spoke this morning about International, that will be a growth area for us. The CapEx that's going into the international space and new facilities will expand their capacity by 30% when compared to last year. That's a big deal. 
And I think when you look at the rest of our business, Donnie spoke this morning about automation, and you're seeing that both across Prepared Foods as well as in our Chicken business, which will certainly help our labor. It will help our efficiency. And then you look at where we're putting money just behind in terms of new facilities. And Humboldt has gone live. We've got a new case-ready facility in Utah, that will be coming online shortly as well as one in South Carolina. So we've got a pretty active internal agenda. If something on the outside presents itself that we think it makes sense for our investors, then we're going to -- we'll obviously take a look at that. But hopefully, that gives you a flavor for where we're investing our money."

But with retail, with the branded portfolio, it can take a little bit longer to get pricing in. We typically don't disclose that kind of information about when we would do it. But here's generally the way we think about this is that when raw materials, when inputs go up, pricing has to go up particularly in an environment where we have such rapid and accelerating inflation. We have little choice but to go and to -- we certainly have to be competitive, but we certainly have to get pricing to cover the increase in inputs. And we're doing that, and we're doing that very methodically. We're looking at all the metrics around that as we do that, but we're doing it in a very responsible way. And Noelle O'Mara and her team are managing that round the clock."

Actually, if you look at inflation, the biggest driver for Prepared Foods has been the input cost of commodities. And of course, for Prepared Foods, that mostly is Pork. You've got that, of course, along with the increase in MAP spend, which I referred to later. 
So in terms of thinking about price, I mean, what Donnie is saying is when we think the price -- that commodities are going up or any inputs are going up, we're going to match that with pricing. That pricing may not follow exactly the track of input inflation. But you also need to think about how that input inflation can move along. While we've got labor cost increases, which are going into our workforce, you should think about those as more permanent of course. But you've seen the cycles around commodities and you'll have to take a view of what you think pork -- the cost of pork will do over the price over the course of next year. If pork comes off, then that will be a help to us. If pork doesn't come off, then I think Donnie's point is that we will continue to take price to match the nature of the cost that's coming to us."

With the new vaccine, it's a new tool. We believe that vaccine is the most effective thing, the most effective tool available today. We've studied the data.

So there's a number of -- we need a number of heads. You can do the math on how much outside meat we're purchasing based on volumes and you could probably convert that to head. I mean one of the things that we could -- the quick math would tell you that being able to run those products through our plants and being able to debone those chickens and go into our further process assets and at the same time, get credit for all the byproducts through our ingredient solutions group and then have the ability with our One Tyson approach to be able to sell export leg quarters and paws and so forth, along with just the further processing volume increases that we would get, all of that adds up to a much better cost scenario and a much better performance in our Chicken business."

Our billion-dollar brands: Tyson, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm have driven strong share growth with consumers buying more than ever before.  
Second, we saw in the third quarter growing volume in foodservice channel as reopening and recovery continue. We saw uptake from outlets nationwide, reflected in our sales, which we were up $1.3 billion for the quarter. Our broad production and distribution network is well positioned to meet this growing demand.  
Third, the diversity of our portfolio demonstrated its value during the quarter. Led by Beef, we delivered an exceptional result as a strong U.S. export demand, coupled with ample cattle supply, supported elevated margins in that business.  
Fourth, we continue to build financial strength. This quarter, we used higher operating cash flow to reduce debt. The steps we've taken position us with a very strong balance sheet and high levels of liquidity.  
And finally, we are investing in future growth across our portfolio. We're in the process of bringing 12 new plants online globally to address capacity constraints and growing demand. In all, Tyson delivered a strong quarter. As we look to the future, we want to build on these strengths. 
Let's look at how we plan to do that. First, we have built a solid footing to drive consistent results. Our strengths include a diverse portfolio, well-known trusted brands, scale in meaningful markets and an exceptionally strong balance sheet. Second, labor is our #1 challenge, so we have continued our focus on improving our team member experience without compromising their health and safety. We are accelerating efforts to make Tyson the most sought-after place to work because we know how important team members are to our business.  
One of the way that we're doing this is to accelerate our investments in automation and technology. This not only helps us to eliminate more difficult, hard-to-fill tasks but also reskill our labor profile to enable their contribution to more value-added activities.  
Third, we are actively working to recover volume from pandemic lows and in doing so, improve the reliability we offer our customers. Dynamic and evolving channel demand continues to create operational complexities. We took steps earlier this year to make our organization more responsive to demand signals and to accelerate our speed to market by getting our sales teams closer to their customers. There is more to do, however, and so our work here continues.  
Fourth, our focus on operational excellence and disciplined cost management is especially important during periods of continued market volatility and increasing inflationary pressures. As you will hear today, we continue to be laser-focused in making progress in restoring the competitiveness of our Chicken segment. We are also accelerating actions across our enterprise to become more operationally excellent.  
Finally, we will continue to optimize our balance sheet, which will give us optionality as we prioritize the delivery of shareholder value.  
Turning to Slide 5. We improved our sales and earnings performance this quarter. The results demonstrate the benefit of our multi-protein multichannel portfolio. Sales improved 25% in third quarter and 8% year-to-date, reflecting the improved volumes, which are up 10% for the quarter and flat year-to-date. It also reflects effective pricing strategies in all of our segments during this inflationary environment.  
We delivered strong operating earnings performance, resulting in approximately $1.4 billion in operating income for the quarter. This represents an 81% increase compared to prior year and translates to $2.70 in earnings per share.  
Our earnings reflect our 3 key priorities: one, to be the go-to supplier for customers and consumers; two, to be the most sought-after place to work; and three, to be operationally excellent. We want to be the most sought-after place to work. This starts with an unrelenting focus on safety every minute, every shift, every day.  
Health and safety have been and will continue to be our top priority. We have a history of using all the tools at our disposal to protect our team members and the vaccine is no different. As many of you will have seen, last week, we announced that Tyson will require COVID-19 vaccinations for our entire U.S. workforce by November 1. We do this now because the Delta variant is more contagious and getting vaccinated is the single most effective thing people can do to protect themselves, their families and their communities.  
We have raised wages in many markets to ensure we're competitive and are exploring other ways to make Tyson the most sought-after place to work in the communities where we operate. For example, we are piloting childcare facilities at some of our plants, and we have opened medical clinics to make health care more accessible to team members and their families.  
Finally, we are accelerating investments in automation and advanced technologies to make team members' jobs easier. We look forward to providing more detail on automation and technology road map at our upcoming Investor Day.  
We're taking aggressive actions to add new capacity to meet demand, adjust our product mix by plant and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. We're listening to our customers and are committed to improving reliability of supply.  
In the third quarter, we improved volume levels across all segments. In Prepared Foods, we continue to optimize our product portfolio, remove processing and supply chain complexity and prioritize products with the highest demand, resulting in lower cost and better service to our customers.  
In Beef, ample cattle supply, heavier animal weights and strong demand have driven volumes higher year-to-date. In Pork, our volumes are up year-to-date versus pandemic lows. We are pleased to have additional capacity coming online at Eagle Mountain, Utah and Columbia, South Carolina. Both facilities are expected to grow our prepackaged beef and pork products.  
In Chicken, volume declined year-to-date despite improved foodservice demand led by QSRs. We also saw a sustained retail demand, including the frozen value-added poultry category. Limited capacity and persistent labor challenges have impacted customer fill rates in this segment. However, our new plant in Humboldt, Tennessee continues to ramp up production, including harvest capacity. This ramp-up is helping us improve customer fill rates.  
Chicken remains a top priority for me and for our company. We continue to execute against our road map to bring operating income margin to at least the 5% to 7% range by mid fiscal '22. Our goal has not changed and we remain committed to restoring top-tier performance. We are making progress. The first imperative is to be the most sought-after place to work.  
I've outlined the investments we're making to enhance our team member experience in my earlier comments. The second imperative is to improve operational performance. Last quarter, we highlighted the impact of lower hatch rates on our chicken operations. We have begun to deploy new male parent stock. Where the stock has been deployed, hatch rates are improving. We expect the full rollout of this breeder stock to be complete this fall with harvest capacity improvements occurring by mid fiscal '22. 
Our rate of outside meat purchases has declined 25% versus last quarter and will continue to decline as hatch rates and utilization improve. We have identified opportunities to reduce mix complexity across our chicken footprint, which will help us operate more efficiently.  
The final imperative is to service our customers on time and in full. We're pleased by the continued share performance of our value-added products like Tyson Chicken Nuggets, Crispy Strips and Air Fried. We gained share during the third quarter in the last 52 weeks.  
Looking ahead, we expect further growth. And as a result, we're investing in line upgrades and increased capacity to drive branded product growth. We have increased prices to help offset significant raw material and supply chain cost inflation. Pricing improved nearly 16% in the quarter versus the comparable period last year.  
We will staff our plants, service our customers, grow our business and be the best chicken company, period. Part of being customer-centric means being as efficient as possible in taking cost out where you can without compromising our ability to execute against our strategic and operational priorities.  
We have ongoing efforts across the business to reduce costs, but we must also find new innovative ways to be better and stronger. This means investing in advances like automation and artificial intelligence to deliver productivity gains and competitive advantage. We have already delivered strong productivity gains in fiscal year '21. Across our business, we are looking to build upon the strength of those actions in the months and years to come, which we will detail at the Investor Day later this year.  
These improvements come at a time when we are investing heavily in capacity expansions across segments to better partner with our customers and meet long-term demand. I'll now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail."

Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. Sales were up approximately 25% in the third quarter. Volumes were up 9.7%, primarily due to strength in retail and the ongoing foodservice recovery. Average sales p",1934,"Thank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. Sales were up approximately 25% in the third quarter. Volumes were up 9.7%, primarily due to strength in retail and the ongoing foodservice recovery. Average sales price was also up about 17%, largely due to strong results in our Beef segment, the mix benefit from retail volume and a partial recovery of raw material inflation in net sales price.  
Operating income was up 81% in the third quarter due to continued strong performance in our Beef business. Chicken and Prepared Foods also improved their respective segment earnings while Pork earnings were down versus the comparable period a year ago.  
Year-to-date, operating income for the total company improved by 49%. Earnings per share grew 93% in the third quarter due largely to strength in operating income, specifically within our Beef segment. EPS is up 61% on a year-to-date basis.  
We performed well despite a challenging operating environment that spanned tough labor availability, significant inflation pressures on raw material costs, global supply chain challenges and an evolving demand backdrop. Slide 11 bridges our total company sales on a year-to-date basis. We delivered growth in the retail channel along all reporting segments, which, in aggregate, accounted for more than $1 billion in sales improvement over the year-to-date period and more than $300 million in the third quarter versus the respective comparable periods.  
Moving to foodservice. Sales improved by approximately $1.3 billion in the third quarter, leading to a year-to-date improvement for the channel of nearly $1 billion compared to the same period last year. Exports were up over 18% versus the comparable period, led by Beef, where sales improved by more than $350 million on a year-to-date basis. Asia has been a key driver of Beef export strength.  
We've also seen some strength in industrial, particularly in Beef and Pork. And finally, year-to-date sales grew $79 million or approximately 6% in our International business. This business is a growth priority for Tyson and we continue to invest to develop further capacities and capabilities in new markets to meet growing global consumer demand for protein products.
Current capacity expansions across 7 international locations are expected to dramatically increase our fully cooked production capabilities. These investments are fully aligned to our strategic growth priorities. And when complete, will enhance our international processing capacity by close to 30% versus fiscal 2020.
The overall, we're pleased with the company's top line growth year-to-date. We are carefully managing the current inflationary pressures through pricing actions as well as commercial and operational excellence with emphasis on productivity and cost. We know that our price recovery efforts relative to inflation must be matched by equal aggressiveness on productivity.
Slide 12 bridges year-to-date operating income. Production inefficiencies and low labor availability resulted in total company volumes roughly flat to the comparable period a year ago. However, we are encouraged by the volume improvement we are seeing across our segments in the third quarter. Price/mix benefited substantially in the year-to-date period from price recovery of raw material cost inflation, improved mix, strong Beef segment performance and continued retail strength across segments.
Operating income was partially offset by $2.2 billion in increased cost of goods sold for the period, reflecting meaningful inflation in raw material and supply chain costs. Feed ingredients, labor, packaging and freight are all key components of this COGS increase, which we're working to mitigate.  
On a comparative basis, SG&A benefited from the $56 million loss in the year-to-date fiscal 2020 period as compared to a $55 million gain in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 associated with the cattle supplier incident. This was in addition to certain reductions in trade spend and travel costs.  
Moving into the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $3.5 billion for the third quarter, up 12%. Volumes were also up in the quarter due to continued strength in retail, improving demand through foodservice and segment-wide operational improvements. These were partially offset by COVID-related production inefficiencies.  
Average sales price was up 15% in the quarter due to favorable mix, sustained retail volume and strong supply and demand fundamentals. Our reported price improvement also reflects actions we took to cover the inflationary pressure seen from higher grain, labor and freight costs. Our conversations with customers on widespread inflationary pressures have been productive. We'll continue to partner with customers to ensure we receive a fair return on our products while working to deliver service levels and fill rates that meet or exceed their expectations.  
Operating income was $27 million in the third quarter and $137 million on a fiscal year-to-date basis, both stronger than comparable periods a year ago. This represents an operating margin of 1.3% year-to-date.  
Fiscal year-to-date operating income was negatively impacted by $410 million of higher feed ingredient costs as well as $210 million of increased grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases. For the third quarter, feed ingredients were $270 million higher, while grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases were $110 million higher.  
Segment performance also reflects net derivative gains during the third quarter of $125 million and $235 million on a year-to-date basis, both versus the respective comparable periods. These results are associated with realized gains as well as open positions.  
Moving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 14% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was up 4.5% in the quarter, with strength in the retail channel and continued recovery in foodservice. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by the pass-through of raw material costs, lower commercial spending and better sales mix. Segment operating income was $150 million for the quarter, up over 3% versus the prior year. Year-to-date operating income was $633 million, up 23% versus the prior year period. Operating margins for the segment was 6.5% for the third quarter, a decline of 60 basis points versus the comparable year ago period.  
The slowdown in segment operating margins versus the same quarter last year were driven by significant increases in raw material input costs. However, on a year-to-date basis, our operating margin of 9.6% was up 170 basis points versus last year, driven by favorable pricing and lower commercial spend.  
Demand for the balance of the year is expected to remain elevated at retail with volumes continuing to exceed pre-COVID levels and foodservice continuing to recover. During the third quarter, core business lines experienced volume share growth of 90 basis points, while dollar share grew 70 basis points.  
We continue to believe that the ongoing inflationary environment will create a meaningful headwind for Prepared Foods in the upcoming quarter. Raw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging and labor are all challenging our cost of production. To offset inflationary pressure, we're focused on pricing, revenue management and commercial spend optimization while ensuring the continued build of brand equity through marketing and trade support.  
Moving to the Beef segment. Segment sales were over $4.9 billion for the quarter, up 36% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers included strong domestic and export demand for beef products with average sales price up 12% for the quarter. We had ample livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies. Mounting drought conditions in the Western United States cattle-growing region as well as elevated costs for grain also drove some cattle supply liquidation. We have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal '22 and currently believe it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs.  
Sales volume for the quarter was up year-over-year due to continued strong demand in contrast to a soft comparable period a year ago, driven by lower production volumes. We delivered segment operating income of $1.1 billion for the quarter. This improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cutout, which were partially offset by higher operating costs.  
Operating margins for the segment improved 520 basis points to 22.6% for the third quarter. While our Beef segment experienced tremendous results on a year-to-date basis, we're still not at optimal levels of capacity throughput within our beef plants due to labor challenges. Meanwhile, drought conditions and elevated grain prices are creating incremental costs and risks for cattle producers. Until these conditions stabilize and within the constraints I've mentioned, we will work to maximize our beef processing capacity to provide a reliable outlet for our livestock farmers and adequate product supply for customers and consumers.  
Now let's move on to the Pork segment on Slide 16. Third quarter results reflect higher hog costs and operating expenses that weren't fully offset through pork cutout. Segment sales were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 54% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand partially offset by a challenging labor environment. Average sales price increased more than 39%, while volumes were also up relative to the same period last year.  
Segment operating income was $67 million for the quarter, down 37% versus the comparable period. Overall, operating margins for the segment declined by 570 basis points to 3.9% for the quarter. The operating income decline was driven by higher hog costs and increased labor and freight costs. Through the end of this calendar year, lower projected 2021 pork production and strong consumer demand are expected to support hog prices well above 2020 levels.  
Slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Given the continued strength in our Beef segment and ongoing inflationary pressures that are partially being recovered through price, we're raising our sales guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver annual revenues in the range of $46 billion to $47 billion. At the segment level, we expect our directional annual guidance to hold. Key risks to this guidance include freight rates, labor cost and availability, grain costs in the Chicken segment, raw material costs for each of our businesses and continued export market strength along with price volatility in commodity meats.  
We're slightly realizing our outlook on effective tax rate to approximately 22.5%. We'll continue to monitor the potential implications of new legislation but we do not currently expect to see impacts to our adjusted rate this fiscal year. While our expectations related to liquidity are also unchanged, liquidity during the third quarter improved substantially to $3.4 billion and has since benefited from $1.2 billion of pretax proceeds from the divestiture of our Pet Treats business in early July. 
Finally, we expect our COVID-related costs, which totaled $55 million in the quarter, to be approximately $325 million for the year. As a reminder, some of the costs that were previously described as COVID-related have evolved to become structural.  
Turning to Slide 18. In pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we have substantially delevered our business over the past 12 months, reducing leverage to 1.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Investing organically in our business will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities.  
Each of these levers, individually and in aggregate, will support strong return generation for our shareholders. We will also continue to explore costs to optimize our portfolio through M&A through the lens of value creation and shareholder return. Finally, we are committed to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. In short, we view the cash generation capabilities of this business as both strong and diverse, and we expect our capital allocation framework to deliver solid returns for our shareholders in the future.  
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Donnie."

Let me start with this. As we think about -- as we look forward, the fundamentals of our business look good going forward. And we have a strong retail and foodservice demand.

As we think about -- as we look forward, the fundamentals of our business look good going forward. And we have a strong retail and foodservice demand. We haven't changed our approach. Chicken is our top priority for me and for our company, and we continue to execute our plan. That hasn't changed and that starts with staffing our plants and servicing our customers, and we have to be the most competitive Chicken business. 
But we also want to grow the business, and we are committed to top-tier performance. We're committed to the 5% to 7% AOI by mid-FY '22 that we talked about earlier. And we're committed to kind of the most sought-after place to work, and we talked a lot about that in the prepared remarks. We've increased wages, and this includes benefits up to $22 an hour. We've instituted a flexible work schedules and shifts. We're piloting childcare and on-site health clinics for our team members and their families. We're solving transportation problems for our team members. We're investing heavily in automation and technology and trying to automate those most difficult and higher turnover jobs. 
I talked last time, just so you understand the  basis of it, the 7 levers of our business in Chicken are: price, volume, mix, labor, yield, spend and live. And so let me touch on each of those for a moment. In our live operations, the planned improved hatch is well underway. The new males will be in place by this fall, as we talked about in 2Q. We will see harvest capacity increase by mid fiscal '22. 
So here's kind of the formula, that's better hatch equals more birds, which equals more volume, which equals better service, which equals a better cost structure, which equals better performance and ultimately, better results for us. But until then, to your point in your question, we are improving hatch and harvest volume now. Even these headwinds, we are better than an average company by a sizable margin in our live production area, and we'll get sequentially better between now and mid '22. 
If I look at spend, we talked a lot last time about outside purchases and Stewart mentioned earlier that we've decreased that by 25%, although at a higher price. The thing that is challenging now is we're paying a lot overtime because of inefficiency associated with labor, which is absenteeism and turnover. We've had inflation on all inputs. We believe grain and our cost of goods will crest in early Q4. In fact, it has based on the forward-looking curves. This is in our cost of goods. We've seen great improvements in our cost management and our execution by our team, much of that has been masked by inflation. 
And then go to labor. Labor is our single biggest issue we face not only in Chicken but also in our other businesses. We've increased wages and created flexible shifts, childcare, on-site clinics. The Delta variant has been a disruptor. We were on a good trajectory, and then the Delta variant showed up and we've taken a step back as a result of that. We've got plans to mitigate that but the health and safety of our team members are our highest priority. We are more inefficient than we have historically been. Certainly, a big part of what we have to solve. But essentially, it takes us 6 days to get 5 days worth of work. I will tell you that the execution has improved sequentially through the year. Our volume is up in the quarter, that's head, that's waste, that's our finished goods sales. Volume is negatively impacted by harvesting below plan, which we talked about as a result of hatch. We started this year with a plan to grow the business and grow our head and grow our sales. But our byproducts and export sales are our biggest misses from a volume perspective. 
We will see volume increase between now and mid '22. That's in hatch, that's in head harvested and that's in volume through our plants. From a mix standpoint, we've added volume. Value-added volume is very strong. That's ready-to-eat products, that's pre-fried products, that's our frozen value-added branded products. That's the heart and soul of our business in Chicken. 
We are at capacity with strong retail and foodservice demand. As Stewart referenced earlier, we're adding lines and plans to address very strong demand. Our pricing is up 16% in the quarter. Most of this increase came in June and even more in July. We work with our customers, and they've been very responsive. Our relationships are relationships are very strong with our customers. 
We've been successful in getting pricing. Grain also, at the same time, has continued to escalate. And pricing will certainly lag the cost in this scenario. We're just simply asking for fair market value for these products. But long story short, we are executing better. We are performing better. We have a great deal of inflation led by grain, but we've gotten pricing around us. And so as we move into every month and quarter from here, I would expect us to be sequentially better. And that 5% to 7% that we talked about by mid-'22, we're committed to that, and we stand with that number."

For the last year or so between COVID and unfortunately your fire, it seems like there's been a lot of cattle that just hasn't been dead as quickly as people may have expected. So although  we may be going through an underlying contraction, there seems to be a lot more cattle out there through probably at least through the winter if not through 2022. Would you agree with that? Would you kind of put parameters around that? How do you see that? 
And then as a follow-up to that would be the export side, the China and Japan, the trade policies, that seems to be -- and the shortage of Australian's beef, that seems like there's a duration to the export picture as well. And then I'll leave it there, and I appreciate your time, as always."

And I think your view of Beef, where we had ample cattle supplies and where we had really strong demand. We were constricted in the middle, but based on the labor availability -- and I talked about this in Chicken earlier -- but in our Beef business, it essentially takes us 6 days to get 5 days worth of work. So the inefficiency associated with that allowed cattle to back up on the ranch and then feedlots. 
So here's what we know as we look into '22. Herd supplies are expected to be down about 0.5%. And June cattle on feed is projected to be up 1.9%. There has been some herd liquidation in the West and Northern Plains, which according to CattleFax, about 33% of the U.S. cow-calf production is in this drought area. But '22, '22 is looking good. Is it going to be at the same level in which we were -- where we are at '21? Probably not. I don't think it will be that good. I think it will be better than historical returns. But -- and I'm talking that 1% to 3%, which we talked about forever, it will be north of that, we think. But we think all in all, Beef will have a very nice year in '22. 
In terms of export, to the other part of your question, Asian growth is still solid. U.S. grain-fed beef is preferred around the world. And as you mentioned, key global beef suppliers are rebuilding herds in Australia and Brazil and Canada. So all of that is true. And so strong export demand for us as well as domestic."

So, so far, we're running at about a 9.5% range. But you've always talked about like this 10% to 12% range. So what is it -- what keeps you away from being more aggressive on pricing within the Prepared Foods business to really pass on more of that internal inflationary pressure you're seeing on the ingredient side just to bring it back to the low-teens levels because I think guidance as well for the year is just below that 10% level.

Retail orders, for example, are up 30% versus pre-COVID levels. Foodservice is showing a sequential improvement as well. We have seen accelerating and unprecedented inflation. So what do we do about that? Well, we have significant foodservice pricing already in the market. Retail pricing will be in the market by September 5. Inflation is up about 14% during our 3Q and 9% year-to-date. We've had -- just like other businesses, we've had labor and absenteeism and turnover in the business, so we have a number of open positions. So that certainly has made us inefficient. 
And so we've got aggressive pricing going on, aggressive revenue management and commercial spend management will help mitigate a portion of these inflationary impacts. We'll have to get more pricing, but we're comfortable that over time, that our Prepared Foods is a double-digit business for us. And it's just a -- costs are hitting us faster than we can get pricing at this point."

But let's just talk about overall our view of capital allocation. First of all, we really feel great about the current position of our balance sheet. I mean liquidity was $3.4 billion coming out of the quarter. That was before we took the receipt of the $1.2 billion from pet, and we did repay about $500 million worth of debt subsequent to the end of the quarter. So the balance sheet is very healthy. 
From an investment standpoint, one of the things that we talked about both in the prepared remarks and in last quarter is that we expect to invest behind our business. We have significant opportunity to invest in expanding our capacity. And I spoke this morning about International, that will be a growth area for us. The CapEx that's going into the international space and new facilities will expand their capacity by 30% when compared to last year. That's a big deal. 
And I think when you look at the rest of our business, Donnie spoke this morning about automation, and you're seeing that both across Prepared Foods as well as in our Chicken business, which will certainly help our labor. It will help our efficiency. And then you look at where we're putting money just behind in terms of new facilities. And Humboldt has gone live. We've got a new case-ready facility in Utah, that will be coming online shortly as well as one in South Carolina. So we've got a pretty active internal agenda. If something on the outside presents itself that we think it makes sense for our investors, then we're going to -- we'll obviously take a look at that. But hopefully, that gives you a flavor for where we're investing our money."

But with retail, with the branded portfolio, it can take a little bit longer to get pricing in. We typically don't disclose that kind of information about when we would do it. But here's generally the way we think about this is that when raw materials, when inputs go up, pricing has to go up particularly in an environment where we have such rapid and accelerating inflation. We have little choice but to go and to -- we certainly have to be competitive, but we certainly have to get pricing to cover the increase in inputs. And we're doing that, and we're doing that very methodically. We're looking at all the metrics around that as we do that, but we're doing it in a very responsible way.

Actually, if you look at inflation, the biggest driver for Prepared Foods has been the input cost of commodities. And of course, for Prepared Foods, that mostly is Pork. You've got that, of course, along with the increase in MAP spend, which I referred to later. 
So in terms of thinking about price, I mean, what Donnie is saying is when we think the price -- that commodities are going up or any inputs are going up, we're going to match that with pricing. That pricing may not follow exactly the track of input inflation. But you also need to think about how that input inflation can move along. While we've got labor cost increases, which are going into our workforce, you should think about those as more permanent of course. But you've seen the cycles around commodities and you'll have to take a view of what you think pork -- the cost of pork will do over the price over the course of next year. If pork comes off, then that will be a help to us. If pork doesn't come off, then I think Donnie's point is that we will continue to take price to match the nature of the cost that's coming to us."

I'll start by saying that the safety of our team members continue to be our top priority, and I'm very pleased that we now have a team in the U.S. that is fully vaccinated. As we focus on meeting the needs of our customers and consumers,",2311,"Thank you, Megan. I'll start by saying that the safety of our team members continue to be our top priority, and I'm very pleased that we now have a team in the U.S. that is fully vaccinated. As we focus on meeting the needs of our customers and consumers, vaccination is the best way that we can protect our team members from the impacts related to COVID-19 and ensure business continuity. 
Earlier today, we reported strong fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results. We delivered double-digit sales and earnings growth in a challenging year. Our performance was supported by continued strength in consumer demand for protein. Our retail core business lines, which include our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park have driven strong share growth in the retail channel, delivering 13 quarters of consecutive growth. Continued recovery in the foodservice channel, led by QSRs, also supported our strong results. Overall, we saw our volume recover in the second half from the pandemic lows to finish the fiscal year only slightly down. 
We are taking several deliberate actions by segment to improve our volumes, including investing behind capacities, brands and product innovation and our team members. Our investments in team members include our successful vaccination mandate as well as automation and technology initiatives that I'll discuss in a moment. The construction of the 12 new plants that we've mentioned previously are progressing well, and once complete, will enable Tyson to address capacity constraints and growing global demand for protein. These new capacities include 9 chicken plants, 2 case-ready beef and pork plants and 1 new vacant plant. 
In parallel to our actions to improve volume, we have also worked to recover inflation through pricing, achieving a 13% price improvement for the fiscal year and a 24% increase for the fourth quarter. In this dynamic environment, we will be aggressive in monitoring inflation and driving price recovery activities. 
And the diversity of our portfolio showed its value again this quarter as demonstrated by earnings. Performance in our Beef segment supported the delivery of a strong fiscal year earnings result. Our performance has allowed us to build financial strength. Our balance sheet is strong, resilient and provides Tyson the optionality needed to pursue strategic growth priorities. And to that point, our investment in future growth across our portfolio continue. 
We demonstrated resilience in fiscal year 2021, and we are entering fiscal 2022 with tremendous momentum. Our results demonstrate the dedication of our global team the importance of our diverse portfolio strategy and our ability to meet consumer demand across proteins, channels and meal occasions. 
Now turning to financial results. Let me give you some highlights overall. I was pleased with both a strong quarter and full year. Sales improved 20% in the fourth quarter and 11% during the full year. Our sales gains were largely driven by higher average sales price. Average sales price trends reflect successful pricing strategies during the ongoing inflationary environment, but we still have opportunities, specifically in Prepared Foods, where we delivered softer results than anticipated. 
Like many other companies, we were faced with a range of higher levels of inflation, notably higher grains, labor, meat and transportation costs. Our teams have worked together with our customers to pass along that inflation through price increases. 
On volume, we saw improvement in the second half relative to the same period last year. Volumes were up 3% for the second half, are nearly 350 million pounds. Although we're working diligently to achieve optimal throughput across our segments, labor challenges are still impacting our volumes and ability to achieve optimal mix across our processing footprint. Having said that, we're taking aggressive actions as a team to address the labor constraints, and we're seeing improvements. 
We delivered solid operating income performance, up 26% during the fourth quarter and 42% for the full year. This performance was largely due to strength in our Beef segment for continued strong consumer demand and ample cattle supply have driven higher earnings. Overall, our operating income performance translated to earnings per share of $2.30 for the fourth quarter, up 35%; and $8.28 for the full year, up 53%. 
Looking at our results on volume. We're taking aggressive actions to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix by plant and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. For the fiscal year, our volume was down slightly. Customer demand during fiscal '21 outpaced our ability to supply products, but we're working aggressively to fill that void. We recognize how important the service levels are to our customers, and we're committed to improving our fill rates and reliability of supply. 
With respect to supply, we have focused on ensuring our ability to maintain business continuity, and our team has been resilient in the face of numerous supply chain challenges. As we look toward fiscal '22, improving volumes will be key to delivering against our commitments. We expect to grow our total company volumes by 2% to 3% next year, outpacing overall protein consumption growth. A large percentage of that growth will come from the Chicken segment. And across our business, we're working to optimize our product portfolio, remove complexities, enhanced capacities and pursue operational improvement initiatives to deliver against these volume growth objectives. 
Moving now to Slide 6. We acknowledge the challenging and competitive labor environment. And it's no secret that we want to be the most sought after place to work. We fully understand that this starts with an unrelenting focus on safety, every minute, every shift, every day. The health safety and wellness of our team members has been and will continue to be our top priority. 
So I'd like to take a minute to stop and commend our team members and our leadership team for doing their part to keep themselves, their colleagues, their families and their community safe, which has helped us reach our vaccination goals. The vaccines and investments in COVID-19 protection measures are certainly not the only actions that we've taken to become the most sought after place to work. 
To ensure that every Tyson team member feels as though they can bring their true and complete self to work each day, we've invested to high in diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. And we also understand the importance of a strong compensation offering, and we believe that we hold a leadership position in this space. We have raised wages and across our business today, we pay an average of $24 per hour, which includes full medical, vision, dental and other benefits like access to retirement plan and sick pay and we will continue to explore other innovative benefit offerings that remove barriers and make our team members' lives easier. 
We're also accelerating investments in automation and advanced technologies to make existing roles safer and easier while reducing costs. We're confident that our actions will increase Tyson staffing levels and position us for volume growth. 
Relating to operational excellence and market competitiveness, today, we are announcing the launch of a new productivity program designed to drive a better, faster and more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making. The program is targeted to deliver $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal '24 relative to fiscal '21 cost baseline. These savings are included in the guidance expectations that Stewart will share in a moment. 
Execution of the effort will be supported by a program management office that will ensure delivery of key project milestones and report on savings achievements connected to 3 imperatives. The first is operational and functional excellence and is targeted to deliver greater than $300 million in recurring savings. This includes functional efficiency efforts in finance, HR and procurement that are focused on applying best practices to reduce cost. 
The second is digital solutions, which is targeted to deliver more than $250 million in recurring savings. We'll achieve this goal by leveraging new digital solutions like artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to drive efficiency in operations, supply chain, planning, logistics and warehousing. For example, we're using technology to ensure that our shipments are optimally loaded to save freight cost and enhanced customer service levels. In many ways, the pandemic has already accelerated our push to more digital footing and our commitment in this space will continue that focus. 
The third is automation. We will leverage automation and robotics technologies to automate difficult and higher turnover positions. For example, we have substantial opportunity to automate the debone process within our poultry harvest facilities using the combination of both third-party and proprietary technologies. 
Chicken remains a top priority for me personally and for our company. We continue to execute against our road map to bring operating income margin to at least the 5% to 7% range on a run rate basis by mid fiscal '22. Our goal has not changed, and we remain committed to restoring top-tier performance. 
The first imperative is to be the most sought after place to work. I've outlined the investments we're making to enhance our team member experience in my earlier comments. This will ensure that we have the right levels of staffing to fulfill our customer orders on time and in full. 
The second imperative is to improve operational performance. Critical to improving operational performance is maximizing our fixed cost leverage, which means having enough birds in our internal networks to run our plants full. By reconfiguring and optimizing our existing footprint, we can increase our harvest capacity by more than 10% without building another plant. In addition, we have clear initiatives to remove complexity from our plants, reduce transportation and handling, and minimize waste. 
Our operational improvements will unlock significant unused capacity in our network and take advantage of the fixed cost leverage. Each of these initiatives will support leading operational performance from our Chicken business in the future. 
Hatch rates have impacted our ability to do this, and we've shared the initiatives underway to correct this. Our new male rollout is progressing as planned, and we believe we've hit the inflection point that will lead to sequential improvements through the entirety of fiscal 2022. The new male rollout at our pullet farms is nearly complete, and we continue to observe improved hatch rates associated with these new males. 
We've also mentioned how strength in spot prices for commodity chicken products throughout the fiscal year has put our buy versus growth program at a relative disadvantage versus history. From Q3 to Q4, we again reduced our rate of outside purchases, this time by nearly 30%. 
The final imperative is to service our customers, on time and in full. Tyson's branded value-added product offerings have continued to gain share during both the fourth quarter and the latest 52 weeks and new capacity expansions will help us maintain momentum. 
Inflation has clearly had an impact on the business. Our commercial teams have successfully pursued inflation-justified pricing, delivering top line growth for the business to offset the cost increases. As rates of inflation continue, so will our pricing actions with an equivalent level of emphasis on disciplined operational execution and volume throughput. We will staff our plants, service our customers, grow volumes and be the best chicken business. The plan we have in place is still the right plan and our level of confidence, conviction and excitement as a team continue to grow. 
Looking forward to fiscal year 2022, I feel confident in our ability to drive value creation. We have strong consumer demand, a powerful and diverse portfolio across geographies and channels and a team that is positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. Our priorities are clear: winning with customers and consumers, winning with team members and winning with excellence in execution. With these priorities as our guide, we are taking aggressive actions to accelerate our growth relative to the overall market, improved operating margins and drive stronger returns on invested capital. 
We are committed to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety and well-being as well as ensuring an inclusive and equitable work environment every shift, every day, every location with no exceptions. We have shown that we are willing to take bold actions in support of this commitment. 
Second, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better serve demand. This includes increasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales by focusing our product portfolio and by adding capacity to meet demand. We expect our volume to outpace the market in the intermediate term. 
Third, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment. This starts by returning our operating margin to the 5% to 7% level by the middle of fiscal 2022. Fourth, we are driving operational and functional excellence in investing in digital and automation initiatives. This is at the heart of our new productivity program. We're working diligently to drive out waste, minimize bureaucracy and enhance decision-making speed across the organization. 
Finally, to address expected demand growth over the next decade, we're using our financial strength to invest in our business through both organic investments in strategic M&A. On capital alone, we expect to invest $2 billion in fiscal year '22 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation objectives. 
Tyson has the right portfolio, the consumer-driven insights and the scale and the capabilities to win in the marketplace across proteins, channels and meal locations. We also have the financial strength to invest behind our business to accelerate growth and to obtain our momentum. I look forward to sharing with you our progress as we work through the year, and I'll be sharing more details with you at our Investor Day in a few weeks. 
I'll now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail."

Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. We're pleased to report a strong overall finish to the year. Sales were up approximately 20% in the fourth quarter, largely a function of our successful pricing in",1944,"Thank you, Donnie. 
Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. We're pleased to report a strong overall finish to the year. Sales were up approximately 20% in the fourth quarter, largely a function of our successful pricing initiatives that were pursued to offset inflationary pressures. Volumes were down 4% during the fourth quarter, primarily due to labor challenges hampering our efforts to fully benefit from strong retail demand and recovery in foodservice. 
Fourth quarter operating income of nearly $1.2 billion was up 26% due to continued strong performance in our Beef business. For the full year, operating income improved to nearly $4.3 billion, up 42%. Driven by the strength in operating income, fourth quarter EPS grew 35% to $2.30 on, with the full year up 53% to $8.28. 
Slide 11 bridges our total company sales for fiscal year '21. Sales dollars were up across all segments. As you can see, the most substantial sales dollars benefit came from the Beef segment, which saw market conditions that led to a wider than historical cut-out margin. At the same time, we saw price increases across the business to offset the high levels of inflation we faced. 
Looking at our channel results. Sales at retail drove over $1 billion of top line improvement versus last year, even after exceptionally strong volumes in the comparable period. Improvements in sales through the foodservice channel drove an increase of $1.6 billion and our fiscal year export sales were nearly $1 billion stronger than the prior year as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business. 
Slide 12 bridges year-to-date operating income, which was about $1.3 billion higher than fiscal 2020. As I mentioned previously, volumes were down slightly during the year, primarily a result of a challenging labor environment. Our pricing actions and strength in the Beef segment led to approximately $5.6 billion of sales price mix benefit, which more than offset the higher COGS price mix of $4.6 billion. 
We saw inflation across the business, notable areas where in wages, grain costs, live animal costs and pork meat costs in prepared foods and freight costs across the enterprise. Incremental direct COVID-19 costs were favorable by approximately $200 million during the year, although our total spending at $335 million was still substantial. The decrease was driven primarily by cycling onetime bonuses that were paid last year, and a large portion of that was reinvested in permanent wage increases for our team members this year. 
Lower onetime bonus costs were partially offset by higher testing and vaccination costs incurred during fiscal 2021. While these costs are expected to reduce in fiscal '22, we will continue to spend against initiatives to keep our team members safe. And finally, SG&A was over $100 million favorable to prior year, which was largely a result of the net benefit associated with the beef supplier fraud. 
Now moving to the Beef segment. Segment sales were over $5 billion for the quarter, up 26% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers included strong domestic and export demand for beef products. Offsetting higher sales prices were higher cattle costs, up more than 20% during the fourth quarter. We had ample livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies. And we have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal '22 and currently believe it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs. 
Sales volume for the quarter was up year-over-year due to continued strong demand in contrast to a soft comparable period a year ago, driven by lower production volumes. We delivered segment operating income of $1.1 billion or 22.9% for the fourth quarter. This improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cut-out, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. 
While our Beef segment experienced strong results during the quarter and fiscal year, we are still not at optimal levels of capacity throughput due to labor challenges, which we expect to normalize over the course of fiscal '22. 
Now let's move on to the Pork segment on Slide 14. Segment sales were over $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 30% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand and increased hog costs, partially offset by a challenging labor environment. Average sales price increased more than 40%. Our volumes were down relative to the same period [indiscernible] quarter, down 52% versus the comparable period. Overall, operating margins for the segment declined to 4.7% for the quarter, the operating income and freight costs. 
Sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 7% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was down 5.7 [indiscernible] with strength in the retail channel and  continued volume growth driven by higher sales mix. During the fourth quarter, retail core business [indiscernible] by consumer demand for our brands and continued strong brand execution by our team. Operating margins for the segment were [indiscernible] $139 million for the fourth quarter A slowdown in segment [indiscernible] significant increases in raw material input costs that we were not able to fully recover through price during the quarter. For the full year, operating 
[Audio Gap] 
logistics, ingredients, packaging and labor fitting income have increased our cost of production. We've executed pricing, revenue management and commercial spend optimization initiatives while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through marketing and trade support. We expect to take continued pricing actions to ensure that any inflationary cost increases that our business incurs are passed along. Our pricing has lagged inflation, but we expect to recover those cost increases during fiscal '22. 
Moving into the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $3.9 billion for the fourth quarter, up 21%. Volumes improved 1.3% in the quarter as strong consumer demand offset both labor challenges and the detrimental impact of a fire at our rendering facility. Our teams have been focused on streamlining our plants to deliver higher volumes, and we expect to deliver substantial volume improvements in fiscal '22 as the hatch rate recovers, and we operate our plants more efficiently. 
Average sales price improved over 20% in the fourth quarter and 11.4% for the fiscal year compared to the same periods last year. This increase is due to favorable product mix and price recovery to offset cost inflation. Our pricing has admittedly lagged our realization of cost inflation, but we made tremendous progress in the last few months to close that gap and are now seeing those benefits. We have restructured our pricing strategies given our experience in fiscal '21 to ensure that we have the flexibility to better respond to market and inflationary conditions. 
Chicken experienced an operating loss of $113 million in the fourth quarter. The segment earned $24 million, representing an operating margin of 0.2% for the fiscal year 2021. Operating income was negatively impacted by $945 million of higher feed ingredient costs, grow out expenses and outside meat purchases. For the fourth quarter, feed ingredients were $325 million higher than the same period last year. 
Segment performance also reflects net derivative losses of $75 million during the fourth quarter, which was $120 million worse than the same period last year. 
Turning to Slide 17. In pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we have substantially delevered our business over the past 12 months, reducing leverage to 1.2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA as we paid down $2 billion of debt while growing our earnings and cash flow. Investing organically in our business will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities. Each of these levers will support strong return generation for our shareholders. We will also continue to explore parts to optimize our portfolio through M&A through the lens of value creation and shareholder return. 
Finally, as our track record has demonstrated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. We're pleased to announce that last week, our Board approved a $0.06 increase to our annual dividend payment now totaling $1.84 per Class A share. 
Let's now discuss the fiscal '22 financial outlook. We currently anticipate total company sales between $49 million and $51 billion, which translate to sales growth of between 5% and 7%. We expect 2% to 3% volume growth on a year-over-year basis as we work to optimize our existing footprint and run our plants full. Our new productivity initiative is expected to deliver $300 million to $400 million of savings during fiscal '22, driven by operational and functional excellence initiatives, the rollout of digital solutions across the enterprise and extensive automation projects that are currently underway. 
Now as we look at the organic growth opportunities ahead for our business, we expect a meaningful increase in CapEx spending to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profiles. We currently anticipate CapEx spending of approximately $2 billion during fiscal '22, an increase of roughly $800 million. This investment will support our initiatives to meet global protein demand growth into the future, allow us to gain share and will deliver strong financial returns for our shareholders. 
Excluding the impact of changes from potential tax legislation, we currently expect our adjusted tax rate to be around 23%. We anticipate net interest expense of approximately $380 million because of intentional deleveraging during fiscal '21. Liquidity is expected to significantly exceed our target while net leverage is expected to remain well below 2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
It is important to note though that over the last 2 years, working capital has been a source of cash. We don't expect this to be the case in fiscal '22. Moving forward, our business growth will require increased working capital, which, combined with deferred tax payments under the CARES Act, taxes on the gain of the Pet Treats divestiture, litigation settlements and other discrete items will lead to a substantial use of cash during fiscal 2022. 
Now let's look at how each of our segments will contribute to that total company performance. Prepared Foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal '22 of between 7% and 9%. We will remain disciplined and agile in our pricing initiatives to ensure that any additional inflationary pressures are passed along to customers while also working diligently to deliver productivity savings to reduce costs. 
We expect the Beef segment to continue to show strength due to prolonged industry dynamics leading to segment margins of between 9% and 11%. We expect the front half of the year to be meaningfully stronger than the back half as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize partway through the year. 
In Chicken, our operational turnaround is working, and we still expect to achieve run rate profitability of 5% to 7% by the middle of the year. We expect this will be achieved through sequential quarterly margin improvements during the first half of the year, resulting in full year margins that fall between 5% to 7%, although expected at the lower end of that range. 
In Pork, we expect similar performance during fiscal '22 to what we accomplished during fiscal '21, equating to a margin of between 5% and 7%. In International and Other, we expect margins of 2% to 3% as capacity expansions and strong global demand support volume growth and improved profitability. 
Our segments individually and in aggregate, have clear and compelling role within Tyson's portfolio strategy. They deliver diverse countercyclical performance that supports the company's long-term earnings objectives and deliver strong value for shareholders.

This is really a diverse portfolio that's delivered a great result, and that's driven the increase in cash. So sitting at 1.2x leverage, we've got $1 billion of debt that will come due this year. We're planning to pay that down. 
We also, as you called out, are going to have a much larger expenditure on CapEx, which is going to be great for our investors. And as our business grows, that's going to consume some more working capital, regular working capital. In addition to that, we've got a number of one-off payments that we expect to pay out this year, which are pretty meaningful. And to characterize that is around $1 billion of deferred taxes related to the CARES Act, taxes that are owed on the sale of the Pet business, as well as some payout of the litigation accruals that you've seen in our books. 
To M&A. Maybe the last question on an M&A versus buyback. Look, as a normal course, we don't comment on any specific M&A. But we've shared our specific levers in our business. We have successfully pulled all those levers over the last number of years. And I think that's been a good effect. We don't imagine that we're going to change that this year."

But as we've mentioned in the script earlier, we're seeing a light at the end of this tunnel. We're seeing our ability to get plant staffed. I think from a poultry perspective, for example, we're almost fully staffed since November 1. We've made great progress across Prepared Foods and our Beef and Pork businesses. So we're gaining on that post the close of our vaccine mandate. So we're very optimistic about '22. 
But in addition to having a labor shortfall, which is constrained capacity, we've also had just capacity shortfall in some key categories, for example, ready-to-eat products that would be for the more value-added poultry and also for prepared foods. And again, we're just now bringing on 2 new case-ready beef and pork plants to enable us to have more capacity in there and a startup mode. 
So yes, the labor has been a challenge. We see -- we're seeing progress. We're very excited about '22 from that perspective. We believe we've got the worst behind us, and we're looking forward to that, but we're also -- we've got 12 new plants going -- are under construction to deliver more capacity and we have strong demand for that.

And that's primarily targeted against our finance, human resources and procurement groups, it's executing at a much higher level. There's another component that is digital solutions, and that's about $250 million in recurring savings. That's more on the operational side, the supply chain planning logistics and warehousing. So you can think of that in that bucket. And that's across all businesses. 
In fact, the first 2 across all businesses. And then third, automation, leveraging robotics and technology, and we're spending significantly -- a significant portion of the $2 billion in capital that we're spending or a disproportionate amount of that is going against capacity expansion in these 12 plants that we talked about over the next 3 years. But in addition to that, it's to put automation and technology and to eliminate difficult higher turnover jobs. 
Think, for example, debone automation, whether it be for the white meat or dark meat, think about in terms of material handling and you would see more of that from -- in our Prepared Foods group.

Remember, this male that we put in is not new to the world. It's one we've used and delivered great results for years. So we have a great deal of confidence in that. But it's also efficiency is about running plant at capacity and not having to go to the outside and buy as much boneless skinless breast meat as we have in '21. And then labor. I mean, I mentioned earlier that we're back to near complete staffing, and we're seeing some really, really good results from that.

The improvements are coming from price mix, volume, spend and labor. In short, we are driving operational excellence across our poultry segment, and we are aligned on that plan.

And we want to give people an option. We want to give them a better option. And we think the key to the staffing plans, but more importantly, being able to service customers and execute at a high level, absolutely starts with people. So the $24 an hour, it includes a number of things, but is the benefits that go with that. We've had to enhance a number of those things, the things like scheduling differences, differences meaning multiple shifts or being very creative at each location. Child care is a component of that. We've experimented with on-site health clinics, there's another we've experimented with. 
But we're trying to be creative and trying to make sure that we're positioned well to have a place people want to come to work. And we see that as being critical to our future success.

The one thing I am certain of is as we get into '22, we will -- there's going to be something happened we hadn't anticipated. If you go back to this time a year ago, we thought we had a pretty solid plan around -- in poultry around grain price -- or pricing relative to grain. And then we saw a tremendous increase in in the cost of grain, and we were sitting with fixed pricing so much. So those type of things happen. 
What I can tell you and why we're excited is that we've adjusted our model, our pricing model. And so that we derisk it not only for us, but also for our customers. So that when there is inflation, then we're in a position we can adjust pricing with those customers. And our relationships with them are really second to none. And these have been really good conversations. It's been a win-win approach in these conversations, and we're proud of that. And it starts with that relationship with the customer. 
So we've moved and derisked our model relative to pricing and inflation. And that, we believe, puts us in a better position. In terms of labor, I don't know how to anticipate a new COVID variant or something that the vaccine might not protect against. But I can tell you that we took a bold action to do everything we need to do to protect team members. And we saw it as an investment and a derisking of our business just by having a vaccinated workforce. And so like we believe that's one less thing we'll have to deal with this year.

We've positioned ourselves from a poultry perspective as well as from a Prepared Foods perspective so that we can respond to the inflation, whether it be grain, labor, transportation, warehousing costs, which are the biggest ones. Packaging, packaging and ingredients have all gone up in price as well. In fact, I would -- it might be easier for me to tell you what hasn't seen -- what component hasn't seen inflation in this past year. 
But we think we've got our model positioned to adjust for that around pricing and responsiveness. And we don't expect customers to pay for inefficiency, but we'd like to think that we have relationships with customers that allow us to be able to take to them the inflation that we see in the marketplace and be able to pass that on ultimately to the consumer. And so that's the way we thought about our model. That's how we've adjusted our model and it's been a year long -- really a year-long event doing that. And we are in a pretty good place right now. 
With respect to Chicken, I think based on today's current level of inflation, we have currently caught up without inflation with pricing across the Chicken segment. We're putting that pricing in place in Prepared Foods. And of course, our commodity businesses of Beef and Pork, those respond more rapidly to the inflation.

Perhaps a couple of other things to keep in mind. There are ingredient costs that are outside of grain, things like cooking oil, you've seen the price of oil that increased. Distribution is up. And we've had 13 strong quarters of share gain in our Prepared Foods business, and that business will likely invest money behind our brands this year to make sure that, that kind of momentum continues. So that's probably a run-through the big items."

I'll start by saying that the safety of our team members continue to be our top priority, and I'm very pleased that we now have a team in the U.S. that is fully vaccinated. As we focus on meeting the needs of our customers and consumers,",2305,"Thank you, Megan. I'll start by saying that the safety of our team members continue to be our top priority, and I'm very pleased that we now have a team in the U.S. that is fully vaccinated. As we focus on meeting the needs of our customers and consumers, vaccination is the best way that we can protect our team members from the impacts related to COVID-19 and ensure business continuity.
Earlier today, we reported strong fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results. We delivered double-digit sales and earnings growth in a challenging year. Our performance was supported by continued strength in consumer demand for protein. Our retail core business lines, which include our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park have driven strong share growth in the retail channel, delivering 13 quarters of consecutive growth.
Continued recovery in the foodservice channel, led by QSRs, also supported our strong results. Overall, we saw our volume recover in the second half from the pandemic lows to finish the fiscal year only slightly down.
We are taking several deliberate actions by segment to improve our volumes, including investing behind capacities, brands and product innovation and our team members. Our investments in team members include our successful vaccination mandate as well as automation and technology initiatives that I'll discuss in a moment.
The construction of the 12 new plants that we've mentioned previously are progressing well and, once complete, will enable Tyson to address capacity constraints and growing global demand for protein. These new capacities include 9 chicken plants, 2 case-ready beef and pork plants and 1 new vacant plant.
In parallel to our actions to improve volume, we have also worked to recover inflation through pricing, achieving a 13% price improvement for the fiscal year and a 24% increase for the fourth quarter. In this dynamic environment, we will be aggressive in monitoring inflation and driving price recovery activities.
And the diversity of our portfolio showed its value again this quarter as demonstrated by earnings. Performance in our Beef segment supported the delivery of a strong fiscal year earnings result. Our performance has allowed us to build financial strength. Our balance sheet is strong, resilient and provides Tyson the optionality needed to pursue strategic growth priorities. And to that point, our investment in future growth across our portfolio continue.
We demonstrated resilience in fiscal year 2021, and we are entering fiscal 2022 with tremendous momentum. Our results demonstrate the dedication of our global team, the importance of our diverse portfolio strategy and our ability to meet consumer demand across proteins, channels and meal occasions.
Now turning to financial results. Let me give you some highlights overall. I was pleased with both a strong quarter and full year. Sales improved 20% in the fourth quarter and 11% during the full year. Our sales gains were largely driven by higher average sales price. Average sales price trends reflect successful pricing strategies during the ongoing inflationary environment, but we still have opportunities, specifically in Prepared Foods, where we delivered softer results than anticipated.
Like many other companies, we were faced with a range of higher levels of inflation, notably higher grains, labor, meat and transportation costs. Our teams have worked together with our customers to pass along that inflation through price increases.
On volume, we saw improvement in the second half relative to the same period last year. Volumes were up 3% for the second half or nearly 350 million pounds. Although we're working diligently to achieve optimal throughput across our segments, labor challenges are still impacting our volumes and ability to achieve optimal mix across our processing footprint. Having said that, we're taking aggressive actions as a team to address the labor constraints, and we're seeing improvement.
We delivered solid operating income performance, up 26% during the fourth quarter and 42% for the full year. This performance was largely due to strength in our Beef segment where continued strong consumer demand and ample cattle supply have driven higher earnings. Overall, our operating income performance translated to earnings per share of $2.30 for the fourth quarter, up 35%; and $8.28 for the full year, up 53%.
Looking at our results on volume. We're taking aggressive actions to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix by plant and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. For the fiscal year, our volume was down slightly. Customer demand during the fiscal '21 outpaced our ability to supply products, but we're working aggressively to fill that void. We recognize how important service levels are to our customers, and we're committed to improving our fill rates and reliability of supply.
With respect to supply, we have focused on ensuring our ability to maintain business continuity, and our team has been resilient in the face of numerous supply chain challenges. As we look toward fiscal '22, improving volumes will be key to delivering against our commitments. We expect to grow our total company volumes by 2% to 3% next year, outpacing overall protein consumption growth. A large percentage of that growth will come from the Chicken segment. And across our business, we're working to optimize our product portfolio, remove complexities, enhance capacities and pursue operational improvement initiatives to deliver against these volume growth objectives.
Moving now to Slide 6. We acknowledge the challenging and competitive labor environment. And it's no secret that we want to be the most sought-after place to work. We fully understand that this starts with an unrelenting focus on safety, every minute, every shift, every day. The health, safety and wellness of our team members has been and will continue to be our top priority. So I'd like to take a minute to stop and commend our team members and our leadership team for doing their part to keep themselves, their colleagues, their families and their community safe, which has helped us reach our vaccination goals.
The vaccines and investments in COVID-19 protection measures are certainly not the only actions that we've taken to become the most sought-after place to work. To ensure that every Tyson team member feels as though they can bring their true and complete self to work each day, we've invested behind diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
And we also understand the importance of a strong compensation offering, and we believe that we hold a leadership position in this space. We have raised wages and across our business today, we pay an average of $24 per hour, which includes full medical, vision, dental and other benefits like access to retirement plan and sick pay, and we will continue to explore other innovative benefit offerings that remove barriers and make our team members' lives easier.
We're also accelerating investments in automation and advanced technologies to make existing roles safer and easier while reducing costs. We're confident that our actions will increase Tyson staffing levels and position us for volume growth.
Relating to operational excellence and market competitiveness, today, we are announcing the launch of a new productivity program designed to drive a better, faster and more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making. The program is targeted to deliver $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal '24 relative to fiscal '21 cost baseline. These savings are included in the guidance expectations that Stewart will share in a moment.
Execution of the effort will be supported by a program management office that will ensure delivery of key project milestones and report on savings achievements connected to 3 imperatives. The first is operational and functional excellence and is targeted to deliver greater than $300 million in recurring savings. This includes functional efficiency efforts in finance, HR and procurement that are focused on applying best practices to reduce cost.
The second is digital solutions, which is targeted to deliver more than $250 million in recurring savings. We'll achieve this goal by leveraging new digital solutions like artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to drive efficiency in operations, supply chain, planning, logistics and warehousing. For example, we're using technology to ensure that our shipments are optimally loaded to save freight cost and enhance customer service levels. In many ways, the pandemic has already accelerated our push to more digital footing, and our commitment in this space will continue that focus.
The third is automation. We will leverage automation and robotics technologies to automate difficult and higher turnover positions. For example, we have substantial opportunity to automate the debone process within our poultry harvest facilities using the combination of both third-party and proprietary technologies.
Chicken remains a top priority for me personally and for our company. We continue to execute against our road map to bring operating income margin to at least the 5% to 7% range on a run rate basis by mid-fiscal '22. Our goal has not changed, and we remain committed to restoring top-tier performance.
The first imperative is to be the most sought-after place to work. I've outlined the investments we're making to enhance our team member experience in my earlier comments. This will ensure that we have the right levels of staffing to fulfill our customer orders on time and in full.
The second imperative is to improve operational performance. Critical to improving operational performance is maximizing our fixed cost leverage, which means having enough birds in our internal networks to run our plants full. By reconfiguring and optimizing our existing footprint, we can increase our harvest capacity by more than 10% without building another plant. In addition, we have clear initiatives to remove complexity from our plants, reduce transportation and handling and minimize waste.
Our operational improvements will unlock significant unused capacity in our network and take advantage of the fixed cost leverage. Each of these initiatives will support leading operational performance from our Chicken business in the future.
Hatch rates have impacted our ability to do this, and we've shared the initiatives underway to correct this. Our new male rollout is progressing as planned, and we believe we've hit the inflection point that will lead to sequential improvements through the entirety of fiscal 2022. The new male rollout at our pullet farms is nearly complete, and we continue to observe improved hatch rates associated with these new males.
We've also mentioned how strength in spot prices for commodity chicken products throughout the fiscal year has put our buy versus growth program at a relative disadvantage versus history. From Q3 to Q4, we again reduced our rate of outside purchases, this time by nearly 30%.
The final imperative is to service our customers on time and in full. Tyson's branded value-added product offerings have continued to gain share during both the fourth quarter and the latest 52 weeks, and new capacity expansions will help us maintain momentum.
Inflation has clearly had an impact on the business. Our commercial teams have successfully pursued inflation-justified pricing, delivering top line growth for the business to offset the cost increases. As rates of inflation continue, so will our pricing actions with an equivalent level of emphasis on disciplined operational execution and volume throughput. We will staff our plants, service our customers, grow volumes and be the best chicken business. The plan we have in place is still the right plan, and our level of confidence, conviction and excitement as a team continue to grow.
Looking forward to fiscal year 2022, I feel confident in our ability to drive value creation. We have strong consumer demand, a powerful and diverse portfolio across geographies and channels and a team that is positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. Our priorities are clear: winning with customers and consumers, winning with team members and winning with excellence in execution. With these priorities as our guide, we are taking aggressive actions to accelerate our growth relative to the overall market, improve operating margins and drive stronger returns on invested capital.
We are committed to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety and well-being as well as ensuring an inclusive and equitable work environment every shift, every day, every location with no exceptions. We have shown that we are willing to take bold actions in support of this commitment.
Second, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better serve demand. This includes increasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales by focusing our product portfolio and by adding capacity to meet demand. We expect our volume to outpace the market in the intermediate term.
Third, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment. This starts by returning our operating margin to the 5% to 7% level by the middle of fiscal 2022.
Fourth, we are driving operational and functional excellence in investing in digital and automation initiatives. This is at the heart of our new productivity program. We're working diligently to drive out waste, minimize bureaucracy and enhance decision-making speed across the organization.
Finally, to address expected demand growth over the next decade, we're using our financial strength to invest in our business through both organic investments and strategic M&A. On capital alone, we expect to invest $2 billion in fiscal year '22 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation objectives.
Tyson has the right portfolio, the consumer-driven insights and the scale and the capabilities to win in the marketplace across proteins, channels and meal locations. We also have the financial strength to invest behind our business to accelerate growth and to maintain our momentum. I look forward to sharing with you our progress as we work through the year, and I'll be sharing more details with you at our Investor Day in a few weeks.
I'll now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail."

Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. We're pleased to report a strong overall finish to the year. Sales were up approximately 20% in the fourth quarter, largely a function of our successful pricing initiatives that were pursued to offset inflationary pressures. Volumes were down 4% during the fourth quarter, primarily due to labor challenges, hampering our efforts to fully benefit from strong retail demand and recovery in foodservice.
Fourth quarter operating income of nearly $1.2 billion was up 26% due to continued strong performance in our Beef business. For the full year, operating income improved to nearly $4.3 billion, up 42%. Driven by the strength in operating income, fourth quarter EPS grew 35% to $2.30, with the full year up 53% to $8.28.
Slide 11 bridges our total company sales for fiscal year '21. Sales dollars were up across all segments. As you can see, the most substantial sales dollars benefit came from the Beef segment, which saw market conditions that led to a wider-than-historical cutout margin. At the same time, we saw price increases across the business to offset the high levels of inflation we faced.
Looking at our channel results. Sales at retail drove over $1 billion of top line improvement versus last year, even after exceptionally strong volumes in the comparable period. Improvements in sales through the foodservice channel drove an increase of $1.6 billion, and our fiscal year export sales were nearly $1 billion stronger than the prior year as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business.
Slide 12 bridges year-to-date operating income, which was about $1.3 billion higher than fiscal 2020. As I mentioned previously, volumes were down slightly during the year, primarily a result of a challenging labor environment. Our pricing actions and strength in the Beef segment led to approximately $5.6 billion of sales price/mix benefit, which more than offset the higher COGS price/mix of $4.6 billion.
We saw inflation across the business. Notable areas were in wages, grain costs, live animal costs and pork meat costs in prepared foods and freight costs across the enterprise. Incremental direct COVID-19 costs were favorable by approximately $200 million during the year, although our total spending at $335 million was still substantial. The decrease was driven primarily by cycling onetime bonuses that were paid last year, and a large portion of that was reinvested in permanent wage increases for our team members this year.
Lower onetime bonus costs were partially offset by higher testing and vaccination costs incurred during fiscal 2021. While these costs are expected to reduce in fiscal '22, we will continue to spend against initiatives to keep our team members safe. And finally, SG&A was over $100 million favorable to prior year, which was largely a result of a net benefit associated with the beef supplier fraud.
Now moving to the Beef segment. Segment sales were over $5 billion for the quarter, up 26% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers included strong domestic and export demand for beef products. Offsetting higher sales prices were higher cattle costs, up more than 20% during the fourth quarter. We had ample livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies. And we have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal '22 and currently believe it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs.
Sales volume for the quarter was up year-over-year due to continued strong demand in contrast to a soft comparable period a year ago driven by lower production volumes. We delivered segment operating income of $1.1 billion or 22.9% for the fourth quarter. This improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cutout, which were partially offset by higher operating costs.
While our Beef segment experienced strong results during the quarter and fiscal year, we are still not at optimal levels of capacity throughput due to labor challenges, which we expect to normalize over the course of fiscal '22.
Now let's move on to the Pork segment on Slide 14. Segment sales were over $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 30% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand and increased hog costs partially offset by a challenging labor environment. Average sales price increased more than 40%. Our volumes were down relative to the same period last year. Segment operating income was $78 million for the quarter, down 52% versus the comparable period. Overall, operating margins for the segment declined to 4.7% for the quarter. The operating income decline was driven by higher hog costs and increased labor and freight costs.
Moving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 7% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was down 5.7% in the quarter, with strength in the retail channel and continued recovery in foodservice more than offset by labor challenges. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by inflation-justified pricing and better sales mix.
During the fourth quarter, retail core business lines experienced their 13th straight quarter of volume share growth driven by consumer demand for our brands and continued strong brand execution by our team. Operating margins for the segment were 1.7% or $39 million for the fourth quarter. A slowdown in segment operating margins versus the same quarter last year was driven by significant increases in raw material input costs that we were not able to fully recover through price during the quarter. For the full year, operating income margin was 7.6% or $672 million.
As we mentioned last quarter, the ongoing inflationary environment created a meaningful headwind for Prepared Foods during the fourth quarter. Raw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging and labor have increased our cost of production. We've executed pricing, revenue management and commercial spend optimization initiatives while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through marketing and trade support. We expect to take continued pricing actions to ensure that any inflationary cost increases that our business incurs are passed along. Our pricing has lagged inflation, but we expect to recover those cost increases during fiscal '22.
Moving into the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $3.9 billion for the fourth quarter, up 21%. Volumes improved 1.3% in the quarter as strong consumer demand offset both labor challenges and the detrimental impact of a fire at our Hanceville rendering facility. Our teams have been focused on streamlining our plants to deliver higher volumes, and we expect to deliver substantial volume improvements in fiscal '22 as the hatch rate recovers and we operate our plants more efficiently.
Average sales price improved over 20% in the fourth quarter and 11.4% for the fiscal year compared to the same periods last year. This increase is due to favorable product mix and price recovery to offset cost inflation. Our pricing has admittedly lagged our realization of cost inflation, but we made tremendous progress in the last few months to close that gap and are now seeing those benefits. We have restructured our pricing strategies given our experience in fiscal '21 to ensure that we have the flexibility to better respond to market and inflationary conditions.
Chicken experienced an operating loss of $113 million in the fourth quarter. The segment earned $24 million, representing an operating margin of 0.2% for the fiscal year 2021. Operating income was negatively impacted by $945 million of higher feed ingredient costs, grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases. For the fourth quarter, feed ingredients were $325 million higher than the same period last year. Segment performance also reflects net derivative losses of $75 million during the fourth quarter, which was $120 million worse than the same period last year.
Turning to Slide 17. In pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we have substantially delevered our business over the past 12 months, reducing leverage to 1.2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA as we paid down $2 billion of debt while growing our earnings and cash flow. Investing organically in our business will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities. Each of these levers will support strong return generation for our shareholders. We will also continue to explore parts to optimize our portfolio through M&A through the lens of value creation and shareholder return.
Finally, as our track record has demonstrated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. We're pleased to announce that last week, our Board approved a $0.06 increase to our annual dividend payment now totaling $1.84 per Class A share.
Let's now discuss the fiscal '22 financial outlook. We currently anticipate total company sales between $49 million and $51 billion, which translate to sales growth of between 5% and 7%. We expect 2% to 3% volume growth on a year-over-year basis as we work to optimize our existing footprint and run our plants full. Our new productivity initiative is expected to deliver $300 million to $400 million of savings during fiscal '22, driven by operational and functional excellence initiatives, the rollout of digital solutions across the enterprise and extensive automation projects that are currently underway.
Now as we look at the organic growth opportunities ahead for our business, we expect a meaningful increase in CapEx spending to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profiles. We currently anticipate CapEx spending of approximately $2 billion during fiscal '22, an increase of roughly $800 million. This investment will support our initiatives to meet global protein demand growth into the future, allow us to gain share and will deliver strong financial returns for our shareholders.
Excluding the impact of changes from potential tax legislation, we currently expect our adjusted tax rate to be around 23%. We anticipate net interest expense of approximately $380 million because of intentional deleveraging during fiscal '21. Liquidity is expected to significantly exceed our target, while net leverage is expected to remain well below 2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA.
It is important to note though that over the last 2 years, working capital has been a source of cash. We don't expect this to be the case in fiscal '22. Moving forward, our business growth will require increased working capital, which, combined with deferred tax payments under the CARES Act, taxes on the gain of the Pet Treats divestiture, litigation settlements and other discrete items, will lead to a substantial use of cash during fiscal 2022.
Now let's look at how each of our segments will contribute to that total company performance. Prepared Foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal '22 of between 7% and 9%. We will remain disciplined and agile in our pricing initiatives to ensure that any additional inflationary pressures are passed along to customers while also working diligently to deliver productivity savings to reduce costs.
We expect the Beef segment to continue to show strength due to prolonged industry dynamics, leading to segment margins of between 9% and 11%. We expect the front half of the year to be meaningfully stronger than the back half as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize partway through the year.
In Chicken, our operational turnaround is working, and we still expect to achieve run rate profitability of 5% to 7% by the middle of the year. We expect this will be achieved through sequential quarterly margin improvements during the first half of the year, resulting in full year margins that fall between 5% to 7%, although expected at the lower end of that range.
In Pork, we expect similar performance during fiscal '22 to what we accomplished during fiscal '21, equating to a margin of between 5% and 7%. In International/Other, we expect margins of 2% to 3% as capacity expansions and strong global demand support volume growth and improved profitability.
Our segments individually and in aggregate have clear and compelling role within Tyson's portfolio strategy. They deliver diverse countercyclical performance that supports the company's long-term earnings objectives and deliver strong value for shareholders.

We also, as you called out, are going to have a much larger expenditure on CapEx, which is going to be great for our investors. And as our business grows, that's going to consume some more working capital, regular working capital. In addition to that, we've got a number of one-off payments that we expect to pay out this year, which are pretty meaningful.

But in addition to having a labor shortfall, which is constrained capacity, we've also had just capacity shortfall in some key categories, for example, ready-to-eat products that would be for the more value-added poultry and also for prepared foods.

There's another component that is digital solutions, and that's about $250 million in recurring savings. That's more on the operational side, the supply chain planning, logistics and warehousing. So you can think of that in that bucket. And that's across all businesses. In fact, the first 2 across all businesses.

The improvements are coming from price/mix, volume, spend and labor. In short, we are driving operational excellence across our poultry segment, and we are aligned on that plan. I would tell you, we have the right plan and we have the right people to make sure that we execute on the fundamentals of our business."

We have to be the most sought-after place to work. And we've done a number of things already to try to do that. It's the recognition that the workforce today, they have many, many options, and there are far few people chasing the number of jobs that are actually out there. And so as we've talked internally, we're not trying to solve the labor problem for America. We're trying to solve it for Tyson Foods.
And we want to give people an option. We want to give them a better option. And we think the key to the staffing plans, but more importantly, being able to service customers and execute at a high level, absolutely starts with people. So the $24 an hour, it includes a number of things, but it is -- it's the benefits that go with that. We've had to enhance a number of those things, these things like scheduling differences, meaning multiple shifts or being very creative at each location. Childcare is a component of that. We've experimented with on-site health clinics, there's another we've experimented with.
But we're trying to be creative and trying to make sure that we're positioned well to have a place people want to come to work. And we see that as being critical to our future success. And so that's what we're doing, $24 an hour. I would tell you that maybe leading in the marketplace but it's -- I think it's also a competitive wage. And so we want to be on the leading side of that. And so that is our intent. That's how you can think about it as we think about labor going forward. We see that as the cost of inflation and the cost of labor going forward."

I would tell you that in all my years of being in this business, there are always risks that come up. The one thing I am certain of is as we get into '22, we will -- there's going to be something that happened we hadn't anticipated. If you go back to this time a year ago, we thought we had a pretty solid plan around -- in poultry around grain price -- or pricing relative to grain. And then we saw a tremendous increase in the cost of grain, and we were sitting with fixed pricing on -- so much. So those type of things happen.
What I can tell you and why we're excited is that we've adjusted our model, our pricing model and -- so that we've derisked it not only for us, but also for our customers. So that when there is inflation, then we're in a position we can adjust pricing with those customers. And our relationships with them are really second to none. And these have been really good conversations. It's been a win-win approach in these conversations, and we're proud of that. And it starts with that relationship with the customer. So we've moved and derisked our model relative to pricing and inflation. And that, we believe, puts us in a better position.
In terms of labor, I don't know how to anticipate a new COVID variant or something that the vaccine might not protect against. But I can tell you that we took a bold action to do everything we need to do to protect team members. And we saw it as an investment and a derisking of our business just by having a vaccinated workforce. And so I think we believe that's one less thing we'll have to deal with this year. That's one less thing we're seeing in terms of complexity to our business."

He can cover maybe in greater detail on some of those non-grain. We've positioned ourselves from a poultry perspective as well as from a prepared foods perspective so that we can respond to the inflation, whether it be grain, labor, transportation, warehousing costs, which are the biggest ones. Packaging and ingredients have all gone up in price as well. In fact, I would -- it might be easier for me to tell you what hasn't seen -- what component hasn't seen inflation in this past year.
But we think we've got our model positioned to adjust for that around pricing and responsiveness. And we don't expect customers to pay for inefficiencies, but we'd like to think that we have relationships with customers that allow us to be able to take to them inflation that we see in the marketplace and be able to pass that on ultimately to the consumer. And so that's the way we thought about our model. That's how we've adjusted our model and it's been a yearlong -- really a yearlong event doing that. And we are in a pretty good place right now.
With respect to Chicken, I think based on today's current level of inflation, we have currently caught up with that inflation with pricing across the Chicken segment. We're putting that pricing in place in Prepared Foods. And of course, our commodity businesses of Beef and Pork, those respond more rapidly to the inflation. And so those are working as designed as well. Stewart, would you like to add any color to that?"

And of course, we're continuing to pass through price and have the benefit of some mix. When you look at the top line in the business, keep in mind -- and actually, when you look at the cost, keep in mind, the guidance around beef, which is lower than last year, right? And FOB, you should expect to see both the cutout [ for ] and you should expect to see the cattle costs increase. And that's going to be part of it.
Perhaps a couple of other things to keep in mind. There are ingredient costs that are outside of grains, things like cooking oil, you've seen the price of oil, that increased. Distribution is up. And we've had 13 strong quarters of share gain in our Prepared Foods business, and that business will likely invest money behind our brands this year to make sure that, that kind of momentum continues. So that's probably a run-through through the big items."
