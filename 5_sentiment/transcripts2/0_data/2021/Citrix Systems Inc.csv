Good morning, Ann, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on this earlier-than-expected fourth quarter earnings call. We clearly moved the earnings call up a few days, just given the timing of the announcement of the right transaction. So today, though, I'm really pleased to result strong fourth quarter and full year results. 
The transformation of Citrix that we initiated a few years back has been really successful. We now have over $1.2 billion in subscription ARR. And importantly, SaaS ARR, which is now $725 million, reaccelerated in the fourth quarter, up nearly 40% year-on-year. 
What drove this strong growth is our installed base, moving more aggressively to Citrix Cloud. This is a trend that we talked about earlier in the year, started to pick up in Q3. And it really stepped up a lot in the fourth quarter as we continue to demonstrate the value of new technologies and of course, the TCO benefits and moving to Citrix Cloud. 
Our fourth quarter and full year results, again, exceeded expectations, both on the top and the bottom line. When I step back and reflect on the full year of 2020 and compare results against the original guidance that we provided at this time last year, reported revenue came in over $120 million above the midpoint, and EPS was more than $0.60 above the midpoint. 
We accomplished all this while aggressively transitioning to a subscription model, sunsetting the general availability of the perpetual option in the workspace and driving 75% of our total product bookings sold as subscriptions. This is up from 62% a year ago. 
So now with the large majority of our business on a subscription model, we're focused on moving even faster in our transition to the cloud. So today's announcement of the agreement to acquire Wrike is really a reflection of this. As a leading cloud-native collaborative work management platform, Wrike is a natural extension to the functionalities that we deliver through the Citrix Workspace. And the go-to-market leverage opportunities for us are really, really excited as we go forward. I'm personally very excited to welcome the Wrike team to Citrix, and I'm confident that together, we're going to deliver great results for our customers and all of our shareholders. 
So with that, I'd like to introduce Andrew Filev, the Founder and CEO of Wrike. Andrew?"

I'd like to echo what David said and express how incredibly excited were to be joining the Citrix team. This is such an important day for Wrike. When we started to explore the partnership with Citrix, it became obvious that their combination would allow us to access a much larger base of customers. And we have long-admired Citrix as an investor leader, and we're impressed with what their team has done to help create the digital workspace category. 
What might be less of this is that Wrike and Citrix share common vision when it comes to the future work, which provides very strong foundation for complementary product strategy. Our cloud solutions provide digital workspace experience that enables teams to access the resources they need to collaborate in the most effective way across any device allocation. Not only will the combined company be positioned to deliver the future work, but as part of this, we'll also be able to create unique opportunities to reach new users and unlock new revenue streams. We view this transaction as a win-win for stakeholders. 
And before I turn the call over back to David, I'd like to take a moment to thank the entire Wrike team for getting us to this point. Their dedication and commitment has been and will continue to be critical to our success. I'm personally really excited to be joined Citrix and to work alongside the Citrix and Wrike team to execute on the many opportunities in front of us.

Like you said, we saw a nice acceleration of SaaS ARR coming up close to 40% in the quarter. So just to step back a little bit and remind everybody what we've talked about throughout this year. The first half of the year, especially Q1, was really focused on helping customers manage through short-term requirements, the pandemic and everything needed to get their teams to a position where they were safe, secure and able to operate remotely. 
As we move through Q2, we started talking about refocusing a lot of our efforts back on installed base migration, net new Citrix Cloud. And you saw those results in the third quarter as we stepped up probably 50% improvement over what we had seen in the second quarter. And then the further expectation that, that would continue to take off in Q4. And that's exactly what happened. We actually exceeded our plan for installed base migration. And we're doing that because customers are really seeing the value, both in terms of the net new technologies that we're bringing to bear across the Citrus cloud portfolio that allows them to do a number of new things, managing a hybrid infrastructure, optimizing virtual delivery of infrastructure as well as all of the other capabilities around intelligence and endpoints, et cetera. 
We've also demonstrated the TCO benefits of being able to migrate from an on-premise to a cloud solution, working together with great partners like Microsoft and others, bringing down their total cost of ownership pretty substantially. I think all those messages are resonating, and we expect that to continue into 2021. 
So the second question, you're talking about how to think about Wrike overall and how it sits. And so I think the context there is really important. And so I think among the top priorities of companies around the world, and you hear this a lot, is really figuring out what work is going to look like once we get into this post-pandemic period. Create an environment, of course, for them that allows them to drive the highest level of productivity out of their teams around the world. And so one thing that's super clear is that this hybrid or distributed work model that we've all seen over the last 9 months is really here to stay. It's generated a tremendous amount of benefits, and companies are really embracing this as the go forward. And so what we've done, I think, as everyone knows, is provide this digital work platform that securely delivers all of the work resources that people need to be productive, applications, content, business services, et cetera. And what Wrike brings is a platform for collaborative work management that transforms the way distributed teams operate, making them much more efficient through better visibility, cross departmental collaboration, automation, et cetera. So we're really now managing holistically all the complexity at the IT end and all the complexity of the end user at. So we think together, this is a really powerful combination. And as Andrew says, opening up a number of new revenue opportunities for both the workspace to drive incremental penetration and also for a stand-alone platform like Wrike, to be able to access our hundreds of thousands of customers around the world. 
So we think this is a very complete platform at this point in time. Our #1 priority right now is making sure that we scale and drive success across this acquisition and integrate the technologies over a period of time. So that's the way you should think about it with the appropriate context."

One of the things that I think has been clear to everyone across the industry over 2020 was that those that have embraced cloud had a much higher ability to adapt rapidly. The agility that cloud brings has allowed companies to respond from a business continuity standpoint, through the pandemic, of course, being able to tap in and access new ways of of reaching customers and other business partners and, of course, new revenue models. And so this trend that we had seen even before that, just migrated infrastructure to cloud for all the obvious benefits, really accelerated. That, of course, is true across the Citrix portfolio as well. I mean, once -- as I said to Raimo, once the people have gotten through the initial push of the pandemic, they could step back, think about what's going to drive their business long term, how do they drive some competitive advantage? And obviously, the agility benefits are one of those drivers. 
And so right now, I think that this move for Citrix is only going to accelerate from here. We've seen great success in the second half of the year. We're demonstrating the benefits to customers. And we're reinforcing that, of course, with things that we're doing internally across our innovation portfolio, across compensation structures, et cetera, to make sure that, that continues into '21."

The right platform essentially manages the exact same complexity for all of these distributed teams when it comes to a platform for work. And so bringing these together gives us a truly holistic and differentiated solution. So we're looking at this across a couple of different dimensions, opening up revenue opportunities for both independent product lines, if you will, but more importantly, bringing together a holistic approach to managing distributed teams. So I think that's one of the buying triggers that we have heard listening to our customers about what it would take to drive penetration of the Workspace more broadly across their enterprises and managing these distributed teams, driving end user productivity. Is 1 of those buying triggers. So a lot of this is listening to customers and responding to their needs and where they're trying to drive their businesses in the future."

And so they've just got a higher level of mix in that respect. And that's what's driving the recognized revenue change. If I step back and I look at the Americas bookings, total bookings were up in the low double digits for the full year. So that business is strong, and it's just a matter of working through the model transition. 
When we think about the full year, though, I think it's pretty consistent with everything that we have said over the last 3 or 4 quarters. The first quarter of the year was really focused on just getting teams productive, getting them secure, getting them available to work at home. Second quarter was a little bit more of fixing the mistakes that customers made in the first quarter is the rush. Things like replacing VPN solutions, maybe making sure they had the appropriate level of security in the infrastructure and just ensuring that things were working effectively. And in the second half of the year, started to move more towards the future. What do they want their businesses to look like on a long-term basis, whether that was revenue models, overall transformation or in most cases, talking about the workforce. And this is where this concept of a distributed workforce has really has really come home. I mean, you're seeing now that 2/3 or more of organizations are planning on embracing a much more distributed or remote workforce going forward for the obvious benefits. It drives higher engagement, drives higher productivity, lower turnover, all these great quantifiable benefits for companies. And so that becomes a nice tailwind for us. What we do is help manage a lot of these distributed teams, making them more effective, making them more productive. And I think that, that's where a lot of the customer conversations are right now. Bigger transformational projects, thinking about where they're going in the future. And fortunately, the workforce and distributed teams is a large part of that."

So competitively, we are -- we -- sorry, so on the competitive landscape, we focus on the work management side as opposed to communications and in the work management, will lead the business products.

That allows us to both combine very large customers in our platform, but also enable an easy access and that's our retiring by experience that leads to the global penetration. 
When it comes to enterprise capabilities, we pride ourselves on security, which is actually a great fit with specifics on that heavy focus on security, including some very innovative features on the platform that differentiate us and allow us to sell our solution to security sensitive customers like financial institutions. We're also proud ourselves in their core work management and collaboration capabilities, able to provide advanced and sophisticated functionality like resource management to our customers. So really have that complete product package that allows us to win over the deals in upmarket and enterprise. And when it comes to Microsoft, their great partner. As you know, they're putting heavy capital emphasis on right now as their communication platform and trying to win that market as their companies switching to remote and distributed works. And we have an amazing and innovative product integration with them and a good partnership with Microsoft to market together."

And then as we said in the guidance, I mean, we're  at about 50% of our revenue in subscription, and we expect the mix for the year to be between 50% and 60%, and we'll start to think about that more specifically as we guide through the quarters, we get more comfortable with it. But what what we're going to do, Karl, is we're going to, at some point in the first half of this year, have an Investor Day and start to really give you guys a little bit more finer point around some of this mix in the business.

I think that like all markets, they obviously go through a level of evolution. And as you said, for file sync and share, we grew that business dramatically for many years in the independent category, that over time, decided that it was better serving our customers to integrate those core capabilities into the workspace to not only focus on providing a storage option, of course, but really a control plane or a platform to allow people to access files regardless of where they reside, whether it's in one of the more popular cloud storage repositories or whether that's on-premise. So it really becomes an integrated service delivery part of the platform. For us, it's an incremental capabilities, but also a broad differentiator. 
So I think we'll just wait and see how the markets evolve over a many year period of time. The collaborative work management market right now is multibillion dollars in nature. It's growing at a very rapid clip, and it has the -- certainly potential to show extreme growth in this business for many, many years.

As you'd imagine, as the product and the platform go from departments to divisions to corporations, so that obviously brings in IT as part of the process.

Good morning, Ann, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on this earlier-than-expected fourth quarter earnings call. We clearly moved the earnings call up a few days, just given the timing of the announcement of the right transaction. 
So today, though, I'm really pleased to result strong fourth quarter and full year results.  
The transformation of Citrix that we initiated a few years back has been really successful. We now have over $1.2 billion in subscription ARR. And importantly, SaaS ARR, which is now $725 million, reaccelerated in the fourth quarter, up nearly 40% year-on-year.  
What drove this strong growth is our installed base, moving more aggressively to Citrix Cloud. This is a trend that we talked about earlier in the year, started to pick up in Q3, and it really stepped up a lot in the fourth quarter as we continue to demonstrate the value of new technologies and of course, the TCO benefits and moving to Citrix Cloud.
Our fourth quarter and full year results, again, exceeded expectations, both on the top and the bottom line. When I step back and reflect on the full year of 2020 and compare results against the original guidance that we provided at this time last year, reported revenue came in over $120 million above the midpoint, and EPS was more than $0.60 above the midpoint.  
We accomplished all this while aggressively transitioning to a subscription model, sunsetting the general availability of the perpetual license option in the Workspace and driving 75% of our total product bookings sold as subscriptions. This is up from 62% a year ago.  
So now with the large majority of our business on a subscription model, we're focused on moving even faster in our transition to the cloud. So today's announcement of the agreement to acquire Wrike is really a reflection of this. 
As a leading cloud-native collaborative work management platform, Wrike is a natural extension to the functionalities that we deliver through the Citrix Workspace. And the go-to-market leverage opportunities for us are really, really exciting as we go forward. 
I'm personally very excited to welcome the Wrike team to Citrix, and I'm confident that, together, we're going to deliver great results for our customers and all of our shareholders.  
So with that, I'd like to introduce Andrew Filev, the Founder and CEO of Wrike. Andrew?"

I'd like to echo what David said and express how incredibly excited we are to be joining the Citrix team. This is such an important day for Wrike. 
When we started to explore the partnership with Citrix, it became obvious that their combination would allow us to access a much larger base of customers. And we have long-admired Citrix as an industry leader, and we're impressed with what their team has done to help create the digital workspace category.  
What might be less on this is that Wrike and Citrix share common vision when it comes to the future work, which provides very strong foundation for complementary product strategy. Our cloud solutions provide digital workspace experience that enables teams to access the resources they need to collaborate in the most effective way across any device allocation. Not only will the combined company be positioned to deliver the future work, but as part of this, we'll also be able to create unique opportunities to reach new users and unlock new revenue streams.

Like you said, we saw a nice acceleration of SaaS ARR coming up close to 40% in the quarter. So just to step back a little bit, remind everybody what we've talked about throughout this year. 
The first half of the year, especially Q1, was really focused on helping customers manage through short-term requirements, the pandemic and everything needed to get their teams to a position where they were safe, secure and able to operate remotely.  
As we move through Q2, we started talking about refocusing a lot of our efforts back on installed base migration, net new Citrix Cloud. And you saw those results in the third quarter as we stepped up probably 50% improvement over what we had seen in the second quarter and then the further expectation that, that would continue to take off in Q4. And that's exactly what happened. 
We actually exceeded our plan for installed base migration. And we're doing that because customers are really seeing the value, both in terms of the net new technologies that we're bringing to bear across the Citrix Cloud portfolio that allows them to do a number of new things, managing a hybrid infrastructure, optimizing virtual delivery of infrastructure as well as all of the other capabilities around intelligence and endpoints, et cetera.  
We've also demonstrated the TCO benefits of being able to migrate from an on-premise to a cloud solution, working together with great partners like Microsoft and others, bringing down their total cost of ownership pretty substantially. I think all those messages are resonating, and we expect that to continue into 2021.  
So second question, you're talking about how to think about Wrike overall and how it sits. And so I think the context there is really important. 
And so I think among the top priorities of companies around the world, and you hear this a lot, is really figuring out what work is going to look like once we get into this post-pandemic period. Create an environment, of course, for them that allows them to drive the highest level of productivity out of their teams around the world. And so one thing that's super clear is that this hybrid or distributed work model that we've all seen over the last 9 months is really here to stay. It's generated a tremendous amount of benefits, and companies are really embracing this as the go-forward. 
And so what we've done, I think, as everyone knows, is provide this digital work platform that securely delivers all of the work resources that people need to be productive, applications, content, business services, et cetera. And what Wrike brings is a platform for collaborative work management that transforms the way distributed teams operate, making them much more efficient through better visibility, cross-departmental collaboration, automation, et cetera. 
So we're really now managing holistically all the complexity at the IT end and all the complexity at the end user end. So we think, together, this is a really powerful combination. 
And as Andrew says, opening up a number of new revenue opportunities for both the Workspace to drive incremental penetration and also for a stand-alone platform like Wrike to be able to access our hundreds of thousands of customers around the world.  
So we think this is a very complete platform at this point in time. Our #1 priority right now is making sure that we scale and drive success across this acquisition and integrate the technologies over a period of time. So that's the way you should think about it with the appropriate context."

One of the things that I think has been clear to everyone across the industry over 2020 was that those that have embraced cloud had a much higher ability to adapt rapidly. The agility that cloud brings has allowed companies to respond from a business continuity standpoint through the pandemic, of course, being able to tap in and access new ways of reaching customers and other business partners and, of course, new revenue models. 
And so this trend that we had seen even before that just migrated infrastructure to cloud for all the obvious benefits really accelerated. That, of course, is true across the Citrix portfolio as well. 
I mean, once -- as I said to Raimo, once people have gotten through the initial push of the pandemic, they could step back, think about what's going to drive their business long term, how do they drive some competitive advantage. And obviously, the agility benefits are one of those drivers.  
And so right now, I think that this move for Citrix is only going to accelerate from here. We've seen great success in the second half of the year. We're demonstrating the benefits to customers. And we're reinforcing that, of course, with things that we're doing internally across our innovation portfolio, across compensation structures, et cetera, to make sure that, that continues into '21."

Like I described earlier to Phil's question, being able to manage the needs of distributed teams in the world right now is a critical driver for a lot of businesses. 
And bringing together the Citrix platform, which I think everybody knows, is distributing all of those IT-focused work resources, giving people the tools and the access and the ability to securely work from anywhere is critical. The right platform essentially manages the exact same complexity for all of these distributed teams when it comes to a platform for work. And so bringing these together gives us a truly holistic and differentiated solution. 
So we're looking at this across a couple of different dimensions, opening up revenue opportunities for both independent product lines, if you will, but more importantly, bringing together a holistic approach to managing distributed teams. So I think that's one of the buying triggers that we have heard. 
Listening to our customers about what it would take to drive penetration of the Workspace more broadly across their enterprises and managing these distributed teams driving end user productivity is one of those buying triggers. So a lot of this is listening to customers and responding to their needs and where they're trying to drive their businesses in the future."

The Americas is the geo that have led the initial push to subscription and, frankly, the initial push to SaaS. And so they've just got a higher level of mix in that respect. And that's what's driving the recognized revenue change. 
If I step back and I look at the Americas bookings, total bookings were up in the low double digits for the full year. So that business is strong, and it's just a matter of working through the model transition.  
When I think about the full year, though, I think it's pretty consistent with everything that we have said over the last 3 or 4 quarters. The first quarter of the year was really focused on just getting teams productive, getting them secure, getting them available to work at home. 
Second quarter was a little bit more of fixing the mistakes that customers made in the first quarter is the rush. Things like replacing VPN solutions, maybe making sure they had the appropriate level of security in the infrastructure and just ensuring that things were working effectively. 
And then the second half of the year started to move more towards the future, what do they want their businesses to look like on a long-term basis, whether that was revenue models, overall transformation or, in most cases, talking about the workforce. And this is where this concept of a distributed workforce has really come home. 
I mean, you're seeing now that 2/3 or more of organizations are planning on embracing a much more distributed or remote workforce going forward for the obvious benefits. It drives higher engagement, drives higher productivity, lower turnover, all these great quantifiable benefits for companies. And so that becomes a nice tailwind for us. 
What we do is help manage a lot of these distributed teams, making them more effective, making them more productive. And I think that, that's where a lot of the customer conversations are right now, bigger transformational projects, thinking about where they're going in the future. And fortunately, the workforce and distributed teams is a large part of that."

Secondly, on Wrike, what has been some of the lessons learned in some of the company's past efforts on the Teams collaboration space?

I think that like all markets, they obviously go through a level of evolution. And as you said, for file sync and share, we grew that business dramatically for many years in the independent category, that over time, decided that it was better serving our customers to integrate those core capabilities into the Workspace to not only focus on providing a storage option, of course, but really a control plane or a platform to allow people to access files regardless of where they reside, whether it's in one of the more popular cloud storage repositories or whether that's on-premise. So it really becomes an integrated service delivery part of the platform. For us, it's a -- incremental capabilities, but also a broad differentiator. 
So I think we'll just wait and see how the markets evolve over a -- many year period of time. The collaborative work management market right now is multibillion dollars in nature. It's growing at a very rapid clip, and it has the -- certainly potential to show extreme growth in this business for many, many years. But as you would imagine, we always just stay very focused on what our customers are asking for, how we differentiate and defend our portfolio position, and we'll continue to invest behind that. Can you repeat the first part of your question?"

It's one of those metrics that we'll update at our Analyst Meeting, talk about it with more context. But it's probably north of 10% now. I mean it continues to be higher. It's just -- even though the base is getting bigger. 
As Arlen and I have both said in a couple of these comments, we've just been really focused over the back half of the year on migrating the installed base to cloud. We've seen great success with that, and it's going to be a focus area for us going into '21."

As I think everybody knows, we have historically sold into IT or the CIO as kind of the initial entry point for the Citrix Workspace. And over time, one of the buying triggers that we have seen for driving incremental penetration has been to broaden out those buying centers to work with line of businesses, to address a larger set of issues, address -- focused on end user productivity, et cetera, and that fits perfectly with how Wrike has built their business, selling into lots of line of businesses as well as IT. 
As you'd imagine, as the product and the platform go from departments to divisions to corporations, so that obviously brings in IT as part of the process. And so we look at it as, again, an opportunity to broaden the go-to-market for Wrike as an individual product, but also for the Workspace, continuing to drive higher and higher penetration. 
So I think we're very optimistic about right out of the gate, opening up our 10,000 strong partner channel network, hundreds and hundreds of direct sellers on our side, 400,000 relationships with IT and CIOs around the world as an ability to accelerate this business."

Internally, when you talk about incentives, yes, we tweak our own internal incentives to make sure that our field sellers are incented to sell cloud, net new customers as well as installed base migration.

Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on this earlier-than-expected fourth quarter earnings call. We clearly moved the earnings call up a few days, just given the timing of the announcement of the right transaction. 
So today, though, I'm really pleased to result strong fourth quarter and full year results. The transformation of Citrix that we initiated a few years back has been really successful. We now have over $1.2 billion in subscription ARR. And importantly, SaaS ARR, which is now $725 million, reaccelerated in the fourth quarter, up nearly 40% year-on-year.  
What drove this strong growth is our installed base, moving more aggressively to Citrix Cloud. This is a trend that we talked about earlier in the year, started to pick up in Q3, and it really stepped up a lot in the fourth quarter as we continue to demonstrate the value of new technologies and, of course, the TCO benefits and moving to Citrix Cloud.
Our fourth quarter and full year results, again, exceeded expectations, both on the top and the bottom line. When I step back and reflect on the full year of 2020 and compare results against the original guidance that we provided at this time last year, our reported revenue came in over $120 million above the midpoint, and EPS was more than $0.60 above the midpoint. We accomplished all this while aggressively transitioning to a subscription model, sunsetting the general availability of the perpetual license option in the Workspace and driving 75% of our total product bookings sold as subscriptions. This is up from 62% a year ago.  
So now with the large majority of our business on a subscription model, we're focused on moving even faster in our transition to the cloud. So today's announcement of the agreement to acquire Wrike is really a reflection of this. As a leading cloud-native collaborative work management platform, Wrike is a natural extension to the functionalities that we deliver through the Citrix Workspace. And the go-to-market leverage opportunities for us are really, really exciting as we go forward. 
I'm personally very excited to welcome the Wrike team to Citrix, and I'm confident that together, we're going to deliver great results for our customers and all of our shareholders.  
So with that, I'd like to introduce Andrew Filev, the Founder and CEO of Wrike. Andrew?"

I'd like to echo what David said and express how incredibly excited we are to be joining the Citrix team. This is such an important day for Wrike. 
When we started to explore the partnership with Citrix, it became obvious that their combination would allow us to access a much larger base of customers. And we have long-admired Citrix as an industry leader, and we're impressed with what their team has done to help create the digital workspace category.  
What might be less obvious is that Wrike and Citrix share common vision when it comes to the future of work, which provides very strong foundation for complementary product strategy. Our cloud solutions provide digital workspace experience that enables teams to access the resources they need to collaborate in the most effective way across any device allocation. Not only will the combined company be positioned to deliver the future of work, but as part of this, we'll also be able to create unique opportunities to reach new users and unlock new revenue streams.

Like you said, we saw a nice acceleration of SaaS ARR coming up close to 40% in the quarter. So just to step back a little bit, remind everybody what we've talked about throughout this year. The first half of the year, especially Q1, was really focused on helping customers manage through short-term requirements, the pandemic and everything needed to get their teams to a position where they were safe, secure and able to operate remotely.  
As we move through Q2, we started talking about refocusing a lot of our efforts back on installed base migration, net new Citrix Cloud. And you saw those results in the third quarter as we stepped up probably 50% improvement over what we had seen in the second quarter and then the further expectation that, that would continue to take off in Q4. And that's exactly what happened. 
We actually exceeded our plan for installed base migration. And we're doing that because customers are really seeing the value, both in terms of the net new technologies that we're bringing to bear across the Citrix Cloud portfolio that allows them to do a number of new things, managing a hybrid infrastructure, optimizing virtual delivery of infrastructure as well as all of the other capabilities around intelligence and endpoints, et cetera.  
We've also demonstrated the TCO benefits of being able to migrate from an on-premise to a cloud solution, working together with great partners like Microsoft and others, bringing down their total cost of ownership pretty substantially. I think all those messages are resonating, and we expect that to continue into 2021.  
So second question, you're talking about how to think about Wrike overall and how it fits. And so I think the context there is really important. And so I think among the top priorities of companies around the world, and you hear this a lot, is really figuring out what work is going to look like once we get into this post-pandemic period. Create an environment, of course, for them that allows them to drive the highest level of productivity out of their teams around the world. And so one thing that's super clear is that this hybrid or distributed work model that we've all seen over the last 9 months is really here to stay. It's generated a tremendous amount of benefits, and companies are really embracing this as the go-forward. 
And so what we've done, I think, as everyone knows, is provide this digital work platform that securely delivers all of the work resources that people need to be productive, applications, content, business services, et cetera. And what Wrike brings is a platform for collaborative work management that transforms the way distributed teams operate, making them much more efficient through better visibility, cross-departmental collaboration, automation, et cetera. So we're really now managing holistically all the complexity at the IT end and all the complexity at the end user end. So we think, together, this is a really powerful combination. 
And as Andrew says, opening up a number of new revenue opportunities for both the Workspace to drive incremental penetration and also for a stand-alone platform like Wrike to be able to access our hundreds of thousands of customers around the world. So we think this is a very complete platform at this point in time. Our #1 priority right now is making sure that we scale and drive success across this acquisition and integrate the technologies over a period of time. So that's the way you should think about it with the appropriate context."

The agility that cloud brings has allowed companies to respond from a business continuity standpoint through the pandemic, of course, being able to tap in and access new ways of reaching customers and other business partners and, of course, new revenue models. 
And so this trend that we had seen even before that just migrating infrastructure to cloud for all the obvious benefits really accelerated. That, of course, is true across the Citrix portfolio as well.
I mean, once -- as I said to Raimo, once people have gotten through the initial push of the pandemic, they could step back, think about what's going to drive their business long term, how do they drive some competitive advantage. And obviously, the agility benefits are one of those drivers.  
And so right now, I think that this move for Citrix is only going to accelerate from here. We've seen great success in the second half of the year. We're demonstrating the benefits to customers. And we're reinforcing that, of course, with things that we're doing internally across our innovation portfolio, across compensation structures, et cetera, to make sure that, that continues into '21."

Like I described earlier to Phil's question, being able to manage the needs of distributed teams in the world right now is a critical driver for a lot of businesses. 
And bringing together the Citrix platform, which I think everybody knows, is distributing all of those IT-focused work resources, giving people the tools and the access and the ability to securely work from anywhere is critical. The right platform essentially manages the exact same complexity for all of these distributed teams when it comes to a platform for work. And so bringing these together gives us a truly holistic and differentiated solution. 
So we're looking at this across a couple of different dimensions, opening up revenue opportunities for both independent product lines, if you will. But more importantly, bringing together a holistic approach to managing distributed teams. So I think that's one of the buying triggers that we have heard, listening to our customers about what it would take to drive penetration of the Workspace more broadly across their enterprises and managing these distributed teams driving end user productivity is one of those buying triggers. So a lot of this is listening to customers and responding to their needs and where they're trying to drive their businesses in the future."

And so they've just got a higher level of mix in that respect. And that's what's driving the recognized revenue change. 
If I step back and I look at the Americas bookings, total bookings were up in the low double digits for the full year. So that business is strong, and it's just a matter of working through the model transition.  
When I think about the full year, though, I think it's pretty consistent with everything that we have said over the last 3 or 4 quarters. The first quarter of the year was really focused on just getting teams productive, getting them secure, getting them available to work at home. 
Second quarter was a little bit more of fixing the mistakes that customers made in the first quarter is the rush. Things like replacing VPN solutions, maybe making sure they had the appropriate level of security in the infrastructure and just ensuring that things were working effectively. 
And then the second half of the year started to move more towards the future, what do they want their businesses to look like on a long-term basis, whether that was revenue models, overall transformation or, in most cases, talking about the workforce. And this is where this concept of a distributed workforce has really come home. 
I mean you're seeing now that 2/3 or more of organizations are planning on embracing a much more distributed or remote workforce going forward for the obvious benefits. It drives higher engagement, drives higher productivity, lower turnover, all these great quantifiable benefits for companies. And so that becomes a nice tailwind for us. 
What we do is help manage a lot of these distributed teams, making them more effective, making them more productive. And I think that, that's where a lot of the customer conversations are right now, bigger transformational projects, thinking about where they're going in the future. And fortunately, the workforce and distributed teams is a large part of that."

And so we look at it as, again, an opportunity to broaden the go-to-market for Wrike as an individual product, but also for the Workspace, continuing to drive higher and higher penetration. 
So I think we're very optimistic about right out of the gate, opening up our 10,000 strong partner channel network, hundreds and hundreds of direct sellers on our side, 400,000 relationships with IT and CIOs around the world as an ability to accelerate this business."

And thus received a lot of great response from our traditional customer. It's one of the reasons why pushing even further towards end user productivity, end user engagement, managing these distributed teams, as we will do with Wrike, is synergistic.

Yes, I'd say the clear preference is to sell cloud, which is a SaaS license and move our customers to Citrix Cloud.

We incentivize that in 2 ways. One is by demonstrating to customers the value of cloud. And those are things that I've talked about earlier, lots of incremental capabilities, TCO savings and many things that we can talk about from a business point of view. 
Internally, when you talk about incentives, yes, we tweak our own internal incentives to make sure that our field sellers are incented to sell cloud, net new customers as well as installed base migration. And frankly, we're rolling out some of that more broadly across the company to make sure that throughout all of Citrix, we're very much focused on customer success, active use, migrating customers to cloud, et cetera.

Good morning, everybody, and welcome. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased with the momentum in the business, especially around our cloud adoption and the migration of our installed base. Our transition to the cloud is progressing well,",597,"Thanks, Traci. Good morning, everybody, and welcome. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased with the momentum in the business, especially around our cloud adoption and the migration of our installed base. Our transition to the cloud is progressing well, and we expect our first quarter results to mark the trough in terms of the impact on the business model, the income statement. 
So beginning in the second quarter and then continuing throughout the year, we expect to see top line acceleration in our income statement metrics as these headwinds that we've been dealing with on the model transition turn and become a tailwind. To provide insights into the transitioning business model, we've been reporting ARR metrics for subscription  And then beginning today, we're also disclosing total ARR, which includes perpetual license maintenance contracts. 
In Q1, the organic performance of these metrics, excluding any contribution from the Wrike acquisition, showed continuing strength. In fact, SaaS ARR accelerated to 43% year-on-year growth and total ARR was up 15% from last year. So overall, the fundamentals in Q1 were actually quite strong. I'd like to note that this quarter involved really included 3 unique items that impacted recognized revenue. And I want to cover those briefly here in detail before we open up the call for Q&A. 
The first is the Wrike acquisition, which closed at the end of February. Second item is we experienced supply chain constraints in our hardware business impacting our $10 million worth of product. So we expect these issues may persist for several quarters, so we're adjusting our full year expectations accordingly. And the third issue was the duration of on-premise term-based subscriptions, really influenced by the limited use licenses we sold to customers at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. So as a reminder, in Q1 2020, it benefited by $47 million related to this license type. So far, we've either converted to cloud subscriptions or issued new term-based licenses for about $50 million of total bookings value against this group. We have ongoing conversations with many more about Citrix Cloud migration. 
So the limited use business continuity licenses really generally fell into 3 categories: First one, project-specific use cases, like a U.S. government agency that planned on building field hospitals to treat COVID patients. Obviously, those licenses would have no use on the project. Second group would be companies that are adopting a hybrid work style post-pandemic. Many of these customers are either evaluating or they're already beginning to migrate these licenses and their overall Citrix infrastructure to Citrix Cloud. And then the third group are employers that are supporting temporary work from home, and they're really still assessing their long-term work and their real estate plans. The customers in this third cohort tended to opt for shorter duration on-prem term contracts versus multiyear subscriptions in Q1. 
So let me just give you a little context here. We estimate that recognized revenue in the quarter would be about $25 million higher if it wasn't for the shorter on-prem term license duration. In hindsight, of course, these dynamics are really not surprising, but they are different than what our guidance had called for. In the aggregate business continuity licenses expand our installed base and, of course, our subsequent opportunity for these to move to the cloud over time through migration. 
Going forward, we continue to encourage investors to focus on annualized recognized revenue, of course, which we believe provides the most accurate measure of the underlying business performance. 
So operator, with that, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions now."

And I think supply chain constraints shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. It impacted our ability to ship over $10 million worth of revenue in the quarter. So there's 2 things going on there. If you look -- when you read through our earnings letter, you'll see that the networking business actually is very heavily weighted towards subscription. In fact, 89% of bookings in Q1 were subscription. Underlying that is an increasing run rate of hardware appliances to support these pooled capacity licenses. So while we don't disclose it externally, the ARR of that business has been accelerating over the last several years. And so with that, you see a little pressure on COGS, given the increasing component prices. But also in the unique item in this quarter. 
The boxes out of Q1 will ship, but we're assuming that this is going to be a sliding problem. So there could be some issue moving out of Q2 into Q3, et cetera, et cetera. So we just adjusted our full year to account for that. We don't think the issue is more broad than that. And the fortunate thing is that it is a reflection of just the underlying strength and our overall app delivery and security business. 
Second question, actually, your first question regarding limited use licenses. So as I said just a minute ago in my remarks, reminding everybody, we had about $47 million of impact a year ago. And we had put in place programs to really help customers through business continuity and the time of need. And that was for all kinds of different use cases like I highlighted there. The focus over the last quarter or 2 has been on getting those customers to think about longer-term subscriptions, mostly Citrix Cloud. So those companies that have already adopted go-forward plans around hybrid work, around real estate and around whatnot, those are the ones that have been successfully migrated towards Citrix Cloud or part of an ongoing conversation right now. 
The third group were the ones that are really still thinking about this in the context of business continuity. And so our underlying assumption had been that we'd be able to convert those too much longer-term subscriptions. But in reality, what came back was 1 year, in general, 1-year term because their business continuity. And so we're going to approach those going forward as opportunities to help the customer think through their long-term plans and ultimately migrate those to Citrix Cloud.
And as I said, last point -- said a minute ago, is that in the aggregate, we've booked about $50 million worth of commitments against this overall pool."

In this group of licenses that are truly business continuity, and people are looking at those as business continuity. They're still related to the pandemic. Those customers haven't worked their way through yet. And so it would be natural for them to offer a shorter-term license as they figure out what their long-term plans are.

And then over a longer period of time, it will be migrating to SaaS. So if I step back a little bit and just provide a bit of context in that overall business. A couple of years ago, it was largely hardware based, and we have a software heritage that underlies our business, and we were able to deliver those technologies across a number of different form factors, virtual appliances as a container and coming soon as a service. And so what that has afforded us is the opportunity to start transitioning customers to what we call a pooled capacity, just gives them incredible flexibility for delivering their network infrastructure across all types of hybrid cloud deployment models. And that's really resonated. That's one of the reasons why the volume of hardware and our subscriptions is up as much as it is. Going forward, it's going to continue to migrate towards more of a cloud-delivered platform for app delivery and security, being able to give customers a much more friction-free way to adopt different technology bundles based on their own network architecture and help modernize it. Overall, I think that this quarter being 89% subscription bookings was probably a bit of a high mark. But it's definitely been trending up and to the right. So I think it's going to bounce around a little bit. We're still going to always have a hardware component so long as customers are focused on a hybrid multi-cloud model. So I would expect that part of it to continue for the next several years, but gradually moving towards more complete subscription and then ultimately SaaS."

And as they work those out, of course, the goal would be to just continue to roll those into Citrix Cloud migrations, which I mentioned a couple of times, and you see that in the investor letter. I mean, we've just seen great progress with our transition and trade up motion. Good momentum coming out of the second half of last year, continued into first quarter of this year, and we expect that to continue throughout the year. So all the things that we had talked about over the last 9 months are really clicking and doing well, and we're seeing an acceleration of installed base migrations to Citrix Cloud."

Or did you also see that phenomenon of shorter-term commitments more broadly as your normal renewals came up in the quarter? So that's my first question. And then maybe I'll just ask my second question right away, and it's for Arlen. Just on free cash flow, I know you've reaffirmed the comfort with the $10 in 2022. But I think most investors and analysts are around $8 a share for this year. So I just wanted to just ask whether that's still a reasonable assumption for this year? And if it is, then it requires a pretty decent improvement in your operating income to cash flow conversion in 2022 to get to $10 per share. So this is probably the kind of bridge you'll offer at the next Analyst Day you do, but maybe you could sort of tease it out a little bit with us on this call to give us comfort in that $10 number."

Good morning, everybody, and welcome. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased with the momentum in the business, especially around our cloud adoption and the migration of our installed base. Our transition to the cloud is progressing well,",602,"Thanks, Traci. Good morning, everybody, and welcome. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased with the momentum in the business, especially around our cloud adoption and the migration of our installed base. Our transition to the cloud is progressing well, and we expect our first quarter results to mark the trough in terms of the impact on the business model, the income statement. 
So beginning in the second quarter and then continuing throughout the year, we expect to see top line acceleration in our income statement metrics as these headwinds that we've been dealing with on the model transition turn and become a tailwind. To provide insights into the transitioning business model, we've been reporting ARR metrics for Subscription and SaaS. And then beginning today, we're also disclosing total ARR, which includes perpetual license maintenance contracts. 
In Q1, the organic performance of these metrics, excluding any contribution from the Wrike acquisition, showed continuing strength. In fact, SaaS ARR accelerated to 43% year-on-year growth and total ARR was up 15% from last year. So overall, the fundamentals in Q1 were actually quite strong. I'd like to note that this quarter involved -- really included 3 unique items that impacted recognized revenue. And I want to cover those briefly here in detail before we open up the call for Q&A. 
The first is the Wrike acquisition, which closed at the end of February. Second item is we experienced supply chain constraints in our hardware business, impacting over $10 million worth of products. So we expect these issues may persist for several quarters, so we're adjusting our full year expectations accordingly. 
And the third issue was the duration of on-premise term-based subscriptions, really influenced by the limited use licenses we sold to customers at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. So as a reminder, in Q1 2020, it benefited by $47 million related to this license type. So far, we've either converted to cloud subscriptions or issued new term-based licenses for about $50 million of total bookings value against this group. We have ongoing conversations with many more about the Citrix Cloud migration. 
So the limited use business continuity licenses really generally fell into 3 categories: first one, project-specific use cases, like a U.S. government agency that planned on building field hospitals to treat COVID patients. Obviously, those licenses would have no use beyond the project term. 
Second group would be companies that are adopting a hybrid work style post pandemic. Many of these customers are either evaluating or they're already beginning to migrate these licenses and their overall Citrix infrastructure to Citrix Cloud. 
And then the third group are employers that are supporting temporary work from home, and they're really still assessing their long-term work and their real estate plans. The customers in this third cohort tended to opt for shorter-duration on-prem term contracts versus multiyear subscriptions in Q1. 
So let me just give you a little context here. We estimate that recognized revenue in the quarter would be about $25 million higher if it wasn't for the shorter on-prem term license duration. In hindsight, of course, these dynamics are really not surprising, but they are different than what our guidance had called for. 
In the aggregate, business continuity licenses expand our installed base and, of course, our subsequent opportunity for these to move to the cloud over time through migration. Going forward, we continue to encourage investors to focus on annualized recognized revenue, of course, which we believe provides the most accurate measure of the underlying business performance. 
So operator, with that, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions now."

And then the follow-on is then, a little bit, it's like -- if you think about the -- on the Networking side, just kind of -- you talked about the component shortage. Like, how will that play through for the rest of the year?"

And I think supply chain constraints shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. It impacted our ability to ship over $10 million worth of revenue in the quarter. 
So there's 2 things going on there. If you looked -- when you read through our earnings letter, you'll see that the Networking business actually is very heavily weighted towards Subscription. In fact, 89% of bookings in Q1 were Subscription. Underlying that is an increasing run rate of hardware appliances to support these pooled capacity licenses. 
So while we don't disclose it externally, the ARR of that business has been accelerating over the last several quarters. And so with that, you see a little pressure on COGS, given the increasing component prices, but also in the unique item in this quarter. 
The boxes out of Q1 will ship in Q2, but we're assuming that this is going to be a sliding problem. So there could be some issue moving out of Q2 into Q3, et cetera, et cetera. So we just adjusted our full year to account for that. We don't think the issue is more broad than that. And the fortunate thing is that it is a reflection of just the underlying strength and our overall App Delivery and Security business. 
Second question, actually, your first question regarding the limited use licenses. So as I said just a minute ago in my remarks, reminding everybody, we had about $47 million of impact a year ago. And we had put in place programs to really help customers through business continuity in the time of need. And that was for all kinds of different use cases like I highlighted there. 
The focus over the last quarter or 2 has been on getting those customers to think about the longer-term subscriptions, mostly Citrix Cloud. So those companies that have already adopted go-forward plans around hybrid work, around real estate and around whatnot, those are the ones that have been successfully migrated towards Citrix Cloud or part of an ongoing conversation right now. 
The third group were the ones that are really still thinking about this in the context of business continuity. And so our underlying assumption had been that we'd be able to convert those to much longer-term subscriptions. But in reality, what came back was 1 year -- in general, 1-year term because of their business continuity. And so we're going to approach those going forward as just opportunities to help the customer think through their long-term plans and ultimately migrate those to Citrix Cloud."

In this group of -- this group of licenses that are truly business continuity, and people are looking at those as business continuity, they're still related to the pandemic. Those customers haven't worked their way through yet. And so it would be natural for them to offer a shorter-term license as they figure out what their long-term plans are.

And then over a longer period of time, it will be migrating to SaaS. So if I step back a little bit and just provide a bit of context in that overall business, a couple of years ago, it was largely hardware based. And we have a software heritage that underlies our business, and we were able to deliver those technologies across a number of different form factors, virtual appliances as a container and coming soon as a service. 
And so what that has afforded us is the opportunity to start transitioning customers to what we call a pooled capacity. It just gives them incredible flexibility for delivering their network infrastructure across all types of hybrid cloud deployment models. And that's really resonated. That's one of the reasons why the volume of hardware and our subscriptions is up as much as it is. 
Going forward, it's going to continue to migrate towards more of a cloud-delivered platform for App Delivery and Security, being able to give customers a much more friction-free way to adopt different technology bundles based on their own network architecture and help modernize IT. 
Overall, I think that this quarter, being 89% Subscription bookings, was probably a bit of a high mark. But it's definitely been trending up and to the right. So I think it's going to bounce around a little bit. We're still going to always have a hardware component so long as customers are focused on a hybrid multi-cloud model. So I would expect that part of it to continue for the next several years, but gradually moving towards more complete Subscription and then ultimately SaaS."

And so the way I look at it is we had a special set of circumstances a year ago. We generated about $47 million of revenue. We've already booked $50 million of revenue commitments against that. And we probably have a large pool, an 8-figure pool of licenses that we're continuing to discuss about cloud migration.

But I think most investors and analysts are around $8 a share for this year. So I just wanted to just ask whether that's still a reasonable assumption for this year?

Of the $1.4 billion, is there -- could you give us a rough sense of what the split between the Workspace and Networking looks like on the maintenance ARR side? 
And then the second piece of that would be, we're seeing the SaaS mix of Subscription bookings continue to move up into the right. You guys are targeting 50% to 60% for the year. As customers migrate over, are you seeing the type of uplift that we -- that you initially outlined a year or so ago in terms of seeing that 30% to 40% uplift?"

And so one of the reasons why our business has been accelerating in the cloud is just that. It gives customers more agility, more ability to manage, et cetera. So our strategy, of course, is focus on the idea of hybrid and multi-cloud, where a lot of our customers are somewhere in between. 
We want to give them the ability to run DaaS, either Citrix DaaS or one of the cloud platforms, manage it with the overall Citrix Cloud and still maintain on-premises licenses, running their workloads in public cloud, you name it.

We talked about that beginning in the back half of last year and really continuing here with overall bookings up well into the triple figures on a year-over-year percentage basis. And the reason that's happening are just the same things we've talked about before. It's easier to manage. It's easier to stay current, stay updated. 
In fact, the business that we're doing with some of our major partners, like Microsoft, for example, is stronger than it's ever been. We can go in and demonstrate to a customer that, for example, Citrix Cloud plus Microsoft Azure and WVD, the 3 of them together is the cheapest alternative and the most flexibility for them to be able to manage and run their infrastructure.

As you see in the letter, our cloud transition is progressing well. Our success in migrating customers to the cloud has continued to gain momentum over the last 3 quarters and our organic SaaS ARR growth rate continues to accelerate, up 47% year-on-year, while total ARR was steady at 13% growth. However, it's clear that we've had some sales execution challenges in some areas that are reflected in our Q2 results. And we believe that the cause of this has been really the increased complexity around managing this faster transition to the cloud, while simultaneously managing all the different license model types and motions that are key components of our reported revenue and overall P&L. 
So we believe we've identified the root causes and we're taking immediate actions to remedy these execution challenges. And this is including reorganizing our sales team, including sales leadership; realigning our customer-facing organizations to improve overall focus as well as indirect channels. We're reallocating resources to increase our capacity of quota-carrying sales reps to better support longer-term growth and we're refining our channel focus to prioritize landing and growing new business activities. While our SaaS transition metrics, obviously, are progressing really well, we acknowledge that many of our 2021 guidance ranges as well as the financial modeling guideposts we provided back at our analyst meeting in 2019 are going to take us longer than anticipated to achieve. 
So taking into account our year-to-date results and the changes we're making organizationally and with our overall go-to-market activities, we're recalibrating the shape and the path of the overall business model transition. At our Financial Analyst Meeting in October, which we'll have in conjunction with our third quarter earnings results announcement, we plan to provide an updated framework to more simply model our faster transition to SaaS and the expected business and financial outcomes. So through this, we, of course, continue to encourage investors to really focus on annualized recurring revenue as we believe this continues to provide the most accurate measure of the underlying business performance as we go through this business model transition.

The first is accurately forecasting the totals and the mix of different license types. Obviously, they have a different impact financially. Second is migrating the installed base to cloud, and the third is driving net new business bookings. With mix, we've consistently come in much higher with the SaaS mix, both in Q2 and in our forward guidance. Installed base migration, as you see in the letter, has been really positive. We've really stepped up the pace over the last 9 months or so, more than 2x where we were this time a year ago. Customers are seeing a lot of value in this migration and our co-sell with hyperscalers and particularly like Microsoft, for example, is up sharply. 
However, new business bookings was really the challenge in Q2. I think we believe that the root cause of that is a combination of really 3 things. Primarily the complexity that has existed with trying to balance all of these different moving parts, the mixed messaging and priorities inside the field that, that has caused whether it's duration, as you mentioned, migrations, new products, et cetera. I think it's confusing and it's just frankly inefficient. We are behind where I'd like to be in overall quota-carrying capacity, just due to investments in other areas of go-to-market as well as the pace of our hiring process. And the third is we just haven't done enough, in my opinion, to really enable our traditional channel partners to participate in the SaaS transition of the company. I think they're focused too much on fulfillment and an inconsistent alignment with the field. 
So that's why we listed those 4 things that we're doing to really focus on reorganizing and prioritizing the sales team, increasing direct quota carriers, channel leverage and prioritizing SaaS and happy to go into more detail about any of those four."

I think it looks through all of this noise with the business model transition. It gives you a better picture for what's going on. What's driving that is the Workspace in general. Just to give a couple of statistics there. Workspace, SaaS, in particular, and consumption-based bookings up sharply on a year-over-year basis. From a mix, we don't talk about bookings by product much, but I'll tell you around a mix basis. It's about 70% of Workspace is now coming via SaaS, up from 50% or less a year ago. So we're pushing in that transition. 
Part of the complexity that we're calling out right now as I think that the teams have tried too hard to guide this mix one way or another versus really embracing how quickly it should be moving. And so I'm happy with that. And then the second piece of it that's really driving it, of course, is the installed base migration. I just mentioned that on Raimo's question, but we are running 2 to 3x the rate that we were a year ago. We've increasingly seen customers migrating to Citrix Cloud and areas like the co-sell that I referenced just a minute ago is really helping drive that. So I think we're getting better and better alignment on that. So those are the primary drivers behind the 13% total ARR growth for the business."

And so a lot of this is about how do we land new customers very cleanly and how do we do that with our channel. How do we have people prioritizing SaaS is the primary motion. How do we make sure that incentives line up in the field, for example, and in the channel to support that, removing some of these what I call complexity issues.

When you step back and look at the market, I mean, we've had a relatively isolated set of issues that we think have just impacted our overall execution. When we do research, looking at our competitive analysis, win loss, there's been no material changes on that front. Sales cycles have been generally consistent with where they are in the past. And overall opportunity pipelines are where they need to be from our -- to be able to hit our numbers. It's just the execution items that we have highlighted there. 
If you look at the Workspace, it's definitely not an issue of it being overly penetrated. These markets are actually accelerating. You can look at some of the industry analysts that point to market growth rates and Citrix grew sharply in Workspace Technologies last year. We are the market leader in this area, and we will be growing this year as well. I earlier answered to Raimo's question, I think one of the things that will be really helpful for everyone is providing more of an ARR byproduct at some point in the future so that we can get a cleaner look past all these business model changes to be able to look at the underlying growth rates. And we're hoping to do that at our upcoming analyst meeting, just so that we can normalize all of these business model shifts and give everybody a true picture. 
But similar to the way I answered Raimo's question, what's driving our SaaS ARR growth right now organically to accelerate 3 quarters in a row is Workspace. What's really driving the total ARR in the low teens is Workspace. And so I don't anticipate that mix changing materially over the balance of the year. What I do expect though is our accuracy of whether it's forecasting or execution to improve throughout the second quarter. I mean, in the second half. Arlen?"

And so that's really the genesis of a lot of these changes that we're talking about. 
The other one is, I think, just recognizing where customers are going and how they're buying software and this general trend towards much more of a land-and-expand consumption-based different buying centers. And we want to make sure that we're aligned to where that's going in the future as well. And then lastly, it's -- I referenced quota-carrying capacity. It's one of those areas where it's behind where I'd like it to be. And these don't impact short term much, but it really gives you much better flexibility and growth opportunities long term.

I mean when we talk about execution, that's obviously an inside-out statement against our own expectations. And where believe we're doing well. And so the way that will manifest itself is in a couple of areas. One of them is just accuracy in terms of forecasting. And that could be everything from the totals to the mix of license types to products and other areas. And that has been, unfortunately, much less accurate recently than we would like. And so then you diagnose what is causing that? And some of the root causes are just mixed messaging in both our direct and our indirect channels where -- what do we prioritize? Are we prioritizing duration? Are we prioritizing products or different license types? And those types of things are what cause unnecessary complexity and unnecessary volatility. 
And so we're using this really as an opportunity to address not only that, but some of the other areas that I called out, which are really focused more on medium and long term, but I think, overall, just stem to drive better alignment. When I call out the channel, I mean, I think one thing in my mind is important. I think the channel right now today -- and when I say channel, I mean more of our traditional VARs and DaaS, I think they're overly focused on fulfillment. And there's been an inconsistent alignment with the field where they're operating in a supporting cast or they're actually driving net new demand and servicing customers. And refinements like that are really important because complexity just slows you down. It makes it harder to do business within Citrix and all of those things impact our overall accuracy. 
And so that's what we're trying to drive towards. And one of the reasons why we are pushing to a higher and higher mix of SaaS is that allows us to effectively not let our own internal execution impact the external financials, but it's also the way we generate much higher lifetime economic value for Citrix investors and customers."

I guess I'm wondering if you could talk a bit more about the retention and the conversion of some of the customers that took advantage of some of these bespoke license last year. Obviously, you're having a lot of success with SaaS ARR. It's accelerating here. But overall, I guess, are you on plan for sort of the conversion of these bespoke license?

I mean, most of that was either focused on temporary capacity that was used in the early part of the pandemic or things that have moved into permanent capacity already and just expanded the overall base. And so if I step back and I look at the -- you mentioned retention and whatnot. The renewal rates is one way to look at that. I mean we haven't called those out specifically since an analyst meeting. But those have been trending positive for the last several quarters. So we're probably right around as high as they've ever been in our history. That's SaaS as well as maintenance. 
The overall conversion of the installed base, as I said, I think we've really got a motion there that is resonating with customers. The products and the product maturity and the product resiliency is where we need it to be. And then the co-sell with Microsoft and the other hyperscalers is doing really well. And so that's why that pace is up 2, 3x from where it was a year ago. And I expect that installed base migration to continue. You see that when we call out certain metrics like paid subscribers on Citrix Cloud. That's another good metric. I think that was up more than 50% year-on-year. So that part of the transition, those things are going really, really well. 
And one of the -- just reminding everybody what we're calling out here is optimizing more on the kind of new business execution side so we can stop having as much volatility of total results as we've had over the last couple of quarters."

And so you're seeing that come out of subscriptions. I think in the AD&S business, which is the proxy for Networking, the second quarter increased, I think, 66% year-on-year in subscription and Software represented just under half of that total. So that's the direction that we've seen there. 
I think in general, take a big step back. I mean, what's going on in the market is, last year, the first 2, 3 quarters was really focused on somewhat transactional, COVID-related projects and whatnot. And over the last few quarters, people are refocusing on longer-term strategic, more transformational-type projects. It's one of the reasons why our installed base migration has picked up so much and we expect that to continue. So I think the type of project is becoming more and more strategic. And I'm not sure if that's what's driving legacy necessarily. But certainly, where we're taking those products is cloud-delivered platforms, simplicity of deployment, underlying simplicity and modernization of infrastructure. A lot of those things just mean drive them to the cloud, remove moving parts and then help them just have a more complete view of their infrastructure."

I mean if you step back and you talk about our growth rates and could they have been faster. In hindsight, yes, I think we had tried too hard to manage the business model transition between the pace of SaaS adoption and our short-term financial metrics. And these are goals that are obviously somewhat incongruous. And going forward, as we've talked about a lot this morning and some of the changes we're making is more lean into it, embrace the SaaS move more rapidly, and then just drive lower complexity internally. We clearly haven't always gotten this right, and I think it's caused more volatility than it should have. 
But if you take a big step back and you talk about growth rates, it's one of the reasons why we keep focusing everyone on ARR because it is the right proxy to look at, how the business model transition is going. And our SaaS ARR growth has accelerated for the third quarter in a row. It's somewhere close to $900 million, growing at nearly 50% year-on-year. We have $3 billion in total ARR growing in the low teens. And those are the leading indicators that we look at when we look at our -- where we expect the overall business growth rate to eventually get to as we get through this transition. 
So the real message today is we're clearly aligned on the execution issues that we have had, and we're taking steps immediately to address those. We're focused on simplifying the overall business model and leaning into the transition so that it becomes faster to get through this and really emerge the other side in a model that I think is easier to understand, easier to predict and, just frankly, easier to manage."

We think that's just the prudent approach that we should be taking right now.

Couple of areas are a little bit more medium and long term that I've called out. Increasing quota-carrying capacity. That doesn't impact the Q3, but that sets you up for 2022 and beyond so that you just have greater flexibility in both growth and predictability. 
So I mean I think it's a combination of both short, medium and long term. But the most impactful, frankly, is just getting to that point where we are, as much as possible, 100% SaaS. And that will take some time because one of our core differentiators, of course, is being customer-centric, being able to drive a hybrid model, being able to allow them to maintain some level of on-premise deployment, and we will continue to do that. We're just doing it in a different rate and pace, let's put it that way.

As you see in the letter, our cloud transition is progressing well. Our success in migrating customers to the cloud has continued to gain momentum over the last 3 quarters and our organic SaaS ARR growth rate continues to accelerate, up 47% year-on-year, while total ARR was steady at 13% growth. However, it's clear that we've had some sales execution challenges in some areas that are reflected in our Q2 results. And we believe that the cause of this has been really the increased complexity around managing this faster transition to the cloud, while simultaneously managing all the different license model types and motions that are key components of our reported revenue and overall P&L.  
So we believe we've identified the root causes and we're taking immediate actions to remedy these execution challenges. And this is including reorganizing our sales team, including sales leadership, realigning our customer-facing organizations to improve overall focus as well as indirect channels; reallocating resources to increase our capacity of quota-carrying sales reps to better support longer-term growth; and we're refining our channel focus to prioritize landing and growing new business activities. While our SaaS transition metrics, obviously, are progressing really well, we acknowledge that many of our 2021 guidance ranges as well as the financial modeling guideposts we provided back at our analyst meeting in 2019 are going to take us longer than anticipated to achieve.  
So taking into account our year-to-date results and the changes we're making organizationally and with our overall go-to-market activities, we're recalibrating the shape and the path of the overall business model transition. At our Financial Analyst Meeting in October, which we'll have in conjunction with our third quarter earnings results announcement, we plan to provide an updated framework to more simply model our faster transition to SaaS and the expected business and financial outcomes. So through this, we, of course, continue to encourage investors to really focus on annualized recurring revenue as we believe this continues to provide the most accurate measure of the underlying business performance as we go through this business model transition.

Actually, 2 different issues. In Q1, just to remind everybody, we had a lot of very special business continuity-type license, it's very short term in nature, things we put together back at the early stage of the pandemic that had impacted overall duration. These were really just unique ability to try and serve customers. Duration is not a factor in Q2. Duration has come back to normal levels as we anticipated. No change. You tend to see slightly longer duration and SaaS contracts in areas like that, but certainly along our lines of expectation.  
I think if you step back and think about Q2, let me put it in context for just a minute. There's 3 main focus areas around go-to-market. The first is accurately forecasting the totals and the mix of different license types. Obviously, they have a different impact financially. Second is migrating the installed base to cloud, and the third is driving net new business bookings. With mix, we've consistently come in much higher with the SaaS mix, both in Q2 and in our forward guidance. Installed base migration, as you see in the letter, has been really positive. We've really stepped up the pace over the last 9 months or so, more than 2x where we were this time a year ago. Customers are seeing a lot of value in this migration and our co-sell with hyperscalers and particularly like Microsoft, for example, is up sharply.  
However, new business bookings was really the challenge in Q2. I think we believe that the root cause of that is a combination of really 3 things, primarily the complexity that has existed with trying to balance all of these different moving parts, the mixed messaging and priorities inside the field that, that has caused whether it's duration, as you mentioned, migrations, new products, et cetera. I think it's confusing and it's just frankly inefficient. We are behind where I'd like to be in overall quota-carrying capacity, just due to investments in other areas of go-to-market as well as the pace of our hiring process. And the third is we just haven't done enough, in my opinion, to really enable our traditional channel partners to participate in the SaaS transition of the company. I think they're focused too much on fulfillment and an inconsistent alignment with the field.  
So that's why we listed those 4 things that we're doing to really focus on reorganizing and prioritizing the sales team, increasing direct quota carriers, channel leverage and prioritizing SaaS, and happy to go into more detail about any of those four."

And that's one of the reasons why we keep focusing on SaaS ARR and total ARR because I think it looks through all of this noise with the business model transition. It gives you a better picture for what's going on. What's driving that is the Workspace in general. Just to give a couple of statistics there. Workspace, SaaS, in particular, and consumption-based bookings up sharply on a year-over-year basis. From a mix, we don't talk about bookings by product much, but I'll tell you around a mix basis. It's about 70% of Workspace is now coming via SaaS, up from 50% or less a year ago. So we're pushing in that transition.  
Part of the complexity that we're calling out right now is I think that the teams have tried too hard to guide this mix one way or another versus really embracing how quickly it should be moving. And so I'm happy with that. And then the second piece of it that's really driving it, of course, is the installed base migration. I just mentioned that on Raimo's question, but we are running 2 to 3x the rate that we were a year ago. We've increasingly seen customers migrating to Citrix Cloud and areas like the co-sell that I referenced just a minute ago is really helping drive that. So I think we're getting better and better alignment on that motion. So those are the primary drivers behind the 13% total ARR growth for the business."

And so a lot of this is about how do we land new customers very cleanly and how do we do that with our channel. How do we have people prioritizing SaaS is the primary motion. How do we make sure that incentives line up in the field, for example, and in the channel to support that, removing some of these what I call complexity issues.

I called out our co-sell that we do. I mean it's up well over 100% year-on-year. And we're now at the top or near the top of their co-sell deal registration process.

And then for Arlen, you did indicate that operating cash flow in '21 would be below the levels of 2020. But for the first half, operating cash flow is down a full 50%.

When you step back and look at the market, I mean, we've had a relatively isolated set of issues that we think have just impacted our overall execution. When we do research, looking at our competitive analysis, win/loss, there's been no material changes on that front. Sales cycles have been generally consistent with where they are in the past. And overall opportunity pipelines are where they need to be from our -- to be able to hit our numbers. It's just the execution items that we have highlighted there.  
If you look at the Workspace, it's definitely not an issue of it being overly penetrated. These markets are actually accelerating. You can look at some of the industry analysts that point to market growth rates and Citrix grew sharply in Workspace technologies last year. We are the market leader in this area, and we will be growing this year as well. An earlier answer to Raimo's question, I think one of the things that will be really helpful for everyone is providing more of an ARR byproduct at some point in the future so that we can get a cleaner look past all these business model changes to be able to look at the underlying growth rates. And we're hoping to do that at our upcoming analyst meeting, just so that we can normalize all of these business model shifts and give everybody a true picture.  
But similar to the way I answered Raimo's question, what's driving our SaaS ARR growth right now organically to accelerate 3 quarters in a row is Workspace. What's really driving the total ARR in the low teens is Workspace. And so I don't anticipate that mix changing materially over the balance of the year. What I do expect though is our accuracy of whether it's forecasting or execution to improve throughout the second quarter -- I mean, in the second half."

The changes that we're talking about are we just think that there -- it's more of a volume question, just in our overall bookings volume, the complexity around that, the accuracy of our forecasting and things that we believe can be further streamlined and optimized. And so that's really the genesis of a lot of these changes that we're talking about. 
The other one is, I think, just recognizing where customers are going and how they're buying software and this general trend towards much more of a land-and-expand, consumption-based different buying centers. And we want to make sure that we're aligned to where that's going in the future as well. And then lastly, it's -- I referenced quota-carrying capacity. It's one of those areas where it's behind where I'd like it to be. And these don't impact short term much, but it really gives you much better flexibility and growth opportunities long term.

I mean when we talk about execution, that's obviously an inside-out statement against our own expectations and where believe we're doing well. And so the way that will manifest itself is in a couple of areas. One of them is just accuracy in terms of forecasting. And that could be everything from the totals to the mix of license types to products and other areas. And that has been, unfortunately, much less accurate recently than we would like. And so then you diagnose what is causing that? And some of the root causes are just mixed messaging in both our direct and our indirect channels where what do we prioritize? Are we prioritizing duration? Are we prioritizing products or different license types? And those types of things are what cause unnecessary complexity and unnecessary volatility. 
And so we're using this really as an opportunity to address not only that, but some of the other areas that I called out, which are really focused more on medium and long term, but I think, overall, just stem to drive better alignment. When I call out the channel, I mean, I think one thing in my mind is important. I think the channel right now today -- and when I say channel, I mean more of our traditional VARs and DaaS, I think they're overly focused on fulfillment. And there's been an inconsistent alignment with the field where they're operating in a supporting cast or they're actually driving net new demand in servicing customers. And refinements like that are really important because complexity just slows you down. It makes it harder to do business within Citrix and all of those things impact our overall accuracy. 
And so that's what we're trying to drive towards. And one of the reasons why we are pushing to a higher and higher mix of SaaS is that allows us to effectively not let our own internal execution impact the external financials, but it's also the way we generate much higher lifetime economic value for Citrix investors and customers at the same time."

I mean most of that was either focused on temporary capacity that was used in the early part of the pandemic or things that have moved into permanent capacity already and just expanded the overall base. And so if I step back and I look at the -- you mentioned retention and whatnot, the renewal rates is one way to look at that. I mean we haven't called those out specifically since an analyst meeting. But those have been trending positive for the last several quarters. So we're probably right around as high as they've ever been in our history. That's SaaS as well as maintenance. 
The overall conversion of the installed base, as I said, I think we've really got a motion there that is resonating with customers. The products and the product maturity and the product resiliency is where we need it to be. And then the co-sell with Microsoft and the other hyperscalers is doing really well. And so that's why that pace is up 2, 3x from where it was a year ago. And I expect that installed base migration to continue. You see that when we call out certain metrics like paid subscribers on Citrix Cloud, that's another good metric. I think that was up more than 50% year-on-year. So that part of the transition, those things are going really, really well. 
And one of the -- just reminding everybody, what we're calling out here is optimizing more on the kind of new business execution side so we can stop having as much volatility of total results as we've had over the last couple of quarters."

And so you're seeing that come out of subscriptions. I think in the [ ADNS ] business, which is the proxy for Networking, the second quarter increased, I think, 66% year-on-year in subscription and software represented just under half of that total. So that's the direction that we've seen there. 
I think in general, take a big step back. I mean what's going on in the market is, last year, the first 2, 3 quarters was really focused on somewhat transactional, COVID-related projects and whatnot. And over the last few quarters, people are refocusing on longer-term strategic, more transformational-type projects. It's one of the reasons why our installed base migration has picked up so much, and we expect that to continue. So I think the type of project is becoming more and more strategic. And I'm not sure if that's what's driving legacy necessarily. But certainly, where we're taking those products is cloud-delivered platforms, simplicity of deployment, underlying simplicity and modernization of infrastructure. A lot of those things just mean drive them to the cloud, remove moving parts and then help them just have a more complete view of their infrastructure."

I mean if you step back and you talk about our growth rates and could they have been faster. In hindsight, yes, I think we had tried too hard to manage the business model transition between the pace of SaaS adoption and our short-term financial metrics. And these are goals that are obviously somewhat incongruous. And going forward, as we've talked about a lot this morning and some of the changes we're making is more lean into it, embrace the SaaS move more rapidly and then just drive lower complexity internally. We clearly haven't always gotten this right, and I think it's caused more volatility than it should have. 
But if you take a big step back and you talk about growth rates, it's one of the reasons why we keep focusing everyone on ARR because it is the right proxy to look at, how the business model transition is going. And our SaaS ARR growth has accelerated for the third quarter in a row. It's somewhere close to $900 million, growing at nearly 50% year-on-year. We have $3 billion in total ARR growing in the low teens. And those are the leading indicators that we look at when we look at our -- where we expect the overall business growth rate to eventually get to as we get through this transition. 
So the real message today is we're cleanly aligned on the execution issues that we have had, and we're taking steps immediately to address those. We're focused on simplifying the overall business model and leaning into the transition so that it becomes faster to get through this and really emerge the other side in a model that I think is easier to understand, easier to predict and, just frankly, easier to manage."

We think that's just the prudent approach that we should be taking right now.

A couple of areas are a little bit more medium and long term that I've called out. Increasing quota-carrying capacity. That doesn't impact the Q3, but that sets you up for 2022 and beyond so that you just have greater flexibility in both growth and predictability. 
So I mean I think it's a combination of both short, medium and long term. But the most impactful, frankly, is just getting to that point where we are, as much as possible, 100% SaaS. And that will take some time because one of our core differentiators, of course, is being customer-centric, being able to drive a hybrid model, being able to allow them to maintain some level of on-premise deployment, and we will continue to do that. We're just doing it in a different rate and pace, let's put it that way.

For those of you whom I've not yet met, I'm Bob Calderoni, Chairman of the Board and Interim CEO. And as you know, I stepped into this new role just a few weeks ago. And while I will need some time before I can share with you my views on 2022 and beyond, I thought I would give you some of my early observations on the business. 
Today, I see a business with very strong assets and a solid foundation. Citrix, as you know, is the leader in its markets. We're #1 in the VDI DaaS market, and we're #2 in the ADC market. And those market positions are supported by strong technology advantages. The markets we participate in are healthy and growing, and our important VDI DaaS business has some strong secular tailwinds with trends supporting secure remote hybrid work. 
We have a strong and loyal customer base across the globe, and we have strong presence in every industry vertical. And from a business perspective, we've proven success in our transition to the cloud with over $1 billion of SaaS ARR, and we have largely transitioned our model to recurring revenues with over $3 billion of ARR. 
I believe the overall health and velocity of our business is best demonstrated by the fact that we expect our total ARR to grow nearly 10% this year on an organic basis. And I'll remind you, this growth is following a rather extraordinary year in 2020 that benefited from an unusual COVID demand. 
Another important metric signaling the health of any recurring revenue business is renewal rates. And while we do not disclose our renewal rates, I can say the rates are both strong and improving. 
There's lots of point to on the positive side, but I think it's fair to say there've also been some missteps along the way, which is clearly overshadowing our success. These missteps are largely in our go-to-market motion and in our own forecasting, and I'm confident they're all fixable. 
We need to shore up our channel programs and put in place the right incentives for our channel partners. And we need to focus sales investments on direct selling quota-carrying individuals and eliminate excess investments in overlays and shared commissions. 
We're going to address all of these issues as part of our planning for 2022 and and I will share more of that with you as part of our Q4 earnings call. Much of this work is underway, but not yet complete. 
I can say, however, the objectives for this work are very clear. We strive to be more predictable, delivering solid growth again in our total ARR along with better margins and cash flow. My priorities has set us on a course to deliver the long-term sustainable growth and profitability, I know we are capable of achieving. 
I'm very happy to be in this role. I look forward to working with the rest of the management team to achieve these objectives. And I look forward to talking with many of you over the coming months.

Look, the company talked about, I think, in an earlier conference call about some of the changes that were made to the channel over the past year or 2 that reduced the profitability of some of our channel partners business as it related to Citrix and really some changes in our compensation program, which I think need to be tweaked. 
The issue really was about how we're compensating and incenting our channel partners. The channel is still there. The channel hasn't gone away. They're not selling somebody else's products. So just focusing on other parts of their business. And like any part of the sales organization, and the channel is part of our sales organization, we want to make it more profitable for them to do business with us. 
So there are a few actions we've taken. We've already started to take with our channel partners and automate the business more attractive to them. The first was we recently moved over some of our stalled and uncovered pipeline, and we're sharing that with them to give them leads and opportunities for new business. 
We've also modified some of our compensation programs. Think of it as like a [ split ] in the short term here to encourage more focus on the Citrix business. We're going to do things in a more structured way for 2022, like compensation plans, you typically start them out at the beginning of the year. So we'll be more structured in our approach in 2022, but we didn't want to wait before we put some incentives in place. 
And then lastly, we're really working with them around educating them on the transition motion of transitioning existing customers to the cloud and giving them financial incentives. So we think that's not only good business for us, but we think there's really good opportunities for them to expand their business and add more value to their customers if they help them move to our cloud as well. 
So more to be done. Clearly, we just have to reverse some of the things that we did over the last year or 2 and make the business more attractive. And just like a sales force, if you make it more attractive to sell something, you'll get more of it sold and it's fixable. It might take a little bit of time before we see the uptick, but I'm pretty confident we will."

Well, the first thing I'd say is everything we're doing in terms of restructuring is, first and foremost, focused on growth. And I think this is something I've long believed that any business that is focused does a better job on exit and that includes not only margins, but that includes growth. So we are looking to ensure that we're making all of the necessary investments that support our growth. And we're looking to remove distractions that not only depress margins, but distract us from growth. So I think focus is an important part of it. 
I think the other thing I would say about it is we are going to keep or increase our direct quota-carrying individuals. And we're going to increase I mentioned earlier, we're going to be making some changes and are making changes that will increase the compensation that we're providing to our channel partners. So this is, again, in support of growth, there will be more investment into the front line and revenue-generating aspects of our business. 
And then with that said, I think we're going to get more efficient in other parts of the business. So I think one of the things I found early on, and I'm saying that the go-to-market organization, is we introduced far too many overlays over the last 12 to 18 months. And we've got too many instances where we have too many people getting compensated on the same deal. I don't think that's a good thing. I think that not only adds more cost. I think it also takes away sales capacity at the same time. So we're looking to drive a lot of those changes in the organization. 
And then in other parts of the organization, in R&D, it really is the product portfolio. Again, the things that are most important to us that are closely tied to our growth of VDI DaaS, ADC and in our content solutions, we're going to shore up and make sure we're making all of the investments needed in those areas and anything else that we don't have a lot of confidence in that's going to be a material driver of growth, we're going to remove those. 
So I'm confident at the end of it, we'll have an organization better positioned to grow, and I think one that will also see margins improve and drive significantly more cash flow. I definitely see 2021 as a trough year for both margins and cash flow. So I think we're going to come out of this a much stronger company and one that can deliver and create more value."

And I'm just wondering if you could unpack kind of the drivers of that. How much is related to the restructuring kind of onetime items? 
And if we can kind of think about the 2020 is the kind of a more of a normalized growth rate. Just any comments you can kind of bridge between what's implied in free cash flow for 2021, what could be driven by onetime items relative to what you saw last year?"

I think if you look at it on a multiyear basis and you think about how we're going to drive the company, I think it's fair to think of it as much more stabilized, and as Bob said, at a trough because there are factors that go into that. That being said, what we haven't included obviously, is free cash flow guidance for the year. And we haven't taken into account anything it might happen as a result of a restructuring. So that's not included in anything we might do. 
But I think to your concept updating about free cash flow on a more normalized basis, if you were to look at the last few years, it was probably an accurate way to think about it conceptually."

So that's spill overred at least $100 million, I think, from last year into this year. 
And then as you can see, our margins are down this year. So that's -- we shouldn't have that spillover effect next year. And I won't quantify the margin improvement yet. It's premature, but we'll reverse the headwind on margin. And so I expect cash flow to be an inflection point here off of 2021 and get back on the right track and have much higher levels in the coming year or 2."

We've moved -- we've largely moved all of our revenues to a recurring revenue. It's not all ratable, but it's all recurring. And I think that's the most important thing because I think we will increase the lifetime revenue from our customers by doing that. 
As far as driving the delivery model, I think it's wrong to try to force a customer to a delivery model that doesn't work for them. We can incent them. We can encourage them. I think we've largely done that. We see the growth in our SaaS business. We're over $1 billion now in SaaS revenue. It's growing nicely. But I think when we -- any company that tries to force customers to do something that's not in their best interest is probably not a good thing to do. 
So I feel really good that we've got the business recurring. And while it'd be easier to follow us, if it was all ratable, I think the best metric now to look at is the annualized recurring revenue on a total basis. I think that sorts out all the noise of the business model transition. It also source out the noise of having different licensing models. 
And if we look at that, I'm very encouraged by the results. We have 13% growth in that metric through 3 quarters of this year. We're saying, for the full, year, we'll be approximately 10% for the full year, and I feel really good about that. And I think that is a metric that's most important to me in understanding the health and velocity of the business. And I think we can provide that transparency for investors being that it is all recurring revenue. And that's something you'll see an increasing focus on both us internally and I think in our marketing messages out to you and to other investors as well. So that's really good. 
Now I do think customers are naturally going to migrate for the cloud delivery model. We just want them to do that on a rate and pace that makes sense for them because Citrix' infrastructure is oftentimes tied to a much bigger decision around the cloud, not just about Citrix. And I think we've got to recognize that reality."

I'm looking at the pre-COVID trend line, they're higher. And I think we would have felt a lot differently about the year if we had a better, I think, better internal forecasting what this year looks like. 
But no, a lot of negative things happen when you're not realistic. The first thing is you wind up setting quotas too high, and that's not good for your sales force.

And just to follow up on the broader margin question. I think if we take a step back philosophically, and when we talk about Citrix' cloud transition over the last several years, I think you guys have been distinctive in sort of the messaging to the market that we're going to have a cloud transition and broadly, margins, revenue growth and cash flow were all going to improve during this transition to subscription and then ultimately to SaaS, which is distinctive, right, in most other software companies that are going through cloud transition, the message to investors typically, hey, we have to digest a period of potentially slower growth, maybe lower margins, but the unit economics of our cloud tradition are so compelling that you come out the other side looking really strong from a cash flow position. 
So understanding like you're going to be investing in direct sales people to drive that growth. But philosophically, the point around growing margins, cash flow in concert with the SaaS transition, is that -- do you feel confident that that's still the right path to go?"

We're -- this -- I should maybe call this a margin restoration program that it will improve our margins. But the #1 focus is on the growth and in supporting the transition. And I think the company is making good progress on that transition. And a lot of the changes that we're talking about here, I think, are going to be focused around that. 
So we're going to increase the direct quota carrying individuals. We're going to increase the channel investments that are driving the front line. We're going to take away things aren't adding the growth just adding to expense. I mean, having a bunch of overlays that are not directly accountable for delivering sales and having shared compensation doesn't add to growth. It's a -- that investment would be better made somewhere else if you're really -- on growth, and that's what we're looking to do. 
So look, we haven't set the objectives yet for 2022 and really just given a directional statement at this point that we're going -- 2021 is a trough year for both margin and cash flow. But don't read that to think it's in lieu of growth. This is in support of growth. Growth is our #1 objective."

And I think, look, there's a narrative out there right now that's crushing the health and the strength of the business out there, and I think it's misinformed. I think we've got a business here that's very healthy. I think you can see that reflected in the growth in our ARR at 13%. I think you can see it in the fact that we have very strong renewal rates and they're getting better. That's a sign of a very healthy business and a very healthy competitive environment. 
And I think on the point of competition out there, I would point out that Microsoft is a big partner of ours. And that -- again, this is a little bit contrary to the narrative right now, but we partner with them because it's a symbiotic relationship to where they see a lot of value in moving Citrix' infrastructure to Azure. It drives a lot of Azure consumption. And it's a good business for us. So in those deals that we're working on, Microsoft as a partner, we monitor the deals. 
So we have a significant uptick in both the number of deals that we're working on jointly and we also see a significant uptick in the size of those deals that we're working on with Microsoft. So I think there's a lot of metrics here that are very, very encouraging that are inconsistent with the narrative out there. 
And I think part of that narrative, I think, is of our own doing because we obviously stumbled in the first couple of quarters this year and missed our reported revenue objectives. And that's the reason why I'm pointing to ARR to say throughout all of that noise, we have really solid double-digit growth in our ARR and all the other metrics would suggest strength in our business [indiscernible]. [ Real rates ] partnership with Microsoft. 
If I look at the SaaS growth, if I look at the transition of our existing customers from on-prem to the cloud, these are all, to me, votes of confidence in the business. And making that transition to the Citrix Cloud, some of our biggest and most complicated customers and making that move, to me, that's a tremendous vote of confidence in the Citrix business long term. And that, I think, is part of the reason why we see strong renewal rates."

Citrix got a lot of benefit from that, and there was a lot of incremental business  that came our way. But there are a lot of different ways companies solve this big problem last year. And I think, over time, people are going to start to realize that remote work has a very big security aspect to it, a very big performance aspect to it, not just a connectivity aspect to it. And I think as remote hybrid work becomes more permanent and not reactive, I think it's going to move more towards the use cases where Citrix actually has strength. 
I mean, one of the big advantages of Citrix is our performance levels and the HDX technology that we have in our DDI. I mean, that's something that is orders of magnitude more performance than any other form of facilitating remote hybrid work. So actually thinking as security becomes a bigger and bigger issue, I think it's going to move more towards complex use cases that require Citrix and also put some of the other alternatives at a disadvantage out there. 
So this is a secular tailwind that is real, that is going to be there forever. And I think some of the underlying currents also move in Citrix direction as well."

For those of you whom I've not yet met, I'm Bob Calderoni, Chairman of the Board and Interim CEO. And as you know, I stepped into this new role just a few weeks ago. And while I will need some time before I can share with you my views on 2022 and beyond, I thought I would give you some of my early observations on the business. 
Today, I see a business with very strong assets and a solid foundation. Citrix, as you know, is the leader in its markets. We're #1 in the VDI DaaS market, and we're #2 in the ADC market. And those market positions are supported by strong technology advantages. The markets we participate in are healthy and growing, and our important VDI DaaS business has some strong secular tailwinds with trends supporting secure remote hybrid work. 
We have a strong and loyal customer base across the globe, and we have strong presence in every industry vertical. And from a business perspective, we've proven success in our transition to the cloud with over $1 billion of SaaS ARR, and we have largely transitioned our model to recurring revenues with over $3 billion of ARR. 
I believe the overall health and velocity of our business is best demonstrated by the fact that we expect our total ARR to grow nearly 10% this year on an organic basis. And I'll remind you, this growth is following a rather extraordinary year in 2020 that benefited from an unusual COVID demand. 
Another important metric signaling the health of any recurring revenue business is renewal rates. And while we do not disclose our renewal rates, I can say the rates are both strong and improving. 
There's lot to point to on the positive side, but I think it's fair to say there've also been some missteps along the way, which is clearly overshadowing our success. These missteps are largely in our go-to-market motion and in our own forecasting, and I'm confident they're all fixable. 
We need to shore up our channel programs and put in place the right incentives for our channel partners. And we need to focus sales investments on direct selling quota-carrying individuals and eliminate excess investments in overlays and shared commissions. 
We're going to address all of these issues as part of our planning for 2022, and I will share more of that with you as part of our Q4 earnings call. Much of this work is underway, but not yet complete. 
I can say, however, the objectives for this work are very clear. We strive to be more predictable, delivering solid growth again in our total ARR along with better margins and cash flow. My priorities have set us on a course to deliver the long-term sustainable growth and profitability, I know we are capable of achieving. 
I'm very happy to be in this role. I look forward to working with the rest of the management team to achieve these objectives. And I look forward to talking with many of you over the coming months.

I assume by your comments, there's not going to be any changes to the go-to-market motion for the fourth quarter. Anything that will be changed would be in the beginning of next year. 
And then, I guess, secondly, on the go-to-market side, can you just talk a little bit more about the channel kind of what's going on this year that hasn't worked, meaning is it the visibility into the channel pipeline isn't there? It's just an execution between sort of your expectations and what the channels delivered? I'm trying to get a little bit better sense of what's maybe gone wrong on that front and how you think about correcting it or is it again, you're just getting an early view on this?"

Look, the company talked about, I think, in an earlier conference call about some of the changes that were made to the channel over the past year or 2 that reduced the profitability of some of our channel partners' business as it related to Citrix and really some changes in our compensation program, which I think need to be tweaked. 
The issue really was about how we're compensating and incenting our channel partners. The channel is still there. The channel hasn't gone away. They're not selling somebody else's products. They're just focusing on other parts of their business. And like any part of a sales organization, and the channel is part of our sales organization, we want to make it more profitable for them to do business with us. 
So there are a few actions we've taken. We've already started to take with our channel partners and automate the business more attractive to them. The first was we recently moved over some of our stalled and uncovered pipeline, and we're sharing that with them to give them leads and opportunities for new business. 
We've also modified some of our compensation programs. Think of it as like a [indiscernible] [ stiff ] in the short term here to encourage more focus on the Citrix business. We're going to do things in a more structured way for 2022, like compensation plans, you typically start them out at the beginning of the year. So we'll be more structured in our approach in 2022, but we didn't want to wait before we put some incentives in place. 
And then lastly, we're really working with them around educating them on the transition motion of transitioning existing customers to the cloud and giving them financial incentives. So we think that's not only good business for us, but we think there's really good opportunities for them to expand their business and add more value to their customers if they help them move to our cloud as well. 
So more to be done. Clearly, we just have to reverse some of the things that we did over the last year or 2 and make the business more attractive. And just like a sales force, if you make it more attractive to sell something, you'll get more of it sold and it's fixable. It might take a little bit of time before we see the uptick, but I'm pretty confident we will."

Well, the first thing I'd say is everything we're doing in terms of restructuring is, first and foremost, focused on growth. And I think this is something I've long believed that any business that is focused does a better job on execution and that includes not only margins, but that includes growth. So we are looking to ensure that we're making all of the necessary investments that support our growth. And we're looking to remove distractions that not only depress margins, but distract us from growth. So I think focus is an important part of it. 
I think the other thing I would say about it is we are going to keep or increase our direct quota-carrying individuals. And we're going to increase I mentioned earlier, we're going to be making some changes and are making changes that will increase the compensation that we're providing to our channel partners. So this is, again, in support of growth, there will be more investment into the front line and revenue-generating aspects of our business. 
And then with that said, I think we're going to get more efficient in other parts of the business. So I think one of the things I found early on, and I'm saying that the go-to-market organization, is we introduced far too many overlays over the last 12 to 18 months. And we've got too many instances where we have too many people getting compensated on the same deal. I don't think that's a good thing. I think that not only adds more cost, I think it also takes away sales capacity at the same time. So we're looking to drive a lot of those changes in the organization. 
And then in other parts of the organization, in R&D, it really is the product portfolio. Again, the things that are most important to us that are closely tied to our growth of VDI DaaS, ADC and in our content solutions, we're going to shore up and make sure we're making all of the investments needed in those areas and anything else that we don't have a lot of confidence in is going to be a material driver of growth, we're going to remove those. 
So I'm confident at the end of it, we'll have an organization better positioned to grow, and I think one that will also see margins improve and drive significantly more cash flow. I definitely see 2021 as a trough year for both margins and cash flow. So I think we're going to come out of this a much stronger company and one that can deliver and create more value."

And I'm just wondering if you could unpack kind of the drivers of that. How much is related to the restructuring kind of onetime items? 
And if we can kind of think about the 2020 is the kind of a more of a normalized growth rate. Just any comments you can kind of bridge between what's implied in free cash flow for 2021, what could be driven by onetime items relative to what you saw last year?"

I think if you look at it on a multiyear basis and you think about how we're going to drive the company, I think it's fair to think of it as much more stabilized, and as Bob said, at a trough because there are factors that go into that. That being said, what we haven't included obviously, is free cash flow guidance for the year. And we haven't taken into account anything that might happen as a result of a restructuring. So that's not included in anything we might do. 
But I think to your concept updating about free cash flow on a more normalized basis, if you were to look at the last few years, it was probably an accurate way to think about it conceptually."

I think this year again, being a trough, we do have some cash flow headwinds this year that were spillover, as Arlen said, from last year. Last year's revenue growth, the storage and COVID, I think, drove a lot of added commissions and bonuses. And that largely gets paid out in the first quarter of the following year. So that spillover is sort of at least $100 million, I think, from last year into this year. 
And then as you can see, our margins are down this year. So that's -- we shouldn't have that spillover effect next year. And I won't quantify the margin improvement yet. It's premature, but we'll reverse the headwind on margin. And so I expect cash flow to be an inflection point here off of 2021 and get back on the right track and have much higher levels in the coming year or 2."

We've moved -- we've largely moved all of our revenues to recurring revenues. It's not all ratable, but it's all recurring. And I think that's the most important thing because I think we will increase the lifetime revenue from our customers by doing that. 
As far as driving the delivery model, I think it's wrong to try to force a customer to a delivery model that doesn't work for them. We can incent them. We can encourage them. I think we've largely done that. We see the growth in our SaaS business. We're over $1 billion now in SaaS revenue. It's growing nicely. But I think when we -- any company that tries to force customers to do something that's not in their best interest is probably not a good thing to do. 
So I feel really good that we've got the business recurring. And while it'd be easier to follow us, if it was all ratable, I think the best metric now to look at is the annualized recurring revenue on a total basis. I think that sorts out all the noise of the business model transition. It also sorts out the noise of having different licensing models. 
And if we look at that, I'm very encouraged by the results. We have 13% growth in that metric through 3 quarters of this year. We're saying, for the full, year, we'll be approximately 10% for the full year, and I feel really good about that. And I think that is a metric that's most important to me in understanding the health and velocity of the business. And I think we can provide that transparency for investors being that it is all recurring revenue. And that's something you'll see an increasing focus on both us internally and I think in our marketing messages out to you and to other investors as well. So that's really good. 
Now I do think customers are naturally going to migrate for the cloud delivery model. We just want them to do that on a rate and pace that makes sense for them because Citrix' infrastructure is oftentimes tied to a much bigger decision around the cloud, not just about Citrix. And I think we've got to recognize that reality."

I think you can see it in the fact that we have very strong renewal rates and they're getting better. That's a sign of a very healthy business and a very healthy competitive environment. 
And I think on the point of competition out there, I would point out that Microsoft is a big partner of ours. And that -- again, this is a little bit contrary to the narrative right now, but we partner with them because it's a symbiotic relationship to where they see a lot of value in moving Citrix' infrastructure to Azure. It drives a lot of Azure consumption. And it's a good business for us. So in those deals that we're working on, Microsoft as a partner, we monitor the deals. 
So we have a significant uptick in both the number of deals that we're working on jointly and we also see a significant uptick in the size of those deals that we're working on with Microsoft. So I think there's a lot of metrics here that are very, very encouraging that are inconsistent with the narrative out there. 
And I think part of that narrative, I think, is of our own billing because we obviously stumbled in the first couple of quarters this year and missed our reported revenue objectives.

Citrix got a lot of benefit from that, and there was a lot of incremental business that came our way. But there are a lot of different ways companies solved this big problem last year. And I think, over time, people are going to start to realize that remote work has a very big security aspect to it, a very big performance aspect to it, not just a connectivity aspect to it. And I think as remote hybrid work becomes more permanent and not reactive, I think it's going to move more towards the use cases where Citrix actually has strength. 
I mean, one of the big advantages of Citrix is our performance levels and the HDX technology that we have in our DDI. I mean, that's something that is orders of magnitude, more performance than any other form of facilitating remote hybrid work. So actually thinking as security becomes a bigger and bigger issue, I think it's going to move more towards complex use cases that require Citrix and also put some of the other alternatives at a disadvantage out there. 
So this is a secular tailwind that is real, that is going to be there forever. And I think some of the underlying currents also move in Citrix direction as well."
