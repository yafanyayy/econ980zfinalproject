Thank you for joining us. I'll be fairly brief as the fourth quarter, of course, kind of reflected what the rest of the year looked like and so much as it was a bumpy ride.

I'll be fairly brief as the fourth quarter, of course, kind of reflected what the rest of the year looked like and so much as it was a bumpy ride. COVID news dominated, of course, everything in travel. And I would say that we saw a mixed world of some optimism coming from the vaccine rollouts beginning mixed with obviously very bad news on case loads across the globe, closures in many countries, restrictions all over the various geographies. 
So with that as the background, we're happy to turn the page on the year and move into '21. I will say that on the whole, as you saw in our release, booking trends in the fourth quarter pretty much near the third quarter at about down 60% for total gross lodging bookings, net of cancellations that did moderate towards the holiday season and the end of the quarter, and we saw that moderate into the high 50s down. And that has -- that improvement has seemed to continue through January. And in the latter part of January, we've seen down in the high 40s. So the trends are generally good, although very bad or for all, going in the right direction. But I would caution everybody that we continue to expect it to be bumpy as this is a story of a thousand different geographies and a thousand different fact sets around the virus and, of course, vaccine rollouts, et cetera. 
We did see that improvement overall, driven by Vrbo, not a big surprise. That continues to be a terrific use case with the whole home market being very attractive. Family travel being very attractive in that form. And North America generally has been a relative bright spot, of course, our relative strength in North America certainly helps us in that. 
So we continue to hope and expect the vaccine rollout to drive consumer confidence and drive things forward. But we certainly are not trying to predict what consumer sentiment will be as the buyers changes over the ensuing months. So we continue to expect a bumpy ride. We are watching for what governments are doing, what the rules may be on international travel or things like travel passports, et cetera, with the goal just of making that process as soonest as we can for our travelers and getting people back moving again. We know there's a lot of pent-up demand, and we certainly want to serve it as much as we can. 
With that market background in mind, in the fourth quarter, we were investing more heavily in marketing. This was intended to get ahead of what we thought would be the coming demand from the vaccine rollouts, but it was largely focused certainly on the upper funnel brand marketing side on Vrbo, where we knew there was a lot of momentum. And as I've said before on these calls, we are using this moment to try to drive as much brand recognition and long-term value and to the brand over time. So we pushed into Vrbo on the Performance marketing side, which we view as more of a quick twitch muscle. We have continued to be relatively conservative. Again, we saw lots of closures happen across the globe. Those closures drive massive cancellation spikes. And they can make performance marketing very unattractive very quickly when it goes the wrong way. So we have been relatively conservative. 
And in that vein, we have actually removed Vrbo from Google's vacation rental meta product. Again, our focus is as much as possible, on driving direct traffic, driving incremental profitability from all our performance marketing and as we see opportunity to remove unprofitable activities, we do that. And as we leg back into a more normal market, we think we'll be able to drive more into the upper funnel, more direct traffic and be much more calculated in performance marketing. 
On the rest of the marketing side, and this is really about brand differentiation and geographic differentiation. I've talked about this before, but we continue to focus on driving whatever brands make sense, wherever they are in the globe. So for example, we have leaned heavily into our Wotif brand in Australia, a company we bought years ago. It's a very strong domestic brand in Australia, particularly associated with domestic travel, which has been the primary use case, and we're seeing good reaction from the market by doing that. And we are looking at that everywhere. That goes for Vrbo as well, which is not a global brand. It has strength, particularly in North America, but there are parts of Europe where we have other brands that are stronger. Australia, we have another brand called Space that's stronger. So we are leaning into those and seeing good growth across all our alternate accommodation brands in our strong markets. 
Longer term, I would just point out that, in addition to driving that brand neutrality, if you will, we are also intending to drive alternative accommodations through our OTA brands. We haven't -- we've been saying that for a long time. We are now highly focused on doing it. It's not ready to roll yet. We do, do it, but it is not -- the consumer experience is not yet where we want it, but we are highly focused on driving that in the future. And that will be the way we attack markets where we don't have an existing Vrbo or other alternative accommodation brand. 
And then finally, we continue to do work on the marketing side on just brand differentiation and segmenting the market and Brand Expedia, our biggest pool of OTA brand, will be rolling out in the spring with a new campaign focused on essentially the complete trip. Brand Expedia is the most complete OTA, and we are going to focus on people who are trying to book multiple things, more complex trips. We think there's a big opportunity there. And the brand has not sufficiently landed that message over the years. So we are optimistic about our new approach to that. 
On the other side of the house, and perhaps the most important place we are investing our time, energy and calories which we've talked about frequently, is the tech platform. That continues to be a key focus of ours. I just want to point out, this is an area of with opportunity for us. It will be years of mining that opportunity, and 2021 is an important year where we expect to have significant delivery on important steps forward on simplifying our tech platform, and we are keenly focused on that, along with being focused on turning ourselves into a Tier 1 tech company and looking for and building systems to find and retain and recruit great talent and retain our great talent that we have. And build Tier 1 tech enterprise that focus is keenly on solving consumer problems and our business partner problems, and we think we're well on our way to that. 
And finally, I'll end with something that's a little less easy to calculate by revenue or margin, but I think it's equally critical to the success of our enterprise going forward, which is that end of this year, we re-landed, reset our company mission, purpose and values with an emphasis on travel being a force for good, bringing people together, broadening horizons and strengthening connections. And we think, obviously, in this time and place that the U.S. and the world is in, that is obviously an important role we play in the world. But we want to bring that to everything we do, everything we do in the product, and really express that through the experience. And in doing that, we also acknowledged as a company that what we do has impact on the environment, and we are refocusing ourselves on the facts that travel creates on the environment, particularly and initially around tools and information to help our travelers and help our suppliers make better choices to help drive better outcomes for the environment. 
So that's an important push for us. And then finally, we've made some bold, ambitious goals for ourselves around diversity and inclusion in terms of our workforce. And it really goes beyond our workforce because we really want to express that through travel as well. There are many people who have challenges and having successful travel outcomes, we have not done enough to help all people in that. And we want to drive that through everything we do every time we roll a product out, every time we think about building a product and the consumer experience, and we intend to drive that through the business. 
So with that, I'll just close by saying expect things to be bumpy for a while. I don't think this is linear, what we've been going through, and I don't think we should expect it to become linear. We are optimistic that when consumer confidence comes back, when people feel confident that the vaccine rollout is going well, that they will be able to travel. We clearly see demand and I think we're just going to power through it. And when consumers are ready to travel, we're going to be there. And with that, I will turn it over to Eric. Thank you."

Thank you, also, for joining the call as well. Coming into 2020, we've talked a lot about driving margin expansion as being one of our key priorities, and we're pleased we've made significant progress in a number of areas along those fronts. The 
first I want to touch on is on a fixed cost basis. We talked since start of the year at a range of $300 million to $500 million. We upped that during the year last year and then upped it to $700 million to $750 million range. We now believe that we will be at the higher end of that $700 million to $750 million range for fixed cost savings relative to our 2019 exit rate. We have achieved approximately $675 million on a run rate basis. And we expect to realize largely all of the cost savings by the end of 2021. 
As mentioned previously, when projecting for, do keep in mind that we will have annual increases and  expect to invest in areas of the business where we see attractive opportunities as well. 
On the variable cost of revenue side, we remain on track for over $200 million in annual savings based on 2019 volume levels. The 3 key drivers are improved economics through our payments platform, expansion of our conversations costs and lower variable cloud costs as well. Similar to the fixed cost initiatives, we expect to realize largely all of these variable cost savings by the end of 2021. Although given the costs are volume-based, the savings will not be fully evident until we reach more normalized business levels. 
Shifting to our Q4 results. I wanted to start by providing details on 2 onetime items that distorted our P&L and reduced adjusted EBITDA by approximately $65 million. 
First, we recognized approximately $125 million of contra revenue related to third-party travel insurance due primarily to higher pandemic-related cancellations. We restructured our commercial terms and recorded the expense in Q4 so that we will not impact our unit economics of those products and also our P&L going forward. Excluding this impact, the Q4 revenue decline improved by 4% to 62% year-over-year. We continue to believe insurance products are a key part of our offer and also provide terrific customer experience and protection for them going forward to continue to -- we plan to continue to invest in that area. 
And when you look at 2020, the insurance line of business was profitable despite the adjustment that we made and despite substantially less revenue. 
The second onetime change was a favorable adjustment to personnel costs. Given the impact to our business in 2020, we decided to shift cash bonuses, which we accrued at 50% throughout the year to equity this year for the vast majority of our employees. As a result, in Q4, we reversed approximately $60 million of bonus expense that accrued in the first 3 quarters of the year. The related cash savings will come in Q1 of 2021 when bonuses are typically paid. 
We recognize the majority of this bonus benefit and overhead expenses. Excluding the bonus accrual reversal, overhead expenses declined 31% year-over-year in Q4, similar to the year-over-year decline in Q3. The bonus reversal had minimal impact on cost of revenue, which declined 47%, and the disposal of Bodybuilding.com provided approximately a 5% benefit. 
Moving generally on to bonuses. We also made the strategic decision this quarter to shift our compensation structure away from annual cash bonuses going forward, with the vast majority of our fully funded annual bonus program being converted to salary. We anticipate approximately $50 million in extra quarterly payroll costs starting in Q2 of 2020 relative to Q1 2020, mainly due to this change. 
Moving on to marketing efficiency. We have been investing more in brand spend, Peter mentioned that, to drive direct traffic at the top of the funnel, while at the same time, operating at higher ROI and variable channels. We believe this approach, along with the benefits of unifying all of our retail marketing data and technology, will enable us to be much more strategic in how we balance volume, profitability in both the short and the long term. 
As Peter mentioned, we leaned particularly heavily into additional brand marketing Vrbo to take advantage of the demand in alternative accommodations, and we have continued to prudently weigh back into performance marketing, where we see demand. Overall, the efficiency initiatives we've executed during COVID will enable us to emerge from the disruption leaner, faster and with improved margins. 
In total, adjusted EBITDA was negative $160 million in Q4 and when normalizing for the 2 nonrecurring items I just walked through, it was negative $95 million. 
On to free cash flow, it is typically negative for us in Q4 due to seasonality of our profit and working capital. And as such, was negative this quarter as well in Q4 as well, 513 negative -- negative $513 million on a reported basis. 
Moving on to cash. We ended the year with total unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $3.4 billion, which is about $1 billion lower than we ended Q3. During the quarter, we repaid the remaining $650 million outstanding on our revolver which accounted for the majority of the change in cash. We head into 2021 in a strong liquidity position, with the $3.4 billion in cash and an essentially untaxed $2 billion revolver. As the business recovers over the next few years, we remain committed to deleveraging back to our historical capital structure. 
Turning to 2021. While we remain optimistic about the vaccines and look forward to travel recovering. As Peter mentioned, visibility on what the recovery will look like and near-term trends remains low at this point. Given the current trends and typical seasonality, we do expect a significant adjusted EBITDA loss in the quarter. As a reminder, Q1 is historically the lowest revenue and profit quarter of the year. 
In terms of 2021 forecasting, just to give you a bit of insight on costs, overhead costs are the part of the P&L where we have the most visibility. We expect overhead costs in Q1 to be similar to Q4 before the impact of changes to the bonus accrual. We expect overhead in Q2 to step up by approximately $50 million, principally due to the shift away from bonus compensation that I mentioned earlier and a lapping of temporary COVID-related savings from 2020. 
In closing, while there is considerable uncertainty remaining on what the recovery will look like, we feel good about where we are from a margin expansion. We feel good about our liquidity position. And we're confident that we're taking the right steps to accelerate in the recovery. With that, thank you, and Katrina, we're ready for our first question."

So just to be clear, the vast as vast, virtually off of the success in alternatives and Vrbo has been through the branded Vrbo sites or as I mentioned, some of the sub-brands that are specific to countries. We have a very modest business in the alternative space that happens through our OTAs. It has been a less than satisfactory product that we are working on aggressively, but it is a small, small part of the business. We do believe, though, that in time, that can be an important part of the business, particularly when you think about markets where Expedia or Hotels.com or any of our OTAs might have strong brands, but Vrbo is basically nonpresence as a brand. So 
we think that's a scenario where being able to pipe that through is really valuable. We think even in markets where they overlap, there can be use cases where customers are coming into Expedia or another brand and could absolutely want an alternative accommodation and want to see that option revealed as against hotel and other kinds of options. And then I would just add that, while you didn't ask it, I think there's -- we believe there's a big opportunity for alternative accommodations through our B2B partners, which it is not currently really piped to do. So those are all opportunities to continue to expand on the alternative space. And I think to take advantage of what we have in terms of supply, but what we don't necessarily have on the brand side to drive it in certain markets."

I mean, it is a tale of many stories in different markets, has come back at different rates, but I would say in terms of any big drivers, North America has generally retained more willingness to move around people engaging in more travel, less we haven't had government shutdowns in the way we have in other places. So yes, I would say North America is probably the bulk of the story over that month or so. 
The -- to your second question, no, we don't intend to break it out not because we don't want to make all of your lives easier but because we believe it's one business. Essentially, as I mentioned about piping Vrbo content through the OTAs, and we view this as just another product that a traveler will want. It's not -- obviously, it's having a great moment, and we're glad that we own it, and we believe we can ride some of the success travelers being exposed to the product type in a new way. But we view it collectively, and we view it as one business that we're driving whatever the best outcome for the consumers and driving that outcome across all lines of business. So we think this separation has been artificial effectively, and we're not planning to report it that way in the future."

I think we're all aligned and hoping and working towards helping them come out of it. We've renewed a number of agreements without much debate. And I think our focus has been really on doing more to help the hotelier, as you alluded to, through data, but some of the examples include things like optimized distribution, which we've talked about before where we essentially become the wholesale distribution point for a number of hotels. We've done this with a few chains now. And that gives us an opportunity to help them clean up the marketplace, where they might have a wholesale market that is perhaps being abused by some players and driving the wrong outcomes for them. And with our technology and with our approach, we can help clean that up for them, and we think that's a net positive for both of us. 
Similarly, we have been sharing more data. We're working hard on new tools to provide more data to drive real-time decision-making for hoteliers so that they can optimize revenue in better ways. And of course, we're doing our part to try to drive and improve the product so that we can sell higher value rooms, room types, upsell product, et cetera, so that we can help drive ADRs and overall revenue. 
So there's a lot of work going on. I think we're tightly aligned in wanting the hotel to come out and be successful. I think the hotels understand and appreciate the role we play in a rebound, and it's been a quite good environment and good relationships all around, and we're all working hard to try to rebuild the market."

There's a ton of work going on with suppliers, as we just talked about, ton of work going on for the customer. So I think morale is quite good.

As far as the performance goes and Eric, jump in, if you want to as well. But I would say, we're very sharp-minded about it in the sense that we're happy to invest in anything that drives incremental profitability, good revenue and good profits. And we're not keen to continue on a path of just continuing where investment was not productive. So we didn't find investment in the Google VR product, particularly incremental. We didn't think the customer experience was particularly valuable. And we are, of course, also in a period where we're seeing great direct traffic for Vrbo. So we found other ways and, in our view, more profitable ways to drive traffic. 
As far as the rest of performance marketing goes and performance marketing for hotels and Meta, et cetera, the different products for the consumer. It's a different proposition and clearly has historically had value for the consumer, I think we feel like we will continue to play at it. I think we will continue to improve at it. I've talked before about how we've smashed together our performance marketing teams, where we wiring all the data streams. We're pushing towards multi-brand algorithms and things we haven't done before. So we think we're going to get much better at it in terms of being able to optimize for the portfolio. And continue to use it, hopefully very effectively. But right now, there are no -- I wouldn't say there are big tectonic shifts in what we're seeing as to how we would apply that money other than we're going to be very clinical about it in terms of looking for and driving the best veins of profitability we can, wherever they are."

We're not at this point, solving for a specific percentage. Ultimately, we're in this COVID period. And so we're -- as we talked about, waiting back prudently into performance channels and then investment in brand where we think it's appropriate, particularly on Vrbo. But as Peter mentioned, there's just a ton of work that's going on, for example, in performance channels, leveraging our overall data, multi-brand bidding, as Peter just mentioned, but ultimately trying to understand as well lifetime value and incrementality as well. And so those are new muscles, in particular, given the scale, the way we're running the business now and the scale of the data that we're aggregating together. So I think there's more to learn there. And then on the brand side, that just has a very different profile than performance and that it has longer return periods. And so we're confident to invest behind the brands, obviously, doing that behind Vrbo. We expect to do that even more in some of our other brands as we narrow in on specific value propositions and line of product behind those and then the marketing associated as well. So a long-winded way of saying, we don't have a specific percentage that we're solving for now. But we're certainly spending a lot of time trying to improve on the marketing side and the value proposition and related marketing."

But I would say that Vrbo tends to be long dated. The summer, obviously, is a strong opportunity for the Vrbo use case, and we're seeing people lean into that as the year opens up. And so by and large, the blending towards that, we have seen some improvement in conventional lodging, again, particularly in North America. But I would say, it's a little bit of a Vrbo continued health and even amplified health going into the summer months, et cetera. And a little bit of improvement in the more conventional spaces. And I don't think we'll break out exactly how good it was, but Vrbo has been strong. Eric, I don't know if you want to add anything."

But what we've seen is Vrbo elongate again and look much more like we would have expected to see any other year, which gets back to the summer bookings that Peter is mentioning. And so I suspect we know there's pent-up demand. People want to travel. And I think people have confidence that they're going to be able to travel at least domestically using the U.S. as an example. And so they're starting to book those summer months now."

And I think in that vein, you may see us investing in capturing that demand even if that demand is not staying for some time. And so you may see some dislocation, I would expect, or bumpiness in the numbers in terms of when the marketing spend is versus when the revenue recognition is but we certainly don't plan to be back on our heels. We -- as I mentioned, we have a strong campaign that we're working on for Brand Expedia. We've got -- we've certainly consistently stating, and we'll stay in the Vrbo upper funnel work on brand, Hotels.com, the same.

And as we mix into Vrbo with their longer booking windows, particularly in the summer, then you're going to see more of that revenue on the transactions that we're -- a lot of those that we're seeing now, get pushed out into the later months. So then when you go back to look at marketing, it's a bit bumpier, to use Peter's word, just because we're spending now elevated in Vrbo in lots of different ways where the revenue may be more down the line."

I'll take that one first, and let me come back to the other question. But I would say, to be specific in this question, in alternative combinations in our strong markets, we believe we have seen very good share and share growth relative to our competition. But I would say, overall, each of we and our main competitors have different warts and different good guys. We have a very good guy with Vrbo and the use case and where we have supply and where people are wanting to travel. But conversely, we also conventionalizing have a heavy -- a strong presence in major cities and international travel, both of which obviously have been hurt equally. I could point to any one of our competitors who has the inversion of that and has is better in secondary cities, et cetera, maybe better in alternative accommodations in markets where we don't even have a presence. Some of those markets are shut, some of those markets are strong. It's a tale of many stories. 
So I think as it comes to share, we think we're doing well, where we're strong, certainly in alternative accommodations and overall in North America. But there are certainly competitors who have better solutions for certain use cases, and they're seeing benefit from that. So I think it's really -- I would caution anybody to get too excited about share, one way or the other during this because the dislocation really creates a bunch of unique stories. And you can -- I would think one could get fooled by a trend that's not a trend. It's just a moment of how people are using travel right now. So -- but we have gained and we're happy about that. And in our strongest markets and, in particular, in VR. 
I think your other question was on traffic. The answer is we see a lot of booking. It's not entirely clear that it's all for summer or -- which -- not -- I don't think there's anything that tells you there's something specific people are searching for for specific timezone, but we are seeing interest in the holidays already at the end of next -- the end of this year. It's still relatively small, but stronger than it had been 1 year ago. We're seeing trends like that. Some are very strong in alternatives, still highly muted in conventional lodging. And I would just say there are a lot of things we're seeing that contra being what people think is going on. We see a lot of interest in cities in terms of quick share and people looking not necessarily booking, but there's plenty of people looking at travel to cities and other things. So I think it's I think the looking is not yet indicative of a pattern of booking, but there's tons of interest for sure."

And to the first part, I think, yes, there's lots of stories in the panels of those of us who play in the world of Google, et cetera, of being de-ranked things and a lot of learning has gone into that. Obviously, we'll have to watch that as we roll it out. But I think you shouldn't think of this necessarily as a peanut butter approach, not all lodging is sort of parallel. So if someone's looking for a hotel to people in Paris, offering them an apartment for 10 people, not necessarily a solution or a house in south of France. So I think there will be different solutions. I think we're working through what the consumer experience should be. Some of our competitors have done well putting those things next to each other. But again, it's particularly when they can sort of match up relatively the use case, so the small apartment versus the small hotel room. 
When -- right now, Vrbo is largely oriented towards the whole home experience, mostly in secondary places, vacation places, et cetera. So it's really a question of as you get those opportunities, and you want to go to the beach somewhere, how do those things line up, how does the product reveal it in an attractive way and not confuse the consumer, et cetera. So it's really an end-to-end so we have to do, which is what -- how does the consumer want to digest it? How can we service the right things for them? And then how do we give them the benefit of the information and the service and all the things one might be used to in a home rental that are different when you rent a hotel room essentially. So there's a lot of work going into that. I don't have an absolute answer for you, except we know that there is demand. We know that there's a question of getting discovery in places where we don't have brands. We know there is demand from our B2B partners. So we know there's opportunity, but we still have work to do to make sure the consumer experience makes sense."

It could equally take the form of being part of a broader template where we power everything in our rewards program, and that's flights and conventional and alternative right now because the alternative product has not been strong even in our own OTAs. We just don't have a product offering that's particularly compelling for our B2B partners. So that's coming as we build the flexibility into our platform and as we master the alternative accommodations on our own OTAs. We just see it as the opportunity space."

I think we've gotten through the stabilization, and we're in that recovery phase, if you will, and call it, the early innings of that. So I do think that we feel like we're in a great position, as mentioned, with the $3.4 billion, plus the $2 billion on the revolver. But I -- from a capital allocation standpoint, I want to make sure that we can invest behind our brands and feel comfortable we'll be able to take whatever level of risk we decide to do so that we can be relevant in that recovery and be in that conversation with consumers. 
When it comes to the debt side of the house, which you didn't ask, obviously, we paid the $650 million off of the revolver to get that back up to the $2 billion. But at this point, I would say we're in that recovery phase, and not obviously looking to return capital. But down the line, I suspect we will want to take down our debt, get back to investment grade, all the good things we've talked about in previous quarters. And then we could talk about how do we think about returning capital. 
Now more specifically on your question on M&A, I would say we're more in an opportunistic posture at this moment. We've got a strong legacy in M&A as a company, as you will know. We are certainly out and having conversations and seeing what might be opportunistic, if you will. But right now, I would say we're primarily focused on ourselves and making sure that we get our data platform right. We got our marketing right, we can invest behind the business."

And then on the Vrbo question, Google VR was not particularly significant. And we concluded that it was not additive, which is why we made the move we made. And so it's not -- it wasn't like we set a substantial part of our business and just took a shot across the value. We just believed that it was not a particularly critical piece of our business, and we're not adding value, and we made a decision."

So I would say on the listing side, we and our competitors have a fair amount of exclusivity. Sometimes that's because of geography, sometimes that's because of tight, it's a bunch of different things that drive it. We're not spending a huge amount of time trying to figure out how to just make our inventory entirely exclusive. We're trying to spend our time building the category. I think that's probably broadly true for them as well. 
As far as increasing inventory, hasn't been a particularly great market for doing that between home turnover, between people living in their second homes and other things. It's been a challenging time. We have seen some compression in certain markets that we serve, and we are focused on expanding inventory in those places. But because of the challenges broadly in the market, we haven't just been really knowing trying to grow supply all over the place. So we are focused on the places where we know there's lots of demand, where we know there's compression as a first order of business. And over time, as the market normalizes and we see an opportunity to attract good quality content, we'll be back in the market doing that. As far as far as the tech stack goes on marketing, we're making lots of progress every day. Are we where we want to be yet? No. Are we going as fast as we think we can? Yes. And we're making improvements every day. So I think, again, converting all of our brands to one common tech stack, one common set of data, one common set of analytics, is a big list. We've been doing it throughout this crisis, and we're still doing it. And -- but we are beginning to reap real benefits. And I think at the time, I think you said now that we're coming out of it, I'm not sure how to measure that. But if we are indeed coming out of it, it's probably not going to take 10 months or 3 weeks. It's going to take a while over the course of this year. I'm sure we'll be coming out of it, and hopefully, we'll be back to some more normal level. And I hope we will be in a good place in terms of the tech stack. We are a long way ahead of where we were and we will continue to make progress every day. So it depends when that recovery comes, but we're making really good progress. 
And I think that's it. So again, thank you all for your time. I hope you all stay safe. Hopefully, we can all get back to traveling soon. You probably miss it as much as we do and look forward to talking to you again, so take care."

Thank you for joining us. I'll be fairly brief as the fourth quarter, of course, kind of reflected what the rest of the year looked like and so much as it was a bumpy ride.

I'll be fairly brief as the fourth quarter, of course, kind of reflected what the rest of the year looked like and so much as it was a bumpy ride. COVID news dominated, of course, everything in travel. And I would say that we saw a mixed world of some optimism coming from the vaccine rollouts beginning mixed with obviously very bad news on case loads across the globe, closures in many countries, restrictions all over the various geographies. 
So with that as the background, we're happy to turn the page on the year and move into '21. I will say that on the whole, as you saw in our release, booking trends in the fourth quarter pretty much near the third quarter at about down 60% for total gross lodging bookings, net of cancellations. That did moderate towards the holiday season and the end of the quarter, and we saw that moderate into the high 50s down. And that has -- that improvement has seemed to continue through January. And in the latter part of January, we've seen down in the high 40s. 
So the trends are generally good, although very bad overall, going in the right direction. But I would caution everybody that we continue to expect it to be bumpy as this is a story of a thousand different geographies and a thousand different fact sets around the virus and, of course, vaccine rollouts, et cetera. 
We did see that improvement overall, driven by Vrbo, not a big surprise. That continues to be a terrific use case with the whole home market being very attractive, family travel being very attractive in that form. And North America generally has been a relative bright spot, of course. Our relative strength in North America certainly helps us in that. 
So we continue to hope and expect the vaccine rollout to drive consumer confidence and drive things forward. But we certainly are not trying to predict what consumer sentiment will be as the buyers changes over the ensuing months. So we continue to expect a bumpy ride. We are watching for what governments are doing, what the rules may be on international travel or things like travel passports, et cetera, with the goal just of making that process as seamless as we can for our travelers and getting people back moving again. We know there's a lot of pent-up demand, and we certainly want to serve it as much as we can. 
With that market background in mind, in the fourth quarter, we were investing more heavily in marketing. This was intended to get ahead of what we thought would be the coming demand from the vaccine rollouts, but it was largely focused certainly on the upper funnel brand marketing side on Vrbo, where we knew there was a lot of momentum. And as I've said before on these calls, we are using this moment to try to drive as much brand recognition and long-term value into the brand over time. So we pushed into Vrbo. 
On the performance marketing side, which we view as more of a quick twitch muscle. We have continued to be relatively conservative. Again, we saw lots of closures happen across the globe. Those closures drive massive cancellation spikes. And they can make performance marketing very unattractive very quickly when it goes the wrong way. So we have been relatively conservative. 
And in that vein, we have actually removed Vrbo from Google's vacation rental meta product. Again, our focus is as much as possible on driving direct traffic, driving incremental profitability from all our performance marketing. And as we see opportunity to remove unprofitable activities, we do that. And as we leg back into a more normal market, we think we'll be able to drive more into the upper funnel, more direct traffic and be much more calculated in performance marketing. 
On the rest of the marketing side, and this is really about brand differentiation and geographic differentiation, I've talked about this before, but we continue to focus on driving whatever brands make sense, wherever they are in the globe. So for example, we have leaned heavily into our Wotif brand in Australia, a company we bought years ago. It's a very strong domestic brand in Australia, particularly associated with domestic travel, which has been the primary use case. And we're seeing good reaction from the market by doing that. And we are looking at that everywhere. That goes for Vrbo as well, which is not a global brand. It has strength particularly in North America, but there are parts of Europe where we have other brands that are stronger. Australia, we have another brand called Stayz that's stronger. So we are leaning into those and seeing good growth across all our alternate accommodation brands in our strong markets. 
Longer term, I would just point out that, in addition to driving that brand neutrality, if you will, we are also intending to drive alternative accommodations through our OTA brands. We haven't -- we've been saying that for a long time. We are now highly focused on doing it. It's not ready to roll yet. We do, do it, but it is not -- the consumer experience is not yet where we want it, but we are highly focused on driving that in the future. And that will be the way we attack markets where we don't have an existing Vrbo or other alternative accommodation brand. 
And then finally, we continue to do work on the marketing side on just brand differentiation and segmenting the market. And Brand Expedia, our biggest pool of OTA brand, will be rolling out in the spring with a new campaign focused on essentially the complete trip. Brand Expedia is the most complete OTA, and we are going to focus on people who are trying to book multiple things, more complex trips. We think there's a big opportunity there. And the brand has not sufficiently landed that message over the years. So we are optimistic about our new approach to that. 
On the other side of the house and perhaps the most important place we are investing our time, energy and calories, which we've talked about frequently, is the tech platform. That continues to be a key focus of ours. I just want to point out, this is an area froth with opportunity for us. It will be years of mining that opportunity. 2021 is an important year where we expect to have significant delivery on important steps forward on simplifying our tech platform. And we are keenly focused on that, along with being focused on turning ourselves into a Tier 1 tech company and looking for and building systems to find and retain and recruit great talent and retain our great talent that we have and build Tier 1 tech enterprise that focuses keenly on solving consumer problems and our business partner problems. And we think we're well on our way to that. 
And finally, I'll end with something that's a little less easy to calculate by revenue or margin, but I think it's equally critical to the success of our enterprise going forward, which is that at the tail end of this year, we re-landed, reset our company mission, purpose and values with an emphasis on travel being a force for good, bringing people together, broadening horizons and strengthening connections. And we think, obviously, in this time and place that the U.S. and the world is in, that is obviously an important role we play in the world. But we want to bring that to everything we do, everything we do in the product,and really express that through the experience. 
And in doing that, we also acknowledged as a company that what we do has impacts on the environment, and we are refocusing ourselves on effects that travel creates on the environment, particularly and initially around tools and information to help our travelers and help our suppliers make better choices to help drive better outcomes for the environment so that's an important push for us. 
And then finally, we've made some bold, ambitious goals for ourselves around diversity and inclusion in terms of our workforce. And it really goes beyond our workforce because we really want to express that through travel as well. There are many people who have challenges in having successful travel outcomes. We have not done enough to help all people in that. And we want to drive that through everything we do every time we roll a product out, every time we think about building a product and the consumer experience. And we intend to drive that through the business. 
So with that, I'll just close by saying expect things to be bumpy for a while. I don't think this is linear, what we've been going through. And I don't think we should expect it to become linear. We are optimistic that when consumer confidence comes back, when people feel confident that the vaccine rollout is going well, that they will be able to travel. We clearly see demand, and I think we're just going to power through it. And when consumers are ready to travel, we're going to be there. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Eric. Thank you."

Thank you, also, for joining the call as well. Coming into 2020, we've talked a lot about driving margin expansion as being one of our key priorities, and we're pleased to have made significant progress in a number of areas along those fronts. 
The first I want to touch on is on a fixed cost basis. We talked since start of the year a range of $300 million to $500 million. We upped that during the year last year and then upped it to $700 million to $750 million range. We now believe that we will be at the higher end of that $700 million to $750 million range for fixed cost savings relative to our 2019 exit rate. We have achieved approximately $675 million on a run rate basis. And we expect to realize largely all of the cost savings by the end of 2021. 
As mentioned previously, when projecting for, do keep in mind that we will have annual increases and  expect to invest in areas of the business where we see attractive opportunities as well. 
On the variable cost of revenue side, we remain on track for over $200 million in annual savings based on 2019 volume levels. The 3 key drivers are improved economics through our payments platform, expansion of our conversations costs and lower variable cloud costs as well. Similar to the fixed cost initiatives, we expect to realize largely all of these variable cost savings by the end of 2021. Although given the costs are volume-based, the savings will not be fully evident until we reach more normalized business levels. 
Shifting to our Q4 results. I wanted to start by providing details on 2 onetime items that distorted our P&L and reduced adjusted EBITDA by approximately $65 million. 
First, we recognized approximately $125 million of contra revenue related to third-party travel insurance due primarily to higher pandemic-related cancellations. We restructured our commercial terms and recorded the expense in Q4 so that we will not impact our unit economics of those products and also our P&L going forward. Excluding this impact, the Q4 revenue decline improved by 4% to 62% year-over-year. We continue to believe insurance products are a key part of our offer and also provide terrific customer experience and protection for them going forward to continue to -- we plan to continue to invest in that area. And when you look at 2020, the insurance line of business was profitable despite the adjustment that we made and despite substantially less revenue. 
The second onetime change was a favorable adjustment to personnel costs. Given the impact to our business in 2020, we decided to shift cash bonuses, which we accrued at 50% throughout the year to equity this year for the vast majority of our employees. As a result, in Q4, we reversed approximately $60 million of bonus expense that accrued in the first 3 quarters of the year. The related cash savings will come in Q1 of 2021 when bonuses are typically paid. 
We recognize the majority of this bonus benefit and overhead expenses. Excluding the bonus accrual reversal, overhead expenses declined 31% year-over-year in Q4, similar to the year-over-year decline in Q3. The bonus reversal had minimal impact on cost of revenue, which declined 47%, and the disposal of Bodybuilding.com provided approximately a 5% benefit. 
Moving generally on to bonuses. We also made the strategic decision this quarter to shift our compensation structure away from annual cash bonuses going forward with the vast majority of our fully funded annual bonus program being converted to salary. We anticipate approximately $50 million in extra quarterly payroll costs starting in Q2 of 2020 relative to Q1 2020, mainly due to this change. 
Moving on to marketing efficiency. We have been investing more in brand spend, Peter mentioned that, to drive direct traffic at the top of the funnel, while at the same time, operating at higher ROI in variable channels. We believe this approach, along with the benefits of unifying all of our retail marketing data and technology, will enable us to be much more strategic in how we balance volume, profitability in both the short and the long term. 
As Peter mentioned, we leaned particularly heavily into additional brand marketing to Vrbo to take advantage of the demand in alternative accommodations, and we have continued to prudently weigh back into performance marketing, where we see demand. Overall, the efficiency initiatives we've executed during COVID will enable us to emerge from the disruption leaner, faster and with improved margins. 
In total, adjusted EBITDA was negative $160 million in Q4. And when normalizing for the 2 nonrecurring items I just walked through, it was negative $95 million. 
On to free cash flow. It is typically negative for us in Q4 due to seasonality of our profit and working capital and as such was negative this quarter as well, Q4 as well, 513 negative -- negative $513 million on a reported basis. 
Moving on to cash. We ended the year with total unrestricted cash and short-term investments of $3.4 billion, which is about $1 billion lower than we ended Q3. During the quarter, we repaid the remaining $650 million outstanding on our revolver which accounted for the majority of the change in cash. We head into 2021 in a strong liquidity position, with the $3.4 billion in cash and an essentially untaxed $2 billion revolver. As the business recovers over the next few years, we remain committed to deleveraging back to our historical capital structure. 
Turning to 2021. While we remain optimistic about the vaccines and look forward to travel recovering, as Peter mentioned, visibility on what the recovery will look like and near-term trends remain low at this point. Given the current trends and typical seasonality, we do expect a significant adjusted EBITDA loss in the quarter. As a reminder, Q1 is historically the lowest revenue and profit quarter of the year. 
In terms of 2021 forecasting, just to give you a bit of insight on costs, overhead costs are the part of the P&L where we have the most visibility. We expect overhead costs in Q1 to be similar to Q4 before the impact of changes to the bonus accrual. We expect overhead in Q2 to step up by approximately $50 million, principally due to the shift away from bonus compensation that I mentioned earlier and a lapping of temporary COVID-related savings from 2020. 
In closing, while there is considerable uncertainty remaining on what the recovery will look like, we feel good about where we are from a margin expansion. We feel good about our liquidity position. And we're confident that we're taking the right steps to accelerate in the recovery. 
With that, thank you, and Katrina, we're ready for our first question."

We do believe, though, that in time, that can be an important part of the business, particularly when you think about markets where Expedia or Hotels.com or any of our OTAs might have strong brands, but Vrbo is basically nonpresence as a brand. So we think that's a scenario where being able to pipe that through is really valuable. We think even in markets where they overlap, there can be use cases where customers are coming into Expedia or another brand and could absolutely want an alternative accommodation and want to see that option revealed as against hotel and other kinds of options. 
And then I would just add that -- well, you didn't ask it, I think there's -- we believe there's a big opportunity for alternative accommodations through our B2B partners, which it is not currently really piped to do. So those are all opportunities to continue to expand on the alternative space and I think to take advantage of what we have in terms of supply, but what we don't necessarily have on the brand side to drive it in certain markets."

And then with respect to Vrbo, you guys used to break it out separately, and then more recently, you've been consolidating.

First of all, the -- I would say the lion's share of the improvement, yes, is due to strength in North America compared to other places. I mean it is a tale of many stories, and different markets have come back at different rates. But I would say in terms of any big drivers, North America has generally retained more willingness to move around, people engaging in more travel. Less -- we haven't had government shutdowns in the way that we have in other places. So yes, I would say North America is probably the bulk of the story over that month or so. 
The -- to your second question, no, we don't intend to break it out, not because we don't want to make all of your lives easier but because we believe it's one business. Essentially, as I mentioned about piping Vrbo content through the OTAs, we view this as if another product that a traveler will want. It's not -- obviously, it's having a great moment. And we're glad that we own it, and we believe we can ride some of the success travelers being exposed to the product type in a new way. But we view it collectively, and we view it as one business that we're driving whatever the best outcome for the consumers and driving that outcome across all lines of business. So we think this separation has been artificial effectively, and we're not planning to report it that way in the future."

I think we're all aligned and hoping and working towards helping them come out of it. We've renewed a number of agreements without much debate. 
And I think our focus has been really on doing more to help the hotelier, as you alluded to, through data. But some of the examples include things like optimized distribution, which we've talked about before where we essentially become the wholesale distribution point for a number of hotels. We've done this with a few chains now. And that gives us an opportunity to help them clean up the marketplace, where they might have a wholesale market that is perhaps being abused by some players and driving the wrong outcomes for them. And with our technology and with our approach, we can help clean that up for them. And we think that's a net positive for both of us. 
Similarly, we have been sharing more data. We're working hard on new tools to provide more data to drive real-time decision-making for hoteliers so that they can optimize revenue in better ways. And of course, we're doing our part to try to drive and improve the product so that we can sell higher value rooms, room types, up-sell product, et cetera, so that we can help drive ADRs and overall revenue. 
So there's a lot of work going on. I think we're tightly aligned in wanting the hotel to come out and be successful. I think the hotels understand and appreciate the role we play in a rebound. And it's been quite a good environment and good relationships all around, and we're all working hard to try to rebuild the market."

Thanks for the questions, Lloyd. I think morale is quite good. I think people are energized. I think in the early days, there was fear of survival and all those kinds of things. We're long past that. I think we are trying to drive a performance culture, a culture that gets a lot done. And we've shrunk the company considerably in terms of manpower. So people are working hard. People are tackling big issues. 
This replatforming of our entire tech stack, it's a big undertaking, and there's a ton of work going on there. There's a ton of work going on with suppliers, as we just talked about; ton of work going on for the customer. So I think morale is quite good. We're trying to build a culture where people who want to win and want to thrive feel inspired to do their best work. And I think that's what we're doing. Does that appeal to everybody? Maybe not, but that is what we're driving. And I think there's a lot of energy behind that. 
So I would say morale is good. People are engaged. People feel good about our new mission and our purpose, and I think we're all aligned behind that. 
As far as the performance goes, and Eric, jump in, if you want to as well. But I would say, we're very sharp-minded about it in the sense that we're happy to invest in anything that drives incremental profitability, good revenue and good profits. And we're not keen to kind of continue on a path of just continuing where investment was not productive. So we didn't find investment in the Google VR product particularly incremental. We didn't think the customer experience was particularly valuable. And we are, of course, also in a period where we're seeing great direct traffic for Vrbo. So we found other ways and, in our view, more profitable ways to drive traffic. 
As far as the rest of performance marketing goes and performance marketing for hotels and meta, et cetera, the different products for the consumer, it's a different proposition and clearly has historically had value for the consumer. I think we feel like we will continue to play at it. I think we will continue to improve at it. 
I've talked before about how we've smashed together our performance marketing teams, where we're wiring all the data streams. We're pushing towards multi-brand algorithms and things we haven't done before. So we think we're going to get much better at it in terms of being able to optimize for the portfolio and continue to use it hopefully very effectively. 
But right now, there are no -- I wouldn't say there are big tectonic shifts in what we're seeing as to how we would apply that money other than we're going to be very clinical about it in terms of looking for and driving the best veins of profitability we can, wherever they are."

And just on the marketing as a percent of revenue, just to touch on that, we're not at this point solving for a specific percentage. Ultimately, we're in this COVID period. And so we're, as we talked about, waiting prudently into performance channels and then investing in brand where we think it's appropriate, particularly on Vrbo. 
But as Peter mentioned, there's just a ton of work that's going on, for example, in performance channels, leveraging our overall data, multi-brand bidding, as Peter just mentioned, but ultimately trying to understand as well lifetime value and incrementality as well. And so those are new muscles, in particular, given the scale -- the way we're running the business now and the scale of the data that we're aggregating together. So I think there's more to learn there. 
And then on the brand side, that just has a very different profile than performance in that it has longer return periods. And so we're confident to invest behind the brands, obviously doing that behind Vrbo. We expect to do that even more in some of our other brands as we narrow in on specific value propositions in line of product behind those and then the marketing associated as well. 
So a long-winded way of saying we don't have a specific percentage that we're solving for now. But we're certainly spending a lot of time trying to improve on the marketing side and the value proposition and related marketing."

And so by and large, the blending towards that. We have seen some improvement in conventional lodging, again, particularly in North America.

But what we've seen is Vrbo elongate again and look much more like we would have expected to see in any other year, which gets back to the summer bookings that Peter is mentioning. 
And so I suspect -- we know there's pent-up demand. People want to travel. And I think people have confidence that they're going to be able to travel at least domestically using the U.S. as an example. And so they're starting to book those summer months now."

If '21 starts to look more normal, which it seems to be doing, then we'll start to see that expand again. And I think in that vein, you may see us investing in capturing that demand even if that demand is not staying for some time. 
And so you may see some dislocation, I would expect, or bumpiness in the numbers in terms of when the marketing spend is versus when the revenue recognition is, but we certainly don't plan to be back on our heels. We -- as I mentioned, we have a strong campaign that we're working on for Brand Expedia. We've got -- we've certainly consistently stating we'll stay in the Vrbo upper funnel work on brand; Hotels.com, the same.

I'll take that one first and then me come back to the other question. But I would say, to be specific in the question, in alternative accommodations in our strong markets, we believe we have seen very good share and share growth relative to our competition. But I would say, overall, each of -- we and our main competitors have different [ awards ] and different good guys. We have a very good guy with Vrbo and the use case and where we have supply and where people are wanting to travel. 
But conversely we also and conventionalizing have a heavy -- a strong presence in major cities and international travel, both of which obviously have been hurt equally. I could point to any one of our competitors who has the inversion of that and has -- is better in secondary cities, et cetera, maybe better in alternative accommodations in markets where we don't even have a presence. Some of those markets have shut, some of those markets are strong. It's a tale of many stories. 
So I think as it comes to share, we think we're doing well, where we're strong, certainly in alternative accommodations and overall in North America. But there are certainly competitors who have better solutions for certain use cases, and they're seeing benefit from that. So I think it's really -- I would caution anybody to get too excited about share one way or the other during this because the dislocation really creates a bunch of unique stories. And you can -- I would think one could get fooled by a trend that's not a trend. It's just a moment of how people are using travel right now. So -- but we have gained and we're happy about that and -- in our strongest markets and, in particular, in VR. 
I think your other question was on traffic. The answer is we see a lot of booking. It's not entirely clear that it's all for the summer or for -- which -- not -- I don't think there's anything that tells you there's something specific people are searching for, for specific timezone. But we are seeing interest in the holidays already at the end of next -- at the end of this year. It's still relatively small, but stronger than it had been a year ago. 
We're seeing trends like that. Some are very strong in alternatives are still highly muted in conventional lodging. And I would just say there are a lot of things we're seeing that contra being what people think is going on. We see a lot of interest in cities in terms of quick share and people looking -- not necessarily booking, but there's plenty of people looking to travel to cities and other things. So I think it's -- I think that the looking is not yet indicative of a pattern of booking, but there's tons of interest for sure."

So Peter, maybe go back in history a little bit. I think part of the pain point for Vrbo in the past when it was a public company was to make sure you don't get de-ranked in the search results because of duplicative content, I think as you try to integrate, say, Abritel's inventory onto Homeaway.com or Vrbo.com. So as you work to integrate the Vrbo content itself onto your OTA properties, is a potential traffic loss or degradation something that we need to worry about in the future? 
And I guess, what do you think you need to do to address from a consumer experience standpoint for that seamless integration of inventory, so that to the consumer, they are more willing to pick either/or or maybe more the alternative accommodations on Brand Expedia?"

And to the first part, I think, yes, there's lots of stories in the panels of those of us who play in the world of Google, et cetera, of being de-ranked and things and a lot of learnings gone into that. Obviously, we'll have to watch that as we roll it out. 
But I think you shouldn't think of this necessarily as a peanut butter approach. Not all lodging is sort of parallel. So if someone's looking for a hotel to people in Paris, offering them an apartment for 10 people, not necessarily a solution or a house in south of France. So I think there will be different solutions. I think we're working through what the consumer experience should be. Some of our competitors have done well putting those things next to each other. But again, it's particularly when they can sort of match up relatively the use case, so the small apartment versus the small hotel room. 
When -- right now, Vrbo is largely oriented towards the whole home experience mostly in secondary places, vacation places, et cetera. So it's really a question of as you get those opportunities and you want to go to the beach somewhere, how do those things line up, how does the product reveal it in an attractive way and not confuse the consumer, et cetera. So it's really an end-to-end. So we have to do, which is what -- how does the consumer want to digest it, how can we service the right things for them and then how do we give them the benefit of the information and the service and all the things one might be used to in a home rental that are different when you rent a hotel room essentially. 
So there's a lot of work going into that. I don't have an absolute answer for you, except we know that there is demand. We know that there's a question of getting discovery in places where we don't have brands. We know there is demand from our B2B partners. So we know there's opportunity, but we still have work to do to make sure the consumer experience makes sense."

So there's no reason we can't take a brand like Stayz in Australia and drive that through. And there is no little benefit to absolutely turning it into Vrbo. 
That being said, there are some markets where we have converted to Vrbo, and we are going to invest behind that brand. And we'll do that in some places as well. So I think you'll see a combination of places where Vrbo is the right answer. You'll see a few places where we're content to use some strong local, long-dated brands that have real brand awareness and stickiness. And then as I say, we'll use our other OTA brands and other things to drive it in places where neither exists and where we don't think it's worth trying to start a brand from scratch."

From a flexibility standpoint, that's certainly something that's top of mind for us. I don't think it necessarily dips into insurance itself. But of course, we've looked at the terms associated with those, and those have been modified relative to the situation that we're in, i.e., whether you have COVID or been exposed and so on and so forth. And so there's adjustments that have been made to those policies to make them relevant.

And -- but we believe when we can do it, there will be significant demand opportunities in those vectors. 
So it could take the form of a white label product in certain kinds of circumstances. It could equally take the form of being part of a broader template where we power everything in our rewards program, and that's flights and conventional and alternative. Right now, because the alternative product has not been strong even in our own OTAs, we just don't have a product offering that's particularly compelling for our B2B partners. So that's coming as we build the flexibility into our platform and as we master the alternative accommodations on our own OTAs. We just see it as an opportunity in the space."

I can take the first part, Peter, which is, I think our focus continues to be for the moment on stabilization and recovery. I think we've gotten through the stabilization, and we're in that recovery phase, if you will, and call it, the early innings of that. So I do think that we feel like we're in a great position, as mentioned, with the $3.4 billion plus the $2 billion on the revolver. 
But I -- from a capital allocation standpoint, I want to make sure that we can invest behind our brands and feel comfortable we'll be able to take whatever level of risk we decide to do so that we can be relevant in that recovery and be in that conversation with consumers. 
When it comes to the debt side of the house, which you didn't ask, obviously, we paid the $650 million off on the revolver to get that back up to the $2 billion. But at this point, I would say we're in that recovery phase and not obviously looking to return capital. But down the line, I suspect we will want to take down our debt, get back to investment grade, all the good things we've talked about in previous quarters. And then we could talk about how do we think about returning capital. 
Now more specifically on your question on M&A, I would say we're more in an opportunistic posture at this moment. We've got a strong legacy in M&A as a company, as you will know. We are certainly out and having conversations and seeing what might be opportunistic, if you will. But right now, I would say we're primarily focused on ourselves and making sure that we get our data platform right, we got our marketing right, we can invest behind the business."

Sometimes that's because of geography, sometimes that's because it's tight. It's a bunch of different things that drive it. We're not spending a huge amount of time trying to figure out how to just -- how to make our inventory entirely exclusive. We're trying to spend our time building the category. I think that's probably broadly true for them as well. 
As far as increasing inventory, it hasn't been a particularly great market for doing that between home turnover, between people living in their second homes and other things. It's been a challenging time. We have seen some compression in certain markets that we serve, and we are focused on expanding inventory in those places. 
But because of the challenges broadly in the market, we haven't just been willy nilly trying to grow supply all over the place. So we are focused on the places where we know there's lots of demand, where we know there's compression as a first order of business. And over time, as the market normalizes and we see an opportunity to attract good quality content, we'll be back in the market doing that. 
As far as far as the tech stack goes on marketing, we're making lots of progress every day. Are we where we want to be yet? No. Are we going as fast as we think we can? Yes. And we're making improvements every day. So I think, again, converting all of our brands to one common tech stack, one common set of data, one common set of analytics, is a big list. We've been doing it throughout this crisis, and we're still doing it. And -- but we are beginning to reap real benefits. 
And I think by the time,- I think you said now that we're coming out of it, I'm not sure how to measure that. But if we are indeed coming out of it, it's probably not going to take 10 months or 3 weeks. It's going to take a while over the course of this year. I'm sure we'll be coming out of it, and hopefully, we'll be back to some more normal level. And I hope we will be in a good place in terms of the tech stack. We are a long way ahead of where we were and we will continue to make progress every day. So it depends when that recovery comes, but we're making really good progress. 
And I think that's it. So again, thank you all for your time. I hope you all stay safe. Hopefully, we can all get back to traveling soon. You probably miss it as much as we do, and look forward to talking to you again. Take care."

Thank you for joining our call. We have some brief remarks and then we'll take questions.

Thank you for joining our call. We have some brief remarks and then we'll take questions. 
I'll start by talking about the Egencia deal, which we announced a few days ago, that proposed deal is extremely exciting to us. And in a few minutes, Eric will share the details. But I'll just say it really highlights 3 core things we're trying to do. One is find the best opportunity for all our businesses. And in this case, we felt that putting Egencia together with AmEx GBT, created a great new combined corporate enterprise that could focus entirely on the corporate customer. And really provide a best-in-class suite of services to serve those customers. And our ownership in that company, we're very excited to have. 
Secondly, we signed a long-term lodging supply and tech agreement with the company. And you'll recall, we have a big B2B business, Expedia Partner Services. It is core to our strategy long term and driving and powering the industry broadly is an important move for us. So this deal enhances significantly and just gives us more throughput to continue to innovate, both on the supply and technology side to provide great services to the entire travel ecosystem. 
And finally, as we've talked about endlessly in the past year, we are trying to simplify our company, so we can focus on the most important and largest opportunities. And with Egencia in a great new home, should this deal proceed, we will be in a great position to focus on our B2C and B2B businesses and our core technology platform, and that's really a great chance for us to get simpler and get agility and speed in the rest of our core business. 
Moving on to recent trends. I would say, as I've said, travel remains a study in contrast. Those for different geographies, some are still shut down, some like the U.S. are quite open now. And equally, a study in differences between vacation rentals, domestic travel versus international travel, business travel is more challenged, conventional lodging, particularly in big cities is more challenged. So it's really a study in contrast. It depends where you're strongest. We have benefited greatly in our vacation rental business and our domestic U.S. business, but other parts of the business still remain challenged. 
I would say, and many have reported already, but the summer looks strong, particularly in the U.S. and in other markets where vaccinations are well along the way. We are already seeing booking trends well above 2019 levels for leisure destinations, beach, mountains, et cetera. And that goes for not only vacation rentals, but also for conventional lodging. 
To give a little more color on bookings themselves, we said on our last call that we were down somewhere in the high 40% in the gross bookings, net of cancellations in the January period. That has moderated to down around 20% in March and has improved on that in April. So the trends remain strong, again, driven largely by the strongest markets, but still, the trends are very good, and we're excited about that. 
I would just keep in mind, while summer looks great and we are ambitious and feeling good about the overall recovery, that the calendar is still a question mark. We don't know what seasonality will look like as long as COVID is here and the usual trends that might come in the fall and winter are still unknown. So while we're extremely excited about summer, it's a little too early to predict how those trends like work-from-home, whether school is in session, et cetera, will change travel behavior going into the following quarters. 
On the Vrbo front and VacationRentals, in general, we continue to lean into that business. We have grown share in all our strongest markets and invested heavily in marketing and in acquiring host, and we feel like that continues to be a great opportunity for us, not just in this moment, but in the future as we capitalize on landing the brand and getting more people to experience Vrbo and staying in VacationRentals. 
We are seeing some compression in summer. People ask about that frequently. And I'll just say, so far, we have seen replacement as a pretty good solution. Most people look for something, if they can't find it, they'll find something nearby. And increasingly, as more people are vaccinated, they are willing and happy to stay in resorts and in conventional lodging, and I would say, some portion of them would actually prefer it that way, and we're seeing in those leisure destinations for the summer, very strong conventional lodging numbers. 
On the marketing side, I've mentioned in past quarters that we have taken a relatively conservative bias on how we've approached marketing. Rather, we have a little money on the table then get too far out over our skis. But I the course of the first quarter, we have sort of changed that bias and moved more, particularly in the back half of the quarter towards investing and getting in front of the wave of demand, we think, is coming. That's taken the form of a number of brand marketing rollouts, including a brand-new Expedia Brand marketing campaign that started at the Academy awards. We've relaunched our Orbitz brand with a focus on LGBTQIA+, and that's sort of, again, a push as we try to differentiate brands and really focus each brand on who their market is. And later this month, we have a great new summer ad campaign coming for Vrbo that we think will be really impactful. 
So that investment in brand building is really important to us. We've talked before about going up funnel, creating that brand love, pushing for direct interactions, direct consumption. But keep in mind, it's not a quick Twitch tool like performance marketing, so we have to invest over time to build that. But we think it does have returns ultimately for Performance marketing as the brands become more well-loved and more highly thought of. 
We are starting to see wins. I've talked at someone in the past about combining our performance marketing teams. They've been doing Yeoman's work and a terrific job. We've actually put in a new leader who came from the outside, and there's a great new addition to the team. But I just wanted to -- I've said that before, I want to give one stat to give you a sense of the acceleration we're finally starting to get which is that 75% of our SEM spend is now on a new consolidated technical and data platform. And just for a point of reference, at the end of last year, that was at 15%. So it is starting to accelerate. We're starting to get the wins we hope to get as we combine these plans. And as we invest more and get more aggressive and we're getting these wins, we're seeing our click share go back to historic levels or higher in our main products and our key markets. 
We continue to refine our marketing spend in general, and we will continue to test and learn, and there will be balancing as we learn. But I will say, we mentioned last time on our last call that we went off the Google meta product for VacationRentals. And actually, over this last quarter, we have pulled back from other vacation rental meta players and so far, the results have been excellent and as good or better than we could have hoped for in terms of the returns we have seen in getting more direct trapping and traffic other ways more efficiently. So

using it to adapt and improve the customer experience to the specific customer journey. [indiscernible] opportunity for conversion and improving the business. But most of all, it's a great opportunity to improve the experience for the customer and make it easier for them to find what they want. And in a related point, we're also using AI and telemetry data to track customer experience, to track friction points and again, focus on taking that friction out of the customer experience and making it great. So these are first-tier technologies that the best e-commerce companies in the world use, and we are now using it to make our consumer experiences better. And it's really exciting, right for the business, but in many ways, even more exciting that we can drive customer love and a better customer experience. 
And so finally, I'd just say, we are clearly benefiting from our relative strength in some of the best markets, BR, the U.S., et cetera. But it's a bumpy ride, and we're hoping for reopenings. I would say the announcement about New York City. You'll remember, we're very strong in big cities and in international travel, neither of which have been doing well, but the announcement about New York open up hopefully, some international travel between EMEA and the U.S. this summer will start to open even more as we go forward. 
And I'd just like to say, it's nice to report that we're making progress, but we are mindful of our friends and colleagues and everybody really in India. We have a big operation in India. We've got many sick colleagues and family members, and our thoughts are with them every day. And whatever the world can do to help, we are doing everything we can to help, but we all should do more. And I would finally say that's a reminder that this is an unpredictable time. We still don't know what's happening in many markets. Anything could happen, things could get worse before they get better, but we are optimistic. We are seeing a lot of improvement across the globe, and we are feeling good about the work we're doing at the company. 
So with that, I'll just say, hopefully, vaccines continue to roll out. Hopefully, you all have your vaccines and tell everybody you know to get a vaccine. And we have little doubt that as that continues, the world will open up and travel will come rolling back. So with that, I will pass it off to Eric."

We are very excited about the deal, and I'm optimistic about the success we would see from the",1109,"Thanks, Peter. 
I'd like to start by providing more details on the binding offer we received from AmEx GBT to acquire Egencia. I echo Peter's earlier comments. We are very excited about the deal, and I'm optimistic about the success we would see from the combined company. Now which includes 2 major pieces. First, we have approximately 14% ownership in the combined business, presuming close, which we currently estimate is valued at approximately $750 million. Second, we would also enter into a 10-year lodging supply agreement between AmEx GBT and EPS. As Peter mentioned earlier, and then to put this commercial deal into perspective, the supply agreement would have generated in excess of $60 million in EBITDA at 2019 volumes. We anticipate the proposed deal would close in 9 to 12 months. 
Next, I wanted to provide an update on our cost-saving initiatives. In 2020, we made considerable progress on rightsizing our cost base, and these efforts continued in Q1. We still expect to be towards the higher end of our $700 million to $750 million range for fixed cost savings relative to our 2019 exit rate, and we have now achieved approximately $700 million on a run rate basis. We remain confident we will realize largely all of those targets cost savings by the end of 2021. 
As we have spoken about previously, when looking forward, we will have annual increases in the remaining cost basis from items like annual comp increases and we expect to invest in areas of the business where we see attractive opportunities. 
On variable cost of revenue, we remain on track for over $200 million in annual savings based on 2019 volume levels. As a reminder, the 3 key drivers are improved economics through our payments platform, expansion of our conversations platform to reduce customer service costs and lower variable cloud costs. Similar to these initiatives, we still expect to realize largely all of these variable cost savings by the end of 2021. Although given the costs are volume-based, the savings will not be fully evident until we reach more normalized business levels. 
We've also spoken in the past about driving marketing efficiencies. 
[Audio Gap]
And we've continued to make improvements in Q1 and we also expect a further increase in Q2 as we look to further capitalize on the pace of travel recovery, particularly within the U.S. As a reminder, we incur the marketing expense in the quarter it occurs, but we don't realize any associated lodging revenue until the stay actually happens. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we are investment-grade rated today, and as the recovery continues to unfold, we remain committed to delevering back to more historical leverage levels, while also continuing to reduce our cost of capital. Our ultimate goal of being in a strong position -- to be in a strong position to restart our capital return program to shareholders, as we talked about the early part of last year. To that end, we recently took advantage of compelling market conditions and raised $1 billion in 10-year unsecured notes, which have a coupon of 2.95% and $1 billion in 0 coupon 5-year convertible debt with a 72.5% conversion premium. Together, we used the proceeds of the new debt issuances to redeem $1.7 billion and debt due in 2025 at coupons of 7% and 6.25%. This will yield approximately $80 million in annual interest rate savings. 
From a liquidity standpoint, we have $4.3 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments, which is about $1 billion higher than we ended Q4, with the increase primarily due to positive free cash flow. We also have essentially $2 billion in untapped revolver capacity. As it relates to deferred merchant bookings, it has improved in each quarter since the height of the pandemic and with a total of $6 billion at the end of Q1. 
We have witnessed positive recent trends and are cautiously optimistic about the pace and shape of the recovery. We are also confident in our liquidity position. And therefore, we have elected to pay down 50% of the preferred stock issued in 2020 later this month. And as a reminder, regarding the preferred stock, we also have the ability to pay off that balance at any time when we book to do so and is something that we'll be watching over the coming months. 
Now shifting to the P&L. Total revenue was down 52% versus first quarter of 2019, which was a notable improvement from last quarter, with revenue down approximately 62% year-on-year. And that's normalized for the insurance contra revenue impact that occurred in Q4 of 2020 that we spoke about last quarter. Overhead expenses totaled approximately $500 million in Q1 and came in slightly better than anticipated due to some timing benefits. As a reminder, we define overhead as G&A, tech and content, indirect sales and marketing, while excluding stock-based compensation. 
Moving on, we made a change during Q1 in managing our software licensing and maintenance costs, which led to a modest reclassification to prior results, we have moved from a decentralized approach, which we've talked about previously, where each individual team manages their own spend, which resulted in increased costs and duplicative tools to a much more centralized approach across EG. In 2020, the change resulted in approximately $60 million in costs being reallocated to tech and content, with the majority coming from cost of sales and the remainder from sales and marketing and G&A. There was no change to total costs or EBITDA from this reclassification. In total, adjusted EBITDA was negative $58 million for the quarter, which was slightly better than our expectations. On an absolute basis, adjusted EBITDA was down approximately $235 million versus Q1 2019, while revenue was down approximately $1.4 billion over the same time period. 
On the free cash flow, which totaled $2 billion in Q1 on a reported basis. If you exclude the change in restricted cash, which is primarily driven by Vrbo deferred merchant bookings, free cash flow was approximately $800 million. Looking forward, we mentioned it last quarter, we do expect our overhead cost to step up by approximately $50 million sequentially and from Q1 to Q2 of this year relative to the bonus payments and other issues we talked about last quarter. 
In closing, I continue to be very encouraged by the recent trends within the business, have increasingly confidence in our liquidity position, given the change that we just made, especially in paying down the preferred. But we remain cautiously optimistic about further improvements in travel recovery as we head throughout the rest of the year. 
Operator, we are ready for our first question."

That is our entire business collectively, not just the U.S. The U.S. is stronger for sure, helping that number up. But that -- those are global numbers. As for beyond the cost structure, I'd say we're doing tons of work, and I'll start by, unfortunately, reiterating all the work we're doing on the marketing side, the work we're doing to simplify and combine our performance marketing team, tools, capabilities, data analytics, that's a huge benefit for us as we go into the post -- into the future into the post COVID and our ability to compete in the performance channels in the most effective ways. We believe we can do better and do more on the brand building side and to create that direct customer relationship. And then that bleeds all the way down through, of course, the importance of doing the product right, getting the engagement right, improving the apps, improving the technology, using AI to improve the customer experience. So all of those things are the classic sort of virtuous cycle of can you get them in the door, can you make them love you, do it -- is the experience great, does it help them find what they want. So there's a ton of work. All that work I talked about on the platform side is not about efficiencies, although it does create efficiencies. What it really creates is agility and the ability to serve the customer better and create a stronger tie to that customer and repeat and loyalty and lifetime value. 
So it's really an exercise in all the pieces, but we are getting sharper on all elements, whether it's the brand proposition for every brand, whether it's the geographic proposition for every geo and brand and then what that customer experience is like all the way to the end, through service. And it's all those pieces. So we're investing across the board in terms of our energy and time. And I think those pieces will start to multiply on themselves as we get more and more of them sort of across the road as it were. So lots of good work going on. Some things are a lot further along than others, but I think you'll continue to see improvement across all those categories."

Thanks, Justin. I'll maybe take the second one first. Yes. I mean, we've spent a fair amount of time getting to a new brand proposition, a bunch of new capabilities and things we wanted to talk to the consumers about and just at the early stages of rolling out our Expedia Brand campaign. That is a heavy brand campaign across multiple markets, and we think it has great opportunity. But to be clear, brand marketing is somewhat are not just all science, and it does take time to pay its rewards. We do believe, though, that by being more a funnel, by being more efficient in performance and allowing us to put more money upfront, we can drive greater long-term returns. Now it's not a quick twitch muscle. As I said, brand marketing is now like you run a great ad and tomorrow, everybody books. It takes repeat. It takes sinking in that brand proposition and getting everybody focused on your name, and then it starts to pay rewards and performance. It starts to pay rewards and direct. It starts to pay rewards across a lot of things. 
So we believe in that opportunity, we will invest in that opportunity, and it will take some time to pay out. It's not like performance. It's not like you're buying the transaction every time you do it. On the Vrbo front -- let me just look at the percent of bookings and growth rates. So I think we don't break those numbers out separately. I would say Vrbo is doing great. The U.S., particularly strong. But as I said, in all our strongest markets, we are showing share gains. And Vrbo is clearly -- and vacation rentals in general, clearly in very positive territory, and that is helping bring up all our numbers, no doubt. But we don't break them out separately. And so I think it's just we view it as part of the business. And as I've said before, the long-term plan for Vrbo or VacationRentals, more generally, is to have them available through all our brands in the most optimal way for the customer. So that's where we are."

And then on the marketing side, if you look at year-over-year going to 2018, 2019 and 2021, our marketing spend as a percent of revenue has come down quite a bit when you compare against those. And yet we are spending heavily into brand, and we're continuing to spend in performance channels as well. And we're also seeing, given all the work that the teams have done, where we're getting good share of voice, share of wallet, if you will, at ROAs that are higher than we've traditionally seen. So still a lot to learn how that's going to flow through the P&L over time, as Peter mentioned, but we feel pretty good about the investments that we're making at this time."

So I think we've done the right stuff across what we thought was the right way to shape the business. And as you'll recall, we set out to do that before COVID even hit. So that is the -- that was the plan, that has been the plan, and we feel good about where we've gone to. 
Now are the places we want to invest in? Absolutely. Do we want to bring in and retain the best talent at our company? Absolutely. We are making those moves. We've brought in lots of great new talent. We have changed it, as Eric alluded to, our equity and bonus structure to reward our people for growth so we will continue to invest in the things that will drive our business, much of which is people and their ability to build great tech and tools and products and services and then people to help externalize all the great stuff we're building on the B2B side and, of course, on the consumer side. So we don't feel like, in any way, we're in an unstable position. Where we have a lot of moving parts, we're trying to change a lot. There's no question. And we think all of it has great opportunities. And will we break something along the way, stumble once or twice, I'm sure we will. But in general, we are feeling like we are in a good position. And if anything, we'll continue to invest into the growth as the returns come in. 
As far as brand campaigns come are concerned, no, we are not about hoping that works and just shifting money around. Our whole proposition is that we believe we can do better on the performance marketing side. We can be better, be more efficient, be more competitive. And by doing so, free up capital if you will, to go upstream, up funnel to push into the brand side. We start way through all that, just as we've tested coming off Google meta for VR and other meta for VR. That's had a really positive impact. We will test more things, we will get smarter. And as I alluded to quarters ago, we are getting into being able -- our goal is getting to the point where we can build algorithms to maximize for multi-brand and do things we've just never been able to do before. So that's the opportunity. And we are leaning into both of that from a technical standpoint. And yes, we are spending up more now that the market is coming back. So both of those things are true, but we believe we can do it more efficiently, as Eric said, maintain higher ROEs in that and then redeploy some of that capital back to the front end to drive that brand awareness, where we think we can also do better than we have historically and spend that money more efficiently. So it's sort of, again, a virtuous cycle. We got to do all those parts. It's a lot, but it's not a hope and a prayer and just moving money around. We want to be as efficient as we can and buy good growth in performance marketing where it and we want to use brand to its greatest effect."

And those learnings will no doubt help other brands for us. But we were -- we felt like we were leaving a lot of customers on the side because of the -- how we made them sign up, what they had to go through, et cetera. And the truth is, for a customer, it's a much better experience if they become a loyalty member, they get to see loyalty rates. They get to -- they get a lot of benefits. And in general, they consume more. And the returns on those loyal customers are higher than the returns on people who are not members. So while there may be accounting that has to get accrued for over time, the return on that customer's performance is much greater. It's been proven over and over again in our brands. So this is really just opening up a window, making it easier and better for the customer, helping them see the benefits, allowing them to see the benefits earlier, if you will. And I think there's nothing but upside and good stuff there. So both for the company and for the customer. 
As far as the ROAs goes, we talk about this a lot. We don't really know where it's going to balance out. We are trying to take a scientific and approach as we can to driving returns through our marketing area. So it will be a bunch of learnings as we go. We are testing and learning, even as we speak, a bunch of things across on and off different brands in different geographies and seeing what happens. From a performance marketing standpoint, we will be testing into brand spend as well by geography and by brand. So it -- we're going to learn. It's going to take some time, but we believe with the benefit of a really strong team on the brand side and a really strong team on the performance marketing side, for the first time, once we get all these things consolidated, and the technology working the right way, we are going to have -- it's going to be a fair fight, and we're going to be in a position to perform -- outperform the competition in a way we just haven't been for a long time."

I think the hardest, biggest lift is really on the platform and the technology and the product. And a lot of that's been organizational, getting the right pieces of the company together in the right way and organized under the right leaders so that we could drive this journey we have to drive from getting to this complicated siloed technology we had before to a much more clean, high efficiency, agile construct. So that's where the most -- I would say the most energy is going in. And frankly, it's a tale of 1,000 stories. Different parts of that journey are in different states of completeness. 
But that creates, to your second question, I would say, the most opportunity going forward because every time we get a win there, and I've talked in the past, whether it's about multiple checkouts becoming 1 checkout or multiple identity features becoming 1 identity, it gives you both speed and better consumer experience and better ability to improve on that as well as efficiency and the ability to redeploy that resource to other higher return opportunities. So that's both an efficiency opportunity, but I would think of it more as the opportunity to invest that talent into new growth as we go forward. So we are still in the middle of many of those things still being fully equipped as if they were run as 6 or 8 or 10 separate things. We will get to a place where we have 1 strong, robust thing and those resources can -- some of those resources can get to higher-value returns. 
And then as far as marketing and the other and cutting costs, again, the cost side will come from what I just described. I don't think -- we continue to see opportunities. Many of the things Eric has talked about that have already borne fruit in terms of cost savings, like our voice platform, et cetera, have much more opportunity to go and more running room. So we see that continuing to happen. We're creating great new tools on the service side, which are creating the opportunity to serve our customers much more efficiently, not just through technology, but also through technology assisting humans. So there's all kinds of places that I think there's more opportunity to get more efficient. But we really view it, I think Eric and I think about it as it's really the opportunity to reinvest back in the business when we have those efficiencies as opposed to, do we just keep cutting for more margins. So there's plenty of opportunity on the margin side, I would say, as we reinflate with travel. And on the flip side, we believe we've made good progress, but there's still a long way to go and a lot of opportunity. 
What did I miss? And -- sorry, on the ROIs for direct traffic -- for mix and direct traffic, I would say, sort of a warning here. I think during COVID, it can be very misleading. Most of us in the travel space have seen really good numbers on direct traffic, on mobile use and all that because our most loyal customers, when we weren't marketing as much were a bigger part of our mix than they might otherwise be. I think as we start to reinflate again in terms of a more natural travel market, those dynamics may shift somewhat. But definitely, we continue to push all in on app usage, on direct relationships on getting out of the auctions as much as we can. So the mix has definitely shifted in our favor in terms of direct traffic, in terms of app and mobile use, et cetera. But I don't want to put too much on it because I'm not sure where it's going to normalize out when the market returns globally."

So we've amped up our investment in marketing and attracting Vrbo host, if you will, or owners. It has been successful. We are driving it as fast as we can. There is a lot of demand, and we're focused, as you would imagine, in the most -- the most high-traffic areas where we need and can sell as much new inventories we can get. We introduced a new product, which we called the Fast Start program, where we essentially take successful hosts that are highly rated from other platforms, and we launch them quickly into our platform and instead of having to rebuild their stature as a highly reviewed host, we sort of take as a proxy, their experience elsewhere, and we put them, if you will, very high in the sort and allow them to start-up their business with us. 
But the reality is that Vrbo hosts on balance make more than Airbnb hosts on average. And it's a great opportunity for people to monetize their assets. We think it's better than any other similarly situated one. And we think owners of properties are increasingly becoming aware of that as our brand becomes more ubiquitous and as people become more used to the products. So all our stats make for a great sales story. We just have to get it out there, and we're spending more to get that story out there. Do you want..."

In regards to your question on the booking trends, we continue to see elevated in the next 30 days unconventional lodging, but it has come down from what we saw during the, call it, the depths of the pandemic. We're continuing to see, obviously, very strong demand for the summer. And even off a very small base, we're seeing healthy demand for the holiday period as well. So we're starting to see it extend into away from the 0 to 7 days or very near term into more healthy time periods as well and more distributed to what we have seen historically. And I would say that's a similar story on the Vrbo side as well. But typically, it has longer booking cycles, and we continue to see that as well."

It's not linear from the negative high 40s to 20s and keep going, so don't get too excited, but it is directionally positive, and we hope and believe that will continue. Obviously, there's a lot of summer bookings through that spring period, and you can assume appropriately that has a lot to do with Americans getting vaccinated and being more comfortable booking their holidays for the summer. So we expect something like that trend to continue for a while. 
But again, as I mentioned in my remarks, if -- we need cities to open, we need international travel over. We need other things to open. U.S. domestic travel itself cannot get us back to where we used to be on a stand-alone basis. Having said that, U.S. domestic travel is higher than U.S. domestic travel used to be and was in 2019, we've seen that effect. And we're not disclosing the U.S. market -- the market's growth or not, but in terms of our performance, but yes, the U.S. is strong. It's driving a lot and it's carrying the weight for a lot of other markets that are still closed, frankly. So we feel very good about where the U.S. is. We hope for a lot of reasons that the rest of the world comes back, not just for our business but for their own lives. But that's where we need more to open up."

On the commercial agreement itself, that in excess of $60 million based on 2019 volume. That is for the entire supply relationship that we will have with the combined business.

But again, we are in COVID and as long as you're comfortable with that use case, you're still comfortable with it. 
Now is that sustainable? Will people go back to resorts and other things? I've said publicly that I believe, in general, the trends of the past will continue. But one of the trends of the past was that people were getting more and more into the use case of VacationRentals. So I think we have accelerated that. We've exposed more people to the product. And that's a good long-term trend for that category. But I don't think -- and it will make people consider VacationRental as part of their choices where maybe before they had not. But I don't think we're necessarily going to be seeing a huge shift that sustains itself long-term so much as maybe a reset at a higher level for VacationRentals and then growing off of that."

I think we've seen -- we definitely were seeing earlier in the pandemic, the longer stays, certainly in the VacationRental space, et cetera. I think things have normalized somewhat from that. But in general, those days are longer still on an average basis. And I think we're seeing ADRs are higher. And for us, and people are spending more. Now that's a little bit of mix, but it's also that hotels and VacationRentals and desire both places have been able to push price, and consumers have been willing to pay for it. And I would say that revenge or otherwise, places like Miami demonstrate that there is huge pent-up demand to go to places where people can experience a relatively normal travel experience. And I don't know if you've been to Miami recently, but it is packed. The hotels are full. People are out everywhere. Restaurants are full. So I think that -- and their booking levels are well above 2 years ago. 
So if you just think about that in a macro way, you say, okay, where people can travel, where they can have a normal experience where they feel like they're comfortable free, whatever your words are, there is a huge amount of demand for that. So obviously, it will spread out across the globe, as more places are like Miami.

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. We have some brief remarks and then we'll take questions.
I'll start by talking about the Egencia deal, which we announced a few days ago. That proposed deal is extremely exciting to us. And in a few minutes, Eric will share the details. But I'll just say, it really highlights 3 core things we're trying to do. One is find the best opportunity for all our businesses. And in this case, we felt that putting Egencia together with Amex GBT created a great new combined corporate enterprise that could focus entirely on the corporate customer and really provide a best-in-class suite of services to serve those customers. And our ownership in that company, we're very excited to have.
Secondly, we signed a long-term lodging supply and tech agreement with the company. And you'll recall, we have a big B2B business, Expedia Partner Services. It is core to our strategy long term and driving and powering the industry broadly is an important move for us. So this deal enhances significantly and just gives us more throughput to continue to innovate, both on the supply and technology side to provide great services to the entire travel ecosystem.
And finally, as we've talked about endlessly in the past year, we are trying to simplify our company so we can focus on the most important and largest opportunities. And with Egencia in a great new home, should this deal proceed, we will be in a great position to focus on our B2C and B2B businesses and our core technology platform, and that's really a great chance for us to get simpler and get agility and speed in the rest of our core business.
Moving on to recent trends. I would say, as I've said, travel remains a study in contrasts for different geographies. Some are still shut down, some like the U.S. are quite open now. And equally, a study in differences between vacation rentals, domestic travel versus international travel. Business travel is more challenged. Conventional lodging, particularly in big cities, is more challenged. So it's really a study in contrasts. It depends where you're strongest. We have benefited greatly in our vacation rental business and our domestic U.S. business, but other parts of the business still remain challenged.
I would say and many have reported already, but the summer looks strong, particularly in the U.S. and in other markets where vaccinations are well along the way. We are already seeing booking trends well above 2019 levels for leisure destinations, beach, mountains, et cetera. And that goes for not only vacation rentals, but also for conventional lodging.
To give a little more color on bookings themselves, we said on our last call that we were down somewhere in the high 40% in the gross bookings, net of cancellations, in the January period. That has moderated to down around 20% in March and has improved on that in April. So the trends remain strong, again, driven largely by the strongest markets, but still the trends are very good, and we're excited about that.
I would just keep in mind, while summer looks great and we are ambitious and feeling good about the overall recovery, that the calendar is still a question mark. We don't know what seasonality will look like as long as COVID is here. And the usual trends that might come in the fall and winter are still unknown. So while we're extremely excited about summer, it's a little too early to predict how those trends, like work-from-home, whether school is in session, et cetera, will change travel behavior going into the following quarters.
On the Vrbo front and vacation rentals in general, we continue to lean into that business. We have grown share in all our strongest markets and invested heavily in marketing and in acquiring hosts. And we feel like that continues to be a great opportunity for us, not just in this moment, but in the future as we capitalize on landing the brand and getting more people to experience Vrbo and staying in vacation rentals.
We are seeing some compression in summer. People ask about that frequently. And I'll just say, so far, we have seen replacement as a pretty good solution. Most people look for something. If they can't find it, they'll find something nearby. And increasingly, as more people are vaccinated, they are willing and happy to stay in resorts and in conventional lodging. And I would say, some portion of them would actually prefer it that way, and we're seeing in those leisure destinations for the summer very strong conventional lodging numbers.
On the marketing side, I've mentioned in past quarters that we have taken a relatively conservative bias on how we've approached marketing, rather leave a little money on the table than get too far out over our skis. But in the course of the first quarter, we have sort of changed that bias and moved more, particularly in the back half of the quarter, towards investing and getting in front of the wave of demand we think is coming. That's taken the form of a number of brand marketing rollouts, including a brand-new Expedia brand marketing campaign that started at the Academy Awards. We've relaunched our Orbitz brand with a focus on LGBTQIA+. And that's sort of, again, a push as we try to differentiate brands and really focus each brand on who their market is. And later this month, we have a great new summer ad campaign coming from Vrbo that we think will be really impactful.
So that investment in brand building is really important to us. We've talked before about going up-funnel, creating that brand love, pushing for direct interactions, direct consumption. But keep in mind, it's not a quick twitch tool like performance marketing, so we have to invest over time to build that. But we think it does have returns ultimately for performance marketing as the brands become more well-loved and more highly thought of.
We are starting to see wins. I've talked at some length in the past about combining our performance marketing teams. They've been doing yeoman's work and a terrific job. We've actually put in a new leader who came from the outside and is a great new addition to the team. But I just wanted to, I've said that before, I wanted to give one stat to give you a sense of the acceleration we're finally starting to get, which is that 75% of our SEM spend is now on a new consolidated technical and data platform. And just for a point of reference, at the end of last year, that was at 15%. So it is starting to accelerate. We're starting to get the wins we hoped to get as we combine these platforms. And as we invest more and get more aggressive and we're getting these wins, we're seeing our click share go back to historic levels or higher in our main products and our key markets.
We continue to refine our marketing spend in general, and we will continue to test and learn, and there will be balancing as we learn. But I will say, we mentioned last time on our last call that we went off the Google meta product for vacation rentals. And actually, over this last quarter, we have pulled back from other vacation rental meta players. And so far, the results have been excellent and as good or better than we could have hoped for in terms of the returns we have seen in getting more direct traffic and traffic other ways more efficiently. So that has been a great move, and we will continue to focus on that. But again, we will be up-funnel more. We will be focused and leaning into the wave ahead. But it could be bumpy and we may be a little early, but we believe now is the time to lean in, and we will be leaning in accordingly.
On the platform and technical side, I made a promise that I'm not going to get into the business of telling 100 great stories about our technical platform. We are making great strides every day in it. It is definitely where we are putting the most energy, time and money. But I just wanted to point out one area of wins because it really goes to how this is going to affect not just us as a business but the customers. And that's in our AI and data products. We recently launched a reinforcement learning algorithm, which allows us to power different shopping journeys on a given page for different customers. And we are using it now, not universally because, again, all of the tech is coming along, and it will be launched as it can be in more places, but we're using it to adapt and improve the customer experience to the specific customer journey, opportunity for conversion and improving the business. But most of all, it's a great opportunity to improve the experience for the customer and make it easier for them to find what they want.
And in a related point, we're also using AI and telemetry data to track customer experience, to track friction points and again focus on taking that friction out of the customer experience and making it great. So these are first-tier technologies that the best e-commerce companies in the world use, and we are now using it to make our consumer experiences better. And that's really exciting, right, for the business, but in many ways even more exciting that we can drive customer love and a better customer experience.
And so finally, I'd just say, we are clearly benefiting from our relative strength in some of the best markets, VR, the U.S., et cetera, but it's a bumpy ride and we're hoping for reopenings. I would say the announcement about New York City. You'll remember, we're very strong in big cities and in international travel, neither of which have been doing well, but the announcement about New York opening up, hopefully, some international travel between EMEA and the U.S. this summer will start to open even more as we go forward.
And I'd just like to say, it's nice to report that we're making progress, but we are mindful of our friends and colleagues and everybody really in India. We have a big operation in India. We've got many sick colleagues and family members, and our thoughts are with them every day. And whatever the world can do to help, we are doing everything we can to help, but we all should do more. And I would finally say, that's a reminder that this is an unpredictable time. We still don't know what's happening in many markets. Anything could happen. Things could get worse before they get better, but we are optimistic. We are seeing a lot of improvement across the globe, and we are feeling good about the work we're doing at the company.
So with that, I'll just say, hopefully, vaccines continue to roll out. Hopefully, you all have your vaccines and tell everybody you know to get a vaccine. And we have little doubt that as that continues, the world will open up and travel will come roaring back.
So with that, I will pass it off to Eric. Thank you."

I'd like to start by providing more details on the binding offer we received from Amex GBT to acquire Egencia. I echo Peter's earlier comments. We are very excited about the deal, and I'm optimistic about the success we would see from the combined company. Now on the offer which includes 2 major pieces. First, we have approximately 14% ownership in the combined business, presuming close, which we currently estimate is valued at approximately $750 million. Second, we would also enter into a 10-year lodging supply agreement between Amex GBT and EPS, as Peter mentioned earlier. And then to put this commercial deal into perspective, the supply agreement would have generated in excess of $60 million in EBITDA at 2019 volumes. We anticipate the proposed deal would close in 9 to 12 months.
Next, I wanted to provide an update on our cost-saving initiatives. In 2020, we made considerable progress on rightsizing our cost base, and these efforts continued in Q1. We still expect to be towards the higher end of our $700 million to $750 million range for fixed cost savings relative to our 2019 exit rate, and we have now achieved approximately $700 million on a run rate basis. We remain confident we will realize largely all of those target cost savings by the end of 2021. As we have spoken about previously, when looking forward, we will have annual increases in the remaining cost basis from items like annual comp increases and we expect to invest in areas of the business where we see attractive opportunities.
On variable cost of revenue, we remain on track for over $200 million in annual savings based on 2019 volume levels. As a reminder, the 3 key drivers are improved economics through our payments platform, expansion of our conversations platform to reduce customer service costs and lower variable cloud costs. Similar to the fixed initiatives, we still expect to realize largely all of these variable cost savings by the end of 2021. Although given the costs are volume-based, the savings will not be fully evident until we reach more normalized business levels.
We've also spoken in the past about driving marketing efficiencies. And we've continued to make improvements in Q1, but I want to be very clear, we are spending into the recovery, as Peter mentioned. As it relates to Q1, we increased our investments, particularly in the back half of the quarter, and that continued as well. And we also expect a further increase in Q2 as we look to further capitalize on the pace of travel recovery, particularly within the U.S. As a reminder, we incur the marketing expense in the quarter it occurs, but we don't realize any associated lodging revenue until the stay actually happens.
In terms of the balance sheet, we are investment-grade rated today. And as the recovery continues to unfold, we remain committed to delevering back to more historical leverage levels, while also continuing to reduce our cost of capital. Our ultimate goal of being in a strong position -- to be in a strong position to restart our capital return program to shareholders, as we talked about at the early part of last year. To that end, we recently took advantage of compelling market conditions and raised $1 billion in 10-year unsecured notes, which have a coupon of 2.95% and $1 billion in 0 coupon 5-year convertible debt with a 72.5% conversion premium. Together, we used the proceeds of the new debt issuances to redeem $1.7 billion of debt due in 2025 at coupons of 7% and 6.25%. This will yield approximately $80 million in annual interest rate savings.
From a liquidity standpoint, we have $4.3 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments, which is about $1 billion higher than we ended Q4, with the increase primarily due to positive free cash flow. We also have essentially $2 billion in untapped revolver capacity. As it relates to deferred merchant bookings, it has improved in each quarter since the height of the pandemic and with a total of $6 billion at the end of Q1.
We have witnessed positive recent trends and are cautiously optimistic about the pace and shape of the recovery. We are also confident in our liquidity position. And therefore, we have elected to pay down 50% of the preferred stock issued in 2020 later this month. And as a reminder, regarding the preferred stock, we also have the ability to pay off that balance at any time we choose to do so and is something that we'll be watching over the coming months.
Now shifting to the P&L. Total revenue was down 52% versus first quarter of '19, which was a notable improvement from last quarter, with revenue down approximately 62% year-on-year. And that's normalized for the insurance contra revenue impact that occurred in Q4 of 2020 that we spoke about last quarter. Overhead expenses totaled approximately $500 million in Q1 and came in slightly better than anticipated due to some timing benefits. As a reminder, we define overhead as G&A, tech and content, indirect sales and marketing, while excluding stock-based compensation.
Moving on, we made a change during Q1 in managing our software licensing and maintenance costs, which led to a modest reclassification to prior results. We have moved from a decentralized approach, which we've talked about previously, where each individual team manages their own spend, which resulted in increased costs and duplicative tools, to a much more centralized approach across EG. In 2020, the change resulted in approximately $60 million in costs being reallocated to tech and content, with the majority coming from cost of sales and the remainder from sales and marketing and G&A. There was no change to total costs or EBITDA from this reclassification. In total, adjusted EBITDA was negative $58 million for the quarter, which was slightly better than our expectations. On an absolute basis, adjusted EBITDA was down approximately $235 million versus Q1 2019, while revenue was down approximately $1.4 billion over the same time period.
On the free cash flow, which totaled $2 billion in Q1 on a reported basis. If you exclude the change in restricted cash, which is primarily driven by Vrbo's deferred merchant bookings, free cash flow was approximately $800 million. Looking forward, we mentioned it last quarter, we do expect our overhead cost to step up by approximately $50 million sequentially from Q1 to Q2 of this year relative to the bonus payments and other issues we talked about last quarter.
In closing, continue to be very encouraged by the recent trends within the business, have increasing confidence in our liquidity position given the change that we just made, especially in paying down the preferred, but we remain cautiously optimistic about further improvements in travel recovery as we head throughout the rest of the year.

If that's so, could you just give those same sort of trends on a global bookings basis? And maybe I misunderstood that. And then secondly, kind of a high-level question. If you think about what you're doing with the business to help, you've done a lot of things to improve the cost structure as you're going into and then out of COVID. How would you describe what you've done to try to improve the bookings growth and the revenue growth pre versus post-COVID?

First of all, the answer to your first question is, those numbers are global. That is our entire business collectively, not just the U.S. The U.S. is stronger for sure, helping that number up, but those are global numbers.
As for beyond the cost structure, I'd say we're doing tons of work, and I'll start by, unfortunately, reiterating all the work we're doing on the marketing side, the work we're doing to simplify and combine our performance marketing team, tools, capabilities, data analytics. That's a huge benefit for us as we go into the future, into the post-COVID time and our ability to compete in the performance channels in the most effective ways. We believe we can do better and do more on the brand building side and to create that direct customer relationship.
And then that bleeds all the way down through, of course, the importance of doing the product right, getting the engagement right, improving the apps, improving the technology, using AI to improve the customer experience. So all of those things are the classic sort of virtuous cycle of, can you get them in the door? Can you make them love you? Is the experience great? Does it help them find what they want? So there's a ton of work. All that work I talk about on the platform side is not about efficiencies, although it does create efficiencies. What it really creates is agility and the ability to serve the customer better and create a stronger tie to that customer and repeat and loyalty and lifetime value.
So it's really an exercise in all the pieces, but we are getting sharper on all elements, whether it's the brand proposition for every brand, whether it's the geographic proposition for every geo and brand and then what that customer experience is like all the way to the end, through service. And it's all those pieces. So we're investing across the board in terms of our energy and time. And I think those pieces will start to multiply on themselves as we get more and more of them sort of across the road as it were. So lots of good work going on. Some things are a lot further along than others, but I think you'll continue to see improvement across all those categories."

Thanks, Justin. I'll maybe take the second one first. Yes. I mean, we've spent a fair amount of time getting to a new brand proposition, a bunch of new capabilities and things we wanted to talk to the consumers about and are just at the early stages of rolling out our Expedia brand campaign. That is a heavy brand campaign across multiple markets, and we think it has great opportunity.
But to be clear, brand marketing is somewhat art, not just all science. And it does take time to pay its rewards. We do believe, though, that by being more up-funnel, by being more efficient in performance and allowing us to put more money up-funnel, we can drive greater long-term returns. Now it's not a quick twitch muscle. As I said, brand marketing is not like you run a great ad and tomorrow everybody books. It takes repeat. It takes sinking in that brand proposition and getting everybody focused on your name, and then it starts to pay rewards in performance. It starts to pay rewards in direct. It starts to pay rewards across a lot of things. So we believe in that opportunity. We will invest in that opportunity. And it will take some time to pay out. It's not like performance. It's not like you're buying the transaction every time you do it.
On the Vrbo front, let me just look at the percent of bookings and growth rates. So I think we don't break those numbers out separately. I would say Vrbo is doing great. The U.S. is particularly strong. But as I said, in all our strongest markets, we are showing share gains. And Vrbo is clearly and vacation rentals in general are clearly in very positive territory, and that is helping bring up all our numbers, no doubt. But we don't break them out separately. And so I think it's just we view it as part of the business. And as I've said before, the long-term plan for Vrbo or vacation rentals more generally is to have them available through all our brands in the most optimal way for the customer. So that's where we are."

And we're also seeing given all the work that the teams have done, where we're getting good share of voice, share of wallet, if you will, at ROAS that are higher than we've traditionally seen.

We did a lot of things that we thought were the right things to do for the long-term health of the company. But we have invested in lots of people, talent, marketing, all kinds of things, technology. So I think we've done the right stuff across what we thought was the right way to shape the business. And as you'll recall, we set out to do that before COVID even hit. So that was the plan. That has been the plan. And we feel good about where we've gone to.
Now are there places we want to invest in? Absolutely. Do we want to bring in and retain the best talent at our company? Absolutely. We are making those moves. We've brought in lots of great new talent. We have changed, as Eric alluded to, our equity and bonus structure to reward our people for growth. So we will continue to invest in the things that will drive our business, much of which is people and their ability to build great tech and tools and products and services and then people to help externalize all the great stuff we're building on the B2B side and of course, on the consumer side. So we don't feel like, in any way, we're in an unstable position. We have a lot of moving parts. We're trying to change a lot. There's no question. And we think all of it has great opportunities. And will we break something along the way, stumble once or twice, I'm sure we will. But in general, we are feeling like we are in a good position. And if anything, we'll continue to invest into the growth as the returns come in.
As far as brand campaigns are concerned, no, we are not about hoping that works and just shifting money around. Our whole proposition is that we believe we can do better on the performance marketing side. We can be better, be more efficient, be more competitive. And by doing so free up capital, if you will, to go upstream, up-funnel to push into the brand side. We test our way through all that just as we've tested coming off Google meta for VR and other meta for VR. That's had a really positive impact. We will test more things. We will get smarter. And as I alluded to quarters ago, we are getting into being able, our goal is getting to the point where we can build algorithms to maximize for multi-brand and do things we've just never been able to do before. So that's the opportunity. And we are leaning into both of that from a technical standpoint.
And yes, we are spending up more now that the market is coming back. So both of those things are true, but we believe we can do it more efficiently. As Eric said, maintain higher ROAS in that and then redeploy some of that capital back to the front end to drive that brand awareness, where we think we can also do better than we have historically and spend that money more efficiently. So it's sort of, again, a virtuous cycle. We got to do all those parts. It's a lot, but it's not a hope and a prayer and just moving money around. We want to be as efficient as we can and buy good growth in performance marketing, and we want to use brand to its greatest effect."

As you are discovering where the optimum ROAS can be, how should we think about the split of your ad budget between performance and brand advertising as we look forward? How do you think it compares to where it has been in the past? And then secondarily, you are making a big push towards loyalty. I think you, in your recent announcement, talked about gaining around 25 million new loyalty members. How does that affect the P&L in terms of how you accrue for the loyalty rewards?"
25915843,712024475,2274414,"Expedia Group, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Yes.

Which is, on the loyalty side, we felt like there's a big opportunity, particularly in Brand Expedia, to drive loyalty. And those learnings will no doubt help other brands for us. But we felt like we were leaving a lot of customers on the side because of how we made them sign up, what they had to go through, et cetera. And the truth is, for a customer, it's a much better experience if they become a loyalty member. They get to see loyalty rates. They get a lot of benefits. And in general, they consume more.
And the returns on those loyal customers are higher than the returns on people who are not members. So while there may be accounting that has to get accrued for over time, the return on that customer's performance is much greater. It's been proven over and over again in our brands. So this is really just opening up a window, making it easier and better for the customer, helping them see the benefits, allowing them to see the benefits earlier, if you will. And I think there's nothing but upside and good stuff there so, both for the company and for the customer.
As far as the ROAS goes, we talk about this a lot. We don't really know where it's going to balance out. We are trying to take as scientific an approach as we can to driving returns through our marketing area. So it will be a bunch of learn as we go. We are testing and learning, even as we speak, a bunch of things across on and off different brands and different geographies and seeing what happens. From a performance marketing standpoint, we will be testing into brand spend as well by geography and by brand. So we're going to learn. It's going to take some time, but we believe with the benefit of a really strong team on the brand side and a really strong team on the performance marketing side, for the first time, once we get all these things consolidated and the technology working the right way, we are going to have, it's going to be a fair fight, and we're going to be in a position to outperform the competition in a way we just haven't been for a long time."

I think the hardest, biggest lift is really on the platform and the technology and the product. And a lot of that's been organizational, getting the right pieces of the company together in the right way and organized under the right leaders so that we could drive this journey we have to drive from getting to this complicated siloed technology we had before to a much more clean, high efficiency, agile construct. So that's where the most, I would say, the most energy is going in. And frankly, it's a tale of 1,000 stories. Different parts of that journey are in different states of completeness.
But that creates, to your second question, I would say, the most opportunity going forward because every time we get a win there, and I've talked in the past, whether it's about multiple checkouts becoming one checkout or multiple identity features becoming one identity, it gives you both speed and better consumer experience and better ability to improve on that as well as efficiency and the ability to redeploy that resource to other higher return opportunities. So that's both an efficiency opportunity, but I would think of it more as the opportunity to invest that talent into new growth as we go forward. So we are still in the middle of many of those things still being fully equipped as if they were run as 6 or 8 or 10 separate things. We will get to a place where we have one strong, robust thing and those resources can, some of those resources can get to higher-value returns.
And then as far as marketing and the other and cutting costs, again, the cost side will come from what I just described. We continue to see opportunities. Many of the things Eric's talked about that have already borne fruit in terms of cost savings, like our voice platform, et cetera, have much more opportunity to go and more running room. So we see that continuing to happen. We're creating great new tools on the service side, which are creating the opportunity to serve our customers much more efficiently, not just through technology, but also through technology assisting humans. So there's all kinds of places that I think there's more opportunity to get more efficient. But we really view, I think Eric and I think about it as, it's really the opportunity to reinvest back in the business when we have those efficiencies as opposed to, do we just keep cutting for more margins. So there's plenty of opportunity on the margin side, I would say, as we reinflate with travel. And on the flip side, we believe we've made good progress, but there's still a long way to go and a lot of opportunity.
What did I miss? And sorry, on the ROIs for direct traffic, for mix and direct traffic, I would say, sort of a warning here. I think during COVID, it can be very misleading. Most of us in the travel space have seen really good numbers on direct traffic, on mobile use and all that because our most loyal customers, when we weren't marketing as much were a bigger part of our mix than they might otherwise be. I think as we start to reinflate again in terms of a more natural travel market, those dynamics may shift somewhat. But definitely, we continue to push all-in on app usage, on direct relationships, on getting out of the auctions as much as we can. So the mix has definitely shifted in our favor in terms of direct traffic, in terms of app and mobile use, et cetera, but I don't want to put too much on it because I'm not sure where it's going to normalize out when the market returns globally."

It has been successful. We are driving it as fast as we can. There is a lot of demand, and we're focused, as you would imagine, in the most high-traffic areas where we need and can sell as much new inventory as we can get. We introduced a new product, which we called the Fast Start program, where we essentially take successful hosts that are highly rated from other platforms and we launch them quickly into our platform and instead of having to rebuild their stature as a highly reviewed host, we sort of take as a proxy their experience elsewhere, and we put them, if you will, very high in the sort and allow them to start up their business with us.
But the reality is that Vrbo hosts on balance make more than Airbnb hosts on average. And it's a great opportunity for people to monetize their assets. We think it's better than any other similarly situated one. And we think owners of properties are increasingly becoming aware of that as our brand becomes more ubiquitous and as people become more used to the products. So all our stats make for a great sales story. We just have to get it out there, and we're spending more to get that story out there. Do you want?"

In regards to your question on the booking trends, we continue to see elevated in the next 30 days unconventional lodging, but it has come down from what we saw during the, call it, the depths of the pandemic. We're continuing to see, obviously, very strong demand for the summer. And even off a very small base, we're seeing healthy demand for the holiday period as well. So we're starting to see it extend into away from the 0 to 7 days or very near term into more healthy time periods as well and more distributed to what we have seen historically. And I would say that's a similar story on the Vrbo side as well. But typically, it has longer booking cycles, and we continue to see that as well."

Obviously, there's a lot of summer bookings through that spring period, and you can assume appropriately that has a lot to do with Americans getting vaccinated and being more comfortable booking their holidays for the summer. So we expect something like that trend to continue for a while.
But again, as I mentioned in my remarks, we need cities to open. We need international travel up. We need other things to open. U.S. domestic travel itself cannot get us back to where we used to be on a stand-alone basis. Having said that, U.S. domestic travel is higher than U.S. domestic travel used to be and was in 2019. We've seen that effect. And we're not disclosing the U.S. market, the market's growth or not in terms of our performance, but yes, the U.S. is strong. It's driving a lot and it's carrying the weight for a lot of other markets that are still closed, frankly. So we feel very good about where the U.S. is.

Now is that sustainable? Will people go back to resorts and other things? I've said publicly that I believe, in general, the trends of the past will continue. But one of the trends of the past was that people were getting more and more into the use case of vacation rentals. So I think we have accelerated that. We've exposed more people to the product.

Thanks for the question, Stephen. I'm rooting for revenge travel, whatever that is. Whatever kind of travel people want to do, we're happy to accommodate it, revenge or otherwise.

But in general, those days are longer still on an average basis. And I think we're seeing ADRs are higher. And for us, and people are spending more.
Now that's a little bit of mix, but it's also that hotels and vacation rentals and desire both places have been able to push price, and consumers have been willing to pay for it. And I would say that revenge or otherwise, places like Miami demonstrate that there is huge pent-up demand to go to places where people can experience a relatively normal travel experience. And I don't know if you've been to Miami recently, but it is packed. The hotels are full. People are out everywhere. Restaurants are full. So I think that and their booking levels are well above 2 years ago.

So obviously, it will spread out across the globe, as more places are like Miami. But I think that demonstrates in a sense that there is pent-up demand for the places and the things where people can spend money."

As far as the work-from-home trends go, yes, we've been leaning into this from the beginning. Vrbo was pushing a lot of sort of staycations, stay nearby, school, from home and making sure people understood what the WiFi and other things were. So we've understood these trends to the extent we could, and we've tried to lean into that consumer interest. I think longer term, we, like every company, and certainly, like every tech company are dealing with the work-from-home questions and the flexible work of the future, I think, clearly, what we've seen suggests that the world will be more flexible. And whether that means people will have the opportunity to work from other places, take longer weekends and work from somewhere, et cetera, we're going to have to see how that plays out.

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. We have some brief remarks and then we'll take questions.
I'll start by talking about the Egencia deal, which we announced a few days ago. That proposed deal is extremely exciting to us. And in a few minutes, Eric will share the details. But I'll just say, it really highlights 3 core things we're trying to do. One is find the best opportunity for all our businesses. And in this case, we felt that putting Egencia together with Amex GBT created a great new combined corporate enterprise that could focus entirely on the corporate customer and really provide a best-in-class suite of services to serve those customers. And our ownership in that company, we're very excited to have.
Secondly, we signed a long-term lodging supply and tech agreement with the company. And you'll recall, we have a big B2B business, Expedia Partner Services. It is core to our strategy long term and driving and powering the industry broadly is an important move for us. So this deal enhances significantly and just gives us more throughput to continue to innovate, both on the supply and technology side to provide great services to the entire travel ecosystem.
And finally, as we've talked about endlessly in the past year, we are trying to simplify our company so we can focus on the most important and largest opportunities. And with Egencia in a great new home, should this deal proceed, we will be in a great position to focus on our B2C and B2B businesses and our core technology platform, and that's really a great chance for us to get simpler and get agility and speed in the rest of our core business.
Moving on to recent trends. I would say, as I've said, travel remains a study in contrasts for different geographies. Some are still shut down, some like the U.S. are quite open now. And equally, a study in differences between vacation rentals, domestic travel versus international travel. Business travel is more challenged. Conventional lodging, particularly in big cities, is more challenged. So it's really a study in contrasts. It depends where you're strongest. We have benefited greatly in our vacation rental business and our domestic U.S. business, but other parts of the business still remain challenged.
I would say and many have reported already, but the summer looks strong, particularly in the U.S. and in other markets where vaccinations are well along the way. We are already seeing booking trends well above 2019 levels for leisure destinations, beach, mountains, et cetera. And that goes for not only vacation rentals, but also for conventional lodging.
To give a little more color on bookings themselves, we said on our last call that we were down somewhere in the high 40% in the gross bookings, net of cancellations, in the January period. That has moderated to down around 20% in March and has improved on that in April. So the trends remain strong, again, driven largely by the strongest markets, but still the trends are very good, and we're excited about that.
I would just keep in mind, while summer looks great and we are ambitious and feeling good about the overall recovery, that the calendar is still a question mark. We don't know what seasonality will look like as long as COVID is here. And the usual trends that might come in the fall and winter are still unknown. So while we're extremely excited about summer, it's a little too early to predict how those trends, like work-from-home, whether school is in session, et cetera, will change travel behavior going into the following quarters.
On the Vrbo front and vacation rentals in general, we continue to lean into that business. We have grown share in all our strongest markets and invested heavily in marketing and in acquiring hosts. And we feel like that continues to be a great opportunity for us, not just in this moment, but in the future as we capitalize on landing the brand and getting more people to experience Vrbo and staying in vacation rentals.
We are seeing some compression in summer. People ask about that frequently. And I'll just say, so far, we have seen replacement as a pretty good solution. Most people look for something. If they can't find it, they'll find something nearby. And increasingly, as more people are vaccinated, they are willing and happy to stay in resorts and in conventional lodging. And I would say, some portion of them would actually prefer it that way, and we're seeing in those leisure destinations for the summer very strong conventional lodging numbers.
On the marketing side, I've mentioned in past quarters that we have taken a relatively conservative bias on how we've approached marketing, rather leave a little money on the table than get too far out over our skis. But in the course of the first quarter, we have sort of changed that bias and moved more, particularly in the back half of the quarter, towards investing and getting in front of the wave of demand we think is coming. That's taken the form of a number of brand marketing rollouts, including a brand-new Expedia brand marketing campaign that started at the Academy Awards. We've relaunched our Orbitz brand with a focus on LGBTQIA+. And that's sort of, again, a push as we try to differentiate brands and really focus each brand on who their market is. And later this month, we have a great new summer ad campaign coming from Vrbo that we think will be really impactful.
So that investment in brand building is really important to us. We've talked before about going up-funnel, creating that brand love, pushing for direct interactions, direct consumption. But keep in mind, it's not a quick twitch tool like performance marketing, so we have to invest over time to build that. But we think it does have returns ultimately for performance marketing as the brands become more well-loved and more highly thought of.
We are starting to see wins. I've talked at some length in the past about combining our performance marketing teams. They've been doing yeoman's work and a terrific job. We've actually put in a new leader who came from the outside and is a great new addition to the team. But I just wanted to, I've said that before, I wanted to give one stat to give you a sense of the acceleration we're finally starting to get, which is that 75% of our SEM spend is now on a new consolidated technical and data platform. And just for a point of reference, at the end of last year, that was at 15%. So it is starting to accelerate. We're starting to get the wins we hoped to get as we combine these platforms. And as we invest more and get more aggressive and we're getting these wins, we're seeing our click share go back to historic levels or higher in our main products and our key markets.
We continue to refine our marketing spend in general, and we will continue to test and learn, and there will be balancing as we learn. But I will say, we mentioned last time on our last call that we went off the Google meta product for vacation rentals. And actually, over this last quarter, we have pulled back from other vacation rental meta players. And so far, the results have been excellent and as good or better than we could have hoped for in terms of the returns we have seen in getting more direct traffic and traffic other ways more efficiently. So that has been a great move, and we will continue to focus on that. But again, we will be up-funnel more. We will be focused and leaning into the wave ahead. But it could be bumpy and we may be a little early, but we believe now is the time to lean in, and we will be leaning in accordingly.
On the platform and technical side, I made a promise that I'm not going to get into the business of telling 100 great stories about our technical platform. We are making great strides every day in it. It is definitely where we are putting the most energy, time and money. But I just wanted to point out one area of wins because it really goes to how this is going to affect not just us as a business but the customers. And that's in our AI and data products. We recently launched a reinforcement learning algorithm, which allows us to power different shopping journeys on a given page for different customers. And we are using it now, not universally because, again, all of the tech is coming along, and it will be launched as it can be in more places, but we're using it to adapt and improve the customer experience to the specific customer journey, opportunity for conversion and improving the business. But most of all, it's a great opportunity to improve the experience for the customer and make it easier for them to find what they want.
And in a related point, we're also using AI and telemetry data to track customer experience, to track friction points and again focus on taking that friction out of the customer experience and making it great. So these are first-tier technologies that the best e-commerce companies in the world use, and we are now using it to make our consumer experiences better. And that's really exciting, right, for the business, but in many ways even more exciting that we can drive customer love and a better customer experience.
And so finally, I'd just say, we are clearly benefiting from our relative strength in some of the best markets, VR, the U.S., et cetera, but it's a bumpy ride and we're hoping for reopenings. I would say the announcement about New York City. You'll remember, we're very strong in big cities and in international travel, neither of which have been doing well, but the announcement about New York opening up, hopefully, some international travel between EMEA and the U.S. this summer will start to open even more as we go forward.
And I'd just like to say, it's nice to report that we're making progress, but we are mindful of our friends and colleagues and everybody really in India. We have a big operation in India. We've got many sick colleagues and family members, and our thoughts are with them every day. And whatever the world can do to help, we are doing everything we can to help, but we all should do more. And I would finally say, that's a reminder that this is an unpredictable time. We still don't know what's happening in many markets. Anything could happen. Things could get worse before they get better, but we are optimistic. We are seeing a lot of improvement across the globe, and we are feeling good about the work we're doing at the company.
So with that, I'll just say, hopefully, vaccines continue to roll out. Hopefully, you all have your vaccines and tell everybody you know to get a vaccine. And we have little doubt that as that continues, the world will open up and travel will come roaring back.
So with that, I will pass it off to Eric. Thank you."

I'd like to start by providing more details on the binding offer we received from Amex GBT to acquire Egencia. I echo Peter's earlier comments. We are very excited about the deal, and I'm optimistic about the success we would see from the combined company. Now on the offer which includes 2 major pieces. First, we have approximately 14% ownership in the combined business, presuming close, which we currently estimate is valued at approximately $750 million. Second, we would also enter into a 10-year lodging supply agreement between Amex GBT and EPS, as Peter mentioned earlier. And then to put this commercial deal into perspective, the supply agreement would have generated in excess of $60 million in EBITDA at 2019 volumes. We anticipate the proposed deal would close in 9 to 12 months.
Next, I wanted to provide an update on our cost-saving initiatives. In 2020, we made considerable progress on rightsizing our cost base, and these efforts continued in Q1. We still expect to be towards the higher end of our $700 million to $750 million range for fixed cost savings relative to our 2019 exit rate, and we have now achieved approximately $700 million on a run rate basis. We remain confident we will realize largely all of those target cost savings by the end of 2021. As we have spoken about previously, when looking forward, we will have annual increases in the remaining cost basis from items like annual comp increases and we expect to invest in areas of the business where we see attractive opportunities.
On variable cost of revenue, we remain on track for over $200 million in annual savings based on 2019 volume levels. As a reminder, the 3 key drivers are improved economics through our payments platform, expansion of our conversations platform to reduce customer service costs and lower variable cloud costs. Similar to the fixed initiatives, we still expect to realize largely all of these variable cost savings by the end of 2021. Although given the costs are volume-based, the savings will not be fully evident until we reach more normalized business levels.
We've also spoken in the past about driving marketing efficiencies. And we've continued to make improvements in Q1, but I want to be very clear, we are spending into the recovery, as Peter mentioned. As it relates to Q1, we increased our investments, particularly in the back half of the quarter, and that continued as well. And we also expect a further increase in Q2 as we look to further capitalize on the pace of travel recovery, particularly within the U.S. As a reminder, we incur the marketing expense in the quarter it occurs, but we don't realize any associated lodging revenue until the stay actually happens.
In terms of the balance sheet, we are investment-grade rated today. And as the recovery continues to unfold, we remain committed to delevering back to more historical leverage levels, while also continuing to reduce our cost of capital. Our ultimate goal of being in a strong position -- to be in a strong position to restart our capital return program to shareholders, as we talked about at the early part of last year. To that end, we recently took advantage of compelling market conditions and raised $1 billion in 10-year unsecured notes, which have a coupon of 2.95% and $1 billion in 0 coupon 5-year convertible debt with a 72.5% conversion premium. Together, we used the proceeds of the new debt issuances to redeem $1.7 billion of debt due in 2025 at coupons of 7% and 6.25%. This will yield approximately $80 million in annual interest rate savings.
From a liquidity standpoint, we have $4.3 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments, which is about $1 billion higher than we ended Q4, with the increase primarily due to positive free cash flow. We also have essentially $2 billion in untapped revolver capacity. As it relates to deferred merchant bookings, it has improved in each quarter since the height of the pandemic and with a total of $6 billion at the end of Q1.
We have witnessed positive recent trends and are cautiously optimistic about the pace and shape of the recovery. We are also confident in our liquidity position. And therefore, we have elected to pay down 50% of the preferred stock issued in 2020 later this month. And as a reminder, regarding the preferred stock, we also have the ability to pay off that balance at any time we choose to do so and is something that we'll be watching over the coming months.
Now shifting to the P&L. Total revenue was down 52% versus first quarter of '19, which was a notable improvement from last quarter, with revenue down approximately 62% year-on-year. And that's normalized for the insurance contra revenue impact that occurred in Q4 of 2020 that we spoke about last quarter. Overhead expenses totaled approximately $500 million in Q1 and came in slightly better than anticipated due to some timing benefits. As a reminder, we define overhead as G&A, tech and content, indirect sales and marketing, while excluding stock-based compensation.
Moving on, we made a change during Q1 in managing our software licensing and maintenance costs, which led to a modest reclassification to prior results. We have moved from a decentralized approach, which we've talked about previously, where each individual team manages their own spend, which resulted in increased costs and duplicative tools, to a much more centralized approach across EG. In 2020, the change resulted in approximately $60 million in costs being reallocated to tech and content, with the majority coming from cost of sales and the remainder from sales and marketing and G&A. There was no change to total costs or EBITDA from this reclassification. In total, adjusted EBITDA was negative $58 million for the quarter, which was slightly better than our expectations. On an absolute basis, adjusted EBITDA was down approximately $235 million versus Q1 2019, while revenue was down approximately $1.4 billion over the same time period.
On the free cash flow, which totaled $2 billion in Q1 on a reported basis. If you exclude the change in restricted cash, which is primarily driven by Vrbo's deferred merchant bookings, free cash flow was approximately $800 million. Looking forward, we mentioned it last quarter, we do expect our overhead cost to step up by approximately $50 million sequentially from Q1 to Q2 of this year relative to the bonus payments and other issues we talked about last quarter.
In closing, continue to be very encouraged by the recent trends within the business, have increasing confidence in our liquidity position given the change that we just made, especially in paying down the preferred, but we remain cautiously optimistic about further improvements in travel recovery as we head throughout the rest of the year.
Operator, we are ready for our first question."

If that's so, could you just give those same sort of trends on a global bookings basis? And maybe I misunderstood that. And then secondly, kind of a high-level question. If you think about what you're doing with the business to help, you've done a lot of things to improve the cost structure as you're going into and then out of COVID. How would you describe what you've done to try to improve the bookings growth and the revenue growth pre versus post-COVID? What do you think are the best ways to get the growth to reaccelerate from where the business was prior to COVID?"

First of all, the answer to your first question is, those numbers are global. That is our entire business collectively, not just the U.S. The U.S. is stronger for sure, helping that number up, but those are global numbers.
As for beyond the cost structure, I'd say we're doing tons of work, and I'll start by, unfortunately, reiterating all the work we're doing on the marketing side, the work we're doing to simplify and combine our performance marketing team, tools, capabilities, data analytics. That's a huge benefit for us as we go into the future, into the post-COVID time and our ability to compete in the performance channels in the most effective ways. We believe we can do better and do more on the brand building side and to create that direct customer relationship.
And then that bleeds all the way down through, of course, the importance of doing the product right, getting the engagement right, improving the apps, improving the technology, using AI to improve the customer experience. So all of those things are the classic sort of virtuous cycle of, can you get them in the door? Can you make them love you? Is the experience great? Does it help them find what they want? So there's a ton of work. All that work I talk about on the platform side is not about efficiencies, although it does create efficiencies. What it really creates is agility and the ability to serve the customer better and create a stronger tie to that customer and repeat and loyalty and lifetime value.
So it's really an exercise in all the pieces, but we are getting sharper on all elements, whether it's the brand proposition for every brand, whether it's the geographic proposition for every geo and brand and then what that customer experience is like all the way to the end, through service. And it's all those pieces. So we're investing across the board in terms of our energy and time. And I think those pieces will start to multiply on themselves as we get more and more of them sort of across the road as it were. So lots of good work going on. Some things are a lot further along than others, but I think you'll continue to see improvement across all those categories."

I'll maybe take the second one first. Yes.

Thanks, Justin. I'll maybe take the second one first. Yes. I mean, we've spent a fair amount of time getting to a new brand proposition, a bunch of new capabilities and things we wanted to talk to the consumers about and are just at the early stages of rolling out our Expedia brand campaign. That is a heavy brand campaign across multiple markets, and we think it has great opportunity.
But to be clear, brand marketing is somewhat art, not just all science. And it does take time to pay its rewards. We do believe, though, that by being more up-funnel, by being more efficient in performance and allowing us to put more money up-funnel, we can drive greater long-term returns. Now it's not a quick twitch muscle. As I said, brand marketing is not like you run a great ad and tomorrow everybody books. It takes repeat. It takes sinking in that brand proposition and getting everybody focused on your name, and then it starts to pay rewards in performance. It starts to pay rewards in direct. It starts to pay rewards across a lot of things. So we believe in that opportunity. We will invest in that opportunity. And it will take some time to pay out. It's not like performance. It's not like you're buying the transaction every time you do it.
On the Vrbo front, let me just look at the percent of bookings and growth rates. So I think we don't break those numbers out separately. I would say Vrbo is doing great. The U.S. is particularly strong. But as I said, in all our strongest markets, we are showing share gains. And Vrbo is clearly and vacation rentals in general are clearly in very positive territory, and that is helping bring up all our numbers, no doubt. But we don't break them out separately. And so I think it's just we view it as part of the business. And as I've said before, the long-term plan for Vrbo or vacation rentals more generally is to have them available through all our brands in the most optimal way for the customer. So that's where we are."

Also on distributing that inventory from a vacation rental standpoint, ultimately through EPS or Expedia Partner Services as well, we think that's a meaningful opportunity for us as well. And then on the marketing side, if you look at year-over-year going to 2018, 2019 and then 2021, our marketing spend as a percent of revenue has come down quite a bit when you compare against those. And yet we are spending heavily into brand, and we're continuing to spend in performance channels as well. And we're also seeing given all the work that the teams have done, where we're getting good share of voice, share of wallet, if you will, at ROAS that are higher than we've traditionally seen. So still a lot to learn how that's going to flow through the P&L over time, as Peter mentioned, but we feel pretty good about the investments that we're making at this time."

We did a lot of things that we thought were the right things to do for the long-term health of the company. But we have invested in lots of people, talent, marketing, all kinds of things, technology. So I think we've done the right stuff across what we thought was the right way to shape the business. And as you'll recall, we set out to do that before COVID even hit. So that was the plan. That has been the plan. And we feel good about where we've gone to.
Now are there places we want to invest in? Absolutely. Do we want to bring in and retain the best talent at our company? Absolutely. We are making those moves. We've brought in lots of great new talent. We have changed, as Eric alluded to, our equity and bonus structure to reward our people for growth. So we will continue to invest in the things that will drive our business, much of which is people and their ability to build great tech and tools and products and services and then people to help externalize all the great stuff we're building on the B2B side and of course, on the consumer side. So we don't feel like, in any way, we're in an unstable position. We have a lot of moving parts. We're trying to change a lot. There's no question. And we think all of it has great opportunities. And will we break something along the way, stumble once or twice, I'm sure we will. But in general, we are feeling like we are in a good position. And if anything, we'll continue to invest into the growth as the returns come in.
As far as brand campaigns are concerned, no, we are not about hoping that works and just shifting money around. Our whole proposition is that we believe we can do better on the performance marketing side. We can be better, be more efficient, be more competitive. And by doing so free up capital, if you will, to go upstream, up-funnel to push into the brand side. We test our way through all that just as we've tested coming off Google meta for VR and other meta for VR. That's had a really positive impact. We will test more things. We will get smarter. And as I alluded to quarters ago, we are getting into being able, our goal is getting to the point where we can build algorithms to maximize for multi-brand and do things we've just never been able to do before. So that's the opportunity. And we are leaning into both of that from a technical standpoint.
And yes, we are spending up more now that the market is coming back. So both of those things are true, but we believe we can do it more efficiently. As Eric said, maintain higher ROAS in that and then redeploy some of that capital back to the front end to drive that brand awareness, where we think we can also do better than we have historically and spend that money more efficiently. So it's sort of, again, a virtuous cycle. We got to do all those parts. It's a lot, but it's not a hope and a prayer and just moving money around. We want to be as efficient as we can and buy good growth in performance marketing, and we want to use brand to its greatest effect."

As you are discovering where the optimum ROAS can be, how should we think about the split of your ad budget between performance and brand advertising as we look forward? How do you think it compares to where it has been in the past? And then secondarily, you are making a big push towards loyalty. I think you, in your recent announcement, talked about gaining around 25 million new loyalty members. How does that affect the P&L in terms of how you accrue for the loyalty rewards?"

Which is, on the loyalty side, we felt like there's a big opportunity, particularly in Brand Expedia, to drive loyalty. And those learnings will no doubt help other brands for us. But we felt like we were leaving a lot of customers on the side because of how we made them sign up, what they had to go through, et cetera. And the truth is, for a customer, it's a much better experience if they become a loyalty member. They get to see loyalty rates. They get a lot of benefits. And in general, they consume more.
And the returns on those loyal customers are higher than the returns on people who are not members. So while there may be accounting that has to get accrued for over time, the return on that customer's performance is much greater. It's been proven over and over again in our brands. So this is really just opening up a window, making it easier and better for the customer, helping them see the benefits, allowing them to see the benefits earlier, if you will. And I think there's nothing but upside and good stuff there so, both for the company and for the customer.
As far as the ROAS goes, we talk about this a lot. We don't really know where it's going to balance out. We are trying to take as scientific an approach as we can to driving returns through our marketing area. So it will be a bunch of learn as we go. We are testing and learning, even as we speak, a bunch of things across on and off different brands and different geographies and seeing what happens. From a performance marketing standpoint, we will be testing into brand spend as well by geography and by brand. So we're going to learn. It's going to take some time, but we believe with the benefit of a really strong team on the brand side and a really strong team on the performance marketing side, for the first time, once we get all these things consolidated and the technology working the right way, we are going to have, it's going to be a fair fight, and we're going to be in a position to outperform the competition in a way we just haven't been for a long time."

I think the hardest, biggest lift is really on the platform and the technology and the product. And a lot of that's been organizational, getting the right pieces of the company together in the right way and organized under the right leaders so that we could drive this journey we have to drive from getting to this complicated siloed technology we had before to a much more clean, high efficiency, agile construct. So that's where the most, I would say, the most energy is going in. And frankly, it's a tale of 1,000 stories. Different parts of that journey are in different states of completeness.
But that creates, to your second question, I would say, the most opportunity going forward because every time we get a win there, and I've talked in the past, whether it's about multiple checkouts becoming one checkout or multiple identity features becoming one identity, it gives you both speed and better consumer experience and better ability to improve on that as well as efficiency and the ability to redeploy that resource to other higher return opportunities. So that's both an efficiency opportunity, but I would think of it more as the opportunity to invest that talent into new growth as we go forward. So we are still in the middle of many of those things still being fully equipped as if they were run as 6 or 8 or 10 separate things. We will get to a place where we have one strong, robust thing and those resources can, some of those resources can get to higher-value returns.
And then as far as marketing and the other and cutting costs, again, the cost side will come from what I just described. We continue to see opportunities. Many of the things Eric's talked about that have already borne fruit in terms of cost savings, like our voice platform, et cetera, have much more opportunity to go and more running room. So we see that continuing to happen. We're creating great new tools on the service side, which are creating the opportunity to serve our customers much more efficiently, not just through technology, but also through technology assisting humans. So there's all kinds of places that I think there's more opportunity to get more efficient. But we really view, I think Eric and I think about it as, it's really the opportunity to reinvest back in the business when we have those efficiencies as opposed to, do we just keep cutting for more margins. So there's plenty of opportunity on the margin side, I would say, as we reinflate with travel. And on the flip side, we believe we've made good progress, but there's still a long way to go and a lot of opportunity.
What did I miss? And sorry, on the ROIs for direct traffic, for mix and direct traffic, I would say, sort of a warning here. I think during COVID, it can be very misleading. Most of us in the travel space have seen really good numbers on direct traffic, on mobile use and all that because our most loyal customers, when we weren't marketing as much were a bigger part of our mix than they might otherwise be. I think as we start to reinflate again in terms of a more natural travel market, those dynamics may shift somewhat. But definitely, we continue to push all-in on app usage, on direct relationships, on getting out of the auctions as much as we can. So the mix has definitely shifted in our favor in terms of direct traffic, in terms of app and mobile use, et cetera, but I don't want to put too much on it because I'm not sure where it's going to normalize out when the market returns globally."

There is a lot of demand, and we're focused, as you would imagine, in the most high-traffic areas where we need and can sell as much new inventory as we can get. We introduced a new product, which we called the Fast Start program, where we essentially take successful hosts that are highly rated from other platforms and we launch them quickly into our platform and instead of having to rebuild their stature as a highly reviewed host, we sort of take as a proxy their experience elsewhere, and we put them, if you will, very high in the sort and allow them to start up their business with us.
But the reality is that Vrbo hosts on balance make more than Airbnb hosts on average. And it's a great opportunity for people to monetize their assets. We think it's better than any other similarly situated one. And we think owners of properties are increasingly becoming aware of that as our brand becomes more ubiquitous and as people become more used to the products. So all our stats make for a great sales story. We just have to get it out there, and we're spending more to get that story out there. Do you want?"

In regards to your question on the booking trends, we continue to see elevated in the next 30 days unconventional lodging, but it has come down from what we saw during the, call it, the depths of the pandemic. We're continuing to see, obviously, very strong demand for the summer. And even off a very small base, we're seeing healthy demand for the holiday period as well. So we're starting to see it extend into away from the 0 to 7 days or very near term into more healthy time periods as well and more distributed to what we have seen historically. And I would say that's a similar story on the Vrbo side as well. But typically, it has longer booking cycles, and we continue to see that as well."

U.S. domestic travel itself cannot get us back to where we used to be on a stand-alone basis. Having said that, U.S. domestic travel is higher than U.S. domestic travel used to be and was in 2019. We've seen that effect. And we're not disclosing the U.S. market, the market's growth or not in terms of our performance, but yes, the U.S. is strong. It's driving a lot and it's carrying the weight for a lot of other markets that are still closed, frankly. So we feel very good about where the U.S. is. We hope for a lot of reasons that the rest of the world comes back, not just for our business but for their own lives. But that's where we need more to open up."

And then the second one was just a follow-up to Naved's question at Vrbo.

On the commercial agreement itself, that in excess of $60 million based on 2019 volume. That is for the entire supply relationship that we will have with the combined business. And there are components of that, that's obviously Egencia and distribution that we're putting in. And obviously, we want to have a much larger relationship with them as well.

Now is that sustainable? Will people go back to resorts and other things? I've said publicly that I believe, in general, the trends of the past will continue. But one of the trends of the past was that people were getting more and more into the use case of vacation rentals. So I think we have accelerated that. We've exposed more people to the product. And that's a good long-term trend for that category. But I don't think -- and will make people consider vacation rental as part of their choices where maybe before they had not. But I don't think we're necessarily going to be seeing a huge shift that sustains itself long-term so much as maybe a reset at a higher level for vacation rentals and then growing off of that."

So anything you're seeing so far in the data at the customer-by-customer level or otherwise that can either confirm or deny the notion in the activity that you're seeing? Whether they seem more willing to splash out for more luxurious accommodations or staying longer, that sort of thing? And I think you brought up reducing friction, I think in your prepared remarks.

Thanks for the question, Stephen. I'm rooting for revenge travel, whatever that is. Whatever kind of travel people want to do, we're happy to accommodate it, revenge or otherwise. I think we definitely were seeing earlier in the pandemic these longer stays, certainly in the vacation rental space, et cetera. I think things have normalized somewhat from that. But in general, those stays are longer still on an average basis. And I think we're seeing ADRs are higher for us and people are spending more.
Now that's a little bit of mix, but it's also that hotels and vacation rentals and desirable places have been able to push price and consumers have been willing to pay for it. And I would say that revenge or otherwise, places like Miami demonstrate that there is huge pent-up demand to go to places where people can experience a relatively normal travel experience. And I don't know if you've been to Miami recently, but it is packed. The hotels are full. People are out everywhere. Restaurants are full. So I think that and their booking levels are well above 2 years ago.
So if you just think about that in a macro way, you say, okay, where people can travel, where they can have a normal experience, where they feel like they're comfortable, free, whatever your words are, there is a huge amount of demand for that. So obviously, it will spread out across the globe as more places are like Miami, but I think that demonstrates in a sense that there is pent-up demand for the places and the things where people can spend money."

As far as the work-from-home trends go, yes, we've been leaning into this from the beginning. Vrbo was pushing a lot of sort of staycations, stay nearby, school from home and making sure people understood what the WiFi and other things were. So we've understood these trends to the extent we could, and we've tried to lean into that consumer interest. I think longer term, we, like every company, and certainly like every tech company, are dealing with the work-from-home questions and the flexible work of the future. I think, clearly, what we've seen suggests that the world will be more flexible.

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us today for our Q2 earnings call. I'll be relatively brief. And then Eric will take over, and we'll take some questions.
I'll open with saying that, in general, Q2 was quite strong and a major improvement on Q1, and we were pleased with the progress we made with particular strength in North America and the U.S. As I've said before, the market has been driven by a lot of COVID-related changes in patterns. Domestic travel has been stronger, VR, stronger whereas international travel, corporate travel, even big city travel has been relatively muted comparatively. The good news in that is that we find ourselves in a relatively stronger position in the U.S., our largest market and the largest travel market. But in places like APAC where we have a large international business, that obviously has not responded as quickly. So as we look across our performance, there's all those moving parts in the mix. And together, what that delivered in the second quarter was general improvement in the April, May time period and another step up and a significant step up in June, not unlike what we saw in the first quarter with a step up in March.
July has been impacted somewhat by Delta and the Delta variant, and we've seen some backwards movement in July, but in general, still relatively stronger performance compared to earlier parts of COVID.
As it pertains to travel patterns, I think it's important to keep in mind that, obviously, we don't know where Delta is going. Places like Australia have had shutdowns. Whereas other parts of the world, including parts for EMEA, things are opening up somewhat more. But there's a lot of unknowns, including in the U.S., and we're starting to see some of that percolate through cancellation rates and more volatility in the numbers.
I think it's also important to keep in mind that as we move into the fourth quarter, where traditional trends would have had a leisure coming off and corporate coming up, et cetera. There's remain a bunch of unknowns across the globe in terms of back-to-school, back to work and how people will travel in this portion of our COVID times.
That being said, as we focused on marketing, Q2 was obviously a time of relative strength, and we aggressively pushed into marketing. We saw the opportunity to get in front of the building momentum in travel. And as we've talked about before, we have a long-term goal of building more brand recognition and pushing more into brand marketing, creating longer-term relationships with customers.
Performance Marketing, on the other hand, remained considerably volatile, especially as we've seen cancellation rates more recently growing slightly. So we were relatively lean in, in Q2. We expect to be leaned in, in Q3, but with a bias towards brand building for the long-term relationships with customers. And we do believe whenever COVID subsides in a way that gives people real comfort. There's so much pent-up demand that travel will outstrip anything we've really ever seen before around the globe.
And as we move building, I just want to emphasize that this is an area where we felt there was opportunity to be stronger. Jon Gieselman joined us in middle of the quarter. Jon is a great talent coming to us from Apple. He is a terrific brand builder. And brand and performance marketing work together. We have to really define and build our brands and I talked extensively in the past about rationalizing the brands, making them work together and allocating capital appropriately and with great confidence. And what Jon will bring and has already brought to the organization.
Likewise, on the tech side, we brought in a net CTO, Rathi Murthy from Verizon Media. This again, is an emphasis, I've spoken about this several times, but we have to be a technology-first company. And to do that, we need great technology leadership. Rathi brings a world of experience to us. And as we move from our multi-stack multi-domain enterprise that we've had historically into 1 platform that can service all our brands and all our business partners. It was really important to have great technical leadership across the organization. So I won't belabor every technical gain, but we are making real progress. We have plenty of work still to do, but we are feeling quite optimistic about Rathi and the changes that she is bringing.
So in general, as we watch COVID play out, we're focusing really on investing in our technology and people, organizing our brands and out getting capital appropriately among them, simplifying our business and of course, maintaining the rigor we've had around driving margin improvement. And more broadly, we believe that as vaccines continue to roll out across the globe, that will bring greater security, greater comfort and greater willingness to travel, but the road may still be bumpy for a while as we watch all the variants play out and various government responses to them.
I'll just close by saying we launch today something very important to us that our employees are passionate about, which is a partnership with UNICEF wherein we will drive for every app transaction we have in the company, we will donate to UNICEF to drive vaccination into the developing world. It's clear that not everyone has the access that the Western world has to vaccines, and it's our view that until the world is more fully vaccinated. We really can't expect travel broadly to be back to normal. So we believe in the movement. We believe in the equitable distribution of vaccines. We want to drive that for all the obvious societal benefits and ultimately because it's good for our long-term business goals.
So with that, I will turn it over to Eric. Thank you."

This is around driving margin expansion through better unit economics. And since that time, we've made significant progress reshaping our cost structure through the fixed and variable cost initiatives we've outlined in detail on previous calls. Another major focus has and will continue to be on simplifying our business to help enable the company do it faster and also ensure we're focusing on the most attractive opportunities for future growth and profitability. This has included selling or shutting down businesses we viewed as noncore to the business going forward.
To put this into perspective, since the beginning of 2020, we have either shut down or sold 8 businesses, and these simplification efforts have continued with the sale of ALIS last month, which I would point out will have an immaterial impact to our financials.
In addition, in early May, we announced the binding offer from Amex GBT to acquire our Agency business. Since then, we have been diligently working through different aspects of the offer, and this week, we officially accepted GBT's offer. Based on where things currently stand, including all relevant regulatory authorities have cleared the transaction and all relevant employee consultations have been completed. We now anticipate closing the transaction during this year 2021. As a reminder, the deal includes 2 major pieces we outlined last quarter, and we remain very excited about.
First, we will have a minority position -- ownership position in the combined business. And second, we will also enter into a 10-year lodging supply agreement between Amex GBT and EPS. Finally, this deal further illustrates the continued progress on simplifying our business.
Now shifting to the P&L. On revenue, total revenue was down approximately 33% versus Q2 2019, which was a meaningful improvement from last quarter with revenue down approximately 52%. We saw continued strength from Vrbo and improving trends within our hotel business, while ADRs were effectively up across the board from last quarter. From a geography perspective, on a revenue basis, the U.S. showed meaningful sequential improvement Q2. EMEA revenue also improved and LatAm and APAC revenue remains relatively flat versus Q1. 
On our cost basis and overhead, we have significantly improved our cost basis versus prepandemic levels, which is reflective on the considerable progress we've made on the cost initiatives outlined in detail over the past 18 months or so. While we won't see full benefit in the financials until we return to more normalized business levels, we remain confident in realizing largely all of the fixed and variable cost savings targets by the end of this year. Overhead costs totaled approximately $544 million in Q2, an increase of approximately $40 million versus last quarter, which was in line with our expectations. The increase sequentially was largely a result of the shift in compensation structure from bonus to salary, which took effect April 1, and we outlined on previous calls.
As it relates to sales and marketing, we increased our spend in Q2 driven by signs of a recovery, although total marketing spend was still well below prepandemic levels. For Q3, we are balancing investing into the recovery to build our brands with recent softening trends and bookings that we've observed in July that Peter mentioned. The net of all of this is we anticipate that we will further close the gap versus prepandemic spend, although it will still be well below Q3 of 2019. 
In total, adjusted EBITDA was $201 million and included a negative contribution from Egencia, which showed some improvement but continue to lag our retail business. We attribute the approximately $260 million of sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA to typical seasonality as well as the improving trends we've mentioned throughout the call.
On to free cash flow, which totaled approximately $2.3 billion in Q2 on a reported basis. Excluding the change in restricted cash, which is primarily driven by the change of Vrbo's deferred merchant bookings, free cash flow was approximately $1.8 billion.
Moving on to the capital structure. In terms of the balance sheet, we continue to be investment grade rated today and would point out that Moody's recently changed our outlook to stable from negative. There is also no change in our financial strategy going forward. We remain committed to delevering back to more historical levels as the recovery continues to progress, while also continuing to look for ways to reduce our cost of capital. With the underlying goal to be in a strong enough position to restart our capital return program to shareholders.
In May, given the positive trends we were witnessing combined with the confidence in our liquidity position, we paid down 50% of the preferred stock that we issued in 2020. We have the right to pay off the remaining balance at any time, and we're closely monitoring and intend to pay off when it's prudent to do so. So that's again something that we'll continue to watch over the course of the year and going forward. 
That said, I remain confident in our liquidity position, which includes approximately $5.5 billion in unrestricted cash as well as a $2 billion untapped revolver.
In closing, we're pleased with the further stabilization of our business in Q2 and remain optimistic about the future of travel, and that it will come back, as Peter mentioned earlier, and we like something that we haven't quite seen before.
And with that, Emma, we're ready to take our first question. Emma are you there?"

So on the first one, we -- our deferred merchant bookings balance was approximately 8 points to $4 billion as of the end of June.

There was an increase in what we call the core deferred merchant bookings, which is our more traditional or conventional launching business, and that reflects, obviously, improvement on our, I guess, that's compared to 2020. So I think you'll see on the core business that it's largely in line with where the real difference is coming on the Vrbo side of the business that ultimately -- and remember, that is restricted. So there's approximately $4.26 billion that's in that deferred merchant bookings for Vrbo, and that just reflects the healthy growth that we've seen in Vrbo that we've talked about a number of times before. But I would say that there's no increased risk, if you will, in that core CMB relative to, I think, where we were in 2019."

It's been very responsive to the new cycles. But we're obviously optimistic that more openings, talk of the U.S. opening to international vaccinated travel, et cetera, will create more opportunities, particularly, as I mentioned, in the international business, which has been a relative strength of ours.

And as we project forward into Q3 and beyond with those longer bookings, our hypothesis is, is that people have been exposed to the category. They've had a great experience. They're looking to book again. They also saw compression that was occurring, particularly during the summer. So people are going in and reserving the house that they want for, whether it's the holiday season or even into next year as well. So again, time will tell in Q3 and Q4 going forward what seasonality looks like in the state of the world that we're in, but we continue to see some really interesting trends from longer data bookings for Vrbo."

I think broadly, the brands are acting within a range, I would say, of performance. But we have seen, as I've mentioned, I think, before, opportunities, for example, in Australia, where our local brand, what if and and our local VR brands have performed very well because they had a domestic travel bias in that market and therefore, in a world where there was much more domestic travel, we leaned into those brands relative to leaning into, let's say, Expedia brand, which has more international appeal or an international travel appeal. So we've seen regional moves like that. I think broadly, though, and you see some reactions and we believe Hotels.com has a slightly higher percentage of unmanaged corporate travel within it. And of course, corporate travel has been greatly reduced during COVID. So we're seeing some movements like that. But I would say, broadly, the brands have performed within a range of one another. We are doing a lot of work to figure out long term how we want the brands to work together as a family of brands rather than as competitors. I've mentioned some of that within performance marketing, but I think you'll see that broadly across the enterprise. As Jon and the team get to rationalizing how those -- how we can make those brands all additive to one another as opposed to competitive. And we are continuing to market again, fairly aggressively behind the brand spend and my comment about the volatility in performance marketing is just to say there continues to be a lot of risk in getting over your SKUs in performance marketing because of the volatility and cancellation rates, shutdowns, other things. So on balance, we are slightly more biased towards brand building. And yes, this is a time where we feel, for the reasons I said that travel is going when it can rebound fully. It is going to be extremely robust, and this is not a time where we want to be quiet in the market. So we are doing lots of things, including our recent move to support UNICEF, et cetera, to get in line with our customer base, get them invested in our brands and in the relationship and drive that for when the future comes pouring in. And while that is volatile, and we don't exactly know when that will be, we know it's coming. So we want to make sure we're there for it."

And I'll just say, so a couple of things to think about there. First of all, as I mentioned, broadly, when you look at conventional lodging plus VR, we believe our position is stronger in the U.S. than pre-COVID. But again, that's not the same for all markets. And if you look at a market like EMEA, which came back strong over the summer and came back principally in domestic that obviously favors some of the other players. And our business in places like EMEA and APAC, as I mentioned, our more international focused. Now that goes to airlift as well because we're very good at delivering long-haul air, which has been virtually nonexistent during the COVID period. So you've seen, again, a bunch of these principles at play where we benefited from some others who have benefited from others. And we generally believe that international will be the next major thing to open up, and that favors our position in many of those markets. And we will see that rebound through that side of our business and through air and all the pieces that are attached to that. But that's really what's going on in market share. More than anything is this domestic versus international exercise. There's also more bookings into small markets as people have stayed domestic and gone to the equipment in the U.S. of the small motel, near national park, et cetera. That has not been a traditional strength of ours. We have been better in big cities. Big cities have lagged somewhat in New York, San Francisco, et cetera, Paris, London. So those factors are all at play. And I would just say that there's been a lot of activity at the lower end of the market and because of the domestic thing, and that's been driving a lot of room nights, but not necessarily a lot of dollars. So you're seeing shifts like that. We feel pretty good about our position definitely in the U.S. We'd obviously love to be strong in all dimensions of our game across the globe. But we think, again, that most of this reverts to the mean over time. And as it does, we will benefit from the return of international travel significantly where in many places in the world, that is the biggest part of our business."

On the Vrbo side, I think you've heard us a couple of times anyways continue to see -- we're seeing a nice performance. We continue to gain share in our primary markets in that business and feel really good about it. And on the conventional lodging side, we have seen continued improvement each month of Q2. We've seen a bit of a softening in July. But again, at this time, we're not going to go into detail on the breakdown between those 2. But net-net of both of those is that we feel good about where we are and the recovery that we're seeing during the quarter."

And I'll just go into the customer dynamics a little bit here, Brian, which is to say, I think they're in COVID broadly as everybody was marketing somewhat less. We saw a lot of direct business. We all -- we're happy about that, but it's more of a function of not going on searching the market unless we let people out in the market searching. I think as it has rebounded, headed more towards usual norms. But again, we've been perhaps somewhat more conservative on the performance marketing side because we -- with cancellation rates so high and other factors going on closures, et cetera. It's easy to spend a lot on performance marketing and not get the return because people don't end up traveling. So we are seeing, I would say, a mix relatively towards existing customers. I think that's what you see across the industry. It's why app usage is up and other things are growing. But again, I think as the market is rebounding and more people are out in the market searching, you'll start to see us get back to more normal relationship between old and new.
Now I will say, a big part of our focus as an enterprise is to create longer-term relationships and greater lifetime value and stickiness and love for our brands with our customers. That involves many things. Obviously, on the marketing side, on the product side, on the service side, all things we're focused on improving. So that 360 kind of enterprise effort, but we do intend and we do plan to build those customer relationships in a different way. We hope than historically where we've all had to go fishing in the Google plant or whatever, and that was the only place to find their business. So we're hoping to change those dynamics over time. But we have been -- we have seen, in general, during COVID a greater performance from existing customers."

I think vacation rentals versus hotel is fairly well understood. But are you noticing any change in terms of folks favoring the agency versus merchant because I'm sure they probably learned last year, they're paying ahead of time and trying to get refunds later on. It's probably something that they probably don't want to do again.

And here, feel free to add, but that hasn't necessarily changed our customer acquisition strategy, our sort strategy or whatever else in the end where our marketplace running a travel company, and our job here is to meet with customers and what they're looking for, that meets the needs and the use cases that they have, and we'll continue to do that.

And then we're seeing for core ADRs increase in some products more than others. So a bit more color there. So on the Vrbo and car side, I would say, in particular, have seen meaningful increases in their ADRs, whereas Air has started to recover, but clearly not to the extent of those other 2 and I would say the same for conventional lodging, it's sort of somewhere between higher than air, but not to the Vrbo and car side.
Projecting forward. We are, as I mentioned earlier, on the Vrbo side, for instance, continue to see bookings with those long booking windows. And if you end up with any kind of supply compression and/or that, that's what customers are comfortable traveling with. And again, as I mentioned earlier, I think people have really enjoyed that product experience. You can continue to expect it's very possible to expect that you would see that in Vrbo going forward. On the car side, listen, they got a supply issue. I think that's been discussed in various forms before, and that's going to take some time to work through. But how much demand remains for car as we get out of the summer season is a bit TBD. And as generally presuming that July is a bit of an anomaly, if things start to recover again, I think you would continue to see ADR increases or healthy levels, if you will, going forward. So again, I'm not going to get into specific. I'm trying to predict where exactly those are going to land, but that gives you a sense of the trends that we're seeing across the different products."

Countries have taken different approaches even within the EU. We spent a lot of time with EU commissioners about trying to synthesize the rules and make them consistent because people traveling within the EU have issues with what the protocols are. So it remains a big unknown. I would say we know that vaccines are definitely the biggest part of the answer, at least that we can see so far. And of course, there's lots of work going on, on other treatment protocols, et cetera, for COVID. So I think we'll continue to see improvements and ultimately, COVID will be something the world learns to live with. And people will be traveling again. So we're starting to see international travel. It's not zero. We're starting to see conversations today, the U.S. government, it was quoted that Biden is considering opening up the U.S. to foreign travelers who are vaccinated. So I think we'll continue to see that push as countries want to get their tourism businesses back and their business travel businesses back. So they're countervailing issues, and I think there will continue to be pressure for people to find ways to make it happen. But we're clearly not done seeing pockets of issues with COVID and reactions from local or national governments to that issue. So I think that's why I say there's a variety of unknowns out there, and we're just playing it out and trying not to end up upside down over marketing to a market that ends up with a problem. So that's one part of it.
And then on the Vrbo integration, I would say, it's work that continues. It's not where we want it to be. We have more content on BEx and actually on Hotels.com. But the end-to-end customer experience is not where we want it to be. So we are iterating on that as we continue to make progress towards unifying our tech stacks for our lodging business. It's a core part of that process. But I would say it's not the most important thing in that presence is a good opportunity for us and something we believe in, but there's a series of steps as we bring those stacks together. And it continues unabated, but it is -- but it's not where we want it to be yet."

So thanks, James. In terms of the CTO's top priorities, it's really as we move to one unified technology team and one unified architecture, the role of the CTO is to define where we're going, how we're doing it, what the rules of the road are and how we do this integration from going many stacks to few and we create this multi-tenant extensible kind of set of capabilities. And I think that's a -- it's a broad process. It cuts across all the technology in our enterprise. And Rathi is hard at work driving that. There's also -- as we get the back end, right, there's also the customer-facing side, which is all about the UI and UX. We want to be an app first company, and we're driving progress to be there. We want to be design focused and we have a focus on a new Head of Design, building our back capability in the enterprise. So it cuts across many things. And it's really about bringing excellence to all those disciplines so that we can just give the best customer experience we can and drive improvements across all the pieces, conversion, engagement, all the things we want to have.
As far as the marketing question goes and bringing our performance marketing together. I would say that number is up from 75 to probably closer to 85 to 90. But again, that's sort of a benchmark, which is to say it's how we're getting everything on common tools, common data sets, common algorithms, but it is -- what's exciting now is the opportunity to begin to test new algorithms, test opportunities across brands, test the opportunity to gain efficiencies and how we market multiple brands in performance marketing, et cetera. We're in the early days of that, but that is what these achievements of getting to the state have given us. And I would say we're in a funny time where traffic patterns are unusual because of COVID. So you're sort of testing it to new algorithms and doing a lot of new performance marketing against a backdrop that's a little bit unusual and confusing. So we don't always have the volumes to test everything. But there's a lot of exciting work going on there. And as I said, all we believe that will generate meaningful efficiencies and better operation in terms of performance marketing, but it is hard to benchmark because we don't have normal traffic levels and normal patterns. So it's hard to say it's going to give us x percent more efficiency or why we have to see it in action against a more typical backdrop. So more to come on that, but we're making steady and strong progress, and we're a long way down the consolidation of tools and data and all the things that those percentages referenced."

So for example, Vrbo has been an area of considerably increased investment. During the past several quarters, other opportunities regionally where we've put money, whether that's in traditional brand spend or social or other things. So regional brands, in some cases, have seen increases as well. I would say while we are leaning into that, and we are leaning into our biggest brands, obviously, in strong markets like the U.S. we believe we can do a lot better in terms of brand messaging, getting cleaner on the brand propositions. And as I mentioned, getting all the brands to work together as a family of brands as opposed to as sort of traditional almost competitors. So we think there's a lot of opportunity to not just spend into brand with a BioStorage brand building, but spend that money more efficiently against even stronger creative and more efficient ways to build brands. So I think there's a lot of opportunity there.
And yes, we intend to also grow in new geos as we refine our capabilities there and pick markets where we are going to go on the offensive. And then I think as far as performance goes. I think what we're talking about when I say we have a bias towards brand building is we want to build long-term relationships. But brand spend and performance work together and stronger brands are the better performing your performance marketing is. And as long as performance marketing to return kind of returns and can bring us the kinds of customers that are sticky and build long-term value, we will spend into that, and we will spend as much as that makes economic sense to do. So I don't think it's an either-or question. It's a question of right now having a bias again towards that brand building while we see how performance marketing shakes up. But as we get better, we believe we will be able to continue to invest in performance marketing more efficiently than we ever have and bring the right down to customers with the backdrop of brand building that really creates sticky customers for the future. So I think you'll see us do both, don't exactly know where the ratios will bear out. We think the company was over biased towards performance marketing because we just didn't have all the tools we needed across the brand enterprise, but we think now we are in a much different place. So that's where we're going to go.
And I think with that, I thank you, Andrew. I think we're at the end. So I just want to say thank you, everybody. Thanks for your time, and I hope we got all your questions answered, and we'll speak to you in a quarter. Take care."

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us today for our Q2 earnings call. I'll be relatively brief. And then Eric will take over, and we'll take some questions.
I'll open with saying that, in general, Q2 was quite strong and a major improvement on Q1, and we were pleased with the progress we made with particular strength in North America and the U.S. As I've said before, the market has been driven by a lot of COVID-related changes in patterns. Domestic travel has been stronger; VR, stronger; whereas international travel, corporate travel, even big city travel has been relatively muted comparatively. The good news in that is that we find ourselves in a relatively stronger position in the U.S., our largest market and the largest travel market. But in places like APAC where we have a largely international business, that obviously has not responded as quickly.
So as we look across our performance, there's all those moving parts in the mix. And together, what that delivered in the second quarter was general improvement in the April, May time period and another step up and a significant step up in June, not unlike what we saw in the first quarter with a step up in March. July has been impacted somewhat by Delta -- the Delta variant, and we've seen some backwards movement in July, but in general, still relatively stronger performance compared to earlier parts of COVID.
As it pertains to travel patterns, I think it's important to keep in mind that, obviously, we don't know where Delta is going. Places like Australia have had shutdowns. Whereas other parts of the world, including parts for EMEA, things are opening up somewhat more. But there's a lot of unknowns, including in the U.S., and we're starting to see some of that percolate through cancellation rates and more volatility in the numbers.
I think it's also important to keep in mind that as we move into the fourth quarter, where traditional trends would have had leisure coming off and corporate coming up, et cetera, there remain a bunch of unknowns across the globe in terms of back to school, back to work and how people will travel in this portion of our COVID times.
That being said, as we focused on marketing, Q2 was obviously a time of relative strength, and we aggressively pushed into marketing. We saw the opportunity to get in front of the building momentum in travel. And as we've talked about before, we have a long-term goal of building more brand recognition and pushing more into brand marketing, creating longer-term relationships with customers. 
Performance marketing, on the other hand, remained considerably volatile, especially as we've seen cancellation rates more recently growing slightly. So we were relatively leaned in, in Q2. We expect to be leaned in, in Q3, but with a bias towards brand building for the long-term relationships with customers. And we do believe whenever COVID subsides in a way that gives people real comfort, there's so much pent-up demand that travel will outstrip anything we've really ever seen before around the globe.
And as we move [ brand ] building, I just want to emphasize that this is an area where we felt there was opportunity to be stronger. Jon Gieselman joined us in middle of the quarter. Jon is a great talent, coming to us from Apple. He is a terrific brand builder. And brand and performance marketing work together. We have to really define and build our brands and I've talked extensively in the past about rationalizing the brands, making them work together and allocating capital appropriately. And we have great confidence in what Jon will bring and has already brought to the organization.
Likewise, on the tech side, we brought in a new CTO, Rathi Murthy from Verizon Media. This again, is an emphasis, I've spoken about this several times, but we have to be a technology-first company. And to do that, we need great technology leadership. Rathi brings a world of experience to us. And as we move from our multi-stack, multi-domain enterprise that we've had historically into 1 platform that can service all our brands and all our business partners, it was really important to have great technical leadership across the organization. So I won't belabor every technical gain, but we are making real progress. We have plenty of work still to do, but we are feeling quite optimistic about Rathi and the changes that she is bringing.
So in general, as we watch COVID play out, we're focusing really on investing in our technology and people, organizing our brands and out getting capital appropriately among them, simplifying our business and of course, maintaining the rigor we've had around driving margin improvement. And more broadly, we believe that as vaccines continue to roll out across the globe, that will bring greater security, greater comfort and greater willingness to travel, but the road may still be bumpy for a while as we watch all the variants play out and various government responses to them.
I'll just close by saying we launched today something very important to us that our employees are passionate about, which is a partnership with UNICEF wherein we will drive for every app transaction we have in the company, we will donate to UNICEF to drive vaccination into the developing world. It's clear that not everyone has the access that the Western world has to vaccines, and it's our view that until the world is more fully vaccinated, we really can't expect travel broadly to be back to normal. So we believe in the movement, we believe in the equitable distribution of vaccines, we want to drive that for all the obvious societal benefits and ultimately because it's good for our long-term business goals.
So with that, I will turn it over to Eric. Thank you."

And since that time, we've made significant progress reshaping our cost struc",923,"Thanks, Peter. In early 2020, I outlined multiple areas of focus, and I wanted to provide updates on them. This is around driving margin expansion through better unit economics. And since that time, we've made significant progress reshaping our cost structure through the fixed and variable cost initiatives we've outlined in detail on previous calls. Another major focus has and will continue to be on simplifying our business to help enable the company do it faster and also ensure we're focusing on the most attractive opportunities for future growth and profitability. This has included selling or shutting down businesses we viewed as noncore to the business going forward. To put this into perspective, since the beginning of 2020, we have either shut down or sold 8 businesses, and these simplification efforts have continued with the sale of ALICE last month, which I would point out will have an immaterial impact to our financials. 
In addition, in early May, we announced the binding offer from Amex GBT to acquire our Egencia business. Since then, we have been diligently working through different aspects of the offer, and this week, we officially accepted GBT's offer. Based on where things currently stand, including all relevant regulatory authorities have cleared the transaction and all relevant employee consultations have been completed, we now anticipate closing the transaction during this year 2021. As a reminder, the deal includes 2 major pieces we outlined last quarter, and remain very excited about. First, we will have a minority position -- ownership position in the combined business. And second, we will also enter into a 10-year lodging supply agreement between Amex GBT and EPS. Finally, this deal further illustrates the continued progress on simplifying our business. 
Now shifting to the P&L. On revenue, total revenue was down approximately 33% versus Q2 2019, which was a meaningful improvement from last quarter with revenue down approximately 52%. We saw continued strength from Vrbo and improving trends within our hotel business, while ADRs were effectively up across the board from last quarter. From a geography perspective, on a revenue basis, the U.S. showed meaningful sequential improvement Q2. EMEA revenue also improved and LatAm and APAC revenue remained roughly flat versus Q1.
On our cost basis and overhead, we have significantly improved our cost basis versus prepandemic levels, which is reflective on the considerable progress we've made on the cost initiatives outlined in detail over the past 18 months or so. While we won't see full benefit in the financials until we return to more normalized business levels, we remain confident in realizing largely all of the fixed and variable cost savings targets by the end of this year. Overhead costs totaled approximately $544 million in Q2, an increase of approximately $40 million versus last quarter, which was in line with our expectations. The increase sequentially was largely a result of the shift in compensation structure from bonus to salary, which took effect April 1, and we outlined on previous calls.
As it relates to sales and marketing, we increased our spend in Q2 driven by signs of a recovery, although total marketing spend was still well below prepandemic levels. For Q3, we are balancing investing into the recovery to build our brands with recent softening trends and bookings that we've observed in July that Peter mentioned. The net of all of this is we anticipate that we will further close the gap versus prepandemic spend, although it will still be well below Q3 of 2019.
In total, adjusted EBITDA was $201 million and included a negative contribution from Egencia, which showed some improvement but continued to lag our retail business. We attribute the approximately $260 million of sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA to typical seasonality as well as the improving trends we've mentioned throughout the call. On the free cash flow, which totaled approximately $2.3 billion in Q2 on a reported basis, excluding the change in restricted cash, which is primarily driven by the change of Vrbo's deferred merchant bookings, free cash flow was approximately $1.8 billion.
Moving on to the capital structure. In terms of the balance sheet, we continue to be investment-grade rated today and would point out that Moody's recently changed our outlook to stable from negative. There is also no change in our financial strategy going forward. We remain committed to delevering back to more historical levels as the recovery continues to progress, while also continuing to look for ways to reduce our cost of capital, with the underlying goal to be in a strong enough position to restart our capital return program to shareholders.
In May, given the positive trends we were witnessing combined with the confidence in our liquidity position, we paid down 50% of the preferred stock that we issued in 2020. We have the right to pay off the remaining balance at any time, and we're closely monitoring and intend to pay off when it's prudent to do so. So that's again something that we'll continue to watch over the course of the year and going forward. That said, I remain confident in our liquidity position, which includes approximately $5.5 billion in unrestricted cash as well as $2 billion untapped revolver.
In closing, we're pleased with the further stabilization of our business in Q2 and remain optimistic about the future of travel, and that it will come back, as Peter mentioned earlier, and will be like something that we haven't quite seen before.
And with that, Emma, we're ready to take our first question. Emma are you there?"

There was an increase in what we call the core deferred merchant bookings, which is our more traditional or conventional lodging business, and that reflects, obviously, improvement on our -- I guess, that's compared to 2020.
So I think you'll see on the core business that it's largely in line with. Where the real difference is, is coming on the Vrbo side of the business that ultimately -- and remember, that is restricted. So there's approximately $4.26 billion that's in that deferred merchant bookings for Vrbo, and that just reflects the healthy growth that we've seen in Vrbo that we've talked about a number of times before. But I would say that there's no increased risk, if you will, in that core DMB relative to, I think, where we were in 2019."

So hard to tell how the rest of Q3 will shake out. It's been very responsive to the new cycles. But we're obviously optimistic that more openings, talk of the U.S. opening to international vaccinated travel, et cetera, will create more opportunities, particularly, as I mentioned, in the international business, which has been a relative strength of ours. So June was a high point, July is looking a lot like April and May."

And as we project forward into Q3 and beyond with those longer bookings, our hypothesis is, is that people have been exposed to the category. They've had a great experience. They're looking to book again. They also saw compression that was occurring, particularly during the summer. So people are going in and reserving the house that they want for, whether it's the holiday season or even into next year as well.
So again, time will tell in Q3 and Q4 going forward what seasonality looks like in the state of the world that we're in, but we continue to see some really interesting trends from longer date of bookings for Vrbo."

So it is quite -- and we're seeing other shifts in booking windows across different products as well. And so being able to compare quarter-over-quarter to, again, historical quarters, it is quite difficult.

I think broadly, the brands are acting within a range, I would say, of performance. But we have seen, as I've mentioned, I think, before, opportunities, for example, in Australia, where our local brand, Wotif, and our local VR brand have performed very well because they had a domestic travel bias in that market and therefore, in a world where there was much more domestic travel, we leaned into those brands relative to leaning into, let's say, Expedia brand, which has more international appeal or an international travel appeal.
So we've seen regional moves like that. I think broadly, though, and you see some reactions and we believe Hotels.com has a slightly higher percentage of unmanaged corporate travel within it. And of course, corporate travel has been greatly reduced during COVID. So we're seeing some movements like that. But I would say, broadly, the brands have performed within a range of one another. We are doing a lot of work to figure out long term how we want the brands to work together as a family of brands rather than as competitors. I've mentioned some of that within performance marketing, but I think you'll see that broadly across the enterprise as Jon and the team get to rationalizing how those -- how we can make those brands all additive to one another as opposed to competitive.
And we are continuing to market, again, fairly aggressively behind the brand spend. And my comment about the volatility in performance marketing is just to say there continues to be a lot of risk in getting over your SKUs in performance marketing because of the volatility and cancellation rates, shutdowns, other things. So on balance, we are slightly more biased towards brand building. And yes, this is a time where we feel, for the reasons I said, that travel is going -- when it can rebound fully, it is going to be extremely robust, and this is not a time where we want to be quiet in the market.
So we are doing lots of things, including our recent move to support UNICEF, et cetera, to get in line with our customer base, get them invested in our brands and in the relationship and drive that for when the future comes pouring in. And while that is volatile, and we don't exactly know when that will be, we know it's coming. So we want to make sure we're there for it."

But truth be told that things are just moving around quite a bit when it comes to those booking windows.
And then from a take rate standpoint, it's really going to depend on those mix. And as Peter and I both mentioned, Vrbo continues to be strong. We've seen conventional hotels come back. Sequentially, we've seen that in air. We continue to see that in car, which has been quite strong as well and has a nice take rates associated with it.

And so market share is important. People are going to compare. You're down 26% bookings versus 19% to booking, which is in the low double digits. So just wondering if you can help us understand how you think about market share in your core U.S. and Europe markets right now.

And I'll just say, so a couple of things to think about there. First of all, as I mentioned, broadly, when you look at conventional lodging plus VR, we believe our position is stronger in the U.S. than pre-COVID. But",394,"Yes. Thanks for the question, Justin. And I'll just say, so a couple of things to think about there. First of all, as I mentioned, broadly, when you look at conventional lodging plus VR, we believe our position is stronger in the U.S. than pre-COVID. But again, that's not the same for all markets. And if you look at a market like EMEA, which came back strong over the summer and came back principally in domestic, that obviously favors some of the other players. And our business in places like EMEA and APAC, as I mentioned, are more international focused. Now that goes to airlift as well because we're very good at delivering long-haul air, which has been virtually nonexistent during the COVID period. 
So you've seen, again, a bunch of these principles at play where we benefited from some, others who have benefited from others. And we generally believe that international will be the next major thing to open up, and that favors our position in many of those markets. And we will see that rebound through that side of our business and through air and all the pieces that are attached to that. But that's really what's going on in market share. More than anything is this domestic versus international exercise.
There's also more bookings into small markets as people have stayed domestic and gone to the equivalent in the U.S. of the small motel near a national park, et cetera. That has not been a traditional strength of ours. We have been better in big cities. Big cities have lagged somewhat, New York, San Francisco, et cetera, Paris, London. So those factors are all at play. And I would just say that there's been a lot of activity at the lower end of the market because of the domestic thing, and that's been driving a lot of room nights, but not necessarily a lot of dollars. So you're seeing shifts like that.
We feel pretty good about our position definitely in the U.S. We'd obviously love to be strong in all dimensions of our game across the globe. But we think, again, that most of this reverts to the mean over time. And as it does, we will benefit from the return of international travel significantly where in many places in the world, that is the biggest part of our business."

And I'll just go into the customer dynamics a little bit here, Brian, which is to say, I think during COVID broadly as everybody was marketing somewhat less, we saw a lot of direct business. We all -- we're happy about that, but it's more of a function of not going out and searching the market unless we let people out in the market searching. I think as it has rebounded, it's headed more towards usual norms. But again, we've been perhaps somewhat more conservative on the performance marketing side because we -- with cancellation rates so high and other factors going on and closures, et cetera. It's easy to spend a lot on performance marketing and not get the return because people don't end up traveling. 
So we are seeing, I would say, a mix relatively towards existing customers. I think that's what you see across the industry. It's why app usage is up and other things are growing. But again, I think as the market is rebounding and more people are out in the market searching, you'll start to see us get back to more normal relationship between old and new.
Now I will say, a big part of our focus as an enterprise is to create longer-term relationships and greater lifetime value and stickiness and love for our brands with our customers. That involves many things. Obviously, on the marketing side, on the product side, on the service side, all things we're focused on improving. So that sort of 360 kind of enterprise effort, but we do intend and we do plan to build those customer relationships in a different way, we hope than historically, where we've all had to go fishing in the Google pond or whatever, and that was the only place to find their business. So we're hoping to change those dynamics over time. But we have been -- we have seen, in general during COVID, a greater performance from existing customers."

And here, feel free to add, but that hasn't necessarily changed our customer acquisition strategy, our sort strategy or whatever else. In the end, we're a marketplace running a travel company, and our job here is to meet with customers and what they're looking for, that meets the needs and the use cases that they have, and we'll continue to do that.

And then we're seeing for core ADRs increase in some products more than others. So a bit more color there. On the Vrbo and car side, I would say, in particular, I have seen meaningful increases in their ADRs, whereas air has started to recover, but clearly not to the extent of those other 2 and would say the same for conventional lodging as sort of somewhere in between, let's say, higher than air, but not to the Vrbo and car side.
Projecting forward, we are, as I mentioned earlier, on the Vrbo side, for instance, continue to see bookings with those long booking windows. And if you end up with any kind of supply compression and/or that, that's what customers are comfortable traveling with. And again, as I mentioned earlier, I think people have really enjoyed that product experience. You can continue to expect that -- it's very possible to expect that you would see that in Vrbo going forward.
On the car side, listen, they got a supply issue. I think that's been discussed in various forms before, and that's going to take some time to work through. But how much demand remains for car as we get out of the summer season is a bit TBD. And as -- generally, presuming that July is a bit of an anomaly, if things start to recover again, I think you would continue to see ADR increases or healthy levels, if you will, going forward. So again, I'm not going to get into specific. I'm trying to predict where exactly those are going to land, but that gives you a sense of the trends that we're seeing across the different products."

Countries have taken different approaches even within the EU. We spent a lot of time with EU commissioners about trying to synthesize the rules and make them consistent because people traveling within the EU have issues with what the protocols are. So it remains a big unknown. I would say we know that vaccines are definitely the biggest part of the answer, at least that we can see so far. And of course, there's lots of work going on, on other treatment protocols, et cetera, for COVID. So I think we'll continue to see improvements and ultimately, COVID will be something the world learns to live with. And people will be traveling again. 
So we're starting to see international travel. It's not zero. We're starting to see conversations. Today, the U.S. government -- it was quoted that Biden is considering opening up the U.S. to foreign travelers who are vaccinated. So I think we'll continue to see that push as countries want to get their tourism businesses back and their business travel businesses back. So they're countervailing issues, and I think there will continue to be pressure for people to find ways to make it happen. But we're clearly not done seeing pockets of issues with COVID and reactions from local or national governments to that issue. So I think that's why I say there's a variety of unknowns out there, and we're just playing it out and trying not to end up upside down over marketing to a market that ends up with a problem. So that's one part of it.
And then on the Vrbo integration, I would say, it's work that continues. It's not where we want it to be. We have more content on BEX and actually on Hotels.com. But the end-to-end customer experience is not where we want it to be. So we are iterating on that as we continue to make progress towards unifying our tech stacks for our lodging business. It's a core part of that process. But I would say it's not the most important thing in that, rather it is a good opportunity for us and something we believe in, but there's a series of steps as we bring those stacks together. And it continues unabated, but it is -- but it's not where we want it to be yet."

In terms of the CTO's top priorities, it's really as we move to one unified technology team and one unified architecture, the role of the CTO is to define where we're going, how we're doing it, what the rules of the road are and how we do this integration from going many stacks to few and we create this multi-tenet extensible kind of set of capabilities. And I think that's a -- it's a broad process. It cuts across all the technology in our enterprise. And Rathi is hard at work driving that.
There's also -- as we get the back end, right, there's also the customer-facing side, which is all about the UI and UX. We want to be an app first company, and we're driving progress to be there. We want to be design focused and we have a focus on a new Head of Design, building our back capability in the enterprise. So it cuts across many things. And it's really about bringing excellence to all those disciplines so that we can just give the best customer experience we can and drive improvements across all the pieces, conversion, engagement, all the things we want to have.
As far as the marketing question goes and bringing our performance marketing together, I would say that number is up from 75% to probably closer to 85% to 90%. But again, that's sort of a benchmark, which is to say it's how we're getting everything, common tools, common data sets, common algorithms, but it is -- what's exciting now is the opportunity to begin to test new algorithms, test opportunities across brands, test the opportunity to gain efficiencies and how we market multiple brands in performance marketing, et cetera. We're in the early days of that, but that is what these achievements of getting to the state have given us.
And I would say we're in a funny time where traffic patterns are unusual because of COVID. So you're sort of testing it, the new algorithms and doing a lot of new performance marketing against a backdrop that's a little bit unusual and confusing. So we don't always have the volumes to test everything. But there's a lot of exciting work going on there. And as I said, we believe that will generate meaningful efficiencies and better operation in terms of performance marketing, but it is hard to benchmark because we don't have normal traffic levels and normal patterns. So it's hard to say it's going to give us x percent more efficiency or y. We have to see it in action against a more typical backdrop. So more to come on that, but we're making steady and strong progress, and we're a long way down the consolidation of tools and data and all the things that those percentages referenced."

I would say while we are leaning into that, and we are leaning into our biggest brands, obviously, in strong markets like the U.S., we believe we can do a lot better in terms of brand messaging, getting cleaner on the brand propositions.
And as I mentioned, getting all the brands to work together as a family of brands as opposed to as sort of traditional almost competitors. So we think there's a lot of opportunity to not just spend into brand with a bias towards brand building, but spend that money more efficiently against even stronger creative and more efficient ways to build brands. So I think there's a lot of opportunity there. And yes, we intend to also grow in new geos as we refine our capabilities there and pick markets where we are going to go on the offensive.
And then I think as far as performance goes. I think what we're talking about when I say we have a bias towards brand building is we want to build long-term relationships. But brand spend and performance work together. The stronger your brands are, the better performing your performance marketing is. And as long as performance marketing can return the kind of returns and bring us the kinds of customers that are sticky and build long-term value, we will spend into that, and we will spend as much as that makes economic sense to do.
So I don't think it's an either-or question. It's a question of right now having a bias again towards that brand building while we see how performance marketing shakes up. But as we get better, we believe we will be able to continue to invest in performance marketing more efficiently than we ever have and bring it right down to customers with the backdrop of brand building that really creates sticky customers for the future.
So I think you'll see us do both. Don't exactly know where the ratios will bear out. We think the company was over biased towards performance marketing because we just didn't have all the tools we needed across the brand enterprise, but we think now we are in a much different place. So that's where we're going to go.
And I think with that, I thank you, Andrew. I think we're at the end. So I just want to say thank you, everybody. Thanks for your time, and I hope we got all your questions answered, and we'll speak to you in a quarter. Take care."

Eric and I will make some brief comments and then, of course, take questions. 
Let me begin by saying we're very pleased with the quarter we had in Q3, nearly matching our adjusted net income and EBITDA from 2019. But I would add that, but for Delta, this would have been our most profitable quarter ever. And I think it's a tremendous milestone for the company to be here while we are still in the dose of COVID and still coming out and a testament really to the work we've done to simplify the company, to focus on technology and to run the business more efficiently. And with that performance and what we're seeing in the market,  we have the confidence to further pay down our preferred stock, which we did a few weeks ago, as you would have noted, which, of course, is another big milestone for us, putting COVID behind us. 
As far as the trends for the quarter go, I'll do a high level, and Eric will give a little more detail. But we went into the quarter following a strong Q2 and good momentum. But as we remarked last quarter, Delta had begun to have impact. We saw it impact cancellations. We saw it impact booking trends. And -- but as we go through August and into September, the Delta fears, particularly in the U.S. began to wane, and we ended stronger in the back half of September, and that has continued through into the fourth quarter with even greater strength. We've seen improvement across all segments, really, well, leisure and domestic have led even those segments, which have been harder hit like corporate and international travel have been coming back. Cities have been returning as well. And so all in all, it's been a broad-based recovery. but it has been led, obviously, still by leisure and domestic travel. And for us, Vrbo has been a particular highlight and beneficiary of that. 
A few highlights on Vrbo since you always ask. We've seen a strong share growth in our focus markets, and in particular, in the U.S. About half of our customers so far in 2021, more than half have been new customers. We expect to book in excess of $2 billion of earnings for new Vrbo hosts who came on the platform this year. And looking ahead, we are already seeing better bookings for next summer than we saw at this time last year. So the trends continue to be quite strong there. And while the story will continue to be impacted greatly by mix effect, which I've talked about before, we are feeling more and more confident. And as international vectors open up, which you've no doubt all read about, this is a particular strength of ours historically. And we think, again, that is a mix effect, which will generally benefit us. 
And COVID recovery, of course, remains somewhat bumpy and is unpredictable to say the least, but we are feeling good. And at every turn, we are seeing demonstrated that when people can travel, they will travel for business or pleasure and everything in between. And we are looking forward to seeing the rest of our business return. 
In terms of some of the details in the business, on the marketing and brand side, our focus continues to be on bringing customers efficiently back to the platform and retain those customers for the long term and building those long-term direct relationships. Obviously, the better our product is, the better our customer experience is and the proposition. All those things add to that direct relationship, and we are feeling confident about the work we are doing on all fronts. But marketing, of course, is the tip of the spear. And with our new focus on being a family of brands, we have launched -- announced that we will be launching 1 loyalty program, which will actually across all our brands and all our products. 
We think it will be the most powerful loyalty program in the industry, and we are really excited about bringing that extra usability and added value to our customers through that loyalty plan because when we get to a place where people can use it across all brands, across all products, we think that just adds tremendous value to the customer. And you should expect to see us do more of that. We will be looking for more ways to unify our brands in the united front of bringing value to the customer in every way we can. 
We spent the better part of the last 6 quarters, building out the organization and in particular, in the last few months, building our creative organization. We've improved, as I've talked about before, all our performance marketing tools and technology, and we're very excited about our position right now. But we went into the third quarter and specific with a much more aggressive posture, Delta hit. We have -- we pulled back somewhat. And now again, that we are seeing things growing and the recovery building again, we are leaning back in we intend to go on the offense with all the new tools we have in our arsenal and our marketing group, and we expect to go on offense and expand share across the world. 
On the B2B front, which we haven't talked about a lot in the past quarters, I just want to highlight a few things here. We brought our groups together, as I remarked last quarter, our supply team and our business, we had called Expedia Partner Solutions, which is a business we have used to power other partners in the travel industry. We brought those together basically in the last few months. And we're seeing lots and lots of opportunity for those businesses to build on the relationships we have with our supply partners, with our B2B partners and find increasing ways to drive their business and drive their success on our platform. But in particular, EPS itself has done well even during COVID. 
We've won wallet share with our partners. We've had many new signings. And for the first time in late October, we actually booked more business than we did in 2019 in that business, and that has continued into November. So great signs there. 
And then finally, on the Egencia  front, you've all seen. Earlier this week, we announced the conclusion of our transaction with Amex GBT. We have merged the Gentian to MexGVT. We will retain a significant equity interest. We feel really good about that. Corporate, we believe will become coming roaring back. And Egencia  even during this time of transition, had its highest signings this year that is ever signed in terms of new clients in the first half. So we'll have some good signs there. But I think that deal is also emblematic, as I said before, of our desire to power more of the industry. We want to power AlyxBT with our Expedia Partner Solutions business with our technology, with our supply, and that is something we will continue to build on as the months and years unfold. So very exciting. And I just want to thank the Egencia team who did a tremendous job building that business, getting it to a place where we could find such a great transaction to put it together with someone else and in working through the time we had during the transaction and doing just a terrific job. So I thank them and our Expedia team to help close that transaction. 
And then finally, while I've talked a lot about technology in the past, and I will keep this brief. I am as excited as I've ever been since I started about 18 months ago about where we are in terms of our technology evolution. We certainly have a lot of work left to do. But it can't be understated the importance of finally being aligned on our technology, on our road map, on our architecture. We have one plan and everybody is rowing together and our velocity is increasing. And I think delivery, most importantly, to the customer will increase along with it. But just for clarity, on the front end, we're focused on being at first data and design driven and focused really on personalization and using all the data and machine learning and the opportunities to create better and better experience for the customer and for our suppliers. 
And on the back end, we're really rearchitecting everything, as I've talked about, we're moving from this many technical stacks to 1 stack on 1 pool of data that serves all the outcomes, all our partners, all our customers, and it's really getting exciting. And finally, I just want to say this moment for us is really important as we move into 2022.  Getting all of this aligned, getting the work stream aligned, getting everybody on the same road map is a really powerful opportunity. And it reminds us that we're finally getting to what we wanted to be getting to, which is delivering new value to the customer. 
We've been internally focused for a lot of COVID. COVID was a tough thing to get through, but we are now in a position where  the entire company is aligned. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of COVID and the opportunity to innovate for the customer and bring great new products and value are really exciting to us, and we're looking forward to doing that. And with that, I will pass it over to Eric."

I'm also pleased with Peter mentioned with the overall recovery of our business. As you will see, it includes 2 quarters in a row of positive adjusted EBITDA.

As you will see, it includes 2 quarters in a row of positive adjusted EBITDA. And in Q3, excluding Egencia was roughly on par with the third quarter of 2019. And with that, I wanted to start by providing an update on the booking trends that we have seen and we are seeing following the pullback we witnessed for much of the third quarter and into the first part of September due to the Delta variant, we saw a notable broad-based improvement across geos and product lines. 
Overall total bookings for all products net of cancels were down 30% versus third quarter of 2019, which was slightly worse than the 26% decline we saw last quarter. Given the continued volatility of the recovery, we also want to provide additional monthly detail on our total lodging bookings net of cancels. That, of course, includes both hotel and Vrbo. And those were down approximately 17% in July, approximately 25% in August, 19% in September and further improved to down negative 2% in October. And again, that September was also down, of course. 
The trends in October that we saw, again, that was negative 2%, they did improve throughout that month, so we exited at a much improved rate relative to the start of that month. 
Moving to the P&L, starting with revenue. It was down approximately 17% versus third quarter of 2019, which was a meaningful improvement from last quarter with revenue down approximately 33%. We saw a significant improvement in both Vrbo and hotel revenue, which benefited from seasonally strong summer travel. Revenue margin for the third quarter was approximately 16%, up from approximately 10% last quarter. This was primarily due to typical third quarter seasonality in the business and product mix weighted towards launching. 
On sales and marketing direct spend in Q3 was approximately $1.1 billion, which is down approximately 19% versus third quarter of 2019 levels. And as Peter mentioned, we reduced spending given the reversal in trends we witnessed in the third quarter. However, going forward, given the more positive recent trends that we've discussed, we are again leading in the marketing spend in Q4. 
Moving on to overhead costs. They totaled approximately $530 million, a slight decrease versus last quarter and below our expectations. We saw lower-than-anticipated discretionary spend, which was down roughly 90% versus the third quarter of 2019 as employees continue to largely work from home in the quarter. I would also call out lower-than-anticipated hiring as there continues to be a high degree of competition for talent, especially for technology roles. 
Looking ahead, we expect overhead to increase by approximately $40 million sequentially in the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower capitalized labor due to the holidays as well as higher anticipated headcount and people costs. In total, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $855 million which is approximately $650 million improvement over the last quarter, driven primarily by typical seasonality. 
Moving on to free cash flow. We [indiscernible] negative $1.4 billion in Q3 on a reported basis. If we exclude the change in restricted cash, which is primarily driven by the change in Vrbo's deferred merchant bookings, free cash flow was negative approximately $450 million. As a reminder, the third quarter is traditionally a low quarter for free cash flow due to seasonality. 
In terms of the balance sheet, we continue to be investment grade-rated today. and remain committed to deleveraging back to more historical levels as well as further reducing our cost of capital. As you may recall, we refinanced some debt earlier this year, which yielded $80 million in annual interest rate savings. And last month, as Peter mentioned, given the improving trends and continued confidence in our liquidity position, we paid off the remainder of the preferred stock. In total, paying off all the preferred stock this year, it will save us approximately $115 million in annual dividend payout going forward. 
Finally, on to Egencia, I want to echo Peter's comments and thank the Egencia's team as well as all of those Expedia employees who are involved with Egencia for their dedication and hard work. 
I would also like to point out Page 17 of the earnings press release, which provides details on Egencia's financials. For the third quarter, Egencia generated $55 million in revenue and negative $18 million in adjusted EBITDA for the -- again, the third quarter. As it relates to Egencia costs in the third quarter 2021 rough numbers, but approximately $35 million was recorded in cost of sales, $20 million in sales and marketing and the remain roughly $20 million spread across tech content and G&A. 
Going forward, we will report our minority stake in the combined company within the Other net line of our income statement. And in terms of the 10-year lodging supply agreement with our Expedia Partner Services business has entered with the combined company, we will account for it like any other standard EPS deal. As a reminder, at 2019 volumes, we expect this deal, the EPS deal to be worth in excess of $60 million on an annualized basis for EBITDA. 
In closing, as Peter and I both mentioned, we're quite encouraged by recent trends and the pace of recovery is clearly improving. Things are getting better. And I remain truly and very optimistic about the future of travel and our company. And so with that, Charlie, we are ready for our first question."

I would say we are still working towards a better marketing world for the company overall, which, yes, means more efficiently being able to get customers. But it's a many-pronged attack. It's the performance marketing issues that I've talked about before. We have come a huge way in terms of the tools, the data and the algorithms, et cetera, but COVID has been a bumpy time. And we have not found normalized times to really get everything tuned exactly how we want. So yes, we believe there's opportunity ahead for that. We also believe opportunity for our brand teams to really be much more impactful than they have historically. And that has impact not only on driving direct customers, but it has an impact on how people respond to performance marketing and other things. So there's many places where those teams can have more impact and ultimately be more efficient in attracting customers. But it's not entirely on them, right? 
We've got to build better products. We've got to have better engagement circles for the customer. We've got improve our service. Every -- we need to improve in every part of our game to continue to make the customer stickier and bring them back and want them make this their place to come for travel. So marketing can be more efficient.  But it's really a virtuous cycle of how we stream marketing together with the experience and that. And with the new efficiencies that your second question goes to, all of that gives us more opportunity to reinvest in more profitable long-term customers and create long-term value for the enterprise."

Cities are picking up, International has picked up. There are -- virtually every area has seen growth. I will say that some of the benefit we have seen, I've talked about mix effects before. When cities were forbidden places, that obviously hurt us. Cities have been a great market for us. And as we've seen cities come back. Now there's great -- they're still greatly lagging major leisure destinations like beaches, but they're coming back and that return benefits us probably disproportionately compared to some others. 
So that mix effect thing. We had some winners and some losers as always, but we've seen cities come back more. We've seen relative to the growth we've seen in sort of the consistently strong leisure areas and the opening of international channels, the announcements from the U.S. from Singapore, et cetera, about allowing international travel, we see that lip up basically as soon as it's announced. We see search queries go up. And again, in places like EMEA, where we're traditionally stronger in international travel as compared to domestic, those openings, I think, all go well for us going forward. 
So it really is a broad-based recovery. I mean it is every -- I mean, not down to every country because there are in countries that have COVID spikes, et cetera, but down to every region. And some regions are trailing dramatically like APAC and Latin America, but they're improving, too. And so it's really broad-based, and it's just what the base you're building off of and some are different than others."

So we also have been strong in long-haul air for those travelers like all those mix effects actually impact things. And so some of them we won in. Vrbo has been a beneficiary. Some of them we lost in big cities and international travel. So it's always been a balance. 
We are less focused on room nights rather than room dollars, if you will. I mean, it's a little misleading. We could book 1 million more 1-Star hotels nights and it wouldn't mean much to our P&L, and we could book 100,000 5-star hotels, those would mean a lot. So you have to take it all in balance, but we are feeling good about the recovery. And in general, our numbers domestically are running ahead and lodging of where we were 2 years ago. So I think we're in good shape there, and we feel good about that. 
And again, we have had a somewhat conservative bent along the game with COVID. We've been -- Eric mentioned tapping the brakes, we tried to respond. Sometimes we get over SKUs, sometimes we're behind the recoveries. It's a balancing act.  But we are getting more confident, more aggressive. And I think you'll see us continue to lean in to gain share across the globe. In terms of the COVID question, it remains to be seen. And every -- as Eric said, every story is its own. But I will tell you, if you look at recent news, for example, of the COVID cases in the U.K. spiking from recent openings. And I was in London and it was amazingly open. I would say that queries have remained elevated since the international announcements to the U.S., and they remain elevated, and we have not seen a pullback from the caseload news. 
So I think that remains strong. And of course, science is helping us out along the way. We just announced that kids will be able to be vaccinated in the U.S., which is a great benefit for society, let alone our business. And likewise, the announcement today about the U.K. approving the Merck pill for treatment. This is -- I think we all agree, is probably going to be an endemic not a pandemic and the more treatments we get and the more ways we get to deal with it, the better off we're all going to be."

And second question, guys, coming back to capital return and how you're thinking about a more normalized environment, booking called out the ability to possibly return capital to shareholders as we get into early 2022.

But I would say that we continue to look tactically around the globe at what the right vectors are to focus on in terms of supply. 
I don't think we feel like we're terribly deficient, but we've been a little bit peanut buttered around the globe. As we did with Vrbo during COVID, we were very focused on those compression markets, freeing up supply there, making that supply really successful right out of the gate and that is the virtuous cycle that we think is most valuable. So we -- you will continue to see us do that for Vrbo, but you will also see us do that in a very targeted way around the globe. And that's with the focus that's tied into where we are marketing, where we are driving our brands, where we think we have the opportunity to win. And again, remember, in many markets around the globe, our B2B business, our Expedia Partner Solutions business drives those markets more than our direct relationship with consumers. And so driving the right supply to feed those businesses as well is a critical piece. 
So we will continue to drive into it. I would say, if anything, we've been relatively modest in terms of supply growth during COVID. with a particular focus, again, on Vrbo, which was a different use case. But as things are reopening, we're seeing more demand. You will see us go after in a targeted way more supply, and again, in a very targeted end-to-end way keying on the markets we're focusing on growing and where those markets want to travel to. So we feel very good about that opportunity. It's just a question of focus. It wasn't a big focus during COVID, but as things improve, we will continue to roll that out."

We've taken some great steps on that this year, and we'll continue to make progress as we move forward on it. And third, we, as a company, have traditionally been committed to returning capital to shareholders in different forms. 
I would say right now is, again, not necessarily the right time for us to do it, but it's certainly something that we're committed to doing over the long haul, and we'll just continue to serve and make what we deem to be, if you will, the right choices at the right time going forward."

But on the -- what are we doing side, we've done a tremendous amount to  work on the brand, to land the brand, to make people really think about it as a primary source of -- Vrbo as a primary source of vacation options. We've invested more than ever -- much more than ever in that brand. And we've really driven it hard. And as I mentioned, more than half our users so far this year our customers have been new customers to the experience, and we think the experience is great. So we do think we have sustainably landed the experience and the use case and the brand, and that will continue to benefit us for many years to come. How share exactly shakes out when the market moves back or people are going to cities. If things will change. We're not we're not strong everywhere. In terms of Vrbo supply, we are more focused on leisure destinations. 
But we think we have sustainably put Vrbo in the minds of many people and other brands in other parts of the world that are strong, like Stays in Australia, et cetera, and that is really a powerful long-term benefit for us."

And this is one of the powerful things that we talked about, new Vrbo customers coming on the platform, but imagine when  they're not only in the Vrbo product stream and enjoying that, but then they're earning value that they can use across air and other things when they have different travel needs. And likewise, the inverse, the Expedia and Hotels.com travelers who might want to rent a Vrbo for a vacation. So that expansion of being able to spend across all those brands, that architecture for our technology, which is really building everything we do into multi-tenet, ultimately having all our one app, all on one stack and one way that doesn't mean one of separate brands, but they'll run on the same technical infrastructure. They'll have their own differentiation for brand, et cetera, or products. But  it's all going to be built for multi-tenant. It's all going to be built for us and for our partners. 
And we have the richest data set really travel data set in the world. And that data set powers all our machine learning, all our AI and our ability to innovate constantly in terms of what the customer sees, how the partners participate, and that's just super powerful once we get it right.

You're on my favorite topic there, Andrew, on the second one, which is there are myriad opportunities. We have massive opportunities on the CRM front.

The ability to sell multiproduct, which we've been the leader in the industry for years, but honestly, it could be so much better at in terms of how our checkout pass work and how we get there. So there's -- I mean -- and everything I just said is measured in the billions or tens of billions of GBT opportunity, in my opinion. 
So I think they're really all over the place and many of them unlock and enable really big opportunities on the B2B front and our ability to power partners, power our suppliers, et cetera. So it's really -- I could give a dissertation for the next 2 hours on it, if you want to miss the Airbnb call. But in the meantime, suffice it to say that there are dozens of them around the company, and they are big rocks and big opportunities. 
As far as travel coming back and our friends leaning into marketing, we've kept a pretty consistent model. We've leaned into brand marketing. And frankly, we've been leaned into brand marketing even when maybe our brand marketing could be better and sharper and that's why we've rebuilt that team. We're bringing the creative teams in-house now and really going at it in a different way. But we expect to be balanced. We've seen our competitors move around and gyrate a bit. We've kind of kept to a balance between brand and performance. We feel like there's opportunity to be more aggressive as our performance marketing machine gets sharper and better and all the tools, right? 
We're seeing vectors of opportunity that we can lean into. And so we definitely will have opportunities to lean in, and I'm really excited about what our brand teams are going to do. Our brand teams are second to none in the industry. We will be the best in the industry. And our performance marketing is phenomenal, and finally brought together in a way that will be really powerful. 
So I think what that balance is, we'll have to -- as I mentioned, the market's got to normalize. We don't exactly know yet. But it is a virtuous cycle and the better our brand marketing is, the better our performance marketing will do. And we believe strongly in both, and we'll continue to kind of lean in, in a balanced way. I think our friends have gyrated a little more than us in and out of some of those things."

So I'll kind of take those in reverse, Dan, I think, which is Vrbo has consistently had a very strong direct business. I mentioned our continued investment in brand across the globe, really on Vrbo or its sister brands. We mentioned, I think, 2 or 3 quarters ago that we got out of -- we got out of performance marketing for Vrbo in the U.S., and it benefited from that with more direct traffic and having felt the effects of it. So I think we feel very good about the direct nature of that business. 
As far as how the product will continue to improve, how loyalty will add to it. Again, that's just other veins of opportunity for us across our Expedia customer base or Hotels customer base, et cetera. So we want to create the universe of people that want to move between our brands and use them and build value and use that value. So I think we will continue to see that. 
As far as rates and occupancy goes, rates have been -- ADR has been very strong throughout COVID. There's been a lot of competition for the product, and owners and managers know that, and they have pushed price where they could. And so we've seen a lot of price increases, and those have helped -- there seems to be no abating of those. And likewise, occupancy in those compressed markets, if you want to be on a beach in the Southeast, or on a beach in Hawaii at Christmas, good luck, it can't be done. So we're going to keep seeing that. I think that's why you're seeing this effect of, okay, I want to get out in front of next summer and get the house I want. And that's a great -- that's smart for the consumer, and it's great for the business, and it gives us a lot of confidence going into next year that this use case will continue to be highly top of mind for many consumers, and we are well positioned. 
So with that, I will thank you. Thanks, Dan. Thanks, everybody. I hope you all stay safe. Looking forward to watching travel recover, and feel free to start that corporate travel now that it's safe out there. Thanks for your time."

Eric and I will make some brief comments and then, of course, take questions.  
Let me begin by saying we're very pleased with the quarter we had in Q3, nearly matching our adjusted net income and EBITDA from 2019. But I would add that -- but for Delta, this would have been our most profitable quarter ever. And I think it's a tremendous milestone for the company to be here while we are still on the throes of COVID and still coming out. And a testament really to the work we've done to simplify the company, to focus on technology and to run the business more efficiently. 
And with that performance and what we're seeing in the market,  we have the confidence to further pay down our preferred stock, which we did a few weeks ago, as you would have noted and which, of course, is another big milestone for us, putting COVID behind us.  
As far as the trends for the quarter go, I'll do a high level and Eric will give a little more detail. But we went into the quarter following a strong Q2 and good momentum. But as we remarked last quarter, Delta had begun to have impact. We saw it impact cancellations. We saw it impact booking trends. And -- but as we got through August and into September, the Delta fears, particularly in the U.S. began to wane, and we ended stronger in the back half of September. And that has continued through into the fourth quarter with even greater strength. 
We've seen improvement across all segments, really. Well, leisure and domestic have led. Even those segments, which have been harder hit like corporate and international travel, have been coming back. Cities have been returning as well. And so all in all, it's been a broad-based recovery. but it has been led, obviously, still by leisure and domestic travel. And for us, Vrbo has been a particular highlight and beneficiary of that.  
A few highlights on Vrbo since you always ask. We've seen a strong share growth in our focus markets, and in particular, in the U.S. About half of our customers so far in 2021, more than half have been new customers. We expect to book in excess of $2 billion of earnings for new Vrbo hosts who came on the platform this year. And looking ahead, we're already seeing better bookings for next summer than we saw at this time last year. So the trends continue to be quite strong there. 
And while the story will continue to be impacted greatly by mix effect, which I've talked about before, we are feeling more and more confident. And as international vectors open up, which you've no doubt all read about, this is a particular strength of ours historically. And we think, again, that is a mix effect, which will generally benefit us.  
And COVID recovery, of course, remains somewhat bumpy and is unpredictable to say the least, but we are feeling good. And at every turn, we are seeing demonstrated that when people can travel, they will travel for business, for pleasure and everything in between, and we are looking forward to seeing the rest of our business return.  
In terms of some of the details in the business. On the marketing and brand side, our focus continues to be on bringing customers efficiently back to the platform and retain those customers for the long term and building those long-term direct relationships. Obviously, the better our product is, the better our customer experience is and the proposition, all those things add to that direct relationship, and we are feeling confident about the work we are doing on all fronts. But marketing, of course, is the tip of the spear. 
And with our new focus on being a family of brands, we have launched -- announced that we will be launching 1 loyalty program, which will actually cross all our brands and all our products.  We think it will be the most powerful loyalty program in the industry. And we are really excited about bringing that extra usability and added value to our customers through that loyalty plan. Because when we get to a place where people can use it across all brands, across all products, we think that just adds tremendous value to the customer. And you should expect to see us do more of that. We will be looking for more ways to unify our brands in the united front of bringing value to the customer in every way we can.  
We spent the better part of the last 6 quarters building out the organization, and in particular, in the last few months, building our creative organization. We've improved, as I've talked about before, all our performance marketing tools and technology. And we're very excited about our position right now. But we went into the third quarter and specific with a much more aggressive posture, Delta hit, we have -- we pulled back somewhat. And now again, that we are seeing things growing and the recovery building again. We are leaning back in. We intend to go on the offense with all the new tools we have in our arsenal and our marketing group, and we expect to go on offense and expand share across the world.  
On the B2B front, which we haven't talked about a lot in the past quarters, I just want to highlight a few things here. We brought our groups together. As I remarked last quarter, our supply team and our business, we had called Expedia Partner Solutions, which is a business we have used to power other partners in the travel industry. We brought those together officially in the last few months. And we're seeing lots and lots of opportunity for those businesses to build on the relationships we have with our supply partners, with our B2B partners and find increasing ways to drive their business and drive their success on our platform. 
But in particular, EPS itself has done well even during COVID.  We've won wallet share with our partners. We've had many new signings. And for the first time in late October, we actually booked more business than we did in 2019 in that business, and that has continued into November. So great signs there.  
And then finally, on the Egencia  front, you've all seen earlier this week, we announced the conclusion of our transaction with Amex GBT. We have merged Egencia and the Amex GBT. We will retain a significant equity interest. We feel really good about that. Corporate, we believe will become coming roaring back. And Egencia even during this time of transition had its highest signings this year that is ever signed in terms of new clients in the first half. So we'll have some good signs there. 
But I think that deal is also emblematic, as I said before, of our desire to power more of the industry. We want to power Amex GBT with our Expedia Partner Solutions business, with our technology, with our supply, and that is something we will continue to build on as the months and years unfold. So very exciting. And I just want to thank the Egencia team who did a tremendous job building that business, getting it to a place where we could find such a great transaction to put it together with someone else and in working through the time we had during the transaction and doing just a terrific job. So I thank them and our Expedia team who helped close that transaction.  
And then finally, while I've talked a lot about technology in the past, and I will keep this brief, I am as excited as I've ever been since I started about 18 months ago about where we are in terms of our technology evolution. We certainly have a lot of work left to do. But it can't be understated the importance of finally being aligned on our technology, on our road map, on our architecture. We have one plan, and everybody is growing together and our velocity is increasing. And I think delivery, most importantly, to the customer will increase along with it. 
But just for clarity, on the front end, we're focused on being at first data and design driven and focused really on personalization and using all the data and machine learning and the opportunities to create better and better experiences for the customer and for our suppliers.  
And on the back end, we're really rearchitecting everything. As I've talked about, we're moving from this many technical stacks to one stack on one pool of data that serves all the outcomes, all our partners, all our customers. And it's really getting exciting. 
And finally, I just want to say this moment for us is really important as we move into 2022. Getting all of this aligned, getting the work stream aligned, getting everybody on the same road map is a really powerful opportunity. And it reminds us that we're finally getting to what we wanted to be getting to, which is delivering new value to the customer.  
We've been internally focused for a lot of COVID. COVID was a tough thing to get through, but we are now in a position where  the entire company is aligned. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of COVID and the opportunity to innovate for the customer and bring great new products and value are really exciting to us, and we're looking forward to doing that. 
And with that, I will pass it over to Eric."
25915843,1685811434,2426434,"Expedia Group, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Expedia Group, Inc.","Executives","Right. Thank you, Peter. I'm also pleased with Peter mentioned with the overall recovery of our business. As you will see, it includes 2 quarters in a row of positive adjusted EBITDA. And in Q3, excluding Egencia was roughly on par with the third quarter",920,"Right. Thank you, Peter. I'm also pleased with Peter mentioned with the overall recovery of our business. As you will see, it includes 2 quarters in a row of positive adjusted EBITDA. And in Q3, excluding Egencia was roughly on par with the third quarter of 2019. 
And with that, I wanted to start by providing an update on the booking trends that we have seen and we are seeing. Following the pullback we witnessed for much of the third quarter and into the first part of September due to the Delta variant, we saw a notable broad-based improvement across geos and product lines.  
Overall total bookings for all products net of cancels were down 30% versus third quarter of 2019, which was slightly worse than the 26% decline we saw last quarter. Given the continued volatility of the recovery, we also want to provide additional monthly detail on our total lodging bookings net of cancels. That, of course, includes both hotel and Vrbo. And those were down approximately 17% in July, approximately 25% in August, 19% in September and further improved to down -- negative 2% in October. And again, that September was also down, of course. The trends in October that we saw, again, that was negative 2%, they did improve throughout that month, so we exited at a much improved rate relative to the start of that month.  
Moving to the P&L, starting with revenue. It was down approximately 17% versus third quarter of 2019, which was a meaningful improvement from last quarter with revenue down approximately 33%. We saw a significant improvement in both Vrbo and hotel revenue, which benefited from seasonally strong summer travel. Revenue margin for the third quarter was approximately 16%, up from approximately 10% last quarter. This was primarily due to typical third quarter seasonality in the business and product mix weighted towards lodging.  
On sales and marketing. Direct spend in Q3 was approximately $1.1 billion, which is down approximately 19% versus third quarter of 2019 levels. And as Peter mentioned, we reduced spending given the reversal in trends we witnessed in the third quarter. However, going forward, given the more positive recent trends that we've discussed, we are again leaning in the marketing spend in Q4.  
Moving on to overhead costs. They totaled approximately $530 million, a slight decrease versus last quarter and below our expectations. We saw lower-than-anticipated discretionary spend, which was down roughly 90% versus the third quarter of 2019 as employees continue to largely work from home in the quarter. I would also call out lower-than-anticipated hiring as there continues to be a high degree of competition for talent, especially for technology roles.  
Looking ahead, we expect overhead to increase by approximately $40 million sequentially in the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower capitalized labor due to the holidays as well as higher anticipated head count and people costs. In total, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $855 million which is approximately $650 million improvement over the last quarter, driven primarily by typical seasonality.  
Moving on to free cash flow, which showed negative $1.4 billion in Q3 on a reported basis. If we exclude the change in restricted cash, which is primarily driven by the change in Vrbo's deferred merchant bookings, free cash flow was negative approximately $450 million. As a reminder, the third quarter is traditionally a low quarter for free cash flow due to seasonality.  
In terms of the balance sheet, we continue to be investment grade-rated today and remain committed to deleveraging back to more historical levels as well as further reducing our cost of capital. As you may recall, we refinanced some debt earlier this year, which yielded $80 million in annual interest rate savings. And last month, as Peter mentioned, given the improving trends and continued confidence in our liquidity position, we paid off the remainder of the preferred stock. In total, paying off all the preferred stock this year, it will save us approximately $115 million in annual dividend payout going forward.  
Finally, on to Egencia. I want to echo Peter's comments and thank the Egencia's team as well as all of those Expedia employees who are involved with Egencia for their dedication and hard work.  
I would also like to point out Page 17 of the earnings press release, which provides details on Egencia's financials. For the third quarter, Egencia generated $55 million in revenue and negative $18 million in adjusted EBITDA for the -- again, the third quarter. As it relates to Egencia costs in the third quarter 2021 rough numbers, but approximately $35 million was recorded in cost of sales, $20 million in sales and marketing and the remaining roughly $20 million spread across tech, content and G&A.  
Going forward, we will report our minority stake in the combined company within the other net line of our income statement. And in terms of the 10-year lodging supply agreement with our Expedia Partner Services business has entered with the combined company, we will account for it like any other standard EPS deal. As a reminder, at 2019 volumes, we expect this deal, the EPS deal, to be worth in excess of $60 million on an annualized basis for EBITDA.  
In closing, as Peter and I both mentioned, we're quite encouraged by recent trends, and the pace of recovery is clearly improving. Things are getting better. And I remain truly and very optimistic about the future of travel and our company. And so with that, Charlie, we are ready for our first question."

I would say we are still working towards a better marketing world for the company overall, which, yes, means more efficiently being able to get customers. But it's a many-pronged attack. It's the performance marketing issues that I've talked about before. We have come a huge way in terms of the tools, the data and the algorithms, et cetera. But COVID has been a bumpy time. And we have not found normalized times to really get everything tuned exactly how we want. So yes, we believe there's opportunity ahead for that. 
We also believe there's significant opportunity for our brand teams to really be much more impactful than they have historically. And that has impact not only on driving direct-to-customers, but it has an impact on how people respond to performance marketing and other things. So there's many places where those teams can have more impact and ultimately be more efficient in attracting customers. 
But it's not entirely on them, right? We've got to build better products. We've got to have better engagement circles for the customer. We've got improve our service. Every -- we need to improve in every part of our game to continue to make the customer stickier and bring them back and want them -- make this their place to come for travel. So marketing can be more efficient.  But it's really a virtuous cycle of how we string marketing together with the experience and that -- and with the new efficiencies that your second question goes to. All of that gives us more opportunity to reinvest in more profitable long-term customers and create long-term value for the enterprise."

I would say both of those are substantially complete. There's been a ton of work by the teams to simplify the business. And I think we're feeling really good about the fixed and the variable side. But I'll also add, we are a technology company. We're going to continue to invest and improve our services for our customers and in the way that we operate this business.

Cities are picking up, International has picked up. There are -- virtually every area has seen growth. I will say that some of the benefit we have seen -- I've talked about mix effects before. When cities were forbidden places, that obviously hurt us. Cities have been a great market for us. 
And as we've seen cities come back, now there's great -- they're still greatly lagging major leisure destinations like beaches, but they're coming back and that return benefits us probably disproportionately compared to some others. 
So that mix effect thing -- we had some winners and some losers as always, but we've seen cities come back more. We've seen relative to the growth we've seen in sort of the consistently strong leisure areas and the opening of international channels, the announcements from the U.S. from Singapore, et cetera, about allowing international travel, we see that lift up basically as soon as it's announced. We see search queries go up. 
And again, in places like EMEA, where we're traditionally stronger in international travel as compared to domestic, those openings, I think, all go well for us going forward. 
So it really is a broad-based recovery. I mean it is every -- I mean, not down to every country because there are blips in countries that have COVID spikes, et cetera, but down to every region. And some regions are trailing dramatically like APAC and Latin America, but they're improving, too.

I just -- is there any kind of driving force or explanation that's driving that delta in performance? Is it mix, certain markets lagging? Is there a timing delay? I know there's a difference in reporting structure. So any kind of color there would be helpful. 
And then just on COVID restrictions, I know it's very dynamic and hard to predict, but are you seeing any differences in terms of travel restrictions and implications on demand when we see COVID cases rising in certain markets now versus 6 or 12 months ago?"

We report on stays. So it's sometimes challenging to compare. But I would say, as I've said before, and I mentioned regarding cities, the mix has helped them. They've always been better in smaller markets, long-tail markets, et cetera. We've always been really strong in big cities when cities were dragging, cities get built by international travelers. So we also have been strong in long-haul air for those travelers like all those mix effects actually impact things. And so some of them, we won in. Vrbo has been a beneficiary. Some of them we lost in big cities and international travel. So it's always been a balance. 
We are less focused on room nights rather than room dollars, if you will. I mean, it's a little misleading. We could book 1 million more 1-star hotels nights and it wouldn't mean much to our P&L, and we could book 100,000 5-star hotels, those would mean a lot. So you have to take it all in balance, but we are feeling good about the recovery. And in general, our numbers domestically are running ahead in lodging of where we were 2 years ago. So I think we're in good shape there, and we feel good about that. 
And again, we have had a somewhat conservative bent along the game with COVID. We've been -- Eric mentioned tapping the brakes, we tried to respond. Sometimes we get over our skis, sometimes we're behind the recoveries. It's a balancing act.  But we are getting more confident, more aggressive. And I think you'll see us continue to lean in to gain share across the globe. 
In terms of the COVID question, it remains to be seen. And every -- as Eric said, every story is its own. But I will tell you, if you look at recent news, for example, of the COVID cases in the U.K. spiking from recent openings. And I was in London and it was amazingly open. I would say that queries have remained elevated since the international announcements to the U.S., and they remain elevated, and we have not seen a pullback from the caseload news. 
So I think that remains strong. And of course, science is helping us out along the way. We just announced that kids will be able to be vaccinated in the U.S., which is a great benefit for society, let alone our business. And likewise, the announcement today about the U.K. approving the Merck pill for treatment. This is, I think we all agree, is probably going to be an endemic not a pandemic. And the more treatments we get and the more ways we get to deal with it, the better off we're all going to be."

And second question, guys. Coming back to capital return and how you're thinking about a more normalized environment, Booking called out the ability to possibly return capital to shareholders as we get into early 2022.

But I would say that we continue to look tactically around the globe at what the right vectors are to focus on in terms of supply. 
I don't think we feel like we're terribly deficient, but we've been a little bit peanut buttered around the globe. As we did with Vrbo during COVID, we were very focused on those compression markets, freeing up supply there, making that supply really successful right out of the gate and that is the virtuous cycle that we think is most valuable. So we -- you will continue to see us do that for Vrbo, but you will also see us do that in a very targeted way around the globe. And that's with the focus that's tied into where we are marketing, where we are driving our brands, where we think we have the opportunity to win. 
And again, remember, in many markets around the globe, our B2B business, our Expedia Partner Solutions business drives those markets more than our direct relationship with consumers. And so driving the right supply to feed those businesses as well is a critical piece. 
So we will continue to drive into it. I would say, if anything, we've been relatively modest in terms of supply growth during COVID with a particular focus, again, on Vrbo, which was a different use case. But as things are reopening, we're seeing more demand. You will see us go after in a targeted way more supply, and again, in a very targeted end-to-end way keying on the markets we're focusing on growing and where those markets want to travel to. So we feel very good about that opportunity. It's just a question of focus. It wasn't a big focus during COVID. But as things improve, we will continue to roll that out."

Second, is our commitment to continuing to lower our leverage ratios and get our cost of capital down. We've taken some great steps on that this year, and we'll continue to make progress as we move forward on it. And third, we, as a company, have traditionally been committed to returning capital to shareholders in different forms. 
I would say right now is, again, not necessarily the right time for us to do it, but it's certainly something that we're committed to doing over the long haul, and we'll just continue to serve and make what we deem to be, if you will, the right choices at the right time going forward."

But on the -- what are we doing side, we've done a tremendous amount to  work on the brand, to land the brand, to make people really think about it as a primary source of -- Vrbo as a primary source of vacation options. We've invested more than ever -- much more than ever in that brand. And we've really driven it hard. And as I mentioned, more than half our users so far this year, our customers, have been new customers to the experience, and we think the experience is great. 
So we do think we have sustainably landed the experience and the use case and the brand, and that will continue to benefit us for many years to come. How share exactly shakes out when the market moves back or people are going to cities, if things will change -- we're not strong everywhere. In terms of Vrbo supply, we are more focused on leisure destinations.

And in doing so, we enable our brands -- our multiple of brands to live on one stack, to live in one currency if they wish to allow you to burn that -- earn that currency and burn that currency wherever you want. And this is one of the powerful things that we talked about new Vrbo customers coming on the platform. But imagine when  they're not only in the Vrbo product stream and enjoying that, but then they're earning value that they can use across air and other things when they have different travel needs. And likewise, the inverse, the Expedia and Hotels.com travelers who might want to rent a Vrbo for a vacation. 
So that expansion of being able to spend across all those brands, that architecture for our technology, which is really building everything we do into multi-tenet, ultimately, having all our -- one app all on one stack and one way -- that doesn't mean we will have separate brands, but they'll run on the same technical infrastructure. They'll have their own differentiation for brand, et cetera, or products. But it's all going to be built for multi-tenant. It's all going to be built for us and for our partners. 
And we have the richest data set really -- travel data set in the world. And that data set powers all our machine learning, all our AI and our ability to innovate constantly in terms of what the customer sees, how the partners participate. And that's just super powerful once we get it right. Now there's a lot of work still to do, but we can see the path now, and we are all aligned on that path."

We're bringing the creative teams in-house now and really going at it in a different way. 
But we expect to be balanced. We've seen our competitors move around and gyrate a bit. We've kind of kept to a balance between brand and performance. We feel like there's opportunity to be more aggressive as our performance marketing machine gets sharper and better and all the tools, right, we're seeing vectors of opportunity that we can lean into. 
And so we definitely will have opportunities to lean in, and I'm really excited about what our brand teams are going to do. Our brand teams are second to none in the industry. We will be the best in the industry. And our performance marketing is phenomenal, and finally brought together in a way that will be really powerful. 
So I think what that balance is, we'll have to -- as I mentioned, the market's got to normalize. We don't exactly know yet. But it is a virtuous cycle. And the better our brand marketing is, the better our performance marketing will do. And we believe strongly in both, and we'll continue to kind of lean in, in a balanced way. I think our friends have gyrated a little more than us in and out of some of those things."

So thanks for the question. And I don't mean to be flippant in my response. But ultimately, I think you got to ask GBT and Egencia going forward what their ultimate strategy is around how they plan to monetize and develop customer solutions. I can say that they plan to run Egencia to be a core part of their offering. In fact, they expanded it into some of their existing customer base. So we see a great opportunity with that relationship that we have. We see a great opportunity in the equity component that we have, and we also see it on the EPS side, not only for the existing Egencia volume but also potentially upside with some of their other volume as well."

So I'll kind of take those in reverse, Dan, I think, which is Vrbo has consistently had a very strong direct business. I mentioned our continued investment in brand across the globe, really, on Vrbo or its sister brands. We mentioned, I think, 2 or 3 quarters ago that we got out of -- we got out of performance marketing for Vrbo in the U.S., and it benefited from that with more direct traffic and having felt the effects of it. So I think we feel very good about the direct nature of that business. 
As far as how the product will continue to improve, how loyalty will add to it. Again, that's just other veins of opportunity for us across our Expedia customer base or Hotels customer base, et cetera. So we want to create the universe of people that want to move between our brands and use them and build value and use that value. So I think we will continue to see that. 
As far as rates and occupancy goes, rates have been -- ADR has been very strong throughout COVID. There's been a lot of competition for the product, and owners and managers know that, and they have pushed price where they could. And so we've seen a lot of price increases, and those have helped. There seems to be no abating of those. And likewise, occupancy in those compressed markets. If you want to be on a beach in the Southeast or on a beach in Hawaii at Christmas, good luck, it can't be done. 
So we're going to keep seeing that. I think that's why you're seeing this effect of, okay, I want to get out in front of next summer and get the house I want. And that's a great -- that's smart for the consumer, and it's great for the business, and it gives us a lot of confidence going into next year that this use case will continue to be highly top of mind for many consumers, and we are well positioned. 
So with that, I will thank you. Thanks, Dan. Thanks, everybody. I hope you all stay safe. Looking forward to watching travel recover, and feel free to start that corporate travel now that it's safe out there. Thanks for your time."
