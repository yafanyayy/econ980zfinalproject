I hope that you and your families continue to stay safe and well during this ongoing pandemic. 
Before jumping into our quarterly review, I'd like to begin by discussing the news we shared 2 weeks ago about closing the Arena acquisition and some related organizational changes. 
Turning to Slide 4 in the deck. First, we're very pleased to have closed the acquisition and would like to formally welcome the Arena employees to the PTC team. As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, we're excited to complement the strong momentum we have with Creo and Windchill in the traditional CAD and PLM market, with the leading CAD and PLM solutions in the pure SaaS market. Together, Arena and Onshape represent a powerful pure SaaS solution that's #1 in technology, customers and revenue. With this combo, we're positioned to capture the rapidly emerging shift towards SaaS for product development, manufacturing and support. There's clear evidence that the global pandemic has been driving a new normal in our industry and we're now in a position to lead the product development market well into the future. 
We also announced an organization strategy that I'm excited about. We're expanding our SaaS business unit, initially built around Onshape and Vuforia, to embrace arena as well. This will put us in position to pursue technology, business process and revenue synergies across this SaaS portfolio. The expanded business unit, which now accounts for about $100 million of ARR and about 20% of PTC's bookings, will be led by long-time PTC leader, Mike DiTullio. Mike will focus on integrating the Arena team and leveraging the tremendous talent and expertise we have across our SaaS portfolio. With his proven track record of aligning organizations to drive growth, I'm confident that in this new role, Mike can help us fully capitalize on our SaaS leadership position. 
I'm also pleased to announce that Jamie Pappas will succeed Mike as Head of Global Sales, reporting to our Chief Operating Officer, Troy Richardson. Jamie is an accomplished 25-year PTC sales veteran, and he has led regional sales in Asia, Europe and most recently in North America. Jamie has a tremendous track record of success at PTC, so I'm confident in a smooth transition as he assumes his new role. 
With that, I'd like to turn to Slide 5 and review the 3 key elements of our strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. 
First, let's cover the topic of market demand. We had outstanding bookings results in the first quarter, up more than 30% year-over-year versus the fiscal Q1 of last year that was largely unaffected by the pandemic. The bookings helped the Q1 results, but they also beefed up the future backlog. We see the bookings strength is reflecting a continuation of the secular demand trends we experienced in fiscal '20 as customers accelerated their digital transformation initiatives in response to the new way of doing business. 
Industrial companies are prioritizing initiatives like moving all product life cycle processes online across their entire enterprise with PLM, remotely monitoring the products in factories with IoT, bringing digital productivity to their frontline production workers with AR and they're generally getting more and more interested in SaaS as they go forward. For PTC, this all translates into more demand for our unique product portfolio, and we see a strong pipeline heading into the balance of the fiscal year. 
Given that the global PMI number reached its highest point in 3 years in December, we also believe PTC's strong Q1 bookings may have reflected improved customer optimism around promising vaccine news, stimulus policies of the new administration in Washington, and perhaps even some calendar year-end budget flush. We hope that optimization or optimism continues, but with mixed news related to the global pandemic, including concerns about new strains of the virus, we're not sure that we're out of the woods yet, and we continue to think that our outlook for the year is prudent. 
In the top line category, a combination of strong bookings and lower-than-expected churn translated into a very strong quarter with ARR growth of 16% or 12% in constant currency. This was at the high end of our guidance range and was driven by continued momentum in our core business and solid performance in the growth business. Revenue growth of 20% was well above guidance, resulting from strong large deal activity in the quarter. 
In the bottom line category, we delivered strong free cash flow of $111 million and non-GAAP EPS growth of 70%, reflecting a combination of strong top line results combined with continued operating expense discipline. 
In the wake of this strong first quarter, we are increasing our guidance for the year, and Kristian will share the details later in the call. 
With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, Core and Growth segments of our portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 6. You'll see that ARR in our Focused Solutions Group, or FSG, was flat year-over-year, but ARR growth was robust in our much larger Core business once again, and the mid-20s growth performance of our growth business track to our guidance for the year. You might note visually that the Growth business has now reached roughly the same magnitude as FSG. And with Arena coming into the picture, it will soon step up about 30%. And then with its higher growth rates, it will soon become much larger, driving the combined portfolio toward higher growth rates as well. 
Recall that our FSG segment has exposure to certain industries heavily impacted by the pandemic like retail and airline industries. However, our FSG products remain important and are very competitive and we continue to expect FSG to recover to low single-digit ARR growth in fiscal '21 as economic conditions improve. We've seen some good progress in retail already. But as you know, the airline business remains difficult for everybody. 
Naturally, we're very pleased about the 12% ARR growth of our Core business, which materially outpaced the market growth again. Q1 was the 13th consecutive quarter that our Core business ARR growth rate has been in double digits. As Jay Leshaw pointed out in the recent report, PTC has, of late, enjoyed the #1 growth rate in the traditional CAD industry with Creo, and our Windchill business has been doing even better. 
Meanwhile, our Growth business had another strong quarter with year-over-year bookings growth of nearly 40% and delivered ARR growth in the mid-20 s, in line with our guidance for the year. 
Let's go a click deeper into the main elements of our Core and Growth segments. Turning to Slide 7. Our Creo CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the high single digits. The improvement in the demand environment that we started to see in Q4 continued this past quarter, with strong performance across all major geos. And in a market that tends to see very little replacement activity, we had some notable CAD competitive displacements, which speaks to the technological strength of the Creo product suite. 
Our CAD technology leadership was further extended with the latest release of Creo 7, which incorporates our first Atlas-based offering. Creo Generative Design Extension, or GDX as we call it, leverages the Frustum generative design engine acquired in 2019 with the compute being offloaded to an Atlas, pure SaaS, elastic computing environment, from where it served the Creo sessions now and soon to Onshape sessions as well. 
We also released the high-fidelity mainstream simulation capabilities of ANSYS, fully integrated into Creo, creating another highly differentiated leg of growth for our CAD business. 
Speaking of ANSYS, on Slide 8, we highlight a great Creo and Creo Simulation Live for CSL win with Shark Ninja. SharkNinja is becoming a household name. And to respond to the growing demand for its products in a very competitive space, SharkNinja reevaluated its design technology and decided to phase out competitive CAD systems and standardize on Creo, adding CSL to help accelerate the new product development cycle times. 
Moving on to Slide 9 in our PLM business. You'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective, in Q1, PLM performance was broad-based with double-digit growth across all 3 major geographies, led again by the APAC region. Thanks to its key role in digital transformation initiatives, PLM continues to be a major growth engine for PTC. 
From a vertical perspective, our PLM team continues to win big in the medical device space, but market traction in the first quarter was strong across a number of verticals, including automotive, aerospace and defense and high tech. 
Turning to Slide 10. A great proof point in A&D was a major extension and expansion at Airbus, which also happened to include a competitive displacement in one of their divisions. Along with the Windchill footprint expansion, Airbus adopted ThingWorx and Vuforia in their manufacturing environment, which is another great example of the cross-sell opportunity within our product portfolio. 
Given today's difficult air transportation market, airframe companies are being careful with spending. But thanks to this deal, PTC is locked into a substantial long-term relationship with Airbus. 
You'll see on Slide 11 that we had a great cloud-based Windchill win at Terumo in the medical device space. Terumo is replacing its paper-based FDA compliance system with an end-to-end digital thread based on Windchill's quality management solution. 
Moving on to our growth segment. I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. Following strong bookings performance in Q4, IoT had a solid start to the year with a promising uptick in new logo bookings, an area that was pressured over the last year due to travel restrictions and lockdowns. 
Demand was broad-based across verticals, and we had some sizable expansion deals in the process manufacturing space, which is greenfield for PTC. 
With the strong pipeline and encouraging signs of churn improvement in IoT as well, we expect to see continued solid ARR growth in fiscal '21. 
On Slide 13, we have an example of ThingWorx in the process manufacturing space at Griffin Foods. Operating in a market that as relatively thin margins, Griffin Foods was looking for ways to accelerate efficiencies in its production environment, leveraging the ThingWorx smart connected operations, or SCO, solution they are digitizing their production lines to capture key performance data and display it in a unified view to allow managers to see problems and make faster, more informed decisions on the plant floor. 
Let me shift to our AR business on Slide 14. The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered very strong results in Q1, with bookings up 80% year-over-year. Expansions drove over 50% of bookings in the quarter, with 3 deals greater than $500,000, which was a new record for the AR team. Traction outside the Americas continued to gain momentum with strong growth in both Europe and APAC. 
Let me share 2 examples that highlight the value of our broader AR suite. First, on Slide 15, is at Bid Group, one of the largest integrated suppliers in the wood processing industry. The Bid Group replaced a do-it-yourself, or DIY, approach for industrial IoT. And then they added Vuforia Chalk to the mix to improve workforce productivity while reducing travel costs. 
Turning to Slide 16. A second great AR success story is Royal Enfield, the world's oldest motorcycle brand. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, Royal Enfield was forced to reimagine a planned physical event for launching a new motorcycle. Leveraging Vuforia Studio in under a month, they built a dynamic sales training capability and delivered this highly effective, interactive, augmented reality experience to more than 3,000 remote participants. 
Turning now to Slide 17, and I'll wrap up my comments on our growth business by discussing Onshape, which also delivered a very strong quarter. Onshape had record bookings, up more than 150% from its initial quarter at PTC 1 year ago, including a nice balance of new logo activity and expansions. 
Onshape's pure SaaS CAD solution is quickly becoming a disruptive force in the SMB space, shaking up a mature market segment where PTC has been underrepresented for years. 
I'd like to update you on the exciting trends we're seeing in the education market with Onshape. As the COVID pandemic unfolded, we saw a real opportunity to help schools and universities because we have the only true school-from-home CAD solution that works on any device with no installed footprint. PTC's academic team decided to pivot their focus to Onshape and set an aggressive goal to try to reach 1 million total education users by the end of fiscal '21. To put that in perspective, it's double the number of users that we're participating in our education program across all PTC products at that time. 
I'm happy to report that already in January, we've exceeded the goal of 1 million total Onshape education users, 9 months ahead of schedule. Onshape is quickly becoming the education standard, thanks to one of the greatest share shifts I've experienced. Students and teachers love it. 
Clearly, we caught a wave as world events and the changing needs in education have accelerated this achievement. It's been incredibly rewarding to see how many educators and students have been able to take advantage of Onshape. Students who would not normally have access to CAD are now able to engage in STEM classes. Robotic teams are able to compete even when their season is canceled, and educators have been able to seamlessly continue their instruction because of their access to Onshape. 
On Slide 18, we highlight one of the many school systems supporting their K-12 STEM education program by adopting Onshape, in this case, across the Charlottesville city school system. Gaining 1 million student users is a huge milestone with significant implications for PTC well into the future. 
Manufacturing companies have the very same needs for real-time collaboration and access to data from anywhere and on any device. I continue to think the COVID crisis is accelerating the SaaS tipping point for the engineering software industry by several years. 
On Slide 19, you'll see a great example of a commercial company, Stirling Ultracold doing the same thing. They're adopting Onshape to streamline communication between mechanical designers, supply chain managers, manufacturing and quality assurance teams to avoid the delays associated with sending CAD data back and forth by e-mail like they used to do. 
To wrap up on our Growth business, I think it's pretty clear that our solutions are uniquely positioned to help customers respond to the new normal they're facing today, and they provide a very strong foundation for long-term growth for PTC. 
Let me provide some color on geographic performance, which was strong across the globe. On Slide 20, you'll see that APAC had strong performance with ARR growth of 16%, reflecting the earlier reopening of those economies and much improved churn rates as our subscription licensing model gains increased acceptance. 
Americas ARR growth of 13% was a second quarter in a row of double-digit growth, driven by broad-based demand across our Core and Growth segments, but partially offset by softness in FSG. 
Europe ARR growth of 8% faced a tough year-over-year comparison, but delivered very strong bookings performance in both our Core and Growth segments, along with some notable competitive wins. 
With that, now let me turn to Slide 21 and touch on our key alliance partners. The Microsoft partnership had another strong quarter, delivering above plan for the third consecutive quarter and exceeding expectations in all geos. As you saw in their earnings release yesterday, Microsoft has a lot of momentum, and we're drafting behind it. With a solid pipeline in field engagement strengthening across the globe, we remain bullish on the Microsoft alliance opportunity. 
Rockwell delivered over 20 expansion deals and had transactions in 27 countries. The majority of Rockwell's deals continue to come from customers that are greenfield to PTC and in process industries that we have not traditionally targeted with our core products. I was pleased to see in their earnings release that Rockwell too is seeing a strong uptick in orders. 
If you follow Rockwell, you may be aware that they have reorganized to have a software-focused business unit that owns the PTC partnership. And yesterday, they announced that they have hired Brian Shepherd to head up that unit. Brian worked directly for me at PTC for a dozen years, so I know that Rockwell has found a very capable software leader and somebody who can help the PTC Rockwell relationship unleash its fullest potential. Congratulations to Brian, we're looking forward to working with him. 
Lastly, on the Alliance front, our ANSYS Powered Solutions had a solid quarter with 20% bookings growth and very healthy expansion activity that drove around half of Q1 bookings. To complement CSL in the market, we launched the broader and deeper Creo ANSYS Simulation Suite. We're expecting these ANSYS Powered Solutions to account for high single-digit percentage of our new CAD ACV in fiscal '21. 
Before I wrap up, I'd like to highlight a great win we had with Microsoft on Slide 22. The Colruyt Group was looking for an IoT platform to support a complete digital transformation of their shops food production, energy production and logistics. Microsoft received an RFP in a competitive bid process and turned to PTC to partner on the opportunity. We ultimately won together resulting in a multiphase hybrid cloud IIoT project. 
To wrap up and summarize my comments, turning to Slide 23. We're off to a great start in fiscal '21 as customers continue to embark on digital transformation initiatives that leverage our full product portfolio. We had strong bookings in the quarter, and churn performance was good as well. We delivered ARR at the high end of guidance, while adding to the backlog. We saw a great performance in Core and Growth segments and in our channel. The demand environment appears to be improving globally and our strategic alliances continue to grow and mature. 
Plus, with the Arena team joining forces with Onshape, PTC is now positioned as the #1 leader in SaaS-based CAD and PLM, and along with Vuforia, this sizable pure SaaS portfolio is paving the way toward an attractive future-proof business model for PTC. As Kristian will detail shortly, we're pleased to be raising our fiscal '21 guidance in recognition of solid execution that demonstrates our capability to deliver strong top line growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation, the necessary ingredients to drive significant shareholder value for years to come. 
With that, I'll turn it over to you, Kristian, to take us through more details on the financial results and guidance."

Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a brief review of our firs",1115,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. 
Let me start off with a brief review of our first quarter results, then spend the balance of the call on our revised outlook for fiscal '21. 
Turning to Slide 25. Fiscal Q1 ARR of $1.34 billion increased 12% year-over-year. As Jim noted earlier, we had very strong bookings performance in Q1, resulting in new ACV above expectations. And consistent with recent trends, demand for ramp deals was strong, which contributes to backlog in future periods primarily fiscal '22 and beyond. 
With solid new ACV results, along with churn coming in better than expected, we were pleased to deliver constant currency ARR growth at the high end of the guidance range. Reported ARR growth of 16% benefited from 400 basis points of currency, including a 200 basis point tailwind since the beginning of fiscal '21. 
Strong Q1 free cash flow of $111 million was a record Q1 result for PTC. Q1 revenue of $429 million increased 20% year-over-year. And was well above the annual guidance range we had provided last quarter. Revenue performance was driven by very strong large deal results in the quarter, many of which had long contract duration. 
As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, which in the case of Q1 drove a higher amount of upfront subscription revenue recognized in the quarter. Currency was also a modest revenue tailwind. The strong revenue growth, along with continued financial discipline, resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 70% year-over-year. 
Turning to Page 26. I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with cash of $399 million and $1 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of 3.8%. Subsequent to the first quarter, we financed the Arena acquisition with $600 million from our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. 
From a use of cash standpoint, we plan, first, to pay down the revolver until we're below our 3x debt-to-EBITDA ratio target, which should be within the next couple of quarters. Over the medium term, we expect to continue to delever while also resuming share repurchases. 
Now turning to guidance. I'll begin on Slide 27 by highlighting a few of the key guidance assumptions. We continue to expect the macro environment to remain stable in the near term, with conditions improving in the second half of the fiscal year. And with this as context, we're also still expecting fiscal '21 bookings growth in the double digits on a year-over-year basis. 
Given our strong Q1 performance, we're raising the low end of our organic ARR growth from 9% to 10%, resulting in a range of 10% to 12% growth for the fiscal year. We're expecting Arena to add approximately 400 basis points of ARR growth and currency to add approximately 200 basis points of ARR growth relative to our previous guidance. 
Regarding ARR in fiscal '21, on a constant currency basis, we continue to expect growth rates to be fairly linear each quarter throughout the fiscal year. 
Now for the specifics. Turning to Slide 28. We're expecting fiscal '21 ARR of $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. That's a growth rate of 16% to 18%. Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year, which is growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. 
Note that currency is also benefiting free cash flow by about $15 million. However, this benefit is being offset by an unforecasted foreign tax assessment related to a matter that's been open for a few years. This tax matter is also reflected in our GAAP results. As you'll note, a $35 million charge that covers the periods from 2011 to 2020. This charge reflects the previous assessment paid in 2016 as well as the current expected assessment. We continue to believe that our position is correct and are fighting this issue in court, and we do not expect a final resolution on the matter for at least another year. 
Our $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $15 million of acquisition-related fees and an additional $5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the debt we took on to help finance the Arena acquisition. And as a reminder, fiscal '21 free cash flow also includes approximately $15 million of restructuring payments related to -- primarily to the headquarters relocation as well as to cost actions we took early in fiscal '20, that's early last year. 
Regarding the linearity of free cash flow in fiscal '21, we still expect to generate more than 60% of our annual free cash flow in the first half as collections are stronger in the first half, and this is offset by expenses increasing as we ramp hiring throughout the year. 
Now turning to P&L guidance. We're raising our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. We're now expecting fiscal '21 revenue of $1.69 billion to $1.73 billion, that's a growth rate of 16% to 19%. And the increased revenue guidance is really driven by 3 main factors: first, the strong large deal activity and longer-than-anticipated contract durations that we saw in Q1, which, as we've mentioned before, because of ASC 606 is driving higher upfront revenue recognition. This ultimately is contributing about 400 basis points of growth. As a reminder, this change has no impact on ARR or free cash flow as we continue to bill customers annually upfront. 
Second, the Arena acquisition, which will add approximately 300 basis points of growth. And lastly, FX or currency, which should add approximately 200 basis points of growth relative to our prior guidance. 
On the expense front, we're now expecting operating expense growth of approximately 16% in fiscal '21. This is an increase of approximately 600 basis points. Half of the increase is related to the Arena acquisition and half related to currency. Non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be $3.05 to $3.25, which is growth of 19% to 26%. 
I'd also note here that GAAP guidance does not include the impact of Arena Solutions purchase accounting as the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities work has not yet been completed. 
Wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again here in Q1. We delivered double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on our expense structure and continue to navigate in a very challenging macro environment. A strong start to the year positions us well to deliver attractive double-digit top line growth and very strong free cash flow. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and we can begin Q&A."

With that, you now arguably have 3 code bases for PLM: Arena, Windchill and Onshape. That's not unprecedented in the industry, as you know, as a result of acquisitions in technical software. But could you talk about how you're thinking about the co-development or the conjoining of those technologies, particularly, given the ultimate objective you seem to have had with Atlas of having a microservices architecture, for example? 
And then for Kristian, at the analyst meeting, you put up a very interesting slide on your customer engagement model showing 7 categories of customer that I don't think you've shown before. How does your guidance encompass your thinking about those various categories in terms of growth and contribution to fiscal '21?"

Kristian, you can start thinking about the answer to that. Well I guess -- so it's a good observation. I mean, we had Windchill, then we acquired Onshape, and they were 2 different things and now we acquired Arena. So yes, in fact, we have 3. But actually, we do have a very well understood strategy. 
So first of all, we will begin the process of looking at the best ways for Arena to use more and more of the Atlas platform that came to us with Onshape. And to be frank, Arena and Onshape don't do exactly the same things. Onshape is more like file management, except not really files, but more like data management and collaboration and Onshape's more like bill and material. So those 2 things do different things, but they will, over time, share more and more of a common architecture called Atlas. So then that still leaves Windchill. 
So we have shared kind of a midterm project that we are developing versions of Windchill and Creo that will use the Atlas platform to a great extent, so that they can be delivered in a SaaS model. But those products will retain full upward compatibility from the on-premise versions that exist today. 
Now we'll continue to maintain an on-premise version. So you might say we're going from 3 to 2 to 1.5 or something like that. But there's a good strategy here for how this stuff evolves. And none of it's going to be a revolution because we're bringing all the customers with. But I definitely think this is a problem that will fade away, and we've done that before. It's a problem that -- I'm not sure it's a problem, but it's a situation that will be -- that will evolve over time toward a cleaner kind of steady state in the end.

I mean I think here, conceptually, the right way to think about it is the largest piece of our ARR really comes from S1, the S1 and S2 space. That's also actually where we still see a significant amount of new booking activity. Those are our largest and customers with the biggest growth prospects. 
We have a lot of stable ARR in kind of the S3 and S4 space. And the new -- really the land-and-expand activity happens primarily within the S5 and S6 space. And so I mean, if I was going to think about this, I'd still put the largest chunk up in S1 and S2. We're seeing a lot of momentum in the S5 and S6. 
Tim -- or we actually mentioned in the -- on the call that we've seen a little bit of a resurgence in new IoT customers coming back in the channel, which also operates in kind of the S5, S6 and the channel space continues to bring in new customers. That's obviously also where relationships like Rockwell are, who also continue to bring in a lot of new greenfield customers, which are the foundation really for us to continue to expand upon those relationships over time. 
So I don't know if that hit your question. But..."

I think if you look at it by product, you get a different story because the size, the relatively larger size of some products kind of overwhelms that story. But Arena and Onshape are all about new accounts. They're basically competing in a space where we didn't previously have products competing. So there are almost entirely new accounts. 
If you go to IoT and AR, that's kind of 50-50 because those are products we can sell to our traditional accounts. But of course, there's a lot of demand and interest in IoT and AR, and we have new partners like Rockwell that also take us to a lot of new places. And then if you go back to Creo and Windchill, I mean that would be majority of the bookings coming from companies we've been doing business with. But sometimes we knock one-off or there's a consolidation play or something like that and as well the channel is bringing this to new accounts. 
So I think it's almost all new for Onshape and Arena, roughly half and half-ish for IoT and AR and sort of majority, maybe 70-30 in favor of installed base with Creo in one shop. Sound about right?"

So let me say, on your first question, Arena, Arena is predominantly a U.S. business. It's been almost to a very great degree, sold to American companies, although some American companies have users overseas, but it hasn't really been sold to companies overseas with just a small exception. 
So the first thing we're going to do with arena for share is go international with them. I mean that's a good piece of growth we ought to be able to go after as a synergy. And then, of course, cross-selling between Onshape and Arena produce another synergy and I think our channel ought to produce yet another synergy. So I'm sort of of the opinion that there's a lot of upside to Arena, if not this year, certainly in the coming years as we can take this business places that Arena themselves couldn't have gone so easily. So that's maybe the first part. 
Then second on ANSYS. If I remember, we had quantified that we thought there was $100 million potential opportunity with Creo Simulation Live in our base. I think that's before. I don't know if -- Tim, did that include the mainstream simulation products? No. So I haven't quantified that, but well more than $100 million because the rest of the ANSYS suite actually comes at a higher price point. We probably get less penetration because some of them might already have purchased it from ANSYS or one of their distributors. But certainly, $100 million would be the floor in terms of opportunity. Will we ever get 100% of that? No. But it certainly is a sizable ARR opportunity for us."

So I think they're losing some real momentum. 
So I think it really is more companies are realizing that they -- if they have PLM, they need to have it more broadly and more people need to use it. Like maybe  the procurement guy could walk down the hall and talk to the engineers, but now he's working from home, we can't, and so he needs a seat. 
So I think some of it is existing companies, broadening and deepening their implementation. And then I think there's a lot of companies who, like the Terumo example we gave who was doing their FDA compliance literally on paper and saying, ""Okay, that's not going to work."" We need to get a PLM system, we need to get it fast. So I think there's a lot of companies whose appreciation of PLM has deepened greatly in the last couple of years. First, for digital transformation in general and then for COVID requiring it, and I think that of those companies who get really rigid around PLM, we're certainly knocking down more than our fair share.

I know you talked about maybe some of your end budget flush, but anything else, the fact that large deal signings seem to be working back into the mix where you would maybe point to quarter end activity. And think it perhaps is early, but these developments are new and maybe to be extrapolated into something changing. 
And then the second question, it kind of gets back to the PLM question I was just asked, but the verticals of high tech, life sciences, aerospace and defense, these have been really strong for PTC, pretty consistently, and now you're adding Arena, which is strong in those verticals as well. So is there something specifically about those markets and how they're viewing PLM that really has benefited the fact that PTC has good exposure there?"

Our mid-December comments, Christian said he anticipated we'd be in the middle of the 9 to 12 range, and we came in at 12. So I think, to be frank, what happened is we review the forecast every single week on Fridays, and",538,"Yes. So let's take the first one. Our mid-December comments, Christian said he anticipated we'd be in the middle of the 9 to 12 range, and we came in at 12. So I think, to be frank, what happened is we review the forecast every single week on Fridays, and we raised it 4 times in December. 
So by the time we had that meeting with you, we had raised it once, but a couple of days later, we raised it again and then twice more. So if you study the PLM performance, as, of course, we do. What you'd see is that it wasn't on the backs of any 1 geography or any 1 vertical or any 1 big deal. It was just a lot of deals of all sizes in all geographies across a bunch of different verticals. 
I mean, it's just felt like just good solid business everywhere as opposed to some surprise. I think if you go to the verticals question you asked, I think Arena is very strong in high-tech and very strong in general in SMB. Now Hitech does tend to have a lot of SMB customers. And the other thing about high-tech is product life cycles tend to be very short. 
If you make 777s like Boeing does, it's very hard to switch CAD systems because those products last for decades. But if you're making consumer handheld devices, the life on one of those things is pretty darn short, and the next version isn't based on the last version, so you can switch tools much more easily. 
So I think in general, electronics and high-tech is a fast cycle market, and it's easier to get a share shift to happen there, which helps both Onshape and arena, by the way. 
Now PTC does well in the larger electronics and high-tech customers who probably are selling stuff that ends up in a rack in a data center and big machines that have a lot of electronics in them and so forth that aren't necessarily so short-cycle and whatnot. 
In the case of aerospace and defense, I mean, Arena does have some aerospace and defense accounts that are generally small suppliers to larger firms. But I would say probably that's not  necessarily the best spot to sell arena other than if you're low in the supply chain, and there are a lot of small suppliers in the aerospace and defense supply chain, in part because the government encourages that. So I think Onshape and we're also coming out with an NIH tire version of Onshape for the same reason that these smaller accounts lead something and really just don't have the wherewithal for the bigger, heavier enterprise systems that the masters at the top of their supply chain would prefer. 
So I think maybe a long way of                 Arena and Onshape are very complementary, Creo and Windchill. They do the same thing, but they appeal to different segments of the market. And the low end of the market doesn't want the high-end products and the high end of the market today doesn't want the low-end products. That may happen over time, but right now, it's all incremental upside as far as I'm concerned."

And they decided that they didn't like that anymore. And they'd really prefer to have 1 tool. And as they had to go from 2 to 1, they were going to 3. So that was a pretty substantial displacement of a very well-known high-end product. 
And then the other case really was a displacement of a very well-known low end product where this account said, SharkNinja said, we really like what Creo can do, and we really like CSL and so forth, and we, too, don't like having 2 sets of tools. 
And if we had to pick, I pay creo. So kind of that opposite ends of the Creo range, if you will, we're displacing different products from the same vendor. And that vendor, you can guess who it is. 
It has kind of left their customers a little frustrated.

Well, I think what it really comes down to is, does a customer want SaaS or not? If they want SaaS, then the win rate is exceptionally high. But they might decide they don't want SaaS for whatever reason. And it might be that other people in their company already use SolidWorks or what have you. But think of Onshape as a really good CAD system on a completely different deployment and business model. And the deployment and business model is even more differentiated is more differentiated than the product itself is. So I think smaller companies say, I really like the idea of being able to get to this data without having a server, without having a system administrator, without having -- I'd like to be able to pick up my work at home on my Macintosh, if I worked on it all day on the Windows Workstation. I mean, that's great. I like the real-time collaboration. Onshape is a multi user system, where multiple users work together on the same designs at the same time as opposed to multiple users working independently and passing data back and forth, which is how most other CAD systems work. 
So I think, again, I often say, think of it like electric vehicles versus internal combustion engines. It's religion at some level. And very few people get down to a short list that has 3 of each. 
Somewhere in the decision-making process, they either say, I want electric, and now I'm down to a short list of electric vehicles. Or I don't want electric, I'm going to stay with internal combustion and they end up with that short list. But I'm saying for those customers who say, I think I want SaaS, there's a good chance we're going to win that deal."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope that you and your families continue to stay safe and well during this ongoing pandemic.
Before jumping into our quarterly review, I'd like to begin by discussing the news we shared 2 weeks ago about closing the Arena acquisition and some related organizational changes.
Turning to Slide 4 in the deck. First, we're very pleased to have closed the acquisition, and would like to formally welcome the Arena employees to the PTC team. As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, we're excited to complement the strong momentum we have with Creo and Windchill in the traditional CAD and PLM market with the leading CAD and PLM solutions in the pure SaaS market. Together, Arena and Onshape represent a powerful pure SaaS solution that's #1 in technology, customers and revenue. With this combo, we're positioned to capture the rapidly emerging shift towards SaaS for product development, manufacturing and support. There's clear evidence that the global pandemic has been driving a new normal in our industry, and we're now in a position to lead the product development market well into the future.
We also announced an organization strategy that I'm excited about. We're expanding our SaaS business unit, initially built around Onshape and Vuforia, to embrace Arena as well. This will put us in position to pursue technology, business process and revenue synergies across this SaaS portfolio. The expanded business unit, which now accounts for about $100 million of ARR, and about 20% of PTC's bookings will be led by long-time PTC leader, Michael DiTullio. Mike will focus on integrating the Arena team and leveraging the tremendous talent and expertise we have across our SaaS portfolio. With his proven track record of aligning organizations to drive growth, I'm confident that in this new role, Mike can help us fully capitalize on our SaaS leadership position.
I'm also pleased to announce that Jamie Pappas will succeed Mike as Head of Global Sales, reporting to our Chief Operating Officer, Troy Richardson. Jamie is an accomplished 25-year PTC sales veteran, and he has led regional sales in Asia, Europe and most recently in North America. Jamie has a tremendous track record of success at PTC, so I'm confident in a smooth transition as he assumes his new role.
With that, I'd like to turn to Slide 5 and review the 3 key elements of our strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value.
First, let's cover the topic of market demand. We had outstanding bookings results in the first quarter, up more than 30% year-over-year versus the fiscal Q1 of last year that was largely unaffected by the pandemic. The bookings helped the Q1 results, but they also beefed up the future backlog. We see the bookings strength is reflecting a continuation of the secular demand trends we experienced in fiscal '20 as customers accelerated their digital transformation initiatives in response to the new way of doing business.
Industrial companies are prioritizing initiatives like moving all product life cycle processes online across their entire enterprise with PLM, remotely monitoring the products in factories with IoT, bringing digital productivity to their frontline production workers with AR and they're generally getting more and more interested in SaaS as they go forward. For PTC, this all translates into more demand for our unique product portfolio, and we see a strong pipeline heading into the balance of the fiscal year.
Given that the global PMI number reached its highest point in 3 years in December, we also believe PTC's strong Q1 bookings may have reflected improved customer optimism around promising vaccine news, stimulus policies of the new administration in Washington, and perhaps even some calendar year-end budget flush. We hope that optimization or optimism continues, but with mixed news related to the global pandemic, including concerns about new strains of the virus, we're not sure that we're out of the woods yet, and we continue to think that our outlook for the year is prudent.
In the top line category, a combination of strong bookings and lower-than-expected churn translated into a very strong quarter with ARR growth of 16% or 12% in constant currency. This was at the high end of our guidance range and was driven by continued momentum in our core business and solid performance in the growth business. Revenue growth of 20% was well above guidance, resulting from strong large deal activity in the quarter.
In the bottom line category, we delivered strong free cash flow of $111 million, and non-GAAP EPS growth of 70%, reflecting a combination of strong top line results combined with continued operating expense discipline.
In the wake of this strong first quarter, we are increasing our guidance for the year, and Kristian will share the details later in the call.
With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, Core and Growth segments of our portfolio.
Moving to Slide 6. You'll see that ARR in our Focused Solutions Group, or FSG, was flat year-over-year, but ARR growth was robust in our much larger Core business once again, and the mid-20s growth performance of our Growth business track to our guidance for the year. You might note visually that the Growth business has now reached roughly the same magnitude as FSG. And with Arena coming into the picture, it will soon step up about 30%. And then with its higher growth rates, it will soon become much larger, driving the combined portfolio towards higher growth rates as well.
Recall that our FSG segment has exposure to certain industries heavily impacted by the pandemic like retail and airline industries. However, our FSG products remain important and are very competitive, and we continue to expect FSG to recover to low single-digit ARR growth in fiscal '21 as economic conditions improve. We've seen some good progress in retail already. But as you know, the airline business remains difficult for everybody.
Naturally, we're very pleased about the 12% ARR growth of our Core business, which materially outpaced the market growth again. Q1 was the 13th consecutive quarter that our Core business ARR growth rate has been in double digits. As Jay Vleeschhouwer pointed out in the recent report, PTC has, of late, enjoyed the #1 growth rate in the traditional CAD industry with Creo, and our Windchill business has been doing even better.
Meanwhile, our Growth business had another strong quarter with year-over-year bookings growth of nearly 40%, and delivered ARR growth in the mid-20s, in line with our guidance for the year.  
Let's go a click deeper into the main elements of our Core and Growth segments. Turning to Slide 7, our Creo CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the high single digits. The improvement in the demand environment that we started to see in Q4 continued this past quarter, with strong performance across all major geos. And in a market that tends to see very little replacement activity, we had some notable CAD competitive displacements, which speaks to the technological strength of the Creo product suite.
Our CAD technology leadership was further extended with the latest release of Creo 7, which incorporates our first Atlas-based offering. Creo Generative Design Extension, or GDX as we call it, leverages the Frustum generative design engine acquired in 2019 with the compute being offloaded to an Atlas, pure SaaS, elastic computing environment, from where it serve the Creo sessions now and soon to Onshape sessions as well.
We also released the high-fidelity mainstream simulation capabilities of ANSYS, fully integrated into Creo, creating another highly differentiated leg of growth for our CAD business.
Speaking of ANSYS, on Slide 8, we highlight a great Creo and Creo Simulation Live, or CSL win, with SharkNinja. SharkNinja is becoming a household name. And to respond to the growing demand for its products in a very competitive space, SharkNinja reevaluated its design technology and decided to phase out competitive CAD systems and standardize on Creo, adding CSL to help accelerate the new product development cycle times.
Moving on to Slide 9 in our PLM business. You'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective, in Q1, PLM performance was broad-based with double-digit growth across all 3 major geographies, led again by the APAC region. Thanks to its key role in digital transformation initiatives, PLM continues to be a major growth engine for PTC.
From a vertical perspective, our PLM team continues to win big in the medical device space, but market traction in the first quarter was strong across a number of verticals, including automotive, aerospace and defense and high-tech.
Turning to Slide 10. A great proof point in A&D was a major extension and expansion at Airbus, which also happened to include a competitive displacement in one of their divisions. Along with the Windchill footprint expansion, Airbus adopted ThingWorx and Vuforia in their manufacturing environment, which is another great example of the cross-sell opportunity within our product portfolio.  
Given today's difficult air transportation market, airframe companies are being careful with spending. But thanks to this deal, PTC is locked into a substantial long-term relationship with Airbus.  
You'll see on Slide 11 that we had a great cloud-based Windchill win at Terumo in the medical device space. Terumo is replacing its paper-based FDA compliance system with an end-to-end digital thread based on Windchill's quality management solution.
Moving on to our Growth segment. I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. Following strong bookings performance in Q4, IoT had a solid start to the year with a promising uptick in new logo bookings, an area that was pressured over the last year due to travel restrictions and lockdowns. Demand was broad-based across verticals, and we had some sizable expansion deals in the process manufacturing space, which is greenfield for PTC. With the strong pipeline and encouraging signs of churn improvement in IoT as well, we expect to see continued solid ARR growth in fiscal '21.
On Slide 13, we have an example of ThingWorx in the process manufacturing space at Griffin Foods. Operating in a market that has relatively thin margins, Griffin Foods was looking for ways to accelerate efficiencies in its production environment. Leveraging the ThingWorx smart connected operations, or SCO solution, they are digitizing their production lines to capture key performance data and display it in a unified view to allow managers to see problems and make faster, more informed decisions on the plant floors.
Let me shift to our AR business on Slide 14. The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered very strong results in Q1, with bookings up 80% year-over-year. Expansions drove over 50% of bookings in the quarter, with 3 deals greater than $500,000, which was a new record for the AR team. Traction outside the Americas continued to gain momentum with strong growth in both Europe and APAC.
Let me share 2 examples that highlight the value of our broader AR suite. First, on Slide 15, is at BID Group, one of the largest integrated suppliers in the wood processing industry. The BID Group replaced a do-it-yourself, or DIY, approach for industrial IoT, and then they added Vuforia Chalk to the mix to improve workforce productivity while reducing travel costs.
Turning to Slide 16. A second great AR success story is Royal Enfield, the world's oldest motorcycle brand. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, Royal Enfield was forced to reimagine a planned physical event for launching a new motorcycle. Leveraging Vuforia Studio, in under a month, they built a dynamic sales training capability and delivered this highly effective, interactive, augmented reality experience to more than 3,000 remote participants.
Turning now to Slide 17, and I'll wrap up my comments on our growth business by discussing Onshape, which also delivered a very strong quarter. Onshape had record bookings, up more than 150% from its initial quarter at PTC 1 year ago, including a nice balance of new logo activity and expansions. Onshape's pure SaaS CAD solution is quickly becoming a disruptive force in the SMB space, shaking up a mature market segment where PTC has been underrepresented for years.
I'd like to update you on the exciting trends we're seeing in the education market with Onshape. As the COVID pandemic unfolded, we saw a real opportunity to help schools and universities because we have the only true school-from-home CAD solution that works on any device with no installed footprint. PTC's academic team decided to pivot their focus to Onshape and set an aggressive goal to try to reach 1 million total education users by the end of fiscal '21.
To put that in perspective, it's double the number of users that were participating in our education program across all PTC products at that time. I'm happy to report that already in January, we've exceeded the goal of 1 million total Onshape education users, 9 months ahead of schedule. Onshape is quickly becoming the education standard, thanks to one of the greatest share shifts I have experienced. Students and teachers love it.
Clearly, we caught a wave as world events and the changing needs in education have accelerated this achievement. It's been incredibly rewarding to see how many educators and students have been able to take advantage of Onshape. Students who would not normally have access to CAD are now able to engage in STEM classes. Robotic teams are able to compete even when their season is canceled, and educators have been able to seamlessly continue their instruction because of their access to Onshape.
On Slide 18, we highlight one of the many school systems supporting their K-12 STEM education program by adopting Onshape, in this case, across the Charlottesville City Schools system. Gaining 1 million student users is a huge milestone with significant implications for PTC well into the future. Manufacturing companies have the very same needs for real-time collaboration and access to data from anywhere and on any device. I continue to think the COVID crisis is accelerating the SaaS tipping point for the engineering software industry by several years.
On Slide 19, you'll see a great example of a commercial company, Stirling Ultracold, doing the same thing. They're adopting Onshape to streamline communication between mechanical designers, supply chain managers, manufacturing and quality assurance teams to avoid the delays associated with sending CAD data back and forth by e-mail like they used to do.
To wrap up on our Growth business, I think it's pretty clear that our solutions are uniquely positioned to help customers respond to the new normal they're facing today, and they provide a very strong foundation for long-term growth for PTC.
Let me provide some color on geographic performance, which was strong across the globe. On Slide 20, you'll see that APAC had strong performance with ARR growth of 16%, reflecting the earlier reopening of those economies and much improved churn rates as our subscription licensing model gains increased acceptance. Americas ARR growth of 13% was a second quarter in a row of double-digit growth, driven by broad-based demand across our Core and Growth segments, but partially offset by softness in FSG. Europe ARR growth of 8% faced a tough year-over-year comparison, but delivered very strong bookings performance in both our Core and Growth segments, along with some notable competitive wins.
With that, now let me turn to Slide 21 and touch on our key alliance partners. The Microsoft partnership had another strong quarter, delivering above plan for the third consecutive quarter and exceeding expectations in all geos. As you saw in their earnings release yesterday, Microsoft has a lot of momentum, and we're drafting behind it. With a solid pipeline and field engagement strengthening across the globe, we remain bullish on the Microsoft alliance opportunity.
Rockwell delivered over 20 expansion deals and had transactions in 27 countries. The majority of Rockwell's deals continue to come from customers that are greenfield to PTC and in process industries that we have not traditionally targeted with our core products. I was pleased to see in their earnings release that Rockwell too is seeing a strong uptick in orders.
If you follow Rockwell, you may be aware that they have reorganized to have a software-focused business unit that owns the PTC partnership. And yesterday, they announced that they have hired Brian Shepherd to head up that unit. Brian worked directly for me at PTC for a dozen years, so I know that Rockwell has found a very capable software leader and somebody who can help the PTC-Rockwell relationship unleash its fullest potential. Congratulations to Brian, we're looking forward to working with him.
Lastly, on the Alliance front, our ANSYS-powered solutions had a solid quarter with 20% bookings growth and very healthy expansion activity that drove around half of Q1 bookings. To complement CSL in the market, we launched the broader and deeper Creo ANSYS Simulation suite. We're expecting these ANSYS-powered solutions to account for high single-digit percentage of our new CAD ACV in fiscal '21.
Before I wrap up, I'd like to highlight a great win we had with Microsoft on Slide 22. The Colruyt Group ] was looking for an IoT platform to support a complete digital transformation of their shops, food production, energy production and logistics. Microsoft received an RFP in a competitive bid process and turned to PTC to partner on the opportunity. We ultimately won together resulting in a multiphase hybrid cloud IIoT project.
To wrap up and summarize my comments, turning to Slide 23. We're off to a great start in fiscal '21 as customers continue to embark on digital transformation initiatives that leverage our full product portfolio. We had strong bookings in the quarter, and churn performance was good as well. We delivered ARR at the high end of guidance, while adding to the backlog. We saw a great performance in Core and Growth segments and in our channel. The demand environment appears to be improving globally and our strategic alliances continue to grow and mature.
Plus, with the Arena team joining forces with Onshape, PTC is now positioned as the #1 leader in SaaS-based CAD and PLM, and along with Vuforia, this sizable pure SaaS portfolio is paving the way toward an attractive future-proof business model for PTC. As Kristian will detail shortly, we're pleased to be raising our fiscal '21 guidance in recognition of solid execution that demonstrates our capability to deliver strong top line growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation, the necessary ingredients to drive significant shareholder value for years to come.
With that, I'll turn it over to you, Kristian, to take us through more details on the financial results and guidance."

Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency.Let me start off with a brief review of our first",1115,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency.
Let me start off with a brief review of our first quarter results, then spend the balance of the call on our revised outlook for fiscal '21.
Turning to Slide 25. Fiscal Q1 ARR of $1.34 billion increased 12% year-over-year. As Jim noted earlier, we had very strong bookings performance in Q1, resulting in new ACV above expectations. And consistent with recent trends, demand for ramp deals was strong, which contributes to backlog in future periods, primarily fiscal '22 and beyond.
With solid new ACV results, along with churn coming in better than expected, we were pleased to deliver constant currency ARR growth at the high end of the guidance range. Reported ARR growth of 16% benefited from 400 basis points of currency, including a 200 basis point tailwind since the beginning of fiscal '21.
Strong Q1 free cash flow of $111 million was a record Q1 result for PTC. Q1 revenue of $429 million increased 20% year-over-year. And was well above the annual guidance range we had provided last quarter. Revenue performance was driven by very strong large deal results in the quarter, many of which had long contract duration.
As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, which in the case of Q1 drove a higher amount of upfront subscription revenue recognized in the quarter. Currency was also a modest revenue tailwind. The strong revenue growth, along with continued financial discipline, resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 70% year-over-year.
Turning to Page 26. I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with cash of $399 million and $1 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of 3.8%. Subsequent to the first quarter, we financed the Arena acquisition with $600 million from our revolving credit facility and cash on hand.
From a use of cash standpoint, we plan, first, to pay down the revolver until we're below our 3x debt-to-EBITDA ratio target, which should be within the next couple of quarters. Over the medium term, we expect to continue to delever while also resuming share repurchases.
Now turning to guidance. I'll begin on Slide 27 by highlighting a few of the key guidance assumptions. We continue to expect the macro environment to remain stable in the near term, with conditions improving in the second half of the fiscal year. And with this as context, we're also still expecting fiscal '21 bookings growth in the double digits on a year-over-year basis.
Given our strong Q1 performance, we're raising the low end of our organic ARR growth from 9% to 10%, resulting in a range of 10% to 12% growth for the fiscal year. We're expecting Arena to add approximately 400 basis points of ARR growth and currency to add approximately 200 basis points of ARR growth relative to our previous guidance.
Regarding ARR in fiscal '21, on a constant currency basis, we continue to expect growth rates to be fairly linear each quarter throughout the fiscal year.
Now for the specifics. Turning to Slide 28, we're expecting fiscal '21 ARR of $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion. That's a growth rate of 16% to 18%. Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year, which is growth of approximately 60% year-over-year.
Note that currency is also benefiting free cash flow by about $15 million. However, this benefit is being offset by an unforecasted foreign tax assessment related to a matter that's been open for a few years. This tax matter is also reflected in our GAAP results. As you'll note, a $35 million charge that covers the periods from 2011 to 2020. This charge reflects the previous assessment paid in 2016 as well as the current expected assessment. We continue to believe that our position is correct and are fighting this issue in court, and we do not expect a final resolution on the matter for at least another year.
Our $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $15 million of acquisition-related fees and an additional $5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the debt we took on to help finance the Arena acquisition. And as a reminder, fiscal '21 free cash flow also includes approximately $15 million of restructuring payments related to -- primarily to the headquarters relocation as well as to cost actions we took early in fiscal '20, that's early last year.
Regarding the linearity of free cash flow in fiscal '21, we still expect to generate more than 60% of our annual free cash flow in the first half as collections are stronger in the first half, and this is offset by expenses increasing as we ramp hiring throughout the year.
Now turning to P&L guidance. We're raising our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. We're now expecting fiscal '21 revenue of $1.69 billion to $1.73 billion, that's a growth rate of 16% to 19%. 
And the increased revenue guidance is really driven by 3 main factors: First, the strong large deal activity and longer-than-anticipated contract durations that we saw in Q1, which, as we've mentioned before, because of ASC 606 is driving higher upfront revenue recognition. This ultimately is contributing about 400 basis points of growth. As a reminder, this change has no impact on ARR or free cash flow as we continue to bill customers annually upfront. Second, the Arena acquisition, which will add approximately 300 basis points of growth. And lastly, FX or currency, which should add approximately 200 basis points of growth relative to our prior guidance.
On the expense front, we're now expecting operating expense growth of approximately 16% in fiscal '21. This is an increase of approximately 600 basis points. Half of the increase is related to the Arena acquisition and half related to currency. Non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be $3.05 to $3.25, which is growth of 19% to 26%.
I'd also note here that GAAP guidance does not include the impact of Arena Solutions purchase accounting as the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities work has not yet been completed.
Wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again here in Q1. We delivered double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on our expense structure and continue to navigate in a very challenging macro environment. A strong start to the year positions us well to deliver attractive double-digit top line growth and very strong free cash flow.
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and we can begin Q&A."

With that, you now arguably have 3 code bases for PLM: Arena, Windchill and Onshape. That's not unprecedented in the industry, as you know, as a result of acquisitions in technical software. But could you talk about how you're thinking about the co-development or the conjoining of those technologies, particularly, given the ultimate objective you seem to have had with Atlas of having a microservices architecture, for example?
And then for Kristian, at the analyst meeting, you put up a very interesting slide on your customer engagement model, showing 7 categories of customer that I don't think you've shown before. How does your guidance encompass your thinking about those various categories in terms of growth and contribution to fiscal '21?"

Kristian, you can start thinking about the answer to that while I go through this. Yes, so it's a good observation. I mean we had Windchill, then we acquired Onshape, and they were 2 different things, and now we acquired Arena. So yes, in fact, we have 3. But actually, we do have a very well understood strategy.
So first of all, we will begin the process of looking at the best ways for Arena to use more and more of the Atlas platform that came to us with Onshape. And to be frank, Arena and Onshape don't do exactly the same things. Onshape is more like file management, except not really files, but more like data management and collaboration, and Onshape's more like bill of materials. So those 2 things do different things, but they will, over time, share more and more of a common architecture called Atlas. So then that still leaves Windchill.
So we have shared kind of a midterm project that we are developing versions of Windchill and Creo that will use the Atlas platform to a great extent so that they can be delivered in a SaaS model. But those products will retain full upward compatibility from the on-premise versions that exist today.
Now we'll continue to maintain an on-premise version. So you might say we're going from 3 to 2 to 1.5 or something like that. But there's a good strategy here for how this stuff evolves. And none of it's going to be a revolution because we're bringing all the customers with. But I definitely think this is a problem that will fade away, and we've done that before. It's a problem that -- I'm not sure it's a problem, but it's a situation that will be -- that will evolve over time toward a cleaner kind of steady state in the end. Kristian?"

We have a lot of stable ARR in kind of the S3 and S4 space. And the new -- really, the land-and-expand activity happens primarily within the S5 and S6 space. And so I mean, if I was going to think about this, I'd still put the largest chunk up in S1 and S2. We're seeing a lot of momentum in the S5 and S6. 
Tim -- or we actually mentioned in the -- on the call that we've seen a little bit of a resurgence in new IoT customers coming back in the channel, which also operates in kind of the S5, S6, and the channel space continues to bring in new customers. That's obviously also where relationships like Rockwell are, who also continue to bring in a lot of new greenfield customers, which are the foundation, really, for us to continue to expand upon those relationships over time.

I think if you look at it by product, you get a different story because the size, the relatively larger size of some products kind of overwhelms that story. But Arena and Onshape are all about new accounts. They're basically competing in a space where we didn't previously have products competing. So they are almost entirely new accounts.
If you go to IoT and AR, that's kind of 50-50 because those are products we can sell to our traditional accounts. But of course, there's a lot of demand and interest in IoT and AR, and we have new partners like Rockwell that also take us to a lot of new places.
And then if you go back to Creo and Windchill, I mean that would be majority of the bookings coming from companies we've been doing business with. But sometimes we knock one off or there's a consolidation play or something like that and as well, the channel is bringing us some new accounts.
So I think it's almost all new for Onshape and Arena, roughly half and half-ish for IoT and AR and sort of majority, maybe 70-30 in favor of installed base with Creo and Windchill. Sound about right?"

So let me say, on your first question, Arena, Arena is predominantly a U.S. business. It's been almost to a very great degree, sold to American companies, although some American companies have users overseas, but it hasn't really been sold to companies overseas with just a small exception.
So the first thing we're going to do with Arena for sure is go international with it. I mean that's a good piece of growth we ought to be able to go after as a synergy. And then, of course, cross-selling between Onshape and Arena ought to produce another synergy, and I think our channel ought to produce yet another synergy. So I'm sort of of the opinion that there's a lot of upside to Arena, if not this year, certainly in the coming years as we can take this business places that Arena themselves couldn't have gone so easily. So that's maybe the first part.
Then second on ANSYS. If I remember, we had quantified that we thought there was $100 million potential opportunity with Creo Simulation Live in our base. I think that's before -- I don't know,  Tim, did that include the mainstream simulation products? No. So I haven't quantified that, but well more than $100 million because the rest of the ANSYS suite actually comes at a higher price point. We probably get less penetration because some of them might already have purchased it from ANSYS or one of their distributors. But certainly, $100 million would be the floor in terms of opportunity. Will we ever get 100% of that? No. But it certainly is a sizable ARR opportunity for us."

So I think it really is more companies are realizing that they -- if they have PLM, they need to have it more broadly, and more people need to use it. Like, maybe the procurement guy could walk down the hall and talk to the engineers, but now that he's working from home, he can't, and so he needs a seat. So I think some of it is existing companies, broadening and deepening their implementation.
And then I think there's a lot of companies who, like the Terumo example we gave who was doing their FDA compliance literally on paper saying, ""Okay, that's not going to work. We need to get a PLM system, we need to get it fast."" So I think there's a lot of companies whose appreciation of PLM has deepened greatly in the last couple of years.

And then the second question, it kind of gets back to the PLM question that was just asked, but the verticals of high-tech, life sciences, aerospace and defense, these have been really strong for PTC pretty consistently, and now you're adding Arena, which is strong in those verticals as well. So is there something specifically about those markets and how they're viewing PLM that really has benefited the fact that PTC has good exposure there?"

Our mid-December comments, Kristian said he anticipated we'd be in the middle of the 9% to 12% range, and we came in at 12%. So I think, to be frank, what happened is we review the forecast every single week on Fridays, a",539,"Yes. So let's take the first one. Our mid-December comments, Kristian said he anticipated we'd be in the middle of the 9% to 12% range, and we came in at 12%. So I think, to be frank, what happened is we review the forecast every single week on Fridays, and we raised it 4 times in December.
So by the time we had that meeting with you, we had raised it once, but a couple of days later, we raised it again and then twice more. So if you study the PLM performance, as, of course, we do. What you'd see is that it wasn't on the backs of any 1 geography or any 1 vertical or any 1 big deal. It was just a lot of deals of all sizes in all geographies across a bunch of different verticals. I mean it just felt like just good solid business everywhere as opposed to some surprise.
I think if you go to the verticals question you asked, I think Arena is very strong in high-tech and very strong in general in SMB. Now high-tech does tend to have a lot of SMB customers. And the other thing about high-tech is product life cycles tend to be very short. If you make 777s like Boeing does, it's very hard to switch CAD systems because those products last for decades. But if you're making consumer handheld devices, the life on one of those things is pretty darn short, and the next version isn't based on the last version, so you can switch tools much more easily. So I think in general, electronics and high-tech is a fast-cycle market, and it's easier to get a share shift to happen there, which helps both Onshape and Arena, by the way.
Now PTC does well in the larger electronics and high-tech customers who probably are selling stuff that ends up in a rack in a data center and big machines that have a lot of electronics in them and so forth that aren't necessarily so short-cycle and whatnot.
In the case of aerospace and defense, I mean Arena does have some aerospace and defense accounts that are generally small suppliers to larger firms. But I would say probably that's not necessarily the best spot to sell Arena other than if you're low in the supply chain, and there are a lot of small suppliers in the aerospace and defense supply chain, in part because the government encourages that. So I think Onshape and -- we're also coming out with ITAR version of Onshape for the same reason that these smaller accounts need something and really just don't have the wherewithal for the bigger, heavier enterprise systems that the masters at the top of their supply chain would prefer.
So I think maybe a long way of getting back, Arena and Onshape are very complementary to Creo and Windchill. They do the same thing, but they appeal to different segments of the market. And the low end of the market doesn't want the high-end products and the high end of the market today doesn't want the low-end products. That may happen over time, but right now, it's all incremental upside as far as I'm concerned."

And they decided that they didn't like that anymore, and they'd really prefer to have 1 tool. And as they had to go from 2 to 1, they were going to Creo. So that was a pretty substantial displacement of a very well-known high-end product.

And if we had to pick, I might pick Creo."" So kind of that opposite ends of the Creo range, if you will, we're displacing different products from the same vendor.
And that vendor, you can guess who it is, has kind of left their customers a little frustrated. Some of their business policies, some of their technical strategies aren't well accepted by the customers and is creating some discontent, and some of that just content turns into switching. Especially if you're looking at 2 tools, and you're saying, ""I wish we had one."" Well, I really like those B2C guys. Their tools are great and they're better to work with, and off we go."

In fact, Arena was an example, but we've made a couple of other little tuck-ins that we didn't announce because they were too small. But definitely, that's a business.
And the way I look at it, they're paving the path for a future PTC because at some point, our industry will really go to SaaS. I mean it's starting to, and that's good. But at some point, it will tip right over like other industries have. And at that point, that business unit will be bigger and bigger and may, in fact, be the future center of gravity for PTC. It's not big enough at $100 million, that's $100 million on, let's call it, $1.4 billion. So it's not yet 10%. But you put Arena in there and it steps up closer to 10%, and then you let that growth rate run for a while, and it won't be long before it's quite meaningful to us. But that's what they're doing.

But they might decide they don't want SaaS for whatever reason. And it might be that other people in their company already use SolidWorks or what have you. But think of Onshape as a really good CAD system on a completely different deployment and business model. And the deployment and business model is even more differentiated -- is more differentiated than the product itself is.
So I think smaller companies say, I really like the idea of being able to get to this data without having a server, without having a system administrator, without having -- I'd like to be able to pick up my work at home on my Macintosh if I worked on it all day on a Windows Workstation. I mean that stuff's great. I like the real-time collaboration. Onshape is a multi-user system where multiple users work together on the same designs at the same time as opposed to multiple users working independently and passing data back and forth, which is how most other CAD systems work.
So I think, again, I often say, think of it like electric vehicles versus internal combustion engines. It's religion at some level. And very few people get down to a short list that has 3 of each. Somewhere in the decision-making process, they either say, ""I want electric, and now I'm down to a short list of electric vehicles."" Or, ""I don't want electric, I'm going to stay with internal combustion."" And they end up with that short list. But I'm saying for those customers who say, ""I think I want SaaS,"" there's a good chance we're going to win that deal."

I hope that you and your families have continued to stay safe throughout the ongoing pandemic. 
I'd like to begin by congratulating Tim Fox our long-time Senior VP of Investor Relations, who's left to pursue an exciting opportunity at ACV Auctions following the recent IPO. I worked closely with Tim for many years and feel he added tremendous value to our Investor Relations program. 
While we'll certainly miss Tim, we wish him all the best in his new role. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased to share that we delivered another strong performance in the second quarter. Bookings grew in the mid-30s as compared to a Q2 period from a year ago when bookings declined 15% as the pandemic set in. 
Organic bookings grew in the mid-20s. While much of the booking strength contributed to the second quarter's performance, some of the bookings have start dates in later periods and, therefore, went into backlog or what we will call deferred ARR going forward. 
I'm pleased to see that with several consecutive strong bookings quarters, deferred ARR has returned to pre-COVID levels as customers continue to make commitments to invest in their digital transformation initiatives over the long term. This deferred ARR gives PTC a foundation for growth going forward. 
The economic environment across the globe continues to improve with PMI numbers returning to or exceeding pre-COVID levels in many regions. This data, coupled with the steady increase of vaccinations and stimulus plans from the current administration is encouraging. From our perspective, demand we see for our core products and SaaS offerings, combined with a strong pipeline heading into the second half of 2021, supports our outlook for the year. 
In the top line category, we had a very solid quarter with ARR growth of 18% or 15% in constant currency to $1.39 billion. Growth was driven by a combination of our growth business, which delivered strong results by continued momentum in our core business, where we again outpaced market growth and by strong performance from Arena Solutions in its first quarter being part of PTC. 
On an organic and constant currency basis, we had 11% ARR growth in Q2 of '21, in line with our guidance. If you flip to Slide 5 for a minute, I'd like to remind you that when we use the term ARR, we are referring to the annualized run rate of the book of recurring revenue contracts that are currently active. 
So ARR really means active ARR, and this important metric is what drives our cash flow. On top of that, we have the deferred ARR I mentioned earlier. Given the strong bookings we've had over the past 3 quarters, our total ARR growth, which includes deferred ARR, is up 12% on a constant currency organic basis in Q2. 
As you know, timing of start dates and the nature of ramp deals can impact when a booking moves into active ARR. Therefore, we feel it's important to look at total ARR, again, the sum of active ARR plus deferred ARR. We've been guiding active ARR growth of 10% to 12%. And on top of that, we have been expecting approximately $80 million in deferred ARR as we exit fiscal 2021. We're now projecting more than $90 million in deferred ARR for the full year, which is because bookings in the first half of 2021 have been stronger than what you've seen reported in our reported active ARR results. 
Given the uncertainty around start dates and the magnitude of ramp deals, if a higher mix of our bookings were to flow into deferred ARR rather than active ARR in future quarters, it could put some pressure on active ARR even while total ARR would remain constant. And of course, it could go the other way too with a mix that benefits active ARR. 
We think that by providing more insight into total ARR growth rate we can help show the true underlying performance of the business. By the way, anytime Kristian or I say ARR without a qualifier, we'll be referring to active ARR by default. That remains the most important metric. 
We'll be able to -- or we'll be careful to explicitly call out any references to deferred ARR or total ARR. Coming back to Slide 4 for a moment, to close out the top line category. Revenue growth of 28% was driven by strong execution as well as the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition, plus, of course, the Arena contribution. 
Switching to the bottom line category, we delivered strong free cash flow of $116 million and non-GAAP EPS growth of 83%, reflecting a combination of strong top line results combined with continued operating expense discipline. We did see unfavorable currency movement during the quarter, which impacts our guidance for the full year, but Kristian will share more details on that later in the call. 
While the economic environment is improving, the big driver of PTC's growth continues to be our strong alignment with the digital transformation initiatives of our customers and prospects. As you can see on Slide 6, PTC's logo speaks directly to the idea that digital transforms physical, which is our simple way of saying that PTC's portfolio of digital solutions allow industrial companies to improve growth and profitability by making transformative changes to their physical products into the physical processes of engineering, manufacturing and servicing them. 
PTC's digital transformation story is deep and wide. And our portfolio is full of innovative digital capabilities that align with high-value customer use cases across our CAD, PLM, IoT and AR segments. Our new SaaS strategy gives us another major vector with which to pursue new dimensions of digital transformation. 
With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, core and growth segments of our portfolio. Moving to Slide 7. You'll see that ARR in our Focused Solution Group, or FSG, was essentially flat. But I'm pleased to share that we did see a couple of significant wins in retail and defense which will create a tailwind for ARR growth going forward. 
ARR growth for our core business in constant currency was in the double-digit range and the 27% organic constant currency year-over-year growth of our growth business is consistent with our guidance for the year. With every passing quarter, the growth business is becoming a larger percentage of our ARR and as we discussed at our Investor Day last December, this can be expected to drive higher growth rates for the company over time. 
With the inclusion of Arena, our growth business now has more than $250 million of ARR. Let's go quick deeper into the main elements of our core and growth segments. Turning to Slide 8. Our CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the high single digits. 
The rebound in the demand environment that we started to see in Q4 of 2020 continued this past quarter with strong performance across all our major geos. The response to the enhanced capabilities of Creo 7 and and the growing interest in Creo Simulation Live and Creo ANSYS Simulation that we're seeing, clearly demonstrates that customers appreciate what optimizing design efficiency and accuracy can do for them. 
We're not stopping there. Just today, we announced Creo 8, which includes the Creo generative design extension module called GDX, which is based on our Atlas SaaS platform. GDX on Atlas will deliver the most advanced AI-based generative design capabilities available, benefiting from elastic compute in the cloud with seamless integration to the desktop Creo CAD environment. 
Creo 8 also expands our model based design capabilities, extends additive and subtractive manufacturing capabilities and delivers improvements to the ANSYS-powered simulation offerings. The importance of a strong connection between design and simulation is illustrated by Speed Consulting on Slide 9. 
When the large aerospace customer needed expert design guidance, the real-time design feedback combined with full simulation capabilities, enabled the delivery of structural, thermal and vibration analyses in record time. This customer is a long time Creo customer who immediately recognize the value of the deep integration of CAD and simulation that we're offering in partnership with ANSYS. 
Moving on to Slide 10 in our PLM business, you'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective in Q2, PLM performance was broad-based with solid growth across all 3 major geographies led by Asia Pac. Thanks to the role it plays in digital transformation initiatives, PLM continues to be a major growth engine. 
From a vertical perspective, our PLM business was strong across a number of verticals, including medical devices, industrials and FA&D. Plus, we landed a few large wins and competitive displacements during the quarter. A competitive displacement was at Kimberly Clark, seen here on Slide 11, which is a new logo for PTC. Who selected Windchill as their digital backbone for product development processes. The ability to tightly integrate Windchill with SAP allowed Kimberly Clark to optimize processes that span multiple systems. 
Moving on to our growth business. I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. IoT delivered a third consecutive quarter of improving year-over-year ARR growth with strong new logo growth, and bookings up nearly 50%, while ARR increased 20% from a year ago, we're seeing a good rebound from the slowdown caused by COVID-related travel restrictions and lockdowns that we saw a year ago. 
Our pipeline remains strong and churn continues to modestly improve, putting us in a good position as we head into the second half of 2021. On Slide 13, Strama MPS, a provider of custom machinery and plant engineering. It's just 1 of many companies that pivoted to making PPE during the pandemic. With the challenge of moving from industrial machinery to delicate medical masks at high volume, ThingWorx was used to rapidly identify and fix anomalies on a legging production line and helps Strama complete the changeover process within approximately 1 month. 
Let me shift to our augmented reality business on Slide 14. The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered very strong results in Q2 and with ARR up 60% year-over-year, driven in particular by Vuforia studio and engine. 
Expansions drove over 50% of the bookings in the quarter. Traction outside the Americas continued to gain momentum with strong growth in both Europe and APAC. I'm also pleased to share that Vuforia Expert Capture has been successfully replatformed onto Atlas and now benefits from the operational and technical scalability of the Atlas multi-tenant SaaS architecture. 
Customers can now scale deployments across the enterprise, leverage the same collaboration, version control, content management, and approval workflows that you'd see in Onshape. This is functionality that would have taken much longer to deliver without Atlas. We'll be shipping another new Vuforia product called Vuforia Instruct here in Q2. And and it, too, will be based on Atlas. 
Turning to Slide 15. Here's a great proof point regarding the power of Vuforia Chalk this coming directly from our ecosystem. When a Rockwell customer needed to install new equipment to prevent a costly production shutdown during a time that Rockwell was constrained by travel restrictions, Rockwell engineers leveraged Vuforia Chalk to enable remote experts to see the equipment installation virtually and to provide digital coaching to the on-site engineers. 
As a result, the customer maintained production levels without any revenue loss. Turning now to Slide 16. Onshape delivered a very strong quarter with strong bookings growth and a healthy mix of new logo activity and expansions. The bulk of the Onshape business continues to come from SolidWorks replacements. 
Our education adoption remains strong, and we're starting to see the first education enterprise renewals following the first year free education program that we initiated last year as the pandemic set in. Onshape's ability to deliver seamless collaborative CAD capabilities is definitely meeting an unmet need in the market. 
On Slide 17, Loop Medical is developing a painless blood collection technology needed for routine lab testing, while making the collection process safer and more economical. Thanks to the pure SaaS Atlas platform that underlies Onshape, Loop can run their CAD and data management platform on their current MAC environment without having to invest in clunky virtualization technology, and perhaps more importantly, Loop can offer real-time collaboration capabilities to their distributed global teams and accelerate the design process. 
Finally, moving to Arena on Slide 19. It's exciting to see how well the Arena team performed in their first full quarter as part of PTC. ARR growth was in the mid-teens, while bookings were up more than 50%. Arena is seeing strong traction with upselling, while also increasing penetration into current customer environments and at the same time, keeping retention rates high. The integration is going smoothly and the road map to enable cross-sell programs to expand geographically and to move upmarket is on track. 
Arena is engaging some really innovative companies. On Slide 19, you'll see that they've been working with RefleXion who's creating the first biology guided radiotherapy system. RefleXion needed a solution to scale in parallel with their medical device compliance and commercialization needs. By designating Arena as a system of record, charged with controlling product design and quality and then integrating it with RefleXion's ERP platform, the company was able to create a single source product and quality solution. 
The momentum we're seeing in our growth business, both from an ARR standpoint and from a product innovation perspective, provides PTC with a great portfolio to drive long-term growth. 
Turning to Slide 20. You've heard me reference our Atlas platform several times already with respect to Creo to Vuforia and to Onshape. What you're actually seeing are the first signs of our plan to SaaSify PTC's entire portfolio onto the Atlas platform over time. While we'll continue to offer on-premise versions of core products indefinitely, a growing number of our customers want to enjoy the great benefits of SaaS but at the same time, prefer not to switch off their current enterprise systems. 
PTC is essentially doing with Creo and Windchill, what Microsoft has done with Office in 365. When an on-prem workload shifts to Saas, the ARR of that workload roughly doubles. So this is expected to become a significant source of growth for PTC in the mid to long term. Just as Office 365 has been for Microsoft. 
The introduction of this new growth driver gives us confidence that we can sustain strong levels of growth in the core business for years to come. Let me provide some color on geographic performance, which was strong across the globe, and as shown on Slide 21, reflects continued recovery. Americas ARR growth of 21% was driven by Arena augmented reality and solid core performance. 
Europe ARR grew 8%, consistent with prior several quarters with notable strength in AR and high-teens growth in IoT. APAC delivered the third quarter in a row of mid-teens ARR growth with strong performance across all segments. 
With that, now let me turn to Slide 22 and touch on our key alliance partners. The Microsoft alliance delivered year-over-year bookings of 30%, driven by demand for AR and our joint deal count increasing 40% year-over-year, both of which are solid indicators that our alliance is further evolving. To support additional growth, we've also added PTC field resources in Asia Pac and Americas. 
Before we move on from Microsoft, you probably saw the announcement yesterday that Kathleen Mitford is leaving PTC to join Microsoft. This is a great career opportunity for Kathleen, and I'm pleased she'll remain in our ecosystem. 
Fortunately, we had a successor ready to go, and we promoted Catherine Kinekor, who goes by CK to be our new Chief Strategy Officer. Congratulations to Kathleen and to CK. 
Moving on to Rockwell. We had 1 of the stronger bookings quarters to date in our alliance and showed significant growth year-over-year. It was a strong quarter for the Americas and APAC. More than 30% of the deals were net new logos to PTC and top verticals included manufacturing, distribution services and process manufacturing. 
Our ANSYS alliance continued its momentum in Q2 with double-digit ARR growth. Last week, PTC was named 2020 ANSYS Growth Partner of the Year at their Simulation World Conference. As I alluded to earlier, the customer sentiment around Creo Simulation Live and Creo ANSYS Simulation has been very positive. 
To wrap up and summarize my comments, turning to Slide 23. A we're in great shape at the midpoint of fiscal 21 as customers continue to embark on digital transformation initiatives, adopting more of the full PTC product portfolio as they proceed. In addition to being in great shape for FY '21, the strong growth in deferred ARR means we're already laying the foundation for solid growth in FY '22 and beyond. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Kristian, who will take you through a few more details on the financial results and guidance."

Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a review of our sec",795,"Great. Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. 
Let me start off with a review of our second quarter results, then review our guidance for fiscal 21. 
Turning to Slide 25. Fiscal Q2 ARR of $1.39 billion increased 15% year-over-year and organic ARR grew 11%. Strong Q2 free cash flow of $116 million was in line with our expectations. Q2 revenue of $462 million increased 22% year-over-year. The revenue performance was driven by strong execution and also reflects the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition as well as a modest contribution from Arena. 
The strong revenue growth, along with continued financial discipline resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 83% year-over-year. 
Turning to Page 26. I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with cash of $326 million and $1.5 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of 3.1%. We paid down $80 million on our revolving credit facility during the quarter. 
Now that our leverage ratio is below 3x, which we told you as our goal. We're evaluating the timing of reinstating our share repurchase program. 
Now turning to Slide 27. This slide really highlights a few of the key guidance assumptions. The only real change to our assumptions here is the impact of FX movements. And so with these assumptions as context, we're still expecting fiscal '21 bookings growth in the double digits year-over-year and putting our ARR guidance into perspective. 
Now turning to Slide 28. Last quarter, we told you we expected fiscal '21 ARR to be $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion, a growth rate of 16% to 18%. This assumed 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and a 200 basis point tailwind from currency. 
Our revised guidance range of $1.45 billion to $1.47 billion is 14% to 16%, which assumes 10% to 12% organic growth, same as before, 400 basis points from Arena, same as before, and now no impact from FX. Regarding ARR linearity in fiscal '21. On an organic constant currency basis, we continue to expect the growth rates to be fairly consistent each quarter throughout fiscal '21. Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year. This is growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. And as we said at the beginning of the year, we expected more than 60% of this free cash flow to come in the first half. As we finish the first half, we've delivered 2/3 of that target. 
And just as a reminder, that $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $14 million of acquisition-related fees and additional $7.5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the Arena-related debt, a $14 million unforecasted payment due to a foreign tax dispute. And also includes approximately $16 million of restructuring payments. 
This is offset by incremental cash flow from Arena and a positive impact from FX as well of about $10 million. Free cash flow excludes about $25 million of capital expenditures as well. And as a reminder, collections are stronger in the first half, and this is offset by timing of expenses and headcount ramping throughout the year. And as you all know, we have our next bond interest payment due in the fourth quarter. 
As such, we're expecting 65% to 75% of the remaining free cash flow for our target to come in the third quarter. Now turning to P&L guidance. We're raising our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. Our original guidance was $1.69 billion to $1.73 billion, a growth rate of 16% to 19%. We're now expecting fiscal '21 revenue of $1.71 billion to $1.74 billion, it's a growth rate of 17% to 19%, which includes about 250 basis points from Arena and no impact from -- or nominal impact, if you will, from FX. 
We're increasing our operating margin guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. GAAP operating margin increases from 15% to 16% to 15% to 17%. And and non-GAAP operating margin increases from 31 -- 30% to 31% to 31% to 32%. Non-GAAP EPS guidance was $3.05 to $3.35. The revised guidance is now $3.18 to $3.39. That's growth of 24% to 32%. 
So wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again in Q2. We delivered double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on our expense structure and continuing to navigate what's still a challenging macro environment. I think the first half positions us well to deliver attractive double-digit top line growth and strong free cash flow for the year. 
With that, we'll turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A."

I'd love to hear how you sort of envision PTC's move to Saas. It looks like you'll have all your products available in a SaaS form -- well, the major products available in a SaaS form factor by fiscal '22. And so is the question -- or rather, the question is, is this something you perhaps drive your customer base to or encourage them to adopt? Or is this something that you're going to let happen naturally? 
And maybe the follow-on to that for Kristian is can you just talk about how this plan for SaaSifying the business long term, of course, maybe plays into that fiscal '24 free cash flow target? Sorry, a lot there, but does that make sense?"

So there's a lot you can read into this slide. But if you notice the other logos, then Onshape and Atlas, start a darker greener color and as they move to the right, become more or less the same color of At",543,"Yes, it does. And it's actually a good question. So there's a lot you can read into this slide. But if you notice the other logos, then Onshape and Atlas, start a darker greener color and as they move to the right, become more or less the same color of Atlas and in -- or I'm sorry, Onshape. And that's because we call this strategy and insidious SaaSification strategy, which means it happens step-by-step. 
And it's already started. Vuforia already has the first offerings on Onshape like expert capture. Which is 1 of the biggest ones. We're about to ship the second Vuforia product on Atlas, which will be called Vuforia Instruct coming out later this quarter. 
We mentioned that Creo is shipping a capability on Atlas now for generative design called Creo GDX. And you'll start to see that coming from Windchill and coming from Thingworx. So what we're going to do is begin to offer incremental or, in some cases, replacement modules on Saas. And then over time, the whole suite of each product line will become available on Saas. 
So a customer could begin adopting a part of it, get comfortable with the idea, start to generate some incremental revenue for us. And then in year 2 or 3 or 4, even flip the switch and go 100% to Saas. So that's what that diagram intends to show you is that these products are all climbing on board, but it's not an all or nothing. 
It's step-by-step moving toward that all state where they're fully based on Atlas, and we have really a dream unified SaaS portfolio. I'm so excited about that because a lot of these products have divergent heritages and they're on different architectures today integrated together, but still on different architectures. And we have like a spring cleaning opportunity here, thanks to the power of Atlas to unify on a single platform. 
And and everybody at PTC is aligned behind this. So we're making great progress. And if you think in a year or 2, Windchill and Creo will have $1 billion of ARR. So if we can get some even modest degree of penetration on a 2 for 1 ARR uplift, it's a lot of growth in those businesses. So it's not going to be a lot here. This year, it's not going to be a lot next year, but by the time we get out to '24, '25 it is going to be a lot. 
I will tell you, though, that any guidance we gave you doesn't really contemplate this. This is kind of a new factor. I mean, I'm maybe moving into Kristian's question here. But our original thinking on SaaSification would be there was more all or nothing, and then we decided that this so-called insidious strategy is much more interesting for everybody, customers and PTC. 
And so we're now factoring this into the next rev, if you will, of our long-range plan. And it's going to be impactful. But again, the real big impact is farther to the right even in years yet to come on this chart. So it's going to be a big deal, but not a big deal in the near term. Anything you want to add to that?"

This closed-loop life cycle strategy that you and I both talk about is very unique to PTC. It's CAD and PLM, plus IoT and AR. And now this really interesting new dimension of Saas. That's a differentiated strategy. I always say our PLM competitors don't have IoT or IoT competitors don't have AR and so forth. And there's so much synergy between these products. We cross-sell all day long because customers like the value proposition. 
So I think it's a differentiated strategy. And the products are independently good, but they show up as a team, and the team is phenomenal, the portfolio. And I think it's just really helped us.

I guess, are you seeing things take place or transact in the first half where when you look to the second half, you're maybe mindful of things being pulled forward?

We just delivered 11% ARR growth. So I guess I'm not 100% sure. 1 other thing I'd point out is, our business performed pretty well last year. And some of our comps, so in particular, if you take out the Medidata acquisition, posted some pretty negative numbers. In the parts of the business that compete with us. So they're showing less growth against serious declines, we're showing strong growth on strong growth. 
So I feel like some of the companies who fell into a deep hole during COVID unlike BDC, we'll post bigger numbers as they just get back to where they were in the prior year. But if you look at our 2-year CAGR, everything is growing. Even through the COVID period. And a lot of our comps really aren't growing.

And just to be clear, we first released it as part of the desktop application. And for compute horsepower, use the graphics card. That gets you quite a bit of compute horsepower for certain types of compute-intensive codes like generative design. 
But what we've done now in the second iteration is put it on Atlas, where there's elastic compute, you can have the biggest computer in the world running your generative analyses for you. Let me also say, 1 of the next steps will be the pipe that generative design capability into Onshape. Because it's actually running on the same platform as Onshape now. We just got to build it out into the UI and the functionality of Onshape. 
So what we'll do with generative design is, for sure, will go back to the Creo base. And we will upsell this new module. It's a purchase you add on. And then we'll go into the Onshape base, and we'll do the same thing. I think that generative design is a brand-new idea. It's a transformational idea, but some of these ideas started a little slow and then really take off once people understand what they can do. 
So I expect we'll see that pattern. And then I do think it will give us more competitive alternatives because opportunities. Because I think what we have is unique and special. And I think that if somebody is thinking about switching off SolidWorks, if they want to go to a high end product, they'll be impressed by Creo. If they want to go to a simpler product that's simpler to own and so forth, they'll look at Onshape and say, wow. 
So I think it does give us an opportunity to take some market share. But the first and primary opportunity is the opportunity to drive more growth in the installed base."

That new agreement gave Rockwell the right to sell more products because sometimes they come across those opportunities. But it wasn't really changing the center of gravity of the partnership. 
I think if you look at what's driving a little more momentum with Rockwell, it's 2 things. First of all, Rockwell brought in some new talent. And I'll just say from the sidelines as a partner, these guys are making a difference. They're shaking some things up and really creating some energy. 
And then the second thing is Rockwell had a good quarter overall. Particularly on the orders front. I saw they announced today and their order book was up double digits and so forth. So I imagine some of those orders ended up flowing our way. So I think it's really more improving economic situation in the world of industrial automation, coupled by new talent. 
It's not really a mix shift in the product line up to sell it."

The whole portfolio? Well, I think the demand sort of mirrors the growth rates. As you might expect, some of the products with the highest growth rate, of course, in order to sustain those growth rates, they have the highest bookings. And in some cases, higher churn as well with newer technologies and so forth. 
And then when you get to a product like Creo, churn is very low. So we can build a growth business of less aggressive bookings coming in the top. So I would say, yes, demand is strongest for Vuforia and Onshape. At the next level, it's really ThingWorx. And then below that, PLM and below that CAD, just in terms of demand. 
But it's again a function of the maturity of these products. It's a function of the growth rate of the markets, which is sort of a function of the maturity of the markets and so forth. Hopefully, that hits your question.

Certainly compared to some competitors who weren't posting numbers or anything like that. 
But I'd say it's broad-based. I mean, there's a few pockets like medical device in med tech in general, which is a regulated industry around the globe. We're especially good at that. Windchill tends to take a large percentage of those deals in the larger accounts. And believe it or not, Arena takes a lot of those deals in the smaller accounts is kind of more of a mid-market solution. But they, too, in their market space, are particularly good at regulated markets.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope that you and your families have continued to stay safe throughout the ongoing pandemic.
I'd like to begin by congratulating Tim Fox, our long-time Senior VP of Investor Relations, who's left to pursue an exciting opportunity at ACV Auctions following their recent IPO. I worked closely with Tim for many years and feel he added tremendous value to our Investor Relations program. While we'll certainly miss Tim, we wish him all the best in his new role.
Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased to share that we delivered another strong performance in the second quarter. Bookings grew in the mid-30s as compared to our Q2 period from a year ago when bookings declined 15% as the pandemic set in. Organic bookings grew in the mid-20s. While much of the bookings strength contributed to the second quarter's performance, some of the bookings have start dates in later periods and, therefore, went into backlog or what we will call deferred ARR going forward. I'm pleased to see that with several consecutive strong bookings quarters, deferred ARR has returned to pre-COVID levels as customers continue to make commitments to invest in their digital transformation initiatives over the long term. This deferred ARR gives PTC a foundation for growth going forward.
The economic environment across the globe continues to improve, with PMI numbers returning to or exceeding pre-COVID levels in many regions. This data, coupled with the steady increase of vaccinations and stimulus plans from the current administration, is encouraging. From our perspective, demand we see for our core products and SaaS offerings, combined with a strong pipeline heading into the second half of 2021, supports our outlook for the year.
In the top line category, we had a very solid quarter with ARR growth of 18% or 15% in constant currency to $1.39 billion. Growth was driven by a combination of our growth business, which delivered strong results, by continued momentum in our core business where we again outpaced market growth and by strong performance from Arena Solutions in its first quarter being part of PTC. On an organic and constant currency basis, we had 11% ARR growth in Q2 of '21, in line with our guidance.
If you flip to Slide 5 for a minute, I'd like to remind you that when we use the term ARR, we are referring to the annualized run rate of the book of recurring revenue contracts that are currently active. So ARR really means active ARR, and this important metric is what drives our cash flow. On top of that, we have the deferred ARR I mentioned earlier. Given the strong bookings we've had over the past 3 quarters, our total ARR growth, which includes deferred ARR, is up 12% on a constant currency organic basis in Q2.
As you know, timing of start dates and the nature of ramp deals can impact when a booking moves into active ARR. Therefore, we feel it's important to look at total ARR, again, the sum of active ARR plus deferred ARR. We've been guiding active ARR growth of 10% to 12%. And on top of that, we have been expecting approximately $80 million in deferred ARR as we exit fiscal 2021. We're now projecting more than $90 million in deferred ARR for the full year, which is because bookings in the first half of 2021 have been stronger than what you've seen reported in our reported active ARR results.
Given the uncertainty around start dates and the magnitude of ramp deals, if a higher mix of our bookings were to flow into deferred ARR rather than active ARR in future quarters, it could put some pressure on active ARR even while total ARR would remain constant. And of course, it could go the other way too with a mix that benefits active ARR. We think that by providing more insight into total ARR growth rate, we can help show the true underlying performance of the business. By the way, anytime Kristian or I say ARR without a qualifier, we'll be referring to active ARR by default. That remains the most important metric. We'll be able to -- or we'll be careful to explicitly call out any references to deferred ARR or total ARR.
Coming back to Slide 4 for a moment to close out the top line category. Revenue growth of 28% was driven by strong execution as well as the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition, plus, of course, the Arena contribution. Switching to the bottom line category, we delivered strong free cash flow of $116 million and non-GAAP EPS growth of 83%, reflecting a combination of strong top line results combined with continued operating expense discipline. We did see unfavorable currency movement during the quarter, which impacts our guidance for the full year, but Kristian will share more details on that later in the call.
While the economic environment is improving, the big driver of PTC's growth continues to be our strong alignment with the digital transformation initiatives of our customers and prospects. As you can see on Slide 6, PTC's logo speaks directly to the idea that digital transforms physical, which is our simple way of saying that PTC's portfolio of digital solutions allow industrial companies to improve growth and profitability by making transformative changes to their physical products and to the physical processes of engineering, manufacturing and servicing them. PTC's digital transformation story is deep and wide. And our portfolio is full of innovative digital capabilities that align with high-value customer use cases across our CAD, PLM, IoT and AR segments. Our new SaaS strategy gives us another major vector with which to pursue new dimensions of digital transformation.
With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, Core and Growth segments of our portfolio. Moving to Slide 7, you'll see that ARR in our Focused Solutions Group, or FSG, was essentially flat. But I'm pleased to share that we did see a couple of significant wins in retail and defense, which will create a tailwind for ARR growth going forward. ARR growth for our Core business in constant currency was in the double-digit range, and the 27% organic constant currency year-over-year growth of our Growth business is consistent with our guidance for the year. With every passing quarter, the Growth business is becoming a larger percentage of our ARR. And as we discussed at our Investor Day last December, this can be expected to drive higher growth rates for the company over time. With the inclusion of Arena, our Growth business now has more than $250 million of ARR.
Let's go a click deeper into the main elements of our Core and Growth segments. Turning to Slide 8, our CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the high single digits. The rebound in the demand environment that we started to see in Q4 of 2020 continued this past quarter with strong performance across all our major geos. The response to the enhanced capabilities of Creo 7 and the growing interest in Creo Simulation Live and Creo Ansys Simulation that we're seeing clearly demonstrates that customers appreciate what optimizing design efficiency and accuracy can do for them.
We're not stopping there. Just today, we announced Creo 8, which includes the Creo generative design extension module, called GDX, which is based on our Atlas SaaS platform. GDX on Atlas will deliver the most advanced AI-based generative design capabilities available, benefiting from elastic compute in the cloud with seamless integration to the desktop Creo CAD environment. Creo 8 also expands our model-based design capabilities, extends additive and subtractive manufacturing capabilities and delivers improvements to the Ansys-powered simulation offerings.
The importance of a strong connection between design and simulation is illustrated by Speed Consulting on Slide 9. When a large aerospace customer needed expert design guidance, the real-time design feedback combined with full simulation capabilities enabled the delivery of structural, thermal and vibration analyses in record time. This customer is a long-time Creo customer who immediately recognized the value of the deep integration of CAD and simulation that we're offering in partnership with Ansys.
Moving on to Slide 10 in our PLM business, you'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective in Q2, PLM performance was broad-based with solid growth across all 3 major geographies led by Asia Pac. Thanks to the role it plays in digital transformation initiatives, PLM continues to be a major growth engine. From a vertical perspective, our PLM business was strong across a number of verticals, including medical devices, industrials and FA&D. Plus, we landed a few large wins and competitive displacements during the quarter.
A competitive displacement was at Kimberly Clark, seen here on Slide 11, which is a new logo for PTC who selected Windchill as their digital backbone for product development processes. The ability to tightly integrate Windchill with SAP allowed Kimberly Clark to optimize processes that span multiple systems.
Moving on to our Growth business, I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. IoT delivered a third consecutive quarter of improving year-over-year ARR growth. With strong new logo growth and bookings up nearly 50%, while ARR increased 20% from a year ago, we're seeing a good rebound from the slowdown caused by COVID-related travel restrictions and lockdowns that we saw a year ago. Our pipeline remains strong and churn continues to modestly improve, putting us in a good position as we head into the second half of 2021.
On Slide 13, Strama-MPS, a provider of custom machinery and plant engineering, is just one of many companies that pivoted to making PPE during the pandemic. With the challenge of moving from industrial machinery to delicate medical masks at high volume, ThingWorx was used to rapidly identify and fix anomalies on a lagging production line and helped Strama complete the changeover process within approximately 1 month.
Let me shift to our Augmented Reality business on Slide 14. The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered very strong results in Q2 with ARR up 60% year-over-year driven in particular by Vuforia Studio and Engine. Expansions drove over 50% of the bookings in the quarter. Traction outside the Americas continued to gain momentum with strong growth in both Europe and APAC. I'm also pleased to share that Vuforia Expert Capture has been successfully replatformed onto Atlas and now benefits from the operational and technical scalability of the Atlas multi-tenant SaaS architecture. Customers can now scale deployments across the enterprise, leverage the same collaboration, version control, content management and approval workflows that you'd see in Onshape. This is a functionality that would have taken much longer to deliver without Atlas. We'll be shipping another new Vuforia product called Vuforia Instruct here in Q2. And it, too, will be based on Atlas.
Turning to Slide 15, here's a great proof point regarding the power of Vuforia Chalk that's coming directly from our ecosystem. When a Rockwell customer needed to install new equipment to prevent a costly production shutdown during a time that Rockwell was constrained by travel restrictions, Rockwell engineers leveraged Vuforia Chalk to enable remote experts to see the equipment installation virtually and to provide digital coaching to the on-site engineers. As a result, the customer maintained production levels without any revenue loss.
Turning now to Slide 16. Onshape delivered a very strong quarter with strong bookings growth and a healthy mix of new logo activity and expansions. The bulk of the Onshape business continues to come from SolidWorks replacements. Our Education adoption remains strong, and we're starting to see the first Education enterprise renewals following the first year free Education program that we initiated last year as the pandemic set in. Onshape's ability to deliver seamless, collaborative CAD capabilities is definitely meeting an unmet need in the market.
On Slide 17, Loop Medical is developing a painless blood collection technology needed for routine lab testing while making the collection process safer and more economical. Thanks to the pure SaaS Atlas platform that underlies Onshape, Loop can run their CAD and data management platform on their current Mac environment without having to invest in clunky virtualization technology. And perhaps, more importantly, Loop can offer real-time collaboration capabilities to their distributed global teams and accelerate the design process.
Finally, moving to Arena on Slide 19. It's exciting to see how well the Arena team performed in their first full quarter as part of PTC. ARR growth was in the mid-teens, while bookings were up more than 50%. Arena is seeing strong traction with upselling while also increasing penetration into current customer environments and, at the same time, keeping retention rates high. The integration is going smoothly, and the road map to enable cross-sell programs to expand geographically and to move upmarket is on track.
Arena is engaging some really innovative companies. On Slide 19, you'll see that they've been working with RefleXion who's creating the first biology-guided radiotherapy system. RefleXion needed a solution to scale in parallel with their medical device compliance and commercialization needs. By designating Arena as a system of record, charged with controlling product design and quality and then integrating it with RefleXion's ERP platform, the company was able to create a single source product and quality solution.
The momentum we're seeing in our Growth business, both from an ARR standpoint and from a product innovation perspective, provides PTC with a great portfolio to drive long-term growth.
Turning to Slide 20, you've heard me reference our Atlas platform several times already with respect to Creo, to Vuforia and to Onshape. What you're actually seeing are the first signs of our plan to SaaS-ify PTC's entire portfolio onto the Atlas platform over time. While we'll continue to offer on-premise versions of core products indefinitely, a growing number of our customers want to enjoy the great benefits of SaaS but, at the same time, prefer not to switch off their current enterprise systems. PTC is essentially doing with Creo and Windchill what Microsoft has done with Office 365. When an on-prem workload shifts to SaaS, the ARR of that workload roughly doubles. So this is expected to become a significant source of growth for PTC in the mid- to long term, just as Office 365 has been for Microsoft. The introduction of this new growth driver gives us confidence that we can sustain strong levels of growth in the core business for years to come.
Let me provide some color on geographic performance, which was strong across the globe and, as shown on Slide 21, reflects continued recovery. Americas ARR growth of 21% was driven by Arena, augmented reality and solid Core performance. Europe ARR grew 8%, consistent with prior several quarters, with notable strength in AR and high-teens growth in IoT. APAC delivered a third quarter in a row of mid-teens ARR growth with strong performance across all segments.
With that, now let me turn to Slide 22 and touch on our key alliance partners. The Microsoft alliance delivered year-over-year bookings of 30% driven by demand for AR and our joint deal count increasing 40% year-over-year, both of which are solid indicators that our alliance is further evolving. To support additional growth, we've also added PTC field resources in Asia Pac and Americas. Before we move on from Microsoft, you probably saw the announcement yesterday that Kathleen Mitford is leaving PTC to join Microsoft. This is a great career opportunity for Kathleen, and I'm pleased she'll remain in our ecosystem. Fortunately, we had a successor ready to go, and we promoted Catherine Kinekor, who goes by CK, to be our new Chief Strategy Officer. Congratulations to Kathleen and to CK.
Moving on to Rockwell, we had one of the stronger bookings quarters to date in our alliance and showed significant growth year-over-year. It was a strong quarter for the Americas and APAC. More than 30% of the deals were net new logos to PTC, and top verticals included manufacturing, distribution services and process manufacturing.
Our Ansys alliance continued its momentum in Q2 with double-digit ARR growth. Last week, PTC was named 2020 Ansys Growth Partner of the Year at their Simulation World Conference. As I alluded to earlier, the customer sentiment around Creo Simulation Live and Creo Ansys Simulation has been very positive.
To wrap up and summarize my comments, turning to Slide 23, we're in great shape at the midpoint of fiscal '21 as customers continue to embark on digital transformation initiatives, adopting more of the full PTC product portfolio as they proceed. In addition to being in great shape for FY '21, the strong growth in deferred ARR means we're already laying the foundation for solid growth in FY '22 and beyond.
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Kristian who will take you through a few more details on the financial results and guidance."
32710,710410392,2262152,"PTC Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","PTC Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a review of our secon",800,"Great. Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a review of our second quarter results, then review our guidance for fiscal '21.
Turning to Slide 25. Fiscal Q2 ARR of $1.39 billion increased 15% year-over-year, and organic ARR grew 11%. Strong Q2 free cash flow of $116 million was in line with our expectations. Q2 revenue of $462 million increased 22% year-over-year. The revenue performance was driven by strong execution and also reflects the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition as well as a modest contribution from Arena. The strong revenue growth, along with continued financial discipline, resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 83% year-over-year.
Turning to Page 26. I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with cash of $326 million and $1.5 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of 3.1% (sic) [ 3.8% ]. We paid down $80 million on our revolving credit facility during the quarter. Now that our leverage ratio is below 3x, which we told you as our goal, we're evaluating the timing of reinstating our share repurchase program.
Now turning to Slide 27. This slide really highlights a few of the key guidance assumptions. The only real change to our assumptions here is the impact of FX movements. And so with these assumptions as context, we're still expecting fiscal '21 bookings growth in the double digits year-over-year and putting our ARR guidance into perspective.
Then turning to Slide 28. Last quarter, we told you we expected fiscal '21 ARR to be $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion, a growth rate of 16% to 18%. This assumed 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and a 200 basis point tailwind from currency. Our revised guidance range of $1.45 billion to $1.47 billion is 14% to 16%, which assumes 10% to 12% organic growth, same as before; 400 basis points from Arena, same as before; and now no impact from FX.
Regarding ARR linearity in fiscal '21, on an organic constant currency basis, we continue to expect the growth rates to be fairly consistent each quarter throughout fiscal '21. Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year. This is growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. And as we said at the beginning of the year, we expected more than 60% of this free cash flow to come in the first half. As we finish the first half, we've delivered 2/3 of that target.
And just as a reminder, that $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $14 million of acquisition-related fees and additional $7.5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the Arena-related debt, a $14 million unforecasted payment due to a foreign tax dispute and also includes approximately $16 million of restructuring payments. This is offset by incremental cash flow from Arena and a positive impact from FX as well of about $10 million. Free cash flow excludes about $25 million of capital expenditures as well. And as a reminder, collections are stronger in the first half, and this is offset by timing of expenses and head count ramping throughout the year. And as you all know, we have our next bond interest payment due in the fourth quarter. As such, we're expecting 65% to 75% of the remaining free cash flow for our target to come in the third quarter.
Now turning to P&L guidance. We're raising our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. Our original guidance was $1.69 billion to $1.73 billion, a growth rate of 16% to 19%. We're now expecting fiscal '21 revenue of $1.71 billion to $1.74 billion. It's a growth rate of 17% to 19%, which includes about 250 basis points from Arena and no impact from -- or nominal impact, if you will, from FX. We're increasing our operating margin guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. GAAP operating margin increases from 15% to 16% to 15% to 17%, and non-GAAP operating margin increases from 31 -- 30% to 31% to 31% to 32%. Non-GAAP EPS guidance was $3.05 to $3.35. The revised guidance is now $3.18 to $3.39. That's a growth of 24% to 32%.
So wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again in Q2. We delivered double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on our expense structure and continuing to navigate what's still a challenging macro environment. I think the first half positions us well to deliver attractive double-digit top line growth and strong free cash flow for the year.
With that, we'll turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A."

Understanding that, that diagram is a vision and not guidance per se, I'd love to hear how you sort of envisioned PTC's move to SaaS. It looks like you'll have all your products available in a SaaS form -- well, the major products available in a SaaS form factor by fiscal '22. And so is the question -- or rather, the question is, is this something you perhaps drive your customer base to or encourage them to adopt? Or is this something that you're going to let happen naturally? And maybe the follow-on to that for Kristian is, can you just talk about how this plan for SaaS-ifying the business, long term, of course, maybe plays into that fiscal '24 free cash flow target? Sorry, a lot there, but does that make sense?"

So there's a lot you can read into this slide. But if you notice, the other logos, then Onshape and Atlas, a darker greener color and, as they move to the right, become more or less the same color of Atlas",537,"Yes, it does. And it's actually a good question. So there's a lot you can read into this slide. But if you notice, the other logos, then Onshape and Atlas, a darker greener color and, as they move to the right, become more or less the same color of Atlas and -- or I'm sorry, Onshape. And that's because we call this strategy an insidious SaaS-ification strategy, which means it happens step-by-step. And it's already started. Vuforia already has the first offerings on Onshape like Expert Capture, which is one of the biggest ones. We're about to ship the second Vuforia product on Atlas, which will be called Vuforia Instruct coming out later this quarter. We mentioned that Creo is shipping a capability on Atlas now for generative design called Creo GDX. And you'll start to see that coming from Windchill and coming from ThingWorx. So what we're going to do is begin to offer incremental or, in some cases, replacement modules on SaaS. And then over time, the whole suite of each product line will become available on SaaS.
So a customer could begin adopting a part of it, get comfortable with the idea, start to generate some incremental revenue for us. And then in year 2 or 3, or 4 even, flip the switch and go 100% to SaaS. So that's what that diagram intends to show you, is that these products are all climbing onboard. But it's not an all or nothing, it's step-by-step, moving toward that all-state where they're fully based on Atlas, and we have really a dream unified SaaS portfolio. I'm so excited about that because a lot of these products have divergent heritages and they're on different architectures today, integrated together but still on different architectures, and we have like a spring cleaning opportunity here, thanks to the power of Atlas to unify on a single platform. And everybody at PTC is aligned behind this. So we're making great progress.
And if you think in a year or 2, Windchill and Creo will have $1 billion of ARR. So if we can get some -- even modest degree of penetration on a 2-for-1 ARR uplift, it's a lot of growth in those businesses. So it's not going to be a lot here this year. It's not going to be a lot next year. But by the time we get out to '24, '25, it is going to be a lot. I will tell you, though, that any guidance we gave you doesn't really contemplate this. This is kind of a new factor. I mean I'm maybe moving into Kristian's question here, but our original thinking on SaaS-ification would be that it's more all or nothing, and then we decided that this so-called insidious strategy is much more interesting for everybody, customers and PTC. And so we're now factoring this into the next rev, if you will, of our long-range plan. And it's going to be impactful. But again, the real big impact is farther to the right even in years yet to come on this chart. So it's going to be a big deal, but not a big deal in the near term.
Anything you want to add to that?"

And just to be clear, we first released it as part of the desktop application. And for compute horsepower, use the graphics card, which that gets you quite a bit of compute horsepower for certain types of compute-intensive codes like generative design. But what we've done now in the second iteration is put it on Atlas where there's elastic compute. You can have the biggest computer in the world running your generative analyses for you. Let me also say, one of the next steps will be the pipe that generative design capability into Onshape because it's actually running on the same platform as Onshape now. We just got to build it out into the UI and the functionality of Onshape.
So what we'll do with generative design is, for sure, we'll go back to the Creo base, and we will upsell this new module. It's a purchase you add on. And then we'll go into the Onshape base, and we'll do the same thing. I think that generative design is a brand-new idea. It's a transformational idea. But some of these ideas started a little slow and then really take off once people understand what they can do. So I expect we'll see that pattern. And then I do think it will give us more competitive alternatives because -- or opportunities because I think what we have is unique and special. And I think that if somebody is thinking about switching off SolidWorks, if they want to go to a high-end product, they'll be impressed by Creo. If they want to go to a simpler product that's simpler to own and so forth, they'll look at Onshape and say wow. So I think it does give us an opportunity to take some market share.

That new agreement gave Rockwell the right to sell more products because sometimes they come across those opportunities. But it wasn't really changing the center of gravity of the partnership. I think if you look at what's driving a little more momentum with Rockwell, it's two things. First of all, Rockwell brought in some new talent. And I'll just say from the sidelines as a partner, these guys are making a difference. They're shaking some things up and really creating some energy. And then the second thing is Rockwell had a good quarter overall, particularly on the orders front. I saw they announced today, and their order book was up double digits and so forth. So I imagine some of those orders ended up flowing our way. So I think it's really more improving economic situation in the world of industrial automation, coupled by new talent. It's not really a mix shift in the product lineup to sell it."

As you might expect, some of the products with the highest growth rate, of course, in order to sustain those growth rates, they have the highest bookings and, in some cases, higher churn as well with newer technologies and so forth. And then when you get to a product like Creo, churn is very low. So we can build a growth business off less aggressive bookings coming in the top. So I would say, yes, demand is strongest for Vuforia and Onshape. At the next level, it's really ThingWorx. And then below that, PLM; and below that CAD, just in terms of demand.

Windchill tends to take a large percentage of those deals in the larger accounts.
And believe it or not, Arena takes a lot of those deals in the smaller accounts, it's kind of more of a mid-market solution. But they, too, in their market space, are particularly good at regulated markets. But I mean we've had good success in aerospace, good success in the automotive business.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope that you and your families have continued to stay safe throughout the ongoing pandemic.
I'd like to begin by congratulating Tim Fox, our long-time Senior VP of Investor Relations, who's left to pursue an exciting opportunity at ACV Auctions following their recent IPO. I worked closely with Tim for many years and feel he added tremendous value to our Investor Relations program. While we'll certainly miss Tim, we wish him all the best in his new role.
Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased to share that we delivered another strong performance in the second quarter. Bookings grew in the mid-30s as compared to our Q2 period from a year ago when bookings declined 15% as the pandemic set in. Organic bookings grew in the mid-20s. While much of the bookings strength contributed to the second quarter's performance, some of the bookings have start dates in later periods and, therefore, went into backlog or what we will call deferred ARR going forward. I'm pleased to see that with several consecutive strong bookings quarters, deferred ARR has returned to pre-COVID levels as customers continue to make commitments to invest in their digital transformation initiatives over the long term. This deferred ARR gives PTC a foundation for growth going forward.
The economic environment across the globe continues to improve, with PMI numbers returning to or exceeding pre-COVID levels in many regions. This data, coupled with the steady increase of vaccinations and stimulus plans from the current administration, is encouraging. From our perspective, demand we see for our core products and SaaS offerings, combined with a strong pipeline heading into the second half of 2021, supports our outlook for the year.
In the top line category, we had a very solid quarter with ARR growth of 18% or 15% in constant currency to $1.39 billion. Growth was driven by a combination of our growth business, which delivered strong results, by continued momentum in our core business where we again outpaced market growth and by strong performance from Arena Solutions in its first quarter being part of PTC. On an organic and constant currency basis, we had 11% ARR growth in Q2 of '21, in line with our guidance.
If you flip to Slide 5 for a minute, I'd like to remind you that when we use the term ARR, we are referring to the annualized run rate of the book of recurring revenue contracts that are currently active. So ARR really means active ARR, and this important metric is what drives our cash flow. On top of that, we have the deferred ARR I mentioned earlier. Given the strong bookings we've had over the past 3 quarters, our total ARR growth, which includes deferred ARR, is up 12% on a constant currency organic basis in Q2.
As you know, timing of start dates and the nature of ramp deals can impact when a booking moves into active ARR. Therefore, we feel it's important to look at total ARR, again, the sum of active ARR plus deferred ARR. We've been guiding active ARR growth of 10% to 12%. And on top of that, we have been expecting approximately $80 million in deferred ARR as we exit fiscal 2021. We're now projecting more than $90 million in deferred ARR for the full year, which is because bookings in the first half of 2021 have been stronger than what you've seen reported in our reported active ARR results.
Given the uncertainty around start dates and the magnitude of ramp deals, if a higher mix of our bookings were to flow into deferred ARR rather than active ARR in future quarters, it could put some pressure on active ARR even while total ARR would remain constant. And of course, it could go the other way too with a mix that benefits active ARR. We think that by providing more insight into total ARR growth rate, we can help show the true underlying performance of the business. By the way, anytime Kristian or I say ARR without a qualifier, we'll be referring to active ARR by default. That remains the most important metric. We'll be able to -- or we'll be careful to explicitly call out any references to deferred ARR or total ARR.
Coming back to Slide 4 for a moment to close out the top line category. Revenue growth of 28% was driven by strong execution as well as the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition, plus, of course, the Arena contribution. Switching to the bottom line category, we delivered strong free cash flow of $116 million and non-GAAP EPS growth of 83%, reflecting a combination of strong top line results combined with continued operating expense discipline. We did see unfavorable currency movement during the quarter, which impacts our guidance for the full year, but Kristian will share more details on that later in the call.
While the economic environment is improving, the big driver of PTC's growth continues to be our strong alignment with the digital transformation initiatives of our customers and prospects. As you can see on Slide 6, PTC's logo speaks directly to the idea that digital transforms physical, which is our simple way of saying that PTC's portfolio of digital solutions allow industrial companies to improve growth and profitability by making transformative changes to their physical products and to the physical processes of engineering, manufacturing and servicing them. PTC's digital transformation story is deep and wide. And our portfolio is full of innovative digital capabilities that align with high-value customer use cases across our CAD, PLM, IoT and AR segments. Our new SaaS strategy gives us another major vector with which to pursue new dimensions of digital transformation.
With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, Core and Growth segments of our portfolio. Moving to Slide 7, you'll see that ARR in our Focused Solutions Group, or FSG, was essentially flat. But I'm pleased to share that we did see a couple of significant wins in retail and defense, which will create a tailwind for ARR growth going forward. ARR growth for our Core business in constant currency was in the double-digit range, and the 27% organic constant currency year-over-year growth of our Growth business is consistent with our guidance for the year. With every passing quarter, the Growth business is becoming a larger percentage of our ARR. And as we discussed at our Investor Day last December, this can be expected to drive higher growth rates for the company over time. With the inclusion of Arena, our Growth business now has more than $250 million of ARR.
Let's go a click deeper into the main elements of our Core and Growth segments. Turning to Slide 8, our CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the high single digits. The rebound in the demand environment that we started to see in Q4 of 2020 continued this past quarter with strong performance across all our major geos. The response to the enhanced capabilities of Creo 7 and the growing interest in Creo Simulation Live and Creo Ansys Simulation that we're seeing clearly demonstrates that customers appreciate what optimizing design efficiency and accuracy can do for them.
We're not stopping there. Just today, we announced Creo 8, which includes the Creo generative design extension module, called GDX, which is based on our Atlas SaaS platform. GDX on Atlas will deliver the most advanced AI-based generative design capabilities available, benefiting from elastic compute in the cloud with seamless integration to the desktop Creo CAD environment. Creo 8 also expands our model-based design capabilities, extends additive and subtractive manufacturing capabilities and delivers improvements to the Ansys-powered simulation offerings.
The importance of a strong connection between design and simulation is illustrated by Speed Consulting on Slide 9. When a large aerospace customer needed expert design guidance, the real-time design feedback combined with full simulation capabilities enabled the delivery of structural, thermal and vibration analyses in record time. This customer is a long-time Creo customer who immediately recognized the value of the deep integration of CAD and simulation that we're offering in partnership with Ansys.
Moving on to Slide 10 in our PLM business, you'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective in Q2, PLM performance was broad-based with solid growth across all 3 major geographies led by Asia Pac. Thanks to the role it plays in digital transformation initiatives, PLM continues to be a major growth engine. From a vertical perspective, our PLM business was strong across a number of verticals, including medical devices, industrials and FA&D. Plus, we landed a few large wins and competitive displacements during the quarter.
A competitive displacement was at Kimberly Clark, seen here on Slide 11, which is a new logo for PTC who selected Windchill as their digital backbone for product development processes. The ability to tightly integrate Windchill with SAP allowed Kimberly Clark to optimize processes that span multiple systems.
Moving on to our Growth business, I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. IoT delivered a third consecutive quarter of improving year-over-year ARR growth. With strong new logo growth and bookings up nearly 50%, while ARR increased 20% from a year ago, we're seeing a good rebound from the slowdown caused by COVID-related travel restrictions and lockdowns that we saw a year ago. Our pipeline remains strong and churn continues to modestly improve, putting us in a good position as we head into the second half of 2021.
On Slide 13, Strama-MPS, a provider of custom machinery and plant engineering, is just one of many companies that pivoted to making PPE during the pandemic. With the challenge of moving from industrial machinery to delicate medical masks at high volume, ThingWorx was used to rapidly identify and fix anomalies on a lagging production line and helped Strama complete the changeover process within approximately 1 month.
Let me shift to our Augmented Reality business on Slide 14. The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered very strong results in Q2 with ARR up 60% year-over-year driven in particular by Vuforia Studio and Engine. Expansions drove over 50% of the bookings in the quarter. Traction outside the Americas continued to gain momentum with strong growth in both Europe and APAC. I'm also pleased to share that Vuforia Expert Capture has been successfully replatformed onto Atlas and now benefits from the operational and technical scalability of the Atlas multi-tenant SaaS architecture. Customers can now scale deployments across the enterprise, leverage the same collaboration, version control, content management and approval workflows that you'd see in Onshape. This is a functionality that would have taken much longer to deliver without Atlas. We'll be shipping another new Vuforia product called Vuforia Instruct here in Q2. And it, too, will be based on Atlas.
Turning to Slide 15, here's a great proof point regarding the power of Vuforia Chalk that's coming directly from our ecosystem. When a Rockwell customer needed to install new equipment to prevent a costly production shutdown during a time that Rockwell was constrained by travel restrictions, Rockwell engineers leveraged Vuforia Chalk to enable remote experts to see the equipment installation virtually and to provide digital coaching to the on-site engineers. As a result, the customer maintained production levels without any revenue loss.
Turning now to Slide 16. Onshape delivered a very strong quarter with strong bookings growth and a healthy mix of new logo activity and expansions. The bulk of the Onshape business continues to come from SolidWorks replacements. Our Education adoption remains strong, and we're starting to see the first Education enterprise renewals following the first year free Education program that we initiated last year as the pandemic set in. Onshape's ability to deliver seamless, collaborative CAD capabilities is definitely meeting an unmet need in the market.
On Slide 17, Loop Medical is developing a painless blood collection technology needed for routine lab testing while making the collection process safer and more economical. Thanks to the pure SaaS Atlas platform that underlies Onshape, Loop can run their CAD and data management platform on their current Mac environment without having to invest in clunky virtualization technology. And perhaps, more importantly, Loop can offer real-time collaboration capabilities to their distributed global teams and accelerate the design process.
Finally, moving to Arena on Slide 19. It's exciting to see how well the Arena team performed in their first full quarter as part of PTC. ARR growth was in the mid-teens, while bookings were up more than 50%. Arena is seeing strong traction with upselling while also increasing penetration into current customer environments and, at the same time, keeping retention rates high. The integration is going smoothly, and the road map to enable cross-sell programs to expand geographically and to move upmarket is on track.
Arena is engaging some really innovative companies. On Slide 19, you'll see that they've been working with RefleXion who's creating the first biology-guided radiotherapy system. RefleXion needed a solution to scale in parallel with their medical device compliance and commercialization needs. By designating Arena as a system of record, charged with controlling product design and quality and then integrating it with RefleXion's ERP platform, the company was able to create a single source product and quality solution.
The momentum we're seeing in our Growth business, both from an ARR standpoint and from a product innovation perspective, provides PTC with a great portfolio to drive long-term growth.
Turning to Slide 20, you've heard me reference our Atlas platform several times already with respect to Creo, to Vuforia and to Onshape. What you're actually seeing are the first signs of our plan to SaaS-ify PTC's entire portfolio onto the Atlas platform over time. While we'll continue to offer on-premise versions of core products indefinitely, a growing number of our customers want to enjoy the great benefits of SaaS but, at the same time, prefer not to switch off their current enterprise systems. PTC is essentially doing with Creo and Windchill what Microsoft has done with Office 365. When an on-prem workload shifts to SaaS, the ARR of that workload roughly doubles. So this is expected to become a significant source of growth for PTC in the mid- to long term, just as Office 365 has been for Microsoft. The introduction of this new growth driver gives us confidence that we can sustain strong levels of growth in the core business for years to come.
Let me provide some color on geographic performance, which was strong across the globe and, as shown on Slide 21, reflects continued recovery. Americas ARR growth of 21% was driven by Arena, augmented reality and solid Core performance. Europe ARR grew 8%, consistent with prior several quarters, with notable strength in AR and high-teens growth in IoT. APAC delivered a third quarter in a row of mid-teens ARR growth with strong performance across all segments.
With that, now let me turn to Slide 22 and touch on our key alliance partners. The Microsoft alliance delivered year-over-year bookings of 30% driven by demand for AR and our joint deal count increasing 40% year-over-year, both of which are solid indicators that our alliance is further evolving. To support additional growth, we've also added PTC field resources in Asia Pac and Americas. Before we move on from Microsoft, you probably saw the announcement yesterday that Kathleen Mitford is leaving PTC to join Microsoft. This is a great career opportunity for Kathleen, and I'm pleased she'll remain in our ecosystem. Fortunately, we had a successor ready to go, and we promoted Catherine Kinekor, who goes by CK, to be our new Chief Strategy Officer. Congratulations to Kathleen and to CK.
Moving on to Rockwell, we had one of the stronger bookings quarters to date in our alliance and showed significant growth year-over-year. It was a strong quarter for the Americas and APAC. More than 30% of the deals were net new logos to PTC, and top verticals included manufacturing, distribution services and process manufacturing.
Our Ansys alliance continued its momentum in Q2 with double-digit ARR growth. Last week, PTC was named 2020 Ansys Growth Partner of the Year at their Simulation World Conference. As I alluded to earlier, the customer sentiment around Creo Simulation Live and Creo Ansys Simulation has been very positive.
To wrap up and summarize my comments, turning to Slide 23, we're in great shape at the midpoint of fiscal '21 as customers continue to embark on digital transformation initiatives, adopting more of the full PTC product portfolio as they proceed. In addition to being in great shape for FY '21, the strong growth in deferred ARR means we're already laying the foundation for solid growth in FY '22 and beyond.
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Kristian who will take you through a few more details on the financial results and guidance."

Let me start off with a review of our secon",800,"Great. Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. Let me start off with a review of our second quarter results, then review our guidance for fiscal '21.
Turning to Slide 25. Fiscal Q2 ARR of $1.39 billion increased 15% year-over-year, and organic ARR grew 11%. Strong Q2 free cash flow of $116 million was in line with our expectations. Q2 revenue of $462 million increased 22% year-over-year. The revenue performance was driven by strong execution and also reflects the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition as well as a modest contribution from Arena. The strong revenue growth, along with continued financial discipline, resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 83% year-over-year.
Turning to Page 26. I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with cash of $326 million and $1.5 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of 3.1% (sic) [ 3.8% ]. We paid down $80 million on our revolving credit facility during the quarter. Now that our leverage ratio is below 3x, which we told you as our goal, we're evaluating the timing of reinstating our share repurchase program.
Now turning to Slide 27. This slide really highlights a few of the key guidance assumptions. The only real change to our assumptions here is the impact of FX movements. And so with these assumptions as context, we're still expecting fiscal '21 bookings growth in the double digits year-over-year and putting our ARR guidance into perspective.
Then turning to Slide 28. Last quarter, we told you we expected fiscal '21 ARR to be $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion, a growth rate of 16% to 18%. This assumed 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and a 200 basis point tailwind from currency. Our revised guidance range of $1.45 billion to $1.47 billion is 14% to 16%, which assumes 10% to 12% organic growth, same as before; 400 basis points from Arena, same as before; and now no impact from FX.
Regarding ARR linearity in fiscal '21, on an organic constant currency basis, we continue to expect the growth rates to be fairly consistent each quarter throughout fiscal '21. Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year. This is growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. And as we said at the beginning of the year, we expected more than 60% of this free cash flow to come in the first half. As we finish the first half, we've delivered 2/3 of that target.
And just as a reminder, that $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $14 million of acquisition-related fees and additional $7.5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the Arena-related debt, a $14 million unforecasted payment due to a foreign tax dispute and also includes approximately $16 million of restructuring payments. This is offset by incremental cash flow from Arena and a positive impact from FX as well of about $10 million. Free cash flow excludes about $25 million of capital expenditures as well. And as a reminder, collections are stronger in the first half, and this is offset by timing of expenses and head count ramping throughout the year. And as you all know, we have our next bond interest payment due in the fourth quarter. As such, we're expecting 65% to 75% of the remaining free cash flow for our target to come in the third quarter.
Now turning to P&L guidance. We're raising our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. Our original guidance was $1.69 billion to $1.73 billion, a growth rate of 16% to 19%. We're now expecting fiscal '21 revenue of $1.71 billion to $1.74 billion. It's a growth rate of 17% to 19%, which includes about 250 basis points from Arena and no impact from -- or nominal impact, if you will, from FX. We're increasing our operating margin guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. GAAP operating margin increases from 15% to 16% to 15% to 17%, and non-GAAP operating margin increases from 31 -- 30% to 31% to 31% to 32%. Non-GAAP EPS guidance was $3.05 to $3.35. The revised guidance is now $3.18 to $3.39. That's a growth of 24% to 32%.
So wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again in Q2. We delivered double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on our expense structure and continuing to navigate what's still a challenging macro environment. I think the first half positions us well to deliver attractive double-digit top line growth and strong free cash flow for the year.
With that, we'll turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A."

Understanding that, that diagram is a vision and not guidance per se, I'd love to hear how you sort of envisioned PTC's move to SaaS. It looks like you'll have all your products available in a SaaS form -- well, the major products available in a SaaS form factor by fiscal '22. And so is the question -- or rather, the question is, is this something you perhaps drive your customer base to or encourage them to adopt? Or is this something that you're going to let happen naturally? And maybe the follow-on to that for Kristian is, can you just talk about how this plan for SaaS-ifying the business, long term, of course, maybe plays into that fiscal '24 free cash flow target? Sorry, a lot there, but does that make sense?"

So there's a lot you can read into this slide. But if you notice, the other logos, then Onshape and Atlas, a darker greener color and, as they move to the right, become more or less the same color of Atlas",537,"Yes, it does. And it's actually a good question. So there's a lot you can read into this slide. But if you notice, the other logos, then Onshape and Atlas, a darker greener color and, as they move to the right, become more or less the same color of Atlas and -- or I'm sorry, Onshape. And that's because we call this strategy an insidious SaaS-ification strategy, which means it happens step-by-step. And it's already started. Vuforia already has the first offerings on Onshape like Expert Capture, which is one of the biggest ones. We're about to ship the second Vuforia product on Atlas, which will be called Vuforia Instruct coming out later this quarter. We mentioned that Creo is shipping a capability on Atlas now for generative design called Creo GDX. And you'll start to see that coming from Windchill and coming from ThingWorx. So what we're going to do is begin to offer incremental or, in some cases, replacement modules on SaaS. And then over time, the whole suite of each product line will become available on SaaS.
So a customer could begin adopting a part of it, get comfortable with the idea, start to generate some incremental revenue for us. And then in year 2 or 3, or 4 even, flip the switch and go 100% to SaaS. So that's what that diagram intends to show you, is that these products are all climbing onboard. But it's not an all or nothing, it's step-by-step, moving toward that all-state where they're fully based on Atlas, and we have really a dream unified SaaS portfolio. I'm so excited about that because a lot of these products have divergent heritages and they're on different architectures today, integrated together but still on different architectures, and we have like a spring cleaning opportunity here, thanks to the power of Atlas to unify on a single platform. And everybody at PTC is aligned behind this. So we're making great progress.
And if you think in a year or 2, Windchill and Creo will have $1 billion of ARR. So if we can get some -- even modest degree of penetration on a 2-for-1 ARR uplift, it's a lot of growth in those businesses. So it's not going to be a lot here this year. It's not going to be a lot next year. But by the time we get out to '24, '25, it is going to be a lot. I will tell you, though, that any guidance we gave you doesn't really contemplate this. This is kind of a new factor. I mean I'm maybe moving into Kristian's question here, but our original thinking on SaaS-ification would be that it's more all or nothing, and then we decided that this so-called insidious strategy is much more interesting for everybody, customers and PTC. And so we're now factoring this into the next rev, if you will, of our long-range plan. And it's going to be impactful. But again, the real big impact is farther to the right even in years yet to come on this chart. So it's going to be a big deal, but not a big deal in the near term.
Anything you want to add to that?"

And just to be clear, we first released it as part of the desktop application. And for compute horsepower, use the graphics card, which that gets you quite a bit of compute horsepower for certain types of compute-intensive codes like generative design. But what we've done now in the second iteration is put it on Atlas where there's elastic compute. You can have the biggest computer in the world running your generative analyses for you. Let me also say, one of the next steps will be the pipe that generative design capability into Onshape because it's actually running on the same platform as Onshape now. We just got to build it out into the UI and the functionality of Onshape.
So what we'll do with generative design is, for sure, we'll go back to the Creo base, and we will upsell this new module. It's a purchase you add on. And then we'll go into the Onshape base, and we'll do the same thing. I think that generative design is a brand-new idea. It's a transformational idea. But some of these ideas started a little slow and then really take off once people understand what they can do. So I expect we'll see that pattern. And then I do think it will give us more competitive alternatives because -- or opportunities because I think what we have is unique and special. And I think that if somebody is thinking about switching off SolidWorks, if they want to go to a high-end product, they'll be impressed by Creo. If they want to go to a simpler product that's simpler to own and so forth, they'll look at Onshape and say wow. So I think it does give us an opportunity to take some market share.

If somebody's going to put in 5G, they're going to put in an application like ThingWorx at the same time because if you suddenly have all this access to data and mobility and high-speed connectivity, well, what are you going to do with all the data? And that's really where ThingWorx and, ultimately, Vuforia and products like that fit in. So I think 5G is helpful. It's a tailwind. We've been building a decent business without 5G, but 5G is certainly in the category of nice tailwind more so than anything else."

That new agreement gave Rockwell the right to sell more products because sometimes they come across those opportunities. But it wasn't really changing the center of gravity of the partnership. I think if you look at what's driving a little more momentum with Rockwell, it's two things. First of all, Rockwell brought in some new talent. And I'll just say from the sidelines as a partner, these guys are making a difference. They're shaking some things up and really creating some energy. And then the second thing is Rockwell had a good quarter overall, particularly on the orders front. I saw they announced today, and their order book was up double digits and so forth. So I imagine some of those orders ended up flowing our way. So I think it's really more improving economic situation in the world of industrial automation, coupled by new talent. It's not really a mix shift in the product lineup to sell it."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope that you and your families have continued to stay safe throughout the ongoing pandemic.
I'd like to begin by congratulating Tim Fox, our long-time Senior VP of Investor Relations, who's left to pursue an exciting opportunity at ACV Auctions following their recent IPO. I worked closely with Tim for many years and feel he added tremendous value to our Investor Relations program. While we'll certainly miss Tim, we wish him all the best in his new role.
Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased to share that we delivered another strong performance in the second quarter. Bookings grew in the mid-30s as compared to our Q2 period from a year ago when bookings declined 15% as the pandemic set in. Organic bookings grew in the mid-20s. While much of the bookings strength contributed to the second quarter's performance, some of the bookings have start dates in later periods and, therefore, went into backlog or what we will call deferred ARR going forward. I'm pleased to see that with several consecutive strong bookings quarters, deferred ARR has returned to pre-COVID levels as customers continue to make commitments to invest in their digital transformation initiatives over the long term. This deferred ARR gives PTC a foundation for growth going forward.
The economic environment across the globe continues to improve, with PMI numbers returning to or exceeding pre-COVID levels in many regions. This data, coupled with the steady increase of vaccinations and stimulus plans from the current administration, is encouraging. From our perspective, demand we see for our core products and SaaS offerings, combined with a strong pipeline heading into the second half of 2021, supports our outlook for the year.
In the top line category, we had a very solid quarter with ARR growth of 18% or 15% in constant currency to $1.39 billion. Growth was driven by a combination of our growth business, which delivered strong results, by continued momentum in our core business where we again outpaced market growth and by strong performance from Arena Solutions in its first quarter being part of PTC. On an organic and constant currency basis, we had 11% ARR growth in Q2 of '21, in line with our guidance.
If you flip to Slide 5 for a minute, I'd like to remind you that when we use the term ARR, we are referring to the annualized run rate of the book of recurring revenue contracts that are currently active. So ARR really means active ARR, and this important metric is what drives our cash flow. On top of that, we have the deferred ARR I mentioned earlier. Given the strong bookings we've had over the past 3 quarters, our total ARR growth, which includes deferred ARR, is up 12% on a constant currency organic basis in Q2.
As you know, timing of start dates and the nature of ramp deals can impact when a booking moves into active ARR. Therefore, we feel it's important to look at total ARR, again, the sum of active ARR plus deferred ARR. We've been guiding active ARR growth of 10% to 12%. And on top of that, we have been expecting approximately $80 million in deferred ARR as we exit fiscal 2021. We're now projecting more than $90 million in deferred ARR for the full year, which is because bookings in the first half of 2021 have been stronger than what you've seen reported in our reported active ARR results.
Given the uncertainty around start dates and the magnitude of ramp deals, if a higher mix of our bookings were to flow into deferred ARR rather than active ARR in future quarters, it could put some pressure on active ARR even while total ARR would remain constant. And of course, it could go the other way too with a mix that benefits active ARR. We think that by providing more insight into total ARR growth rate, we can help show the true underlying performance of the business. By the way, anytime Kristian or I say ARR without a qualifier, we'll be referring to active ARR by default. That remains the most important metric. We'll be able to -- or we'll be careful to explicitly call out any references to deferred ARR or total ARR.
Coming back to Slide 4 for a moment to close out the top line category. Revenue growth of 28% was driven by strong execution as well as the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition, plus, of course, the Arena contribution. Switching to the bottom line category, we delivered strong free cash flow of $116 million and non-GAAP EPS growth of 83%, reflecting a combination of strong top line results combined with continued operating expense discipline. We did see unfavorable currency movement during the quarter, which impacts our guidance for the full year, but Kristian will share more details on that later in the call.
While the economic environment is improving, the big driver of PTC's growth continues to be our strong alignment with the digital transformation initiatives of our customers and prospects. As you can see on Slide 6, PTC's logo speaks directly to the idea that digital transforms physical, which is our simple way of saying that PTC's portfolio of digital solutions allow industrial companies to improve growth and profitability by making transformative changes to their physical products and to the physical processes of engineering, manufacturing and servicing them. PTC's digital transformation story is deep and wide. And our portfolio is full of innovative digital capabilities that align with high-value customer use cases across our CAD, PLM, IoT and AR segments. Our new SaaS strategy gives us another major vector with which to pursue new dimensions of digital transformation.
With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, Core and Growth segments of our portfolio. Moving to Slide 7, you'll see that ARR in our Focused Solutions Group, or FSG, was essentially flat. But I'm pleased to share that we did see a couple of significant wins in retail and defense, which will create a tailwind for ARR growth going forward. ARR growth for our Core business in constant currency was in the double-digit range, and the 27% organic constant currency year-over-year growth of our Growth business is consistent with our guidance for the year. With every passing quarter, the Growth business is becoming a larger percentage of our ARR. And as we discussed at our Investor Day last December, this can be expected to drive higher growth rates for the company over time. With the inclusion of Arena, our Growth business now has more than $250 million of ARR.
Let's go a click deeper into the main elements of our Core and Growth segments. Turning to Slide 8, our CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the high single digits. The rebound in the demand environment that we started to see in Q4 of 2020 continued this past quarter with strong performance across all our major geos. The response to the enhanced capabilities of Creo 7 and the growing interest in Creo Simulation Live and Creo Ansys Simulation that we're seeing clearly demonstrates that customers appreciate what optimizing design efficiency and accuracy can do for them.
We're not stopping there. Just today, we announced Creo 8, which includes the Creo generative design extension module, called GDX, which is based on our Atlas SaaS platform. GDX on Atlas will deliver the most advanced AI-based generative design capabilities available, benefiting from elastic compute in the cloud with seamless integration to the desktop Creo CAD environment. Creo 8 also expands our model-based design capabilities, extends additive and subtractive manufacturing capabilities and delivers improvements to the Ansys-powered simulation offerings.
The importance of a strong connection between design and simulation is illustrated by Speed Consulting on Slide 9. When a large aerospace customer needed expert design guidance, the real-time design feedback combined with full simulation capabilities enabled the delivery of structural, thermal and vibration analyses in record time. This customer is a long-time Creo customer who immediately recognized the value of the deep integration of CAD and simulation that we're offering in partnership with Ansys.
Moving on to Slide 10 in our PLM business, you'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective in Q2, PLM performance was broad-based with solid growth across all 3 major geographies led by Asia Pac. Thanks to the role it plays in digital transformation initiatives, PLM continues to be a major growth engine. From a vertical perspective, our PLM business was strong across a number of verticals, including medical devices, industrials and FA&D. Plus, we landed a few large wins and competitive displacements during the quarter.
A competitive displacement was at Kimberly Clark, seen here on Slide 11, which is a new logo for PTC who selected Windchill as their digital backbone for product development processes. The ability to tightly integrate Windchill with SAP allowed Kimberly Clark to optimize processes that span multiple systems.
Moving on to our Growth business, I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. IoT delivered a third consecutive quarter of improving year-over-year ARR growth. With strong new logo growth and bookings up nearly 50%, while ARR increased 20% from a year ago, we're seeing a good rebound from the slowdown caused by COVID-related travel restrictions and lockdowns that we saw a year ago. Our pipeline remains strong and churn continues to modestly improve, putting us in a good position as we head into the second half of 2021.
On Slide 13, Strama-MPS, a provider of custom machinery and plant engineering, is just one of many companies that pivoted to making PPE during the pandemic. With the challenge of moving from industrial machinery to delicate medical masks at high volume, ThingWorx was used to rapidly identify and fix anomalies on a lagging production line and helped Strama complete the changeover process within approximately 1 month.
Let me shift to our Augmented Reality business on Slide 14. The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered very strong results in Q2 with ARR up 60% year-over-year driven in particular by Vuforia Studio and Engine. Expansions drove over 50% of the bookings in the quarter. Traction outside the Americas continued to gain momentum with strong growth in both Europe and APAC. I'm also pleased to share that Vuforia Expert Capture has been successfully replatformed onto Atlas and now benefits from the operational and technical scalability of the Atlas multi-tenant SaaS architecture. Customers can now scale deployments across the enterprise, leverage the same collaboration, version control, content management and approval workflows that you'd see in Onshape. This is a functionality that would have taken much longer to deliver without Atlas. We'll be shipping another new Vuforia product called Vuforia Instruct here in Q2. And it, too, will be based on Atlas.
Turning to Slide 15, here's a great proof point regarding the power of Vuforia Chalk that's coming directly from our ecosystem. When a Rockwell customer needed to install new equipment to prevent a costly production shutdown during a time that Rockwell was constrained by travel restrictions, Rockwell engineers leveraged Vuforia Chalk to enable remote experts to see the equipment installation virtually and to provide digital coaching to the on-site engineers. As a result, the customer maintained production levels without any revenue loss.
Turning now to Slide 16. Onshape delivered a very strong quarter with strong bookings growth and a healthy mix of new logo activity and expansions. The bulk of the Onshape business continues to come from SolidWorks replacements. Our Education adoption remains strong, and we're starting to see the first Education enterprise renewals following the first year free Education program that we initiated last year as the pandemic set in. Onshape's ability to deliver seamless, collaborative CAD capabilities is definitely meeting an unmet need in the market.
On Slide 17, Loop Medical is developing a painless blood collection technology needed for routine lab testing while making the collection process safer and more economical. Thanks to the pure SaaS Atlas platform that underlies Onshape, Loop can run their CAD and data management platform on their current Mac environment without having to invest in clunky virtualization technology. And perhaps, more importantly, Loop can offer real-time collaboration capabilities to their distributed global teams and accelerate the design process.
Finally, moving to Arena on Slide 19. It's exciting to see how well the Arena team performed in their first full quarter as part of PTC. ARR growth was in the mid-teens, while bookings were up more than 50%. Arena is seeing strong traction with upselling while also increasing penetration into current customer environments and, at the same time, keeping retention rates high. The integration is going smoothly, and the road map to enable cross-sell programs to expand geographically and to move upmarket is on track.
Arena is engaging some really innovative companies. On Slide 19, you'll see that they've been working with RefleXion who's creating the first biology-guided radiotherapy system. RefleXion needed a solution to scale in parallel with their medical device compliance and commercialization needs. By designating Arena as a system of record, charged with controlling product design and quality and then integrating it with RefleXion's ERP platform, the company was able to create a single source product and quality solution.
The momentum we're seeing in our Growth business, both from an ARR standpoint and from a product innovation perspective, provides PTC with a great portfolio to drive long-term growth.
Turning to Slide 20, you've heard me reference our Atlas platform several times already with respect to Creo, to Vuforia and to Onshape. What you're actually seeing are the first signs of our plan to SaaS-ify PTC's entire portfolio onto the Atlas platform over time. While we'll continue to offer on-premise versions of core products indefinitely, a growing number of our customers want to enjoy the great benefits of SaaS but, at the same time, prefer not to switch off their current enterprise systems. PTC is essentially doing with Creo and Windchill what Microsoft has done with Office 365. When an on-prem workload shifts to SaaS, the ARR of that workload roughly doubles. So this is expected to become a significant source of growth for PTC in the mid- to long term, just as Office 365 has been for Microsoft. The introduction of this new growth driver gives us confidence that we can sustain strong levels of growth in the core business for years to come.
Let me provide some color on geographic performance, which was strong across the globe and, as shown on Slide 21, reflects continued recovery. Americas ARR growth of 21% was driven by Arena, augmented reality and solid Core performance. Europe ARR grew 8%, consistent with prior several quarters, with notable strength in AR and high-teens growth in IoT. APAC delivered a third quarter in a row of mid-teens ARR growth with strong performance across all segments.
With that, now let me turn to Slide 22 and touch on our key alliance partners. The Microsoft alliance delivered year-over-year bookings of 30% driven by demand for AR and our joint deal count increasing 40% year-over-year, both of which are solid indicators that our alliance is further evolving. To support additional growth, we've also added PTC field resources in Asia Pac and Americas. Before we move on from Microsoft, you probably saw the announcement yesterday that Kathleen Mitford is leaving PTC to join Microsoft. This is a great career opportunity for Kathleen, and I'm pleased she'll remain in our ecosystem. Fortunately, we had a successor ready to go, and we promoted Catherine Kinekor, who goes by CK, to be our new Chief Strategy Officer. Congratulations to Kathleen and to CK.
Moving on to Rockwell, we had one of the stronger bookings quarters to date in our alliance and showed significant growth year-over-year. It was a strong quarter for the Americas and APAC. More than 30% of the deals were net new logos to PTC, and top verticals included manufacturing, distribution services and process manufacturing.
Our Ansys alliance continued its momentum in Q2 with double-digit ARR growth. Last week, PTC was named 2020 Ansys Growth Partner of the Year at their Simulation World Conference. As I alluded to earlier, the customer sentiment around Creo Simulation Live and Creo Ansys Simulation has been very positive.
To wrap up and summarize my comments, turning to Slide 23, we're in great shape at the midpoint of fiscal '21 as customers continue to embark on digital transformation initiatives, adopting more of the full PTC product portfolio as they proceed. In addition to being in great shape for FY '21, the strong growth in deferred ARR means we're already laying the foundation for solid growth in FY '22 and beyond.
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Kristian who will take you through a few more details on the financial results and guidance."

Let me start off with a review of our second quarter results, then review our guidance for fiscal '21.
Turning to Slide 25. Fiscal Q2 ARR of $1.39 billion increased 15% year-over-year, and organic ARR grew 11%. Strong Q2 free cash flow of $116 million was in line with our expectations. Q2 revenue of $462 million increased 22% year-over-year. The revenue performance was driven by strong execution and also reflects the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition as well as a modest contribution from Arena. The strong revenue growth, along with continued financial discipline, resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 83% year-over-year.
Turning to Page 26. I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with cash of $326 million and $1.5 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of 3.1% (sic) [ 3.8% ]. We paid down $80 million on our revolving credit facility during the quarter. Now that our leverage ratio is below 3x, which we told you as our goal, we're evaluating the timing of reinstating our share repurchase program.
Now turning to Slide 27. This slide really highlights a few of the key guidance assumptions. The only real change to our assumptions here is the impact of FX movements. And so with these assumptions as context, we're still expecting fiscal '21 bookings growth in the double digits year-over-year and putting our ARR guidance into perspective.
Then turning to Slide 28. Last quarter, we told you we expected fiscal '21 ARR to be $1.47 billion to $1.5 billion, a growth rate of 16% to 18%. This assumed 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and a 200 basis point tailwind from currency. Our revised guidance range of $1.45 billion to $1.47 billion is 14% to 16%, which assumes 10% to 12% organic growth, same as before; 400 basis points from Arena, same as before; and now no impact from FX.
Regarding ARR linearity in fiscal '21, on an organic constant currency basis, we continue to expect the growth rates to be fairly consistent each quarter throughout fiscal '21. Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year. This is growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. And as we said at the beginning of the year, we expected more than 60% of this free cash flow to come in the first half. As we finish the first half, we've delivered 2/3 of that target.
And just as a reminder, that $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $14 million of acquisition-related fees and additional $7.5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the Arena-related debt, a $14 million unforecasted payment due to a foreign tax dispute and also includes approximately $16 million of restructuring payments. This is offset by incremental cash flow from Arena and a positive impact from FX as well of about $10 million. Free cash flow excludes about $25 million of capital expenditures as well. And as a reminder, collections are stronger in the first half, and this is offset by timing of expenses and head count ramping throughout the year. And as you all know, we have our next bond interest payment due in the fourth quarter. As such, we're expecting 65% to 75% of the remaining free cash flow for our target to come in the third quarter.
Now turning to P&L guidance. We're raising our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. Our original guidance was $1.69 billion to $1.73 billion, a growth rate of 16% to 19%. We're now expecting fiscal '21 revenue of $1.71 billion to $1.74 billion. It's a growth rate of 17% to 19%, which includes about 250 basis points from Arena and no impact from -- or nominal impact, if you will, from FX. We're increasing our operating margin guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. GAAP operating margin increases from 15% to 16% to 15% to 17%, and non-GAAP operating margin increases from 31 -- 30% to 31% to 31% to 32%. Non-GAAP EPS guidance was $3.05 to $3.35. The revised guidance is now $3.18 to $3.39. That's a growth of 24% to 32%.
So wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again in Q2. We delivered double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on our expense structure and continuing to navigate what's still a challenging macro environment. I think the first half positions us well to deliver attractive double-digit top line growth and strong free cash flow for the year.
With that, we'll turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A."

Understanding that, that diagram is a vision and not guidance per se, I'd love to hear how you sort of envisioned PTC's move to SaaS. It looks like you'll have all your products available in a SaaS form -- well, the major products available in a SaaS form factor by fiscal '22. And so is the question -- or rather, the question is, is this something you perhaps drive your customer base to or encourage them to adopt? Or is this something that you're going to let happen naturally? And maybe the follow-on to that for Kristian is, can you just talk about how this plan for SaaS-ifying the business, long term, of course, maybe plays into that fiscal '24 free cash flow target? Sorry, a lot there, but does that make sense?"

So there's a lot you can read into this slide. But if you notice, the other logos, then Onshape and Atlas, a darker greener color and, as they move to the right, become more or less the same color of Atlas",537,"Yes, it does. And it's actually a good question. So there's a lot you can read into this slide. But if you notice, the other logos, then Onshape and Atlas, a darker greener color and, as they move to the right, become more or less the same color of Atlas and -- or I'm sorry, Onshape. And that's because we call this strategy an insidious SaaS-ification strategy, which means it happens step-by-step. And it's already started. Vuforia already has the first offerings on Onshape like Expert Capture, which is one of the biggest ones. We're about to ship the second Vuforia product on Atlas, which will be called Vuforia Instruct coming out later this quarter. We mentioned that Creo is shipping a capability on Atlas now for generative design called Creo GDX. And you'll start to see that coming from Windchill and coming from ThingWorx. So what we're going to do is begin to offer incremental or, in some cases, replacement modules on SaaS. And then over time, the whole suite of each product line will become available on SaaS.
So a customer could begin adopting a part of it, get comfortable with the idea, start to generate some incremental revenue for us. And then in year 2 or 3, or 4 even, flip the switch and go 100% to SaaS. So that's what that diagram intends to show you, is that these products are all climbing onboard. But it's not an all or nothing, it's step-by-step, moving toward that all-state where they're fully based on Atlas, and we have really a dream unified SaaS portfolio. I'm so excited about that because a lot of these products have divergent heritages and they're on different architectures today, integrated together but still on different architectures, and we have like a spring cleaning opportunity here, thanks to the power of Atlas to unify on a single platform. And everybody at PTC is aligned behind this. So we're making great progress.
And if you think in a year or 2, Windchill and Creo will have $1 billion of ARR. So if we can get some -- even modest degree of penetration on a 2-for-1 ARR uplift, it's a lot of growth in those businesses. So it's not going to be a lot here this year. It's not going to be a lot next year. But by the time we get out to '24, '25, it is going to be a lot. I will tell you, though, that any guidance we gave you doesn't really contemplate this. This is kind of a new factor. I mean I'm maybe moving into Kristian's question here, but our original thinking on SaaS-ification would be that it's more all or nothing, and then we decided that this so-called insidious strategy is much more interesting for everybody, customers and PTC. And so we're now factoring this into the next rev, if you will, of our long-range plan. And it's going to be impactful. But again, the real big impact is farther to the right even in years yet to come on this chart. So it's going to be a big deal, but not a big deal in the near term.
Anything you want to add to that?"

And just to be clear, we first released it as part of the desktop application. And for compute horsepower, use the graphics card, which that gets you quite a bit of compute horsepower for certain types of compute-intensive codes like generative design. But what we've done now in the second iteration is put it on Atlas where there's elastic compute. You can have the biggest computer in the world running your generative analyses for you. Let me also say, one of the next steps will be the pipe that generative design capability into Onshape because it's actually running on the same platform as Onshape now. We just got to build it out into the UI and the functionality of Onshape.
So what we'll do with generative design is, for sure, we'll go back to the Creo base, and we will upsell this new module. It's a purchase you add on. And then we'll go into the Onshape base, and we'll do the same thing. I think that generative design is a brand-new idea. It's a transformational idea. But some of these ideas started a little slow and then really take off once people understand what they can do. So I expect we'll see that pattern. And then I do think it will give us more competitive alternatives because -- or opportunities because I think what we have is unique and special. And I think that if somebody is thinking about switching off SolidWorks, if they want to go to a high-end product, they'll be impressed by Creo. If they want to go to a simpler product that's simpler to own and so forth, they'll look at Onshape and say wow. So I think it does give us an opportunity to take some market share.

That new agreement gave Rockwell the right to sell more products because sometimes they come across those opportunities. But it wasn't really changing the center of gravity of the partnership. I think if you look at what's driving a little more momentum with Rockwell, it's two things. First of all, Rockwell brought in some new talent. And I'll just say from the sidelines as a partner, these guys are making a difference. They're shaking some things up and really creating some energy. And then the second thing is Rockwell had a good quarter overall, particularly on the orders front. I saw they announced today, and their order book was up double digits and so forth. So I imagine some of those orders ended up flowing our way. So I think it's really more improving economic situation in the world of industrial automation, coupled by new talent. It's not really a mix shift in the product lineup to sell it."

I mean there's a few pockets like medical device and medtech in general, which is a regulated industry around the globe, we're especially good at that. Windchill tends to take a large percentage of those deals in the larger accounts.
And believe it or not, Arena takes a lot of those deals in the smaller accounts, it's kind of more of a mid-market solution. But they, too, in their market space, are particularly good at regulated markets. But I mean we've had good success in aerospace, good success in the automotive business.

I hope you and your families are well during these continued uncertain times. I'm pleased to share that PTC has welcomed many of our vaccinated employees back to our offices where requirements allow, and we look forward to the day when we can do this on a global scale. Meanwhile, we're monitoring the growing concern with the delta variant of the virus and hoping this new development doesn't lead to another round of business lockdowns. Before I dive into the quarter, I want to share some important news on the Investor Relations front. 
Emily has been doing a great job holding down the fort since Tim Fox left. But keeping up with IR demands is a big job, and Emily was happy to hear that reinforcements are on the way. I'm pleased to announce the hiring of Matt Shimao, as our new Senior VP of Investor Relations. Matt came to us as a recommendation from one of our largest investors, and he came out on top following a thorough search process. That comes to us with a finance background and several successful stents on both the corporate side and the sell side of Investor Relations. He is a strategic thinker and we're excited to bring him on board. 
Turning to Slide 4. With 3 quarters behind us, our guidance for FY '21 has us right on track to deliver mid-teens ARR growth and $340 million of free cash flow this year. That will be a fourth consecutive year of double-digit top line ARR growth, and I anticipate we'll be discussing a fifth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth when we guide fiscal '22 in 90 days or so. 
While the stronger PMI numbers that we're seeing can only be helpful, I'm pleased to see that PTC is earning a reputation as a company that can consistently perform at high levels in good times and in bad. In preparing for this call, I thought back to where we were a year ago with shutdown orders in place, empty offices and factories and schools contemplating how to educate from home. 
Against that chaotic backdrop, I'm very pleased with the results that PTC has been able to deliver right through the pandemic. Some years back in the days when our portfolio was narrower and sold in a perpetual model, our business was much more cyclical, but consistent reliable performance is always what we strive for, and we did the difficult work to earn that. The type of steady organic top line growth performance you see from PTC hasn't been the rule in our peer group, especially among our most direct CAD and PLM competitors. I attribute our superior performance to a better business model to tremendous strength across our entire portfolio and to growth drivers that are now more secular than cyclical. In terms of growth drivers, PTC is well positioned for the future. The new logo success of our Onshape and Arena businesses demonstrates the growing demand for SaaS technologies. We see PLM joining IoT and augmented reality as key digital transformation technologies for industrial companies and years of market outgrowth in the CAD business speaks to the innovation we've reignited there. 
Turning now to Slide 5, so we can get into the Q3 details. PTC delivered another strong performance in top line ARR and bottom line free cash flow in the third quarter. Bookings grew in the mid-30s, a strong rebound in comparison to a year ago when bookings declined. In the top line category, we had a very solid quarter with ARR growth of 18% or 15% in constant currency to $1.42 billion. Growth was driven by solid performance in our growth businesses, continued momentum in our core business where we again outpaced market growth and by a solid contribution from Arena solutions. 
On an organic basis, ARR grew 14% or 11% in constant currency in Q3, in line with our guidance. To close out the top line category, revenue growth of 24% as reported, was driven by strong execution, aided by the impact of ASC 606 revenue recognition policies plus, of course, the Arena contribution. Switching to the bottom line category. We delivered strong free cash flow of $85 million and non-GAAP EPS growth of 34% reflecting a combination of strong top line results, combined with continued operating expense discipline even while we also invest for growth. We continue to feel confident about our FY '21 target, up $340 million in free cash flow. 
Moving to Slide 6. Digital transformation remains our main secular driver of growth. You may remember last quarter, I shared our new tagline, digital transforms physical. These 3 words are captured in our logo and embody how PTC thinks about our long-term strategy. PTC is a digital company, but our customers do business in the physical world, making physical products in physical factories and servicing those products at physical customer sites. In my LiveWorx keynote in June and again at our Global Partner Summit in July, I outlined the power of PTC's unique digital transformation story that has 1 foot in the digital world and 1 foot in the physical world. 
We tell our customers that our digital transforms your physical. And by that, we mean we help customers use digital to define, manage, connect and augment physical products. Our portfolio is already transformative. But now with SaaS, PTC is at the very forefront of thinking about how customers will use digital to disrupt physical in terms of taking an entirely different approach across the hardware, software and system administration of their IT systems. SaaS is surely coming to our market as it has so many other B2B software markets and PTC has carved out an enviable leadership position. 
We now have the most to gain from this disruptive force. With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, Core and Growth segments of our portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 7. You'll see that ARR in our Focused Solutions Group showed growth of 4% or 1% in constant currency, which aligns with our growth expectations for this segment. ARR growth for our core business was 14% or 11% in constant currency. Our growth segment saw 60% ARR growth with 23% organic constant currency growth, reflecting on 1 hand, some lingering hangover from COVID, but counterbalanced by solid performances from our Onshape AR and Arena SaaS solutions. 
Let's go a click deeper into the main elements of our large core and growth segments. Turning to Slide 8. Our CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the low double digits reflecting growth across all geos and an improving demand environment. The additional features and functionalities that Creo 7 delivers, including Creo Simulation Live and Creo ANSYS simulation, continue to demonstrate the power and differentiation of Creo. 
In addition, last quarter, we announced Creo 8, which includes the generative design extension module called GDX, which is based on our Atlas SaaS platform. While it's still early days for Creo leveraging Atlas, this module is a great example of how PTC plans to deliver innovative SaaS-based capabilities as we systematically transition our core products to SaaS. 
On Slide 9, a great example of how CAD generative design and real-time simulation make an enormous impact can be found at HPE taxa, a provider of products, engineering solutions and technology projects for the performance automotive and motor sports sectors. The company designs and manufactures car components and complete systems for some of the highest profile, super premium sports car brands around the globe. Inefficiencies in a multistep, multi-software approach to design were causing miscommunication between design and analyst teams, which delayed production times and caused customer satisfaction risks. By adopting fully integrated and streamlined generative simulation and additive technology workflows in Creo, HPE Cox has simplified the design sequencing, reduced overall design and production time and improved design agility and time to market. 
Moving on to Slide 10 in our PLM business. You'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective, in Q3, we saw broad-based strength across all our geos and in our customer base with a solid quarter in the reseller channel. And we saw increased demand for PLM through the Microsoft alliance, another proof point suggesting more customers are understanding the critical role that PLM plays in their digital transformation initiatives. 
Incidentally, during the quarter, we won 3 more Partner of the Year awards from Microsoft. On Slide 11, we profile a win with cell centric, a Daimler Truck and Volvo joint venture which helps hydrogen fuel cells -- or which develops hydrogen fuel cell systems and believes that PTC's PLM solution is best in class. As the deadline of becoming an independent entity loomed on the horizon, cell-centric knew they needed a PLM backbone in place quickly. 
PTC delivered our cloud-based Windchill offering establishing a best-in-class application landscape for PLM in a great competitive displacement. 
Moving on to our growth businesses. I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. IoT delivered high teens year-over-year ARR growth, delivered -- driven by strength in Europe and APAC. Rockwell was the largest reseller of IoT in the quarter. 
On Slide 13, we discussed how Eaton, a multinational power management company saw the need to deploy a digital transformation strategy across their enterprise. Our factory insights as a service IoT application helped to deliver quick wins forming a digital foundation upon which they can easily add more use cases. Eaton was able to realize multiple improvements, including improved OEE, reduction in unscheduled maintenance, reduction in manual efforts and 100% worker compliance with SOPs. 
Let me shift to our augmented reality business on Slide 14. The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered strong results in Q3 with ARR growing across all geos. We saw improving retention and expansion rates and the opportunity to cross-sell into the larger PTC portfolio is gaining momentum. This quarter, we also announced a new AR product, Vuforia Instruct, a unique Atlas-based SaaS solution designed to enable enterprises to leverage 3D CAD data to deliver -- create, deliver and scale interactive AR work instructions to optimize inspection procedures. When you consider that 2/3 of manufacturers are still using paper-based inspection processes, you can appreciate how Instruct delivers considerable value to our customers. Vuforia resonates with the customers we engage through our alliance with Microsoft and one of the awards we won this quarter was Partner of the Year in mixed reality. 
On Slide 15, you'll see an innovative example of the use of augmented reality that comes from Stana, a U.K. company dedicated to the design, production and service of residential and commercial stairlifts. Stairlifts are customized systems configured for and installed in the consumer's home to help those with difficulty navigating stairs. For example, the move from the first floor living room to the second floor bedroom. Stana leveraged Vuforia to create an AR application that allows customers to see how a customized 3D hologram chairlift could fit and work in their homes. With COVID limiting the amount of face-to-face interaction by sales and service teams, Vuforia enabled a customer-centric tool that could be used by sellers during the sales cycle to help potential buyers visualize a residential stairlift in their home. Stana saw increased purchase confidence, improved differentiation against competitors and shorter sales cycles through improved customer communication. 
Turning now to Slide 16. Onshape delivered a very strong quarter with ARR growth of 40% year-over-year. We had a very strong bookings quarter in the Onshape core commercial business with larger deal sizes and stronger renewals, thanks to a maturing product. Onshape continues to gain share in the education market, too, as schools and students turn to SaaS-based solutions for mobility and ease of everything. 
Looking ahead to Q4, we see a strong pipeline for both the commercial and larger account enterprise business. 
Turning to Slide 17. It is fun highlighting customer stories, especially when that customer is solving a problem through innovation. Delta development and R&D companies specializing in military applications for cooling and heating systems in extreme environments, was contracted to design and manufacture an autonomous portable refrigeration unit for deployment by Medix on the battlefield. The company was seeking to reduce its IT overhead, which had been taking up 20% of the engineering team's product design time. By moving from an on-premise CAD system that took a lot of care and feeding to Onshape, the time loss associated with software installations, licensing and regular system upgrades was eliminated. They both reclaimed the 20% of their design capacity and at the same time, enabled real-time collaboration on 3D designs across a distributed team environment. 
Moving to Arena on Slide 18. Arena continues its growth trajectory, delivering ARR growth of over 20%. Arena is seeing strong traction with upselling as they increase penetration into current customer environments and keep retention rates high. By all measures, Arena looks to be a great acquisition. 
I'm also pleased to note that we opened our first European arena sales operation during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 19. NEXTracker, a flex company, is one of the fastest-growing clean tech companies in solar, offering next-generation solar power plants with smart solar trackers and energy storage solutions. The company lacked a single source to track and manage its engineering design and development processes. They needed a better way to manage product information across distributed teams to enable automated approvals and to improve tracking and accountability. With Arena, NEXTracker was able to reduce review and approval times by 60%, eliminate time zone delays with global partners, and accelerate product introductions by 25%. Arena has helped NEXTrackers significantly improve the way they design and get products to market. 
Naturally, I'm pleased that PTC has been able to complement the strong performance of Creo and Windchill in the traditional market with breakout performance from Onshape and Arena in the Bergin SaaS market of tomorrow. The success we're having with Onshape and Arena in the small and mid-market is 100% complementary to Creo and Windchill success in larger companies. Geographic performance was strong on a global basis, and as shown on Slide 20, reflecting the performance trends we've seen year-to-date. Americas ARR growth of 21% was driven by solid core performance and Arena. 
Europe ARR grew 9%, consistent with prior several prior quarters, with strength in CAD, PLM and improving growth in IoT as we work toward full recovery from COVID there. APAC delivered the fourth quarter in a row of mid-teens ARR growth with strong performance in core and growth businesses. 
Summarizing the state of the business on Slide 21, we're pleased with the general good health of PTC across all of its different dimensions and moving parts and we look forward to wrapping up a great year of ARR and free cash flow growth here in FY '21. With that, I'll turn it over to Kristian to take you through more details on the financial results and guidance."

Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and most of the growth rate references will be in constant currency. 
So let me start off with a review of our third quarter results, and then we'll review guidance for fiscal '21. 
Turning to Slide 23. Fiscal Q3 ARR of $1.42 billion increased 15% year-over-year. And on an organic basis, ARR grew 11%. Q3 free cash flow of $85 million was solid and in line with our expectations. Q3 revenue of $436 million increased 24% year-over-year as reported or 19% at constant currency. Revenue performance was driven by strong execution and also reflects the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition as well as a modest contribution from Arena. The strong revenue growth, along with continued financial discipline resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 34% year-over-year. 
Turning to Page 24, I'll begin with the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with cash of $366 million and $1.5 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.1%. We paid down $30 million on our revolving credit facility during the quarter. With our leverage ratio now less than 3x, which we told you was our goal, we expect to be in the market buying back shares in Q4. 
Now turning to guidance. Slide 25 highlights a few of the key guidance assumptions. And while our assumption on the impact of currency on ARR has changed from neutral to an approximately 60 basis point tailwind, the rest of our guidance assumptions remain the same as they have throughout the year. 
So putting our ARR guidance into perspective and turning to Slide 26. Last quarter, we told you that we expected fiscal '21 ARR to be $1.445 billion to $1.470 billion, a growth rate of 14% to 16%. This assumed 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and no FX impact. Our revised guidance range is now $1.453 billion to $1.478 billion, which is still 14% to 16% growth and assumes 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and approximately 60 basis points of currency impact. Regarding ARR linearity in fiscal '21, we've delivered consistent organic constant currency growth around the middle of our guidance range for 3 quarters, and we continue to expect the growth rate to be consistent in Q4 as we close out fiscal '21. 
Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year, growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. Our $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $15 million of acquisition-related fees, an additional $5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the Arena related debt, approximately $18 million of an unforecasted payment due to a foreign tax dispute, and also includes approximately $15 million of restructuring payments. This is offset by incremental cash flow from Arena. -- free cash flow is also net of approximately $25 million of capital expenditures. 
As a reminder, collections are stronger in the first half, offset by timing of expenses and headcount ramping throughout the year. And as you know, our bond interest payment will hit in the fourth quarter. So we've already delivered more than 90% of the free cash flow target for the year, which is in line with our expectations and has been. 
Now turning to the P&L guidance. We are raising revenue guidance and EPS guidance for the year. Our prior guidance for fiscal '21 was $1.710 billion to $1.740 billion, a growth rate of 17% to 19%. We're now expecting fiscal '21 revenue of $1.733 billion to $1.763 billion, a growth rate of 19% to 21%, which includes approximately 200 basis points from Arena and approximately 100 basis points from FX. We're increasing operating margin guidance both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. GAAP operating margin increases from 15% to 17% to 17% to 19% and non-GAAP operating margin increases from 31% to 32% now to 32% to 33%. Non-GAAP EPS guidance previously was $3.18 to $3.39 and our revised guidance is now expected to be $3.35 to $3.60, that's growth of 30% to 40%. 
Turning to Slide 27. Our total ARR growth, which includes deferred ARR, was 12% on an organic basis in Q3. And we expect organic active ARR growth of 10% to 12% and are now expecting approximately $95 million in deferred ARR for the full year, which is up from what we told you last quarter of around $90 million. 
Wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again in Q3. We delivered double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on our expense structure as we continue to navigate what still remains a somewhat unsteady macro environment. Year-to-date, our performance has positioned us well to deliver attractive double-digit top line growth and very strong free cash flow growth for the year. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and we can begin the Q&A."

And in fact, new Plex pretty well because it's run by Bill Brody, who's one of my better friends in life and reported to me for a dozen years or so. So Plex is a great company. We know who they were. We kind of had decided it wasn't quite the right fit for us to acquire. But actually, we're pleased to see Rockwell acquire them. And I think there's actually some opportunity for synergies between what Plex does and what PTC does. You might almost think that Rockwell is adding flex in a way, from my perspective, to the innovation suite we built together. So I don't see any conflict at all. I think Rockwell will be probably sharing some attention cycles with Plex that maybe had been previously committed to PTC. So we'll have to see how that plays out. But in general, Rockwell is an important partner. They won our Partner of the Year award after they acquired Plex. So I think the partnership is important. It's sort of built into the business as we run it today, and I don't see anything dramatic changing there going forward. There was also a question somebody else asked me is Rockwell going to sell their PTC shares. And I would say you probably should ask Rockwell, but certainly, they have not suggested to us they're going to and I think their public announcement said they were going to fund the Plex acquisition with new debt and cash on hand. So I don't think anything really changes in the relationship other than something new came in. And on one hand, it's bring in new capabilities that might help us against competitors collectively. And on the other hand, we'll have to share attention cycles with it. So that would be my thought there, Saket."

So Altium is 1 of 3 main printed circuit board designers software companies. And then, of course, there are other companies that provide integrated circuit software. The integrated circuit software really doesn't have a touch point with our world of CAD and PLM, but the printed circuit board design software does. We have a partnership with Altium. I'd like to find ways to strengthen that partnership. I don't really see us trying to acquire them. For 1 thing, we'd have to top other desk price, which I don't know that we're in the mood to do. And then secondarily, I don't think they want to be acquired. So I feel like there's a good opportunity there for us to do more in the partnership, both on one hand with Onshape and Arena, which are a nice fit in the lower part of the market with Altium, but also with Creo and Windchill, which are also a nice fit. So there are many Creo and Windchill customers, who put circuit boards in their otherwise mechanical products. And the same would be true of Onshape and arena. So there's lots to do there in terms of a partnership. I don't see us trying to acquire them in the near term, given the circumstances, as I know them. We did make a small ECAD acquisition, actually a company called ECAD, MCAD, but it really was a very small deal, and it really was at the interface of ECAD and MCAD. It was not ECAD capabilities, but it was the ability to import in real time synchronize between an MCAD product like Onshape and an ECAD product like Altium. So it's actually going to prove useful in some of the integration activities that we want to do. But anyway, Altium is a good company. I'm perfectly happy if they remain standalone and we, PTC, look forward to strengthening our partnership because there's lots of synergy on both sides of that partnership."

IoT is a much bigger business because we started it sooner and really had a lot of success in it. So in a way, right now, as IoT goes, it has a big influence on the overall performance of the overall growth segment. So most of the slower growth was in IoT. And most of it is still related to hangovers from COVID. So if we kind of look at what's happening on the sales front with IoT, I mean sales have improved year-over-year. They're still not back to where we want them to be. But in general, what we're seeing is a good quantity of deals but smaller deal sizes, which I just attribute really to conservatism around people doing IoT projects in factories and in general as they come back to speed following COVID. You might remember, too, that we mentioned clearly at the beginning of the year that we had a 2-point headwind to growth in our deferred, what we at the time called, backlog, but deferred ARR was a 2-point headwind. Well, a lot of that headwind landed in IoT because that's the place where our sales were softest last year. So some of that is now coming home to roost now. It's not just what did we sell in the quarter, but it's how much backlog did we also take advantage of maturing in the quarter. And that's another pressure that we'll work our way out of as we kind of round trip the COVID impacts of the first -- or the back half of fiscal '20 and the front half of fiscal '21, no, let's say, mostly in fiscal '20 for us."

So first of all, when I use the term enterprise, I was using it as defined by the Onshape team, which generally means an account that would take 15 seats or more. I guess, kind of a small definition of enterprise for the rest of us at PTC, but that's their definition. So I would say the definition of enterprise used by Onshape is a medium-sized company. and the commercial business is small companies. Now I would tell you that it's just a different buying market. And our Creo software and our Windchill software for that matter, does not participate effectively in the market where Onshape and Arena are making hay right now. So it's all complementary. And in fact, honestly, we're borrowing a page from Dessau strategy of 20 years ago when they had SOLIDWORKS in the mid-market and Catia lenovia in the high end of the market. And those 2 products prospered side-by-side for 20-some years until they both grew a bit old and retired, but it's a strategy that works. It's market segmentation. And so I don't think that you're going to see Onshape and Arena put a dent into Creo and Windchill because amongst other things, Creo and Windchill are adopting the SaaS technology called Atlas that makes Onshape so special. So when Onshape's stealing larger accounts, it's basically by and large, doing them from SolidWorks and then cheery picking a few others here and there. But they're starting to get some accounts whose brands you recognize. You might remember, we had Garrett Turbo present at an Investor Day, I believe it was, that's a pretty large company who went from [indiscernible] to Onshape and really went for all the qualities of SaaS that they love and of course, ease of use and other things of Onshape. So I think Onshape is an attractive product. It needs to mature more before it really could be a viable replacement for the high-end products, generally speaking. But I think it will start to pick off a lot of medium-sized accounts and an occasional larger account who maybe is overserved by the more expensive, more complicated technology they're otherwise using."

And we have many other resellers, but they're largely in CAD and PLM. So Rockwell has become an important reseller for sure, of IoT and AR. And I don't see that ending. When I talk to Blake, about how this fits in with his strategy, even post Plex. Blake says, ""Hey, I need an IoT platform, I need an AR platform, I even want to have a CAD and PLM platform available to me when required because his competitor, Siemens has that stuff, not all of IoT and AR, but some IoT and lots of CAD and PLM. So we remain important to Blake, and there's nothing he acquired in the Plex acquisition that supplants any of the capabilities that PTC brought in the FactoryTalk Innovation Suite. So I think it's Blake and Rockwell's strategy, as I understand it, to add Plex to what they're already doing with PTC. And I don't have any issue that whatsoever because I think it's complementary. And like I said, maybe even some upside opportunities. I just noted that we're going to be sharing some mind share with Rockwell, who now has kind of another child in the family, let's say, that's going to need some attention to.

So first of all, we're very pleased with the performance of Arena. It has, in fact, accelerated since we acquired it. Now there are several things we're doing that I feel like aren't fully in the game yet. One of them is a link to Onshape. And in fact, we've built some technical integration between the 2 products, which is easy to do because they're both SaaS based. And that technical integration has generated some rave reviews from customers. And if you think about it, any customer who wants SaaS for PLM, not, they have the religion and they really want SaaS for everything, including CAD and vice versa. So we do think there will be some cross-selling there. That might -- that benefit might accrue more to Onshape in the near term because Arena accounts tend to be a little bigger, like 1- and 2-seat CAD accounts that might not need PLM, but Arena accounts could generate a fair number of CAD seats, 15 or more. So I think there will be some benefit in both directions that might help Onshape first. But then the thing we can really do for Arena is to globalize the sales force because Arena really is a U.S.-based business, a tiny bit of business in Europe and essentially not in Asia other than sometimes an American company might have some users in Asia, but they're not Asian companies. So we, PTC, of course, are much more globally balanced, and we have the capabilities to help them kind of spread their operation around the world pretty quickly. And that's underway, and I mentioned we opened the European sales operation. By the way, Arena and Onshape both have basically inside sales go-to-market operations, they don't have sales reps all over the place. You still need a European operation and the right time zones and all that, but it's a cost-effective, go-to-market model as opposed to kind of the PTC larger accounts where we have outside reps living in all the different countries around the world next to the customers and so forth. So I think we're going to be able to generate some acceleration for Arena to even higher levels next year, but we still need to plan all that out, but we certainly have something to work with."

The good news is we're not trying to invent the platform we're replatforming until that platform has been under development for 7 or 8 years by the Onshape guys, -- That's Atlas. And it's a fantastic platform. I mean, really great. So I feel like time will tell. But in the end, with Onshape, we're going to get a really great SaaS-based CAD system, but we're actually probably going to get something even bigger, which is the singular platform that powers PTC's next generation of software that's going to breathe another decade or so of growth into our Creo and Windchill product lines."

So Jim, I really appreciate the commentary around the secular tailwinds towards digital transformation.

32710,1673907974,2353394,"PTC Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","PTC Inc.","Executives","Yes, Matt. Well, there's an interesting. It's a good question and an interesting survey we do, where we reach out to our Creo and Windchill customers and test their receptivity towards SaaS. And that receptivity expanded dramatically over the last year. I",778,"Yes, Matt. Well, there's an interesting. It's a good question and an interesting survey we do, where we reach out to our Creo and Windchill customers and test their receptivity towards SaaS. And that receptivity expanded dramatically over the last year. I mean, like from a minority to a very strong majority of them are saying, ""I want SaaS."" Now if you think about it, Creo and Windchill are very sticky products. So they're saying like, ""I want SaaS, but I don't want to switch because switching CAD systems, especially when you're a big user of a high-end CAD system and you've got years and years worth of data, I mean, that's a project. But if I could, within Creo go to SaaS, that would be wonderful. If within windshield, I could go to SaaS, that would be wonderful. Now why do they want to go to SaaS? Well, they realize, first of all, a mobile workforce. And everybody has some hybrid working office strategy going forward. The thing is if the software, if you're a CAD software, for example, runs on a big desktop computer in the office, well, then how do you work from home? You set up another big desktop computer at home and then how do you shuffle the files back and forth. I mean it's just hard. It'd be better if all this data was never on the desktop, it was always in the cloud, same with the application. So for example, during during the COVID initial shutdowns, Windchill worked great because Windchill is web-based and the data actually is in some web server somewhere. So you just go home and you jump on whatever computer you have there or even a phone or a tablet and you log in through your web browser and you're doing Windchill stuff. Creo, and everything like Creo in the market, it's a different story. That's a big, what we call, a fat client executable, typically, with a whole bunch of modules installed, typically integrated to other software on that same computer or might be simulation, might be CAM software or whatever. So there's a whole ecosystem of software set up on that computer, how do you recreate that at home? It's hard and there's licensing obstacles and whatnot. So what a lot of people did is they used a virtual desktop infrastructure. That is from a computer at home, you logged into the computer at work, ran the software and the computer at work and pipe the user interface on to the computer at home. If you did that, it really makes for a pretty crappy workday. This is not really the way to do things like CAD. CAD is optimized for graphics performance and so forth. And all that optimization is completely lost when you're piping the display across the Internet. So you really want something that's designed to never put the data and ideally don't put the application on the desktop computer in the first place because if it's not there, that means you can move around. 
So with Windchill, you can move around, but people like to offload more of the cost. These are complex systems. So mobility is 1 thing they want, work from anywhere, anytime, work from the office 3 days of a week, work from home 2 days a week. But the second real thing is cost. They'd like to get rid of the system administrators, they'd like to get rid of the servers, file servers. There's a lot of costs tied up in that stuff. And they're saying, if you guys could just let me pay for the value I get for the software and not for an infrastructure and the care and feeding of it, it would be great. A third thing we talk about is real-time collaboration. Again, CAD systems are kind of based on the premise of checking and checkout. That means I'll take the file, lock it. So you can look at it, but you can't change it until I'd be clear, I'm done changing it. Well, there's a lot of IP in 1 file. And a lot of times, people are saying, ""Well, I get any other kind of software I'm used to, we're working in the same stuff at the same time. How come I can't do that with CAD."" Again, you can with SaaS. So I can go on, there are more qualities that are important to people, but let's just say what Creo and Windchill customers really want is all the benefits of Onshape and Arena without switching from Creo and Windchill. And that's what we're trying to bring to them."

I think what's really coming to light, it always was true, but it's really much more appreciated now is that PLM is the system of record for products. So PLM in an industrial company, it's absolutely as important as your CRM system, which is the system of record for your customers or your HR system for employees or whatever. So when companies think I really want these processes to be digitized and mobile, you become mobile and global and all that, you realize we need a reliable source of product data that everybody in engineering, manufacturing, service, marketing sales, whatever, can transact against. So we need 1 single system, and we all need access to it. And so we're starting to hear that more and more that it's not about making the engineers more efficient, which was kind of the first generation of PLM. This is more about making sure that everybody across the company has access to the right product data because everybody is making decisions about products, pricing them, selling them, supporting them, manufacturing them. And we need to have accurate data and it needs to be 2 clicks away. And that's what PLM is now being recognized as the system of record for products. And industrial companies can't get very far down the journey of digital transformation without saying, ""Hey, shouldn't we have a system of record for our products. I mean, honestly, they're product companies. So I think PLM is really emerging into something different. A quick example would be that Navy contract we won. It's about product support. It's about everybody supporting ships, having access to data about ships in the systems they contain, support data. And so we're using PLM concepts to support the operation of ship, not the engineering and manufacturing, but actually the operation of ships that were engineered manufactured years ago, and it's kind of a good example of digital transformation versus engineering productivity."

The question I have about the Creo and Onshape strategies is that's a fairly good list of executable. So how do you think about the ones that are perhaps most important on those lists for you to achieve or perhaps the most difficult to achieve, which aren't necessarily the same thing? And then secondly, you referred to Microsoft a number of times. They're on the cusp of launching their manufacturing cloud.

So first on the priorities, Jay, I don't have those lists in front of me, and I hate to off the top of my head, I try to represent them all back to everybody, but what you should think of is there are large engineering teams behind these products. In the case of Creo, 400-plus people working on it. In the case of Onshape, not near that many because it's a smaller, tighter product yet younger product. But there's room with the level of resources we have on these products, they have 4 or 5 priorities. That's down from 20 or 30 that they would otherwise do. They're trying to narrow down and focus on the key ones. So I think we have the capacity to execute 4 or 5 initiatives at a time in both of these products. We can't execute 10 or 20, but certainly 4 or 5 big ones, and I guess you were wearing your hat as a partner that day on that conference. But we're just trying to share with our partners where we're going and what we think is important and frankly, where we think the money is. 
So that's what's going on there. With respect to Microsoft and their manufacturing cloud, there's a lot of conversations going on between PTC and Microsoft about how to align PTC with that manufacturing cloud, they want us to, we want to. It's just a question now of figuring out what to do to make that happen. The fact that our former Chief Strategy Officer, Kathleen Mitford, just went over there. It is actually quite helpful because Kathleen and I are quite close, and we've had some conversations since she's gone over there, and she's now able to help me, let's say, coach me and I'm able to coach her and make the companies better aligned together. So there's a lot of good stuff happening with Microsoft, again, 3 Partner of the Year awards. I think the Manufacturing Cloud will be good for us, but there's some work to figure out once they put it out there, how do we tightly align with it."

I hope you and your families are well during these continued uncertain times. I'm pleased to share that PTC has welcomed many of our vaccinated employees back to our offices where requirements allow, and we look forward to the day when we can do this on a global scale. Meanwhile, we're monitoring the growing concern with the delta variant of the virus and hoping this new development doesn't lead to another round of business lockdowns. Before I dive into the quarter, I want to share some important news on the Investor Relations front. 
Emily has been doing a great job holding down the fort since Tim Fox left. But keeping up with IR demands is a big job, and Emily was happy to hear that reinforcements are on the way. I'm pleased to announce the hiring of Matt Shimao, as our new Senior VP of Investor Relations. Matt came to us as a recommendation from one of our largest investors, and he came out on top following a thorough search process. That comes to us with a finance background and several successful stents on both the corporate side and the sell side of Investor Relations. He is a strategic thinker and we're excited to bring him on board. 
Turning to Slide 4. With 3 quarters behind us, our guidance for FY '21 has us right on track to deliver mid-teens ARR growth and $340 million of free cash flow this year. That will be a fourth consecutive year of double-digit top line ARR growth, and I anticipate we'll be discussing a fifth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth when we guide fiscal '22 in 90 days or so. 
While the stronger PMI numbers that we're seeing can only be helpful, I'm pleased to see that PTC is earning a reputation as a company that can consistently perform at high levels in good times and in bad. In preparing for this call, I thought back to where we were a year ago with shutdown orders in place, empty offices and factories and schools contemplating how to educate from home. 
Against that chaotic backdrop, I'm very pleased with the results that PTC has been able to deliver right through the pandemic. Some years back in the days when our portfolio was narrower and sold in a perpetual model, our business was much more cyclical, but consistent reliable performance is always what we strive for, and we did the difficult work to earn that. The type of steady organic top line growth performance you see from PTC hasn't been the rule in our peer group, especially among our most direct CAD and PLM competitors. I attribute our superior performance to a better business model to tremendous strength across our entire portfolio and to growth drivers that are now more secular than cyclical. In terms of growth drivers, PTC is well positioned for the future. The new logo success of our Onshape and Arena businesses demonstrates the growing demand for SaaS technologies. We see PLM joining IoT and augmented reality as key digital transformation technologies for industrial companies and years of market outgrowth in the CAD business speaks to the innovation we've reignited there. 
Turning now to Slide 5, so we can get into the Q3 details. PTC delivered another strong performance in top line ARR and bottom line free cash flow in the third quarter. Bookings grew in the mid-30s, a strong rebound in comparison to a year ago when bookings declined. In the top line category, we had a very solid quarter with ARR growth of 18% or 15% in constant currency to $1.42 billion. Growth was driven by solid performance in our growth businesses, continued momentum in our core business where we again outpaced market growth and by a solid contribution from Arena solutions. 
On an organic basis, ARR grew 14% or 11% in constant currency in Q3, in line with our guidance. To close out the top line category, revenue growth of 24% as reported, was driven by strong execution, aided by the impact of ASC 606 revenue recognition policies plus, of course, the Arena contribution. Switching to the bottom line category. We delivered strong free cash flow of $85 million and non-GAAP EPS growth of 34% reflecting a combination of strong top line results, combined with continued operating expense discipline even while we also invest for growth. We continue to feel confident about our FY '21 target, up $340 million in free cash flow. 
Moving to Slide 6. Digital transformation remains our main secular driver of growth. You may remember last quarter, I shared our new tagline, digital transforms physical. These 3 words are captured in our logo and embody how PTC thinks about our long-term strategy. PTC is a digital company, but our customers do business in the physical world, making physical products in physical factories and servicing those products at physical customer sites. In my LiveWorx keynote in June and again at our Global Partner Summit in July, I outlined the power of PTC's unique digital transformation story that has 1 foot in the digital world and 1 foot in the physical world. 
We tell our customers that our digital transforms your physical. And by that, we mean we help customers use digital to define, manage, connect and augment physical products. Our portfolio is already transformative. But now with SaaS, PTC is at the very forefront of thinking about how customers will use digital to disrupt physical in terms of taking an entirely different approach across the hardware, software and system administration of their IT systems. SaaS is surely coming to our market as it has so many other B2B software markets and PTC has carved out an enviable leadership position. 
We now have the most to gain from this disruptive force. With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, Core and Growth segments of our portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 7. You'll see that ARR in our Focused Solutions Group showed growth of 4% or 1% in constant currency, which aligns with our growth expectations for this segment. ARR growth for our core business was 14% or 11% in constant currency. Our growth segment saw 60% ARR growth with 23% organic constant currency growth, reflecting on 1 hand, some lingering hangover from COVID, but counterbalanced by solid performances from our Onshape AR and Arena SaaS solutions. 
Let's go a click deeper into the main elements of our large core and growth segments. Turning to Slide 8. Our CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the low double digits reflecting growth across all geos and an improving demand environment. The additional features and functionalities that Creo 7 delivers, including Creo Simulation Live and Creo ANSYS simulation, continue to demonstrate the power and differentiation of Creo. 
In addition, last quarter, we announced Creo 8, which includes the generative design extension module called GDX, which is based on our Atlas SaaS platform. While it's still early days for Creo leveraging Atlas, this module is a great example of how PTC plans to deliver innovative SaaS-based capabilities as we systematically transition our core products to SaaS. 
On Slide 9, a great example of how CAD generative design and real-time simulation make an enormous impact can be found at HPE taxa, a provider of products, engineering solutions and technology projects for the performance automotive and motor sports sectors. The company designs and manufactures car components and complete systems for some of the highest profile, super premium sports car brands around the globe. Inefficiencies in a multistep, multi-software approach to design were causing miscommunication between design and analyst teams, which delayed production times and caused customer satisfaction risks. By adopting fully integrated and streamlined generative simulation and additive technology workflows in Creo, HPE Cox has simplified the design sequencing, reduced overall design and production time and improved design agility and time to market. 
Moving on to Slide 10 in our PLM business. You'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective, in Q3, we saw broad-based strength across all our geos and in our customer base with a solid quarter in the reseller channel. And we saw increased demand for PLM through the Microsoft alliance, another proof point suggesting more customers are understanding the critical role that PLM plays in their digital transformation initiatives. 
Incidentally, during the quarter, we won 3 more Partner of the Year awards from Microsoft. On Slide 11, we profile a win with cell centric, a Daimler Truck and Volvo joint venture which helps hydrogen fuel cells -- or which develops hydrogen fuel cell systems and believes that PTC's PLM solution is best in class. As the deadline of becoming an independent entity loomed on the horizon, cell-centric knew they needed a PLM backbone in place quickly. 
PTC delivered our cloud-based Windchill offering establishing a best-in-class application landscape for PLM in a great competitive displacement. 
Moving on to our growth businesses. I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. IoT delivered high teens year-over-year ARR growth, delivered -- driven by strength in Europe and APAC. Rockwell was the largest reseller of IoT in the quarter. 
On Slide 13, we discussed how Eaton, a multinational power management company saw the need to deploy a digital transformation strategy across their enterprise. Our factory insights as a service IoT application helped to deliver quick wins forming a digital foundation upon which they can easily add more use cases. Eaton was able to realize multiple improvements, including improved OEE, reduction in unscheduled maintenance, reduction in manual efforts and 100% worker compliance with SOPs. 
Let me shift to our augmented reality business on Slide 14. The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered strong results in Q3 with ARR growing across all geos. We saw improving retention and expansion rates and the opportunity to cross-sell into the larger PTC portfolio is gaining momentum. This quarter, we also announced a new AR product, Vuforia Instruct, a unique Atlas-based SaaS solution designed to enable enterprises to leverage 3D CAD data to deliver -- create, deliver and scale interactive AR work instructions to optimize inspection procedures. When you consider that 2/3 of manufacturers are still using paper-based inspection processes, you can appreciate how Instruct delivers considerable value to our customers. Vuforia resonates with the customers we engage through our alliance with Microsoft and one of the awards we won this quarter was Partner of the Year in mixed reality. 
On Slide 15, you'll see an innovative example of the use of augmented reality that comes from Stana, a U.K. company dedicated to the design, production and service of residential and commercial stairlifts. Stairlifts are customized systems configured for and installed in the consumer's home to help those with difficulty navigating stairs. For example, the move from the first floor living room to the second floor bedroom. Stana leveraged Vuforia to create an AR application that allows customers to see how a customized 3D hologram chairlift could fit and work in their homes. With COVID limiting the amount of face-to-face interaction by sales and service teams, Vuforia enabled a customer-centric tool that could be used by sellers during the sales cycle to help potential buyers visualize a residential stairlift in their home. Stana saw increased purchase confidence, improved differentiation against competitors and shorter sales cycles through improved customer communication. 
Turning now to Slide 16. Onshape delivered a very strong quarter with ARR growth of 40% year-over-year. We had a very strong bookings quarter in the Onshape core commercial business with larger deal sizes and stronger renewals, thanks to a maturing product. Onshape continues to gain share in the education market, too, as schools and students turn to SaaS-based solutions for mobility and ease of everything. 
Looking ahead to Q4, we see a strong pipeline for both the commercial and larger account enterprise business. 
Turning to Slide 17. It is fun highlighting customer stories, especially when that customer is solving a problem through innovation. Delta development and R&D companies specializing in military applications for cooling and heating systems in extreme environments, was contracted to design and manufacture an autonomous portable refrigeration unit for deployment by Medix on the battlefield. The company was seeking to reduce its IT overhead, which had been taking up 20% of the engineering team's product design time. By moving from an on-premise CAD system that took a lot of care and feeding to Onshape, the time loss associated with software installations, licensing and regular system upgrades was eliminated. They both reclaimed the 20% of their design capacity and at the same time, enabled real-time collaboration on 3D designs across a distributed team environment. 
Moving to Arena on Slide 18. Arena continues its growth trajectory, delivering ARR growth of over 20%. Arena is seeing strong traction with upselling as they increase penetration into current customer environments and keep retention rates high. By all measures, Arena looks to be a great acquisition. 
I'm also pleased to note that we opened our first European arena sales operation during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 19. NEXTracker, a flex company, is one of the fastest-growing clean tech companies in solar, offering next-generation solar power plants with smart solar trackers and energy storage solutions. The company lacked a single source to track and manage its engineering design and development processes. They needed a better way to manage product information across distributed teams to enable automated approvals and to improve tracking and accountability. With Arena, NEXTracker was able to reduce review and approval times by 60%, eliminate time zone delays with global partners, and accelerate product introductions by 25%. Arena has helped NEXTrackers significantly improve the way they design and get products to market. 
Naturally, I'm pleased that PTC has been able to complement the strong performance of Creo and Windchill in the traditional market with breakout performance from Onshape and Arena in the Bergin SaaS market of tomorrow. The success we're having with Onshape and Arena in the small and mid-market is 100% complementary to Creo and Windchill success in larger companies. Geographic performance was strong on a global basis, and as shown on Slide 20, reflecting the performance trends we've seen year-to-date. Americas ARR growth of 21% was driven by solid core performance and Arena. 
Europe ARR grew 9%, consistent with prior several prior quarters, with strength in CAD, PLM and improving growth in IoT as we work toward full recovery from COVID there. APAC delivered the fourth quarter in a row of mid-teens ARR growth with strong performance in core and growth businesses. 
Summarizing the state of the business on Slide 21, we're pleased with the general good health of PTC across all of its different dimensions and moving parts and we look forward to wrapping up a great year of ARR and free cash flow growth here in FY '21. With that, I'll turn it over to Kristian to take you through more details on the financial results and guidance."
32710,1673907974,2353397,"PTC Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","PTC Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and most of the growth rate references will be in constant currency. So let me start off with a review of our thi",834,"Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and most of the growth rate references will be in constant currency. 
So let me start off with a review of our third quarter results, and then we'll review guidance for fiscal '21. 
Turning to Slide 23. Fiscal Q3 ARR of $1.42 billion increased 15% year-over-year. And on an organic basis, ARR grew 11%. Q3 free cash flow of $85 million was solid and in line with our expectations. Q3 revenue of $436 million increased 24% year-over-year as reported or 19% at constant currency. Revenue performance was driven by strong execution and also reflects the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition as well as a modest contribution from Arena. The strong revenue growth, along with continued financial discipline resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 34% year-over-year. 
Turning to Page 24, I'll begin with the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with cash of $366 million and $1.5 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.1%. We paid down $30 million on our revolving credit facility during the quarter. With our leverage ratio now less than 3x, which we told you was our goal, we expect to be in the market buying back shares in Q4. 
Now turning to guidance. Slide 25 highlights a few of the key guidance assumptions. And while our assumption on the impact of currency on ARR has changed from neutral to an approximately 60 basis point tailwind, the rest of our guidance assumptions remain the same as they have throughout the year. 
So putting our ARR guidance into perspective and turning to Slide 26. Last quarter, we told you that we expected fiscal '21 ARR to be $1.445 billion to $1.470 billion, a growth rate of 14% to 16%. This assumed 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and no FX impact. Our revised guidance range is now $1.453 billion to $1.478 billion, which is still 14% to 16% growth and assumes 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and approximately 60 basis points of currency impact. Regarding ARR linearity in fiscal '21, we've delivered consistent organic constant currency growth around the middle of our guidance range for 3 quarters, and we continue to expect the growth rate to be consistent in Q4 as we close out fiscal '21. 
Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year, growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. Our $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $15 million of acquisition-related fees, an additional $5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the Arena related debt, approximately $18 million of an unforecasted payment due to a foreign tax dispute, and also includes approximately $15 million of restructuring payments. This is offset by incremental cash flow from Arena. -- free cash flow is also net of approximately $25 million of capital expenditures. 
As a reminder, collections are stronger in the first half, offset by timing of expenses and headcount ramping throughout the year. And as you know, our bond interest payment will hit in the fourth quarter. So we've already delivered more than 90% of the free cash flow target for the year, which is in line with our expectations and has been. 
Now turning to the P&L guidance. We are raising revenue guidance and EPS guidance for the year. Our prior guidance for fiscal '21 was $1.710 billion to $1.740 billion, a growth rate of 17% to 19%. We're now expecting fiscal '21 revenue of $1.733 billion to $1.763 billion, a growth rate of 19% to 21%, which includes approximately 200 basis points from Arena and approximately 100 basis points from FX. We're increasing operating margin guidance both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. GAAP operating margin increases from 15% to 17% to 17% to 19% and non-GAAP operating margin increases from 31% to 32% now to 32% to 33%. Non-GAAP EPS guidance previously was $3.18 to $3.39 and our revised guidance is now expected to be $3.35 to $3.60, that's growth of 30% to 40%. 
Turning to Slide 27. Our total ARR growth, which includes deferred ARR, was 12% on an organic basis in Q3. And we expect organic active ARR growth of 10% to 12% and are now expecting approximately $95 million in deferred ARR for the full year, which is up from what we told you last quarter of around $90 million. 
Wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again in Q3. We delivered double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on our expense structure as we continue to navigate what still remains a somewhat unsteady macro environment. Year-to-date, our performance has positioned us well to deliver attractive double-digit top line growth and very strong free cash flow growth for the year. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and we can begin the Q&A."

And in fact, new Plex pretty well because it's run by Bill Brody, who's one of my better friends in life and reported to me for a dozen years or so. So Plex is a great company. We know who they were. We kind of had decided it wasn't quite the right fit for us to acquire. But actually, we're pleased to see Rockwell acquire them. And I think there's actually some opportunity for synergies between what Plex does and what PTC does. You might almost think that Rockwell is adding flex in a way, from my perspective, to the innovation suite we built together. So I don't see any conflict at all. I think Rockwell will be probably sharing some attention cycles with Plex that maybe had been previously committed to PTC. So we'll have to see how that plays out. But in general, Rockwell is an important partner. They won our Partner of the Year award after they acquired Plex. So I think the partnership is important. It's sort of built into the business as we run it today, and I don't see anything dramatic changing there going forward. There was also a question somebody else asked me is Rockwell going to sell their PTC shares. And I would say you probably should ask Rockwell, but certainly, they have not suggested to us they're going to and I think their public announcement said they were going to fund the Plex acquisition with new debt and cash on hand. So I don't think anything really changes in the relationship other than something new came in. And on one hand, it's bring in new capabilities that might help us against competitors collectively. And on the other hand, we'll have to share attention cycles with it. So that would be my thought there, Saket."

So Altium is 1 of 3 main printed circuit board designers software companies. And then, of course, there are other companies that provide integrated circuit software. The integrated circuit software really doesn't have a touch point with our world of CAD and PLM, but the printed circuit board design software does. We have a partnership with Altium. I'd like to find ways to strengthen that partnership. I don't really see us trying to acquire them. For 1 thing, we'd have to top other desk price, which I don't know that we're in the mood to do. And then secondarily, I don't think they want to be acquired. So I feel like there's a good opportunity there for us to do more in the partnership, both on one hand with Onshape and Arena, which are a nice fit in the lower part of the market with Altium, but also with Creo and Windchill, which are also a nice fit. So there are many Creo and Windchill customers, who put circuit boards in their otherwise mechanical products. And the same would be true of Onshape and arena. So there's lots to do there in terms of a partnership. I don't see us trying to acquire them in the near term, given the circumstances, as I know them. We did make a small ECAD acquisition, actually a company called ECAD, MCAD, but it really was a very small deal, and it really was at the interface of ECAD and MCAD. It was not ECAD capabilities, but it was the ability to import in real time synchronize between an MCAD product like Onshape and an ECAD product like Altium. So it's actually going to prove useful in some of the integration activities that we want to do. But anyway, Altium is a good company. I'm perfectly happy if they remain standalone and we, PTC, look forward to strengthening our partnership because there's lots of synergy on both sides of that partnership."

But it is a very different way of doing engineering. We always thought of computer-aided design, but actually, the computer wasn't so much aiding the designer. It was just simply documenting the ideas. But this really is computer-aided design, where the software is providing ideas to the engineer as opposed to just capturing the engineers' ideas. That's a different process than people wrap to wrap their head around or follow AI around. But like I said, the results are pretty spectacular sometimes. So there's definitely a lot of interest. I think it will take a while to mainstream. But certainly, it's going to be a wave of growth in mechanical CAD over the next 5 years. I just -- I don't think it will come on super strong in the near term."

IoT is a much bigger business because we started it sooner and really had a lot of success in it. So in a way, right now, as IoT goes, it has a big influence on the overall performance of the overall growth segment. So most of the slower growth was in IoT. And most of it is still related to hangovers from COVID. So if we kind of look at what's happening on the sales front with IoT, I mean sales have improved year-over-year. They're still not back to where we want them to be. But in general, what we're seeing is a good quantity of deals but smaller deal sizes, which I just attribute really to conservatism around people doing IoT projects in factories and in general as they come back to speed following COVID. You might remember, too, that we mentioned clearly at the beginning of the year that we had a 2-point headwind to growth in our deferred, what we at the time called, backlog, but deferred ARR was a 2-point headwind. Well, a lot of that headwind landed in IoT because that's the place where our sales were softest last year. So some of that is now coming home to roost now. It's not just what did we sell in the quarter, but it's how much backlog did we also take advantage of maturing in the quarter. And that's another pressure that we'll work our way out of as we kind of round trip the COVID impacts of the first -- or the back half of fiscal '20 and the front half of fiscal '21, no, let's say, mostly in fiscal '20 for us."

So first of all, when I use the term enterprise, I was using it as defined by the Onshape team, which generally means an account that would take 15 seats or more. I guess, kind of a small definition of enterprise for the rest of us at PTC, but that's their definition. So I would say the definition of enterprise used by Onshape is a medium-sized company. and the commercial business is small companies. Now I would tell you that it's just a different buying market. And our Creo software and our Windchill software for that matter, does not participate effectively in the market where Onshape and Arena are making hay right now. So it's all complementary. And in fact, honestly, we're borrowing a page from Dessau strategy of 20 years ago when they had SOLIDWORKS in the mid-market and Catia lenovia in the high end of the market. And those 2 products prospered side-by-side for 20-some years until they both grew a bit old and retired, but it's a strategy that works. It's market segmentation. And so I don't think that you're going to see Onshape and Arena put a dent into Creo and Windchill because amongst other things, Creo and Windchill are adopting the SaaS technology called Atlas that makes Onshape so special. So when Onshape's stealing larger accounts, it's basically by and large, doing them from SolidWorks and then cheery picking a few others here and there. But they're starting to get some accounts whose brands you recognize. You might remember, we had Garrett Turbo present at an Investor Day, I believe it was, that's a pretty large company who went from [indiscernible] to Onshape and really went for all the qualities of SaaS that they love and of course, ease of use and other things of Onshape. So I think Onshape is an attractive product. It needs to mature more before it really could be a viable replacement for the high-end products, generally speaking. But I think it will start to pick off a lot of medium-sized accounts and an occasional larger account who maybe is overserved by the more expensive, more complicated technology they're otherwise using."

And we have many other resellers, but they're largely in CAD and PLM. So Rockwell has become an important reseller for sure, of IoT and AR. And I don't see that ending. When I talk to Blake, about how this fits in with his strategy, even post Plex. Blake says, ""Hey, I need an IoT platform, I need an AR platform, I even want to have a CAD and PLM platform available to me when required because his competitor, Siemens has that stuff, not all of IoT and AR, but some IoT and lots of CAD and PLM. So we remain important to Blake, and there's nothing he acquired in the Plex acquisition that supplants any of the capabilities that PTC brought in the FactoryTalk Innovation Suite. So I think it's Blake and Rockwell's strategy, as I understand it, to add Plex to what they're already doing with PTC. And I don't have any issue that whatsoever because I think it's complementary. And like I said, maybe even some upside opportunities. I just noted that we're going to be sharing some mind share with Rockwell, who now has kind of another child in the family, let's say, that's going to need some attention to.

So first of all, we're very pleased with the performance of Arena. It has, in fact, accelerated since we acquired it. Now there are several things we're doing that I feel like aren't fully in the game yet. One of them is a link to Onshape. And in fact, we've built some technical integration between the 2 products, which is easy to do because they're both SaaS based. And that technical integration has generated some rave reviews from customers. And if you think about it, any customer who wants SaaS for PLM, not, they have the religion and they really want SaaS for everything, including CAD and vice versa. So we do think there will be some cross-selling there. That might -- that benefit might accrue more to Onshape in the near term because Arena accounts tend to be a little bigger, like 1- and 2-seat CAD accounts that might not need PLM, but Arena accounts could generate a fair number of CAD seats, 15 or more. So I think there will be some benefit in both directions that might help Onshape first. But then the thing we can really do for Arena is to globalize the sales force because Arena really is a U.S.-based business, a tiny bit of business in Europe and essentially not in Asia other than sometimes an American company might have some users in Asia, but they're not Asian companies. So we, PTC, of course, are much more globally balanced, and we have the capabilities to help them kind of spread their operation around the world pretty quickly. And that's underway, and I mentioned we opened the European sales operation. By the way, Arena and Onshape both have basically inside sales go-to-market operations, they don't have sales reps all over the place. You still need a European operation and the right time zones and all that, but it's a cost-effective, go-to-market model as opposed to kind of the PTC larger accounts where we have outside reps living in all the different countries around the world next to the customers and so forth. So I think we're going to be able to generate some acceleration for Arena to even higher levels next year, but we still need to plan all that out, but we certainly have something to work with."

Well, I think if you look at any ARR stream at PTC, its growth rate is a function of bookings churn, but also start dates, backlog, price increases and so forth. And again, where IoT has been held back is kind of in deal sizes on new bookings and in sort of a softer -- what we used to call backlog now called deferred ARR. So when we look though at the pipeline, the forecast, I mean, we feel pretty confident. It looks pretty good. So I think we're going to end the year on a strong note. I certainly expect that based on the forecast in the pipeline. And I think we're in a better position going forward into next year. Bookings certainly are up year-over-year. Like I said, just not back to where we want them to, and that's more deal size than transaction count."

And then in the end, we'll have it all replatform, but if you look at what we did with the generative design extension. That's a good model to explain what we're trying to do. And that is we want to be able to take key subsystems from Creo and Windchill, in particular, and build them on Atlas and deliver better value, more capabilities, better cost profile to customers through SaaS and then take another module. And so a customer might incrementally by more and more SaaS from us over time, and we envision this taking a few years. And then at some point, just flip the switch and say, I'll just take it all to SaaS. So again, don't think of it as a big bang. Think of it as incremental. Yes, it's a big it's a big development effort. The good news is we're not trying to invent the platform we're replatforming until that platform has been under development for 7 or 8 years by the Onshape guys, -- That's Atlas. And it's a fantastic platform. I mean, really great. So I feel like time will tell. But in the end, with Onshape, we're going to get a really great SaaS-based CAD system, but we're actually probably going to get something even bigger, which is the singular platform that powers PTC's next generation of software that's going to breathe another decade or so of growth into our Creo and Windchill product lines."

It's a good question and an interesting survey we do, where we reach out to our Creo and Windchill customers and test their receptivity towards SaaS. And that receptivity expanded dramatically over the last year. I",778,"Yes, Matt. Well, there's an interesting. It's a good question and an interesting survey we do, where we reach out to our Creo and Windchill customers and test their receptivity towards SaaS. And that receptivity expanded dramatically over the last year. I mean, like from a minority to a very strong majority of them are saying, ""I want SaaS."" Now if you think about it, Creo and Windchill are very sticky products. So they're saying like, ""I want SaaS, but I don't want to switch because switching CAD systems, especially when you're a big user of a high-end CAD system and you've got years and years worth of data, I mean, that's a project. But if I could, within Creo go to SaaS, that would be wonderful. If within windshield, I could go to SaaS, that would be wonderful. Now why do they want to go to SaaS? Well, they realize, first of all, a mobile workforce. And everybody has some hybrid working office strategy going forward. The thing is if the software, if you're a CAD software, for example, runs on a big desktop computer in the office, well, then how do you work from home? You set up another big desktop computer at home and then how do you shuffle the files back and forth. I mean it's just hard. It'd be better if all this data was never on the desktop, it was always in the cloud, same with the application. So for example, during during the COVID initial shutdowns, Windchill worked great because Windchill is web-based and the data actually is in some web server somewhere. So you just go home and you jump on whatever computer you have there or even a phone or a tablet and you log in through your web browser and you're doing Windchill stuff. Creo, and everything like Creo in the market, it's a different story. That's a big, what we call, a fat client executable, typically, with a whole bunch of modules installed, typically integrated to other software on that same computer or might be simulation, might be CAM software or whatever. So there's a whole ecosystem of software set up on that computer, how do you recreate that at home? It's hard and there's licensing obstacles and whatnot. So what a lot of people did is they used a virtual desktop infrastructure. That is from a computer at home, you logged into the computer at work, ran the software and the computer at work and pipe the user interface on to the computer at home. If you did that, it really makes for a pretty crappy workday. This is not really the way to do things like CAD. CAD is optimized for graphics performance and so forth. And all that optimization is completely lost when you're piping the display across the Internet. So you really want something that's designed to never put the data and ideally don't put the application on the desktop computer in the first place because if it's not there, that means you can move around. 
So with Windchill, you can move around, but people like to offload more of the cost. These are complex systems. So mobility is 1 thing they want, work from anywhere, anytime, work from the office 3 days of a week, work from home 2 days a week. But the second real thing is cost. They'd like to get rid of the system administrators, they'd like to get rid of the servers, file servers. There's a lot of costs tied up in that stuff. And they're saying, if you guys could just let me pay for the value I get for the software and not for an infrastructure and the care and feeding of it, it would be great. A third thing we talk about is real-time collaboration. Again, CAD systems are kind of based on the premise of checking and checkout. That means I'll take the file, lock it. So you can look at it, but you can't change it until I'd be clear, I'm done changing it. Well, there's a lot of IP in 1 file. And a lot of times, people are saying, ""Well, I get any other kind of software I'm used to, we're working in the same stuff at the same time. How come I can't do that with CAD."" Again, you can with SaaS. So I can go on, there are more qualities that are important to people, but let's just say what Creo and Windchill customers really want is all the benefits of Onshape and Arena without switching from Creo and Windchill. And that's what we're trying to bring to them."

I think what's really coming to light, it always was true, but it's really much more appreciated now is that PLM is the system of record for products. So PLM in an industrial company, it's absolutely as important as your CRM system, which is the system of record for your customers or your HR system for employees or whatever. So when companies think I really want these processes to be digitized and mobile, you become mobile and global and all that, you realize we need a reliable source of product data that everybody in engineering, manufacturing, service, marketing sales, whatever, can transact against. So we need 1 single system, and we all need access to it. And so we're starting to hear that more and more that it's not about making the engineers more efficient, which was kind of the first generation of PLM. This is more about making sure that everybody across the company has access to the right product data because everybody is making decisions about products, pricing them, selling them, supporting them, manufacturing them. And we need to have accurate data and it needs to be 2 clicks away. And that's what PLM is now being recognized as the system of record for products. And industrial companies can't get very far down the journey of digital transformation without saying, ""Hey, shouldn't we have a system of record for our products. I mean, honestly, they're product companies. So I think PLM is really emerging into something different. A quick example would be that Navy contract we won. It's about product support. It's about everybody supporting ships, having access to data about ships in the systems they contain, support data. And so we're using PLM concepts to support the operation of ship, not the engineering and manufacturing, but actually the operation of ships that were engineered manufactured years ago, and it's kind of a good example of digital transformation versus engineering productivity."

The question I have about the Creo and Onshape strategies is that's a fairly good list of executable. So how do you think about the ones that are perhaps most important on those lists for you to achieve or perhaps the most difficult to achieve, which aren't necessarily the same thing? And then secondly, you referred to Microsoft a number of times. They're on the cusp of launching their manufacturing cloud.

So first on the priorities, Jay, I don't have those lists in front of me, and I hate to off the top of my head, I try to represent them all back to everybody, but what you should think of is there are large engineering teams behind these products. In the case of Creo, 400-plus people working on it. In the case of Onshape, not near that many because it's a smaller, tighter product yet younger product. But there's room with the level of resources we have on these products, they have 4 or 5 priorities. That's down from 20 or 30 that they would otherwise do. They're trying to narrow down and focus on the key ones. So I think we have the capacity to execute 4 or 5 initiatives at a time in both of these products. We can't execute 10 or 20, but certainly 4 or 5 big ones, and I guess you were wearing your hat as a partner that day on that conference. But we're just trying to share with our partners where we're going and what we think is important and frankly, where we think the money is. 
So that's what's going on there. With respect to Microsoft and their manufacturing cloud, there's a lot of conversations going on between PTC and Microsoft about how to align PTC with that manufacturing cloud, they want us to, we want to. It's just a question now of figuring out what to do to make that happen. The fact that our former Chief Strategy Officer, Kathleen Mitford, just went over there. It is actually quite helpful because Kathleen and I are quite close, and we've had some conversations since she's gone over there, and she's now able to help me, let's say, coach me and I'm able to coach her and make the companies better aligned together. So there's a lot of good stuff happening with Microsoft, again, 3 Partner of the Year awards. I think the Manufacturing Cloud will be good for us, but there's some work to figure out once they put it out there, how do we tightly align with it."

I hope you and your families are well during these continued uncertain times. I'm pleased to share that PTC has welcomed many of our vaccinated employees back to our offices where requirements allow, and we look forward to the day when we can do this on a global scale. Meanwhile, we're monitoring the growing concern with the delta variant of the virus and hoping this new development doesn't lead to another round of business lockdowns. Before I dive into the quarter, I want to share some important news on the Investor Relations front. 
Emily has been doing a great job holding down the fort since Tim Fox left. But keeping up with IR demands is a big job, and Emily was happy to hear that reinforcements are on the way. I'm pleased to announce the hiring of Matt Shimao, as our new Senior VP of Investor Relations. Matt came to us as a recommendation from one of our largest investors, and he came out on top following a thorough search process. That comes to us with a finance background and several successful stents on both the corporate side and the sell side of Investor Relations. He is a strategic thinker and we're excited to bring him on board. 
Turning to Slide 4. With 3 quarters behind us, our guidance for FY '21 has us right on track to deliver mid-teens ARR growth and $340 million of free cash flow this year. That will be a fourth consecutive year of double-digit top line ARR growth, and I anticipate we'll be discussing a fifth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth when we guide fiscal '22 in 90 days or so. 
While the stronger PMI numbers that we're seeing can only be helpful, I'm pleased to see that PTC is earning a reputation as a company that can consistently perform at high levels in good times and in bad. In preparing for this call, I thought back to where we were a year ago with shutdown orders in place, empty offices and factories and schools contemplating how to educate from home. 
Against that chaotic backdrop, I'm very pleased with the results that PTC has been able to deliver right through the pandemic. Some years back in the days when our portfolio was narrower and sold in a perpetual model, our business was much more cyclical, but consistent reliable performance is always what we strive for, and we did the difficult work to earn that. The type of steady organic top line growth performance you see from PTC hasn't been the rule in our peer group, especially among our most direct CAD and PLM competitors. I attribute our superior performance to a better business model to tremendous strength across our entire portfolio and to growth drivers that are now more secular than cyclical. In terms of growth drivers, PTC is well positioned for the future. The new logo success of our Onshape and Arena businesses demonstrates the growing demand for SaaS technologies. We see PLM joining IoT and augmented reality as key digital transformation technologies for industrial companies and years of market outgrowth in the CAD business speaks to the innovation we've reignited there. 
Turning now to Slide 5, so we can get into the Q3 details. PTC delivered another strong performance in top line ARR and bottom line free cash flow in the third quarter. Bookings grew in the mid-30s, a strong rebound in comparison to a year ago when bookings declined. In the top line category, we had a very solid quarter with ARR growth of 18% or 15% in constant currency to $1.42 billion. Growth was driven by solid performance in our growth businesses, continued momentum in our core business where we again outpaced market growth and by a solid contribution from Arena solutions. 
On an organic basis, ARR grew 14% or 11% in constant currency in Q3, in line with our guidance. To close out the top line category, revenue growth of 24% as reported, was driven by strong execution, aided by the impact of ASC 606 revenue recognition policies plus, of course, the Arena contribution. Switching to the bottom line category. We delivered strong free cash flow of $85 million and non-GAAP EPS growth of 34% reflecting a combination of strong top line results, combined with continued operating expense discipline even while we also invest for growth. We continue to feel confident about our FY '21 target, up $340 million in free cash flow. 
Moving to Slide 6. Digital transformation remains our main secular driver of growth. You may remember last quarter, I shared our new tagline, digital transforms physical. These 3 words are captured in our logo and embody how PTC thinks about our long-term strategy. PTC is a digital company, but our customers do business in the physical world, making physical products in physical factories and servicing those products at physical customer sites. In my LiveWorx keynote in June and again at our Global Partner Summit in July, I outlined the power of PTC's unique digital transformation story that has 1 foot in the digital world and 1 foot in the physical world. 
We tell our customers that our digital transforms your physical. And by that, we mean we help customers use digital to define, manage, connect and augment physical products. Our portfolio is already transformative. But now with SaaS, PTC is at the very forefront of thinking about how customers will use digital to disrupt physical in terms of taking an entirely different approach across the hardware, software and system administration of their IT systems. SaaS is surely coming to our market as it has so many other B2B software markets and PTC has carved out an enviable leadership position. 
We now have the most to gain from this disruptive force. With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, Core and Growth segments of our portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 7. You'll see that ARR in our Focused Solutions Group showed growth of 4% or 1% in constant currency, which aligns with our growth expectations for this segment. ARR growth for our core business was 14% or 11% in constant currency. Our growth segment saw 60% ARR growth with 23% organic constant currency growth, reflecting on 1 hand, some lingering hangover from COVID, but counterbalanced by solid performances from our Onshape AR and Arena SaaS solutions. 
Let's go a click deeper into the main elements of our large core and growth segments. Turning to Slide 8. Our CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the low double digits reflecting growth across all geos and an improving demand environment. The additional features and functionalities that Creo 7 delivers, including Creo Simulation Live and Creo ANSYS simulation, continue to demonstrate the power and differentiation of Creo. 
In addition, last quarter, we announced Creo 8, which includes the generative design extension module called GDX, which is based on our Atlas SaaS platform. While it's still early days for Creo leveraging Atlas, this module is a great example of how PTC plans to deliver innovative SaaS-based capabilities as we systematically transition our core products to SaaS. 
On Slide 9, a great example of how CAD generative design and real-time simulation make an enormous impact can be found at HPE taxa, a provider of products, engineering solutions and technology projects for the performance automotive and motor sports sectors. The company designs and manufactures car components and complete systems for some of the highest profile, super premium sports car brands around the globe. Inefficiencies in a multistep, multi-software approach to design were causing miscommunication between design and analyst teams, which delayed production times and caused customer satisfaction risks. By adopting fully integrated and streamlined generative simulation and additive technology workflows in Creo, HPE Cox has simplified the design sequencing, reduced overall design and production time and improved design agility and time to market. 
Moving on to Slide 10 in our PLM business. You'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective, in Q3, we saw broad-based strength across all our geos and in our customer base with a solid quarter in the reseller channel. And we saw increased demand for PLM through the Microsoft alliance, another proof point suggesting more customers are understanding the critical role that PLM plays in their digital transformation initiatives. 
Incidentally, during the quarter, we won 3 more Partner of the Year awards from Microsoft. On Slide 11, we profile a win with cell centric, a Daimler Truck and Volvo joint venture which helps hydrogen fuel cells -- or which develops hydrogen fuel cell systems and believes that PTC's PLM solution is best in class. As the deadline of becoming an independent entity loomed on the horizon, cell-centric knew they needed a PLM backbone in place quickly. 
PTC delivered our cloud-based Windchill offering establishing a best-in-class application landscape for PLM in a great competitive displacement. 
Moving on to our growth businesses. I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. IoT delivered high teens year-over-year ARR growth, delivered -- driven by strength in Europe and APAC. Rockwell was the largest reseller of IoT in the quarter. 
On Slide 13, we discussed how Eaton, a multinational power management company saw the need to deploy a digital transformation strategy across their enterprise. Our factory insights as a service IoT application helped to deliver quick wins forming a digital foundation upon which they can easily add more use cases. Eaton was able to realize multiple improvements, including improved OEE, reduction in unscheduled maintenance, reduction in manual efforts and 100% worker compliance with SOPs. 
Let me shift to our augmented reality business on Slide 14. The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered strong results in Q3 with ARR growing across all geos. We saw improving retention and expansion rates and the opportunity to cross-sell into the larger PTC portfolio is gaining momentum. This quarter, we also announced a new AR product, Vuforia Instruct, a unique Atlas-based SaaS solution designed to enable enterprises to leverage 3D CAD data to deliver -- create, deliver and scale interactive AR work instructions to optimize inspection procedures. When you consider that 2/3 of manufacturers are still using paper-based inspection processes, you can appreciate how Instruct delivers considerable value to our customers. Vuforia resonates with the customers we engage through our alliance with Microsoft and one of the awards we won this quarter was Partner of the Year in mixed reality. 
On Slide 15, you'll see an innovative example of the use of augmented reality that comes from Stana, a U.K. company dedicated to the design, production and service of residential and commercial stairlifts. Stairlifts are customized systems configured for and installed in the consumer's home to help those with difficulty navigating stairs. For example, the move from the first floor living room to the second floor bedroom. Stana leveraged Vuforia to create an AR application that allows customers to see how a customized 3D hologram chairlift could fit and work in their homes. With COVID limiting the amount of face-to-face interaction by sales and service teams, Vuforia enabled a customer-centric tool that could be used by sellers during the sales cycle to help potential buyers visualize a residential stairlift in their home. Stana saw increased purchase confidence, improved differentiation against competitors and shorter sales cycles through improved customer communication. 
Turning now to Slide 16. Onshape delivered a very strong quarter with ARR growth of 40% year-over-year. We had a very strong bookings quarter in the Onshape core commercial business with larger deal sizes and stronger renewals, thanks to a maturing product. Onshape continues to gain share in the education market, too, as schools and students turn to SaaS-based solutions for mobility and ease of everything. 
Looking ahead to Q4, we see a strong pipeline for both the commercial and larger account enterprise business. 
Turning to Slide 17. It is fun highlighting customer stories, especially when that customer is solving a problem through innovation. Delta development and R&D companies specializing in military applications for cooling and heating systems in extreme environments, was contracted to design and manufacture an autonomous portable refrigeration unit for deployment by Medix on the battlefield. The company was seeking to reduce its IT overhead, which had been taking up 20% of the engineering team's product design time. By moving from an on-premise CAD system that took a lot of care and feeding to Onshape, the time loss associated with software installations, licensing and regular system upgrades was eliminated. They both reclaimed the 20% of their design capacity and at the same time, enabled real-time collaboration on 3D designs across a distributed team environment. 
Moving to Arena on Slide 18. Arena continues its growth trajectory, delivering ARR growth of over 20%. Arena is seeing strong traction with upselling as they increase penetration into current customer environments and keep retention rates high. By all measures, Arena looks to be a great acquisition. 
I'm also pleased to note that we opened our first European arena sales operation during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 19. NEXTracker, a flex company, is one of the fastest-growing clean tech companies in solar, offering next-generation solar power plants with smart solar trackers and energy storage solutions. The company lacked a single source to track and manage its engineering design and development processes. They needed a better way to manage product information across distributed teams to enable automated approvals and to improve tracking and accountability. With Arena, NEXTracker was able to reduce review and approval times by 60%, eliminate time zone delays with global partners, and accelerate product introductions by 25%. Arena has helped NEXTrackers significantly improve the way they design and get products to market. 
Naturally, I'm pleased that PTC has been able to complement the strong performance of Creo and Windchill in the traditional market with breakout performance from Onshape and Arena in the Bergin SaaS market of tomorrow. The success we're having with Onshape and Arena in the small and mid-market is 100% complementary to Creo and Windchill success in larger companies. Geographic performance was strong on a global basis, and as shown on Slide 20, reflecting the performance trends we've seen year-to-date. Americas ARR growth of 21% was driven by solid core performance and Arena. 
Europe ARR grew 9%, consistent with prior several prior quarters, with strength in CAD, PLM and improving growth in IoT as we work toward full recovery from COVID there. APAC delivered the fourth quarter in a row of mid-teens ARR growth with strong performance in core and growth businesses. 
Summarizing the state of the business on Slide 21, we're pleased with the general good health of PTC across all of its different dimensions and moving parts and we look forward to wrapping up a great year of ARR and free cash flow growth here in FY '21. With that, I'll turn it over to Kristian to take you through more details on the financial results and guidance."
32710,1673907974,2353398,"PTC Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","PTC Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and most of the growth rate references will be in constant currency. So let me start off with a review of our thi",834,"Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and most of the growth rate references will be in constant currency. 
So let me start off with a review of our third quarter results, and then we'll review guidance for fiscal '21. 
Turning to Slide 23. Fiscal Q3 ARR of $1.42 billion increased 15% year-over-year. And on an organic basis, ARR grew 11%. Q3 free cash flow of $85 million was solid and in line with our expectations. Q3 revenue of $436 million increased 24% year-over-year as reported or 19% at constant currency. Revenue performance was driven by strong execution and also reflects the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition as well as a modest contribution from Arena. The strong revenue growth, along with continued financial discipline resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 34% year-over-year. 
Turning to Page 24, I'll begin with the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with cash of $366 million and $1.5 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.1%. We paid down $30 million on our revolving credit facility during the quarter. With our leverage ratio now less than 3x, which we told you was our goal, we expect to be in the market buying back shares in Q4. 
Now turning to guidance. Slide 25 highlights a few of the key guidance assumptions. And while our assumption on the impact of currency on ARR has changed from neutral to an approximately 60 basis point tailwind, the rest of our guidance assumptions remain the same as they have throughout the year. 
So putting our ARR guidance into perspective and turning to Slide 26. Last quarter, we told you that we expected fiscal '21 ARR to be $1.445 billion to $1.470 billion, a growth rate of 14% to 16%. This assumed 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and no FX impact. Our revised guidance range is now $1.453 billion to $1.478 billion, which is still 14% to 16% growth and assumes 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and approximately 60 basis points of currency impact. Regarding ARR linearity in fiscal '21, we've delivered consistent organic constant currency growth around the middle of our guidance range for 3 quarters, and we continue to expect the growth rate to be consistent in Q4 as we close out fiscal '21. 
Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year, growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. Our $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $15 million of acquisition-related fees, an additional $5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the Arena related debt, approximately $18 million of an unforecasted payment due to a foreign tax dispute, and also includes approximately $15 million of restructuring payments. This is offset by incremental cash flow from Arena. -- free cash flow is also net of approximately $25 million of capital expenditures. 
As a reminder, collections are stronger in the first half, offset by timing of expenses and headcount ramping throughout the year. And as you know, our bond interest payment will hit in the fourth quarter. So we've already delivered more than 90% of the free cash flow target for the year, which is in line with our expectations and has been. 
Now turning to the P&L guidance. We are raising revenue guidance and EPS guidance for the year. Our prior guidance for fiscal '21 was $1.710 billion to $1.740 billion, a growth rate of 17% to 19%. We're now expecting fiscal '21 revenue of $1.733 billion to $1.763 billion, a growth rate of 19% to 21%, which includes approximately 200 basis points from Arena and approximately 100 basis points from FX. We're increasing operating margin guidance both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. GAAP operating margin increases from 15% to 17% to 17% to 19% and non-GAAP operating margin increases from 31% to 32% now to 32% to 33%. Non-GAAP EPS guidance previously was $3.18 to $3.39 and our revised guidance is now expected to be $3.35 to $3.60, that's growth of 30% to 40%. 
Turning to Slide 27. Our total ARR growth, which includes deferred ARR, was 12% on an organic basis in Q3. And we expect organic active ARR growth of 10% to 12% and are now expecting approximately $95 million in deferred ARR for the full year, which is up from what we told you last quarter of around $90 million. 
Wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again in Q3. We delivered double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on our expense structure as we continue to navigate what still remains a somewhat unsteady macro environment. Year-to-date, our performance has positioned us well to deliver attractive double-digit top line growth and very strong free cash flow growth for the year. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and we can begin the Q&A."

And in fact, new Plex pretty well because it's run by Bill Brody, who's one of my better friends in life and reported to me for a dozen years or so. So Plex is a great company. We know who they were. We kind of had decided it wasn't quite the right fit for us to acquire. But actually, we're pleased to see Rockwell acquire them. And I think there's actually some opportunity for synergies between what Plex does and what PTC does. You might almost think that Rockwell is adding flex in a way, from my perspective, to the innovation suite we built together. So I don't see any conflict at all. I think Rockwell will be probably sharing some attention cycles with Plex that maybe had been previously committed to PTC. So we'll have to see how that plays out. But in general, Rockwell is an important partner. They won our Partner of the Year award after they acquired Plex. So I think the partnership is important. It's sort of built into the business as we run it today, and I don't see anything dramatic changing there going forward. There was also a question somebody else asked me is Rockwell going to sell their PTC shares. And I would say you probably should ask Rockwell, but certainly, they have not suggested to us they're going to and I think their public announcement said they were going to fund the Plex acquisition with new debt and cash on hand. So I don't think anything really changes in the relationship other than something new came in. And on one hand, it's bring in new capabilities that might help us against competitors collectively. And on the other hand, we'll have to share attention cycles with it. So that would be my thought there, Saket."

So Altium is 1 of 3 main printed circuit board designers software companies. And then, of course, there are other companies that provide integrated circuit software. The integrated circuit software really doesn't have a touch point with our world of CAD and PLM, but the printed circuit board design software does. We have a partnership with Altium. I'd like to find ways to strengthen that partnership. I don't really see us trying to acquire them. For 1 thing, we'd have to top other desk price, which I don't know that we're in the mood to do. And then secondarily, I don't think they want to be acquired. So I feel like there's a good opportunity there for us to do more in the partnership, both on one hand with Onshape and Arena, which are a nice fit in the lower part of the market with Altium, but also with Creo and Windchill, which are also a nice fit. So there are many Creo and Windchill customers, who put circuit boards in their otherwise mechanical products. And the same would be true of Onshape and arena. So there's lots to do there in terms of a partnership. I don't see us trying to acquire them in the near term, given the circumstances, as I know them. We did make a small ECAD acquisition, actually a company called ECAD, MCAD, but it really was a very small deal, and it really was at the interface of ECAD and MCAD. It was not ECAD capabilities, but it was the ability to import in real time synchronize between an MCAD product like Onshape and an ECAD product like Altium. So it's actually going to prove useful in some of the integration activities that we want to do. But anyway, Altium is a good company. I'm perfectly happy if they remain standalone and we, PTC, look forward to strengthening our partnership because there's lots of synergy on both sides of that partnership."

It was just simply documenting the ideas. But this really is computer-aided design, where the software is providing ideas to the engineer as opposed to just capturing the engineers' ideas. That's a different process than people wrap to wrap their head around or follow AI around. But like I said, the results are pretty spectacular sometimes. So there's definitely a lot of interest. I think it will take a while to mainstream. But certainly, it's going to be a wave of growth in mechanical CAD over the next 5 years. I just -- I don't think it will come on super strong in the near term."

IoT is a much bigger business because we started it sooner and really had a lot of success in it. So in a way, right now, as IoT goes, it has a big influence on the overall performance of the overall growth segment. So most of the slower growth was in IoT. And most of it is still related to hangovers from COVID. So if we kind of look at what's happening on the sales front with IoT, I mean sales have improved year-over-year. They're still not back to where we want them to be. But in general, what we're seeing is a good quantity of deals but smaller deal sizes, which I just attribute really to conservatism around people doing IoT projects in factories and in general as they come back to speed following COVID. You might remember, too, that we mentioned clearly at the beginning of the year that we had a 2-point headwind to growth in our deferred, what we at the time called, backlog, but deferred ARR was a 2-point headwind. Well, a lot of that headwind landed in IoT because that's the place where our sales were softest last year. So some of that is now coming home to roost now. It's not just what did we sell in the quarter, but it's how much backlog did we also take advantage of maturing in the quarter. And that's another pressure that we'll work our way out of as we kind of round trip the COVID impacts of the first -- or the back half of fiscal '20 and the front half of fiscal '21, no, let's say, mostly in fiscal '20 for us."

So first of all, when I use the term enterprise, I was using it as defined by the Onshape team, which generally means an account that would take 15 seats or more. I guess, kind of a small definition of enterprise for the rest of us at PTC, but that's their definition. So I would say the definition of enterprise used by Onshape is a medium-sized company. and the commercial business is small companies. Now I would tell you that it's just a different buying market. And our Creo software and our Windchill software for that matter, does not participate effectively in the market where Onshape and Arena are making hay right now. So it's all complementary. And in fact, honestly, we're borrowing a page from Dessau strategy of 20 years ago when they had SOLIDWORKS in the mid-market and Catia lenovia in the high end of the market. And those 2 products prospered side-by-side for 20-some years until they both grew a bit old and retired, but it's a strategy that works. It's market segmentation. And so I don't think that you're going to see Onshape and Arena put a dent into Creo and Windchill because amongst other things, Creo and Windchill are adopting the SaaS technology called Atlas that makes Onshape so special. So when Onshape's stealing larger accounts, it's basically by and large, doing them from SolidWorks and then cheery picking a few others here and there. But they're starting to get some accounts whose brands you recognize. You might remember, we had Garrett Turbo present at an Investor Day, I believe it was, that's a pretty large company who went from [indiscernible] to Onshape and really went for all the qualities of SaaS that they love and of course, ease of use and other things of Onshape. So I think Onshape is an attractive product. It needs to mature more before it really could be a viable replacement for the high-end products, generally speaking. But I think it will start to pick off a lot of medium-sized accounts and an occasional larger account who maybe is overserved by the more expensive, more complicated technology they're otherwise using."

And we have many other resellers, but they're largely in CAD and PLM. So Rockwell has become an important reseller for sure, of IoT and AR. And I don't see that ending. When I talk to Blake, about how this fits in with his strategy, even post Plex. Blake says, ""Hey, I need an IoT platform, I need an AR platform, I even want to have a CAD and PLM platform available to me when required because his competitor, Siemens has that stuff, not all of IoT and AR, but some IoT and lots of CAD and PLM. So we remain important to Blake, and there's nothing he acquired in the Plex acquisition that supplants any of the capabilities that PTC brought in the FactoryTalk Innovation Suite. So I think it's Blake and Rockwell's strategy, as I understand it, to add Plex to what they're already doing with PTC. And I don't have any issue that whatsoever because I think it's complementary. And like I said, maybe even some upside opportunities. I just noted that we're going to be sharing some mind share with Rockwell, who now has kind of another child in the family, let's say, that's going to need some attention to.

So first of all, we're very pleased with the performance of Arena. It has, in fact, accelerated since we acquired it. Now there are several things we're doing that I feel like aren't fully in the game yet. One of them is a link to Onshape. And in fact, we've built some technical integration between the 2 products, which is easy to do because they're both SaaS based. And that technical integration has generated some rave reviews from customers. And if you think about it, any customer who wants SaaS for PLM, not, they have the religion and they really want SaaS for everything, including CAD and vice versa. So we do think there will be some cross-selling there. That might -- that benefit might accrue more to Onshape in the near term because Arena accounts tend to be a little bigger, like 1- and 2-seat CAD accounts that might not need PLM, but Arena accounts could generate a fair number of CAD seats, 15 or more. So I think there will be some benefit in both directions that might help Onshape first. But then the thing we can really do for Arena is to globalize the sales force because Arena really is a U.S.-based business, a tiny bit of business in Europe and essentially not in Asia other than sometimes an American company might have some users in Asia, but they're not Asian companies. So we, PTC, of course, are much more globally balanced, and we have the capabilities to help them kind of spread their operation around the world pretty quickly. And that's underway, and I mentioned we opened the European sales operation. By the way, Arena and Onshape both have basically inside sales go-to-market operations, they don't have sales reps all over the place. You still need a European operation and the right time zones and all that, but it's a cost-effective, go-to-market model as opposed to kind of the PTC larger accounts where we have outside reps living in all the different countries around the world next to the customers and so forth. So I think we're going to be able to generate some acceleration for Arena to even higher levels next year, but we still need to plan all that out, but we certainly have something to work with."

And again, where IoT has been held back is kind of in deal sizes on new bookings and in sort of a softer -- what we used to call backlog now called deferred ARR. So when we look though at the pipeline, the forecast, I mean, we feel pretty confident. It looks pretty good. So I think we're going to end the year on a strong note. I certainly expect that based on the forecast in the pipeline. And I think we're in a better position going forward into next year. Bookings certainly are up year-over-year. Like I said, just not back to where we want them to, and that's more deal size than transaction count."

And then in the end, we'll have it all replatform, but if you look at what we did with the generative design extension. That's a good model to explain what we're trying to do. And that is we want to be able to take key subsystems from Creo and Windchill, in particular, and build them on Atlas and deliver better value, more capabilities, better cost profile to customers through SaaS and then take another module. And so a customer might incrementally by more and more SaaS from us over time, and we envision this taking a few years. And then at some point, just flip the switch and say, I'll just take it all to SaaS. So again, don't think of it as a big bang. Think of it as incremental. Yes, it's a big it's a big development effort. The good news is we're not trying to invent the platform we're replatforming until that platform has been under development for 7 or 8 years by the Onshape guys, -- That's Atlas. And it's a fantastic platform. I mean, really great. So I feel like time will tell. But in the end, with Onshape, we're going to get a really great SaaS-based CAD system, but we're actually probably going to get something even bigger, which is the singular platform that powers PTC's next generation of software that's going to breathe another decade or so of growth into our Creo and Windchill product lines."

It's a good question and an interesting survey we do, where we reach out to our Creo and Windchill customers and test their receptivity towards SaaS. And that receptivity expanded dramatically over the last year. I",778,"Yes, Matt. Well, there's an interesting. It's a good question and an interesting survey we do, where we reach out to our Creo and Windchill customers and test their receptivity towards SaaS. And that receptivity expanded dramatically over the last year. I mean, like from a minority to a very strong majority of them are saying, ""I want SaaS."" Now if you think about it, Creo and Windchill are very sticky products. So they're saying like, ""I want SaaS, but I don't want to switch because switching CAD systems, especially when you're a big user of a high-end CAD system and you've got years and years worth of data, I mean, that's a project. But if I could, within Creo go to SaaS, that would be wonderful. If within windshield, I could go to SaaS, that would be wonderful. Now why do they want to go to SaaS? Well, they realize, first of all, a mobile workforce. And everybody has some hybrid working office strategy going forward. The thing is if the software, if you're a CAD software, for example, runs on a big desktop computer in the office, well, then how do you work from home? You set up another big desktop computer at home and then how do you shuffle the files back and forth. I mean it's just hard. It'd be better if all this data was never on the desktop, it was always in the cloud, same with the application. So for example, during during the COVID initial shutdowns, Windchill worked great because Windchill is web-based and the data actually is in some web server somewhere. So you just go home and you jump on whatever computer you have there or even a phone or a tablet and you log in through your web browser and you're doing Windchill stuff. Creo, and everything like Creo in the market, it's a different story. That's a big, what we call, a fat client executable, typically, with a whole bunch of modules installed, typically integrated to other software on that same computer or might be simulation, might be CAM software or whatever. So there's a whole ecosystem of software set up on that computer, how do you recreate that at home? It's hard and there's licensing obstacles and whatnot. So what a lot of people did is they used a virtual desktop infrastructure. That is from a computer at home, you logged into the computer at work, ran the software and the computer at work and pipe the user interface on to the computer at home. If you did that, it really makes for a pretty crappy workday. This is not really the way to do things like CAD. CAD is optimized for graphics performance and so forth. And all that optimization is completely lost when you're piping the display across the Internet. So you really want something that's designed to never put the data and ideally don't put the application on the desktop computer in the first place because if it's not there, that means you can move around. 
So with Windchill, you can move around, but people like to offload more of the cost. These are complex systems. So mobility is 1 thing they want, work from anywhere, anytime, work from the office 3 days of a week, work from home 2 days a week. But the second real thing is cost. They'd like to get rid of the system administrators, they'd like to get rid of the servers, file servers. There's a lot of costs tied up in that stuff. And they're saying, if you guys could just let me pay for the value I get for the software and not for an infrastructure and the care and feeding of it, it would be great. A third thing we talk about is real-time collaboration. Again, CAD systems are kind of based on the premise of checking and checkout. That means I'll take the file, lock it. So you can look at it, but you can't change it until I'd be clear, I'm done changing it. Well, there's a lot of IP in 1 file. And a lot of times, people are saying, ""Well, I get any other kind of software I'm used to, we're working in the same stuff at the same time. How come I can't do that with CAD."" Again, you can with SaaS. So I can go on, there are more qualities that are important to people, but let's just say what Creo and Windchill customers really want is all the benefits of Onshape and Arena without switching from Creo and Windchill. And that's what we're trying to bring to them."

I think what's really coming to light, it always was true, but it's really much more appreciated now is that PLM is the system of record for products. So PLM in an industrial company, it's absolutely as important as your CRM system, which is the system of record for your customers or your HR system for employees or whatever. So when companies think I really want these processes to be digitized and mobile, you become mobile and global and all that, you realize we need a reliable source of product data that everybody in engineering, manufacturing, service, marketing sales, whatever, can transact against. So we need 1 single system, and we all need access to it. And so we're starting to hear that more and more that it's not about making the engineers more efficient, which was kind of the first generation of PLM. This is more about making sure that everybody across the company has access to the right product data because everybody is making decisions about products, pricing them, selling them, supporting them, manufacturing them. And we need to have accurate data and it needs to be 2 clicks away. And that's what PLM is now being recognized as the system of record for products. And industrial companies can't get very far down the journey of digital transformation without saying, ""Hey, shouldn't we have a system of record for our products. I mean, honestly, they're product companies. So I think PLM is really emerging into something different. A quick example would be that Navy contract we won. It's about product support. It's about everybody supporting ships, having access to data about ships in the systems they contain, support data. And so we're using PLM concepts to support the operation of ship, not the engineering and manufacturing, but actually the operation of ships that were engineered manufactured years ago, and it's kind of a good example of digital transformation versus engineering productivity."

The question I have about the Creo and Onshape strategies is that's a fairly good list of executable. So how do you think about the ones that are perhaps most important on those lists for you to achieve or perhaps the most difficult to achieve, which aren't necessarily the same thing? And then secondly, you referred to Microsoft a number of times. They're on the cusp of launching their manufacturing cloud.

So first on the priorities, Jay, I don't have those lists in front of me, and I hate to off the top of my head, I try to represent them all back to everybody, but what you should think of is there are large engineering teams behind these products. In the case of Creo, 400-plus people working on it. In the case of Onshape, not near that many because it's a smaller, tighter product yet younger product. But there's room with the level of resources we have on these products, they have 4 or 5 priorities. That's down from 20 or 30 that they would otherwise do. They're trying to narrow down and focus on the key ones. So I think we have the capacity to execute 4 or 5 initiatives at a time in both of these products. We can't execute 10 or 20, but certainly 4 or 5 big ones, and I guess you were wearing your hat as a partner that day on that conference. But we're just trying to share with our partners where we're going and what we think is important and frankly, where we think the money is. 
So that's what's going on there. With respect to Microsoft and their manufacturing cloud, there's a lot of conversations going on between PTC and Microsoft about how to align PTC with that manufacturing cloud, they want us to, we want to. It's just a question now of figuring out what to do to make that happen. The fact that our former Chief Strategy Officer, Kathleen Mitford, just went over there. It is actually quite helpful because Kathleen and I are quite close, and we've had some conversations since she's gone over there, and she's now able to help me, let's say, coach me and I'm able to coach her and make the companies better aligned together. So there's a lot of good stuff happening with Microsoft, again, 3 Partner of the Year awards. I think the Manufacturing Cloud will be good for us, but there's some work to figure out once they put it out there, how do we tightly align with it."

I hope you and your families are well during these continued uncertain times. I'm pleased to share that PTC has welcomed many of our vaccinated employees back to our offices where requirements allow, and we look forward to the day when we can do this on a global scale. Meanwhile, we're monitoring the growing concern with the delta variant of the virus and hoping this new development doesn't lead to another round of business lockdowns. Before I dive into the quarter, I want to share some important news on the Investor Relations front.
Emily has been doing a great job holding down the fort since Tim Fox left. But keeping up with IR demands is a big job, and Emily was happy to hear that reinforcements are on the way. I'm pleased to announce the hiring of Matt Shimao as our new Senior VP of Investor Relations. Matt came to us as a recommendation from one of our largest investors, and he came out on top following a thorough search process. 
Matt comes to us with a finance background and several successful stents on both the corporate side and the sell side of Investor Relations. He is a strategic thinker and we're excited to bring him on board.
Turning to Slide 4. With 3 quarters behind us, our guidance for FY '21 has us right on track to deliver mid-teens ARR growth and $340 million of free cash flow this year. That will be a fourth consecutive year of double-digit top line ARR growth, and I anticipate we'll be discussing a fifth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth when we guide fiscal '22 in 90 days or so.
While the stronger PMI numbers that we're seeing can only be helpful, I'm pleased to see that PTC is earning a reputation as a company that can consistently perform at high levels in good times and in bad. In preparing for this call, I thought back to where we were a year ago with shutdown orders in place, empty offices and factories and schools contemplating how to educate from home.
Against that chaotic backdrop, I'm very pleased with the results that PTC has been able to deliver right through the pandemic. Some years back in the days when our portfolio was narrower and sold in a perpetual model, our business was much more cyclical, but consistent, reliable performance is always what we strive for, and we did the difficult work to earn that. The type of steady organic top line growth performance you see from PTC hasn't been the rule in our peer group, especially among our most direct CAD and PLM competitors. 
I attribute our superior performance to a better business model, to tremendous strength across our entire portfolio and to growth drivers that are now more secular than cyclical. In terms of growth drivers, PTC is well positioned for the future. The new logo success of our Onshape and Arena businesses demonstrates the growing demand for SaaS technologies. We see PLM joining IoT and augmented reality as key digital transformation technologies for industrial companies and years of market outgrowth in the CAD business speaks to the innovation we've reignited there.
Turning now to Slide 5, so we can get into the Q3 details. PTC delivered another strong performance in top line ARR and bottom line free cash flow in the third quarter. Bookings grew in the mid-30s, a strong rebound in comparison to a year ago when bookings declined. In the top line category, we had a very solid quarter with ARR growth of 18% or 15% in constant currency to $1.42 billion. Growth was driven by solid performance in our growth businesses, continued momentum in our core business where we again outpaced market growth and by a solid contribution from Arena solutions.
On an organic basis, ARR grew 14% or 11% in constant currency in Q3, in line with our guidance. 
To close out the top line category, revenue growth of 24% as reported was driven by strong execution, aided by the impact of ASC 606 revenue recognition policies plus, of course, the Arena contribution. 
Switching to the bottom line category. We delivered strong free cash flow of $85 million and non-GAAP EPS growth of 34%, reflecting a combination of strong top line results, combined with continued operating expense discipline even while we also invest for growth.
We continue to feel confident about our FY '21 target, up $340 million in free cash flow.
Moving to Slide 6. Digital transformation remains our main secular driver of growth. You may remember last quarter, I shared our new tagline, digital transforms physical. These 3 words are captured in our logo and embody how PTC thinks about our long-term strategy. PTC is a digital company, but our customers do business in the physical world, making physical products in physical factories and servicing those products at physical customer sites. In my LiveWorx keynote in June and again at our Global Partner Summit in July, I outlined the power of PTC's unique digital transformation story that has 1 foot in the digital world and 1 foot in the physical world. We tell our customers that our digital transforms your physical. And by that, we mean we help customers use digital to define, manage, connect and augment physical products. Our portfolio is already transformative. But now with SaaS, PTC is at the very forefront of thinking about how customers will use digital to disrupt physical in terms of taking an entirely different approach across the hardware, software and system administration of their IT systems. SaaS is surely coming to our market as it has so many other B2B software markets, and PTC has carved out an enviable leadership position. We now have the most to gain from this disruptive force.
With that as context, let's take a look at the respective contributions of the FSG, Core and Growth segments of our portfolio.
Moving to Slide 7. You'll see that ARR in our Focused Solutions Group showed growth of 4% or 1% constant currency, which aligns with our growth expectations for this segment. ARR growth for our core business was 14% or 11% in constant currency. Our growth segment saw 60% ARR growth with 23% organic constant currency growth, reflecting on one hand, some lingering hangover from COVID, but counterbalanced by solid performances from our Onshape AR and Arena SaaS solutions. 
Let's go a click deeper into the main elements of our large core and growth segments. Turning to Slide 8. Our CAD team delivered another impressive quarter with ARR growth in the low double digits, reflecting growth across all geos and an improving demand environment. The additional features and functionalities that Creo 7 delivers, including Creo Simulation Live and Creo ANSYS simulation, continue to demonstrate the power and differentiation of Creo.
In addition, last quarter, we announced Creo 8, which includes the generative design extension module called GDX, which is based on our Atlas SaaS platform. While it's still early days for Creo leveraging Atlas, this module is a great example of how PTC plans to deliver innovative SaaS-based capabilities as we systematically transition our core products to SaaS.
On Slide 9, a great example of how CAD generative design and real-time simulation make an enormous impact can be found at HPE COXA, a provider of products, engineering solutions and technology projects for the performance automotive and motor sports sectors. The company designs and manufactures car components and complete systems for some of the highest profile, super premium sports car brands around the globe. Inefficiencies in a multistep, multi-software approach to design were causing miscommunication between design and analyst teams, which delayed production times and caused customer satisfaction risks. By adopting fully integrated and streamlined generative simulation and additive technology workflows in Creo, HPE COXA has simplified the design sequencing, reduced overall design and production time and improved design agility and time to market.
Moving on to Slide 10 in our PLM business. You'll see that PLM continued to deliver very strong performance with another mid-teens ARR growth quarter. From a geographic perspective, in Q3, we saw broad-based strength across all our geos and in our customer base with a solid quarter in the reseller channel. And we saw increased demand for PLM through the Microsoft alliance, another proof point suggesting more customers are understanding the critical role that PLM plays in their digital transformation initiatives.
Incidentally, during the quarter, we won 3 more Partner of the Year awards from Microsoft. 
On Slide 11, we profile a win with cell centric, a Daimler Truck and Volvo joint venture, which helps hydrogen fuel cells -- or which develops hydrogen fuel cell systems and believes that PTC's PLM solution is best in class. As the deadline of becoming an independent entity loomed on the horizon, cell-centric knew they needed a PLM backbone in place quickly. 
PTC delivered our cloud-based Windchill offering establishing a best-in-class application landscape for PLM in a great competitive displacement.
Moving on to our growth businesses. I'll begin with IoT on Slide 12. IoT delivered high teens year-over-year ARR growth, delivered -- driven by strength in Europe and APAC. Rockwell was the largest reseller of IoT in the quarter.
On Slide 13, we discussed how Eaton, a multinational power management company saw the need to deploy a digital transformation strategy across their enterprise. Our factory insights as a service IoT application helped to deliver quick wins, forming a digital foundation upon which they can easily add more use cases. Eaton was able to realize multiple improvements, including improved OEE, reduction in unscheduled maintenance, reduction in manual efforts and 100% worker compliance with SOPs.
Let me shift to our augmented reality business on Slide 14. The Vuforia augmented reality team again delivered strong results in Q3 with ARR growing across all geos. We saw improving retention and expansion rates and the opportunity to cross-sell into the larger PTC portfolio is gaining momentum. This quarter, we also announced a new AR product, Vuforia Instruct, a unique Atlas-based SaaS solution designed to enable enterprises to leverage 3D CAD data to deliver -- create, deliver and scale interactive AR work instructions to optimize inspection procedures. When you consider that 2/3 of manufacturers are still using paper-based inspection processes, you can appreciate how Instruct delivers considerable value to our customers. Vuforia resonates with the customers we engage through our alliance with Microsoft and one of the awards we won this quarter was Partner of the Year in mixed reality.
On Slide 15, you'll see an innovative example of the use of augmented reality that comes from Stana, a U.K. company dedicated to the design, production and service of residential and commercial stairlifts. Stairlifts are customized systems configured for and installed in the consumer's home to help those with difficulty navigating stairs. For example, the move from the first floor living room to the second floor bedroom. Stana leveraged Vuforia to create an AR application that allows customers to see how a customized 3D hologram chairlift could fit and work in their homes. With COVID limiting the amount of face-to-face interaction by sales and service teams, Vuforia enabled a customer-centric tool that could be used by sellers during the sales cycle to help potential buyers visualize a residential stairlift in their home. Stana saw increased purchase confidence, improved differentiation against competitors and shorter sales cycles through improved customer communication.
Turning now to Slide 16. Onshape delivered a very strong quarter with ARR growth of 40% year-over-year. We had a very strong bookings quarter in the Onshape core commercial business with larger deal sizes and stronger renewals, thanks to a maturing product. Onshape continues to gain share in the education market, too, as schools and students turn to SaaS-based solutions for mobility and ease of everything.
Looking ahead to Q4, we see a strong pipeline for both the commercial and larger account enterprise business.
Turning to Slide 17. It Is fun highlighting customer stories, especially when that customer is solving a problem through innovation. Delta development and R&D companies specializing in military applications for cooling and heating systems in extreme environments was contracted to design and manufacture an autonomous portable refrigeration unit for deployment by Medix on the battlefield. The company was seeking to reduce its IT overhead, which had been taking up 20% of the engineering team's product design time. By moving from an on-premise CAD system that took a lot of care and feeding to Onshape, the time loss associated with software installations, licensing and regular system upgrades was eliminated. They both reclaimed the 20% of their design capacity and at the same time, enabled real time collaboration on 3D designs across a distributed team environment.
Moving to Arena on Slide 18. Arena continues its growth trajectory, delivering ARR growth of over 20%. Arena is seeing strong traction with upselling as they increase penetration into current customer environments and keep retention rates high. By all measures, Arena looks to be a great acquisition.
I'm also pleased to note that we opened our first European Arena sales operation during the quarter.
Turning to Slide 19. NEXTracker, a flex company is one of the fastest-growing clean tech companies in solar, offering next-generation solar power plants with smart solar trackers and energy storage solutions. The company lacked a single source to track and manage its engineering design and development processes. They needed a better way to manage product information across distributed teams, to enable automated approvals and to improve tracking and accountability. With Arena, NEXTracker was able to reduce review and approval times by nearly 60%, eliminate time zone delays with global partners and accelerate product introductions by 25%. Arena has helped NEXTracker significantly improve the way they design and get products to market.
Naturally, I'm pleased that PTC has been able to complement the strong performance of Creo and Windchill in the traditional market with breakout performance from Onshape and Arena in the burgeoning SaaS market of tomorrow. The success we're having with Onshape and Arena in the small and mid-market is 100% complementary to Creo and Windchill success in larger companies. Geographic performance was strong on a global basis, and as shown on Slide 20, reflecting the performance trends we've seen year-to-date. Americas ARR growth of 21% was driven by solid core performance and Arena.
Europe ARR grew 9%, consistent with prior several -- several prior quarters, with strength in CAD, PLM and improving growth in IoT as we work toward full recovery from COVID there. APAC delivered the fourth quarter in a row of mid-teens ARR growth with strong performance in core and growth businesses.
Summarizing the state of the business on Slide 21, we're pleased with the general good health of PTC across all of its different dimensions and moving parts, and we look forward to wrapping up a great year of ARR and free cash flow growth here in FY '21.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kristian to take you through more details on the financial results and guidance."
32710,1673907974,2353471,"PTC Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","PTC Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and most of the growth rate references will be in constant currency. So let me start off with a review of our third",833,"Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and most of the growth rate references will be in constant currency. So let me start off with a review of our third quarter results, and then we'll review guidance for fiscal '21.
Turning to Slide 23. Fiscal Q3 ARR of $1.42 billion increased 15% year-over-year. And on an organic basis, ARR grew 11%. Q3 free cash flow of $85 million was solid and in line with our expectations. Q3 revenue of $436 million increased 24% year-over-year as reported or 19% in constant currency. Revenue performance was driven by strong execution and also reflects the impact of ASC 606 on revenue recognition as well as a modest contribution from Arena. The strong revenue growth, along with continued financial discipline resulted in non-GAAP EPS growth of 34% year-over-year.
Turning to Page 24, I'll begin with the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with cash of $366 million and $1.5 billion of gross debt with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.1%. We paid down $30 million on our revolving credit facility during the quarter. With our leverage ratio now less than 3x, which we told you was our goal, we expect to be in the market buying back shares in Q4.
Now turning to guidance. Slide 25 highlights a few of the key guidance assumptions. And while our assumption on the impact of currency on ARR has changed from neutral to an approximately 60 basis point tailwind, the rest of our guidance assumptions remain the same as they have throughout the year.
So putting our ARR guidance into perspective and turning to Slide 26. Last quarter, we told you that we expected fiscal '21 ARR to be $1.445 billion to $1.470 billion, a growth rate of 14% to 16%. This assumed 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and no FX impact. 
Our revised guidance range is now $1.453 billion to $1.478 billion, which is still 14% to 16% growth and assumes 10% to 12% organic growth, 400 basis points from Arena and approximately 60 basis points of currency impact. Regarding ARR linearity in fiscal '21, we've delivered consistent organic constant currency growth around the middle of our guidance range for 3 quarters, and we continue to expect the growth rate to be consistent in Q4 as we close out fiscal '21.
Free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $340 million for the full year, growth of approximately 60% year-over-year. Our $340 million free cash flow target also includes approximately $15 million of acquisition-related fees, an additional $5 million of incremental interest we expect to pay this year due to the Arena-related debt, approximately $18 million of an unforecasted payment due to a foreign tax dispute and also includes approximately $15 million of restructuring payments. This is offset by incremental cash flow from Arena. And free cash flow is also net of approximately $25 million of capital expenditures.
As a reminder, collections are stronger in the first half, offset by timing of expenses and headcount ramping throughout the year. And as you know, our bond interest payment will hit in the fourth quarter. So we've already delivered more than 90% of the free cash flow target for the year, which is in line with our expectations and has been.
Now turning to the P&L guidance. We are raising revenue guidance and EPS guidance for the year. Our prior guidance for fiscal '21 was $1.710 billion to $1.740 billion, a growth rate of 17% to 19%. We're now expecting fiscal '21 revenue of $1.733 billion to $1.763 billion, a growth rate of 19% to 21%, which includes approximately 200 basis points from Arena and approximately 100 basis points from FX.
We're increasing operating margin guidance both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. GAAP operating margin increases from 15% to 17% to 17% to 19% and non-GAAP operating margin increases from 31% to 32%, now to 32% to 33%. Non-GAAP EPS guidance previously was $3.18 to $3.39, and our revised guidance is now expected to be $3.35 to $3.60, that's growth of 30% to 40%.
Turning to Slide 27. Our total ARR growth, which includes deferred ARR, was 12% on an organic basis in Q3. And we expect organic active ARR growth of 10% to 12% and are now expecting approximately $95 million in deferred ARR for the full year, which is up from what we told you last quarter of around $90 million.
Wrapping up, we had strong financial performance again in Q3. We delivered double-digit ARR growth, while maintaining discipline on our expense structure as we continue to navigate what still remains a somewhat unsteady macro environment. Year-to-date, our performance has positioned us well to deliver attractive double-digit top line growth and very strong free cash flow growth for the year.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and we can begin the Q&A."

And in fact, new Plex pretty well because it's run by Bill Brody, who's one of my better friends in life and reported to me for a dozen years or so. So Plex is a great company. We know who they were. We kind of had decided it wasn't quite the right fit for us to acquire. But actually, we're pleased to see Rockwell acquire them. And I think there's actually some opportunity for synergies between what Plex does and what PTC does. You might almost think that Rockwell is adding Plex in a way, from my perspective, to the innovation suite we built together. So I don't see any conflict at all. I think Rockwell will be probably sharing some attention cycles with Plex that maybe had been previously committed to PTC. So we'll have to see how that plays out. But in general, Rockwell is an important partner. They won our Partner of the Year award after they acquired Plex. So I think the partnership is important. It's sort of built into the business as we run it today, and I don't see anything dramatic changing there going forward. There was also a question somebody else asked me is Rockwell going to sell their PTC shares. And I would say you probably should ask Rockwell, but certainly, they have not suggested to us they're going to, and I think their public announcement said they were going to fund the Plex acquisition with new debt and cash on hand. So I don't think anything really changes in the relationship other than something new came in. And on one hand, it's bring in new capabilities that might help us against competitors collectively. And on the other hand, we'll have to share attention cycles with it. So that would be my thought there, Saket."

So Altium is 1 of 3 main printed circuit board designers software companies. And then, of course, there are other companies that provide integrated circuit software. The integrated circuit software really doesn't have a touch point with our world of CAD and PLM, but the printed circuit board design software does. We have a partnership with Altium. I'd like to find ways to strengthen that partnership. I don't really see us trying to acquire them. For one thing, we'd have to top other desk price, which I don't know that we're in the mood to do. 
And then secondarily, I don't think they want to be acquired. So I feel like there's a good opportunity there for us to do more in the partnership, both on one hand with Onshape and Arena, which are a nice fit in the lower part of the market with Altium, but also with Creo and Windchill, which are also a nice fit. So there are many Creo and Windchill customers, who put circuit boards in their otherwise mechanical products. And the same would be true of Onshape and Arena. So there's lots to do there in terms of a partnership. I don't see us trying to acquire them in the near term, given the circumstances, as I know them. We did make a small ECAD acquisition, actually a company called ECAD, MCAD, but it really was a very small deal, and it really was at the interface of ECAD and MCAD. It was not ECAD capabilities, but it was the ability to import in real time synchronize between an MCAD product like Onshape and an ECAD product like Altium. So it's actually going to prove useful in some of the integration activities that we want to do. But anyway, Altium is a good company. I'm perfectly happy if they remain standalone and we, PTC, look forward to strengthening our partnership because there's lots of synergy on both sides of that partnership."

It was just simply documenting the ideas. But this really is computer-aided design, where the software is providing ideas to the engineer as opposed to just capturing the engineers' ideas. That's a different process that people wrap to wrap their head around or follow AI around. But like I said, the results are pretty spectacular sometimes. So there's definitely a lot of interest. I think it will take a while to mainstream. But certainly, it's going to be a wave of growth in mechanical CAD over the next 5 years. I just -- I don't think it will come on super strong in the near term."

IoT is a much bigger business because we started it sooner and really had a lot of success in it. So in a way, right now, as IoT goes, it has a big influence on the overall performance of the overall growth segment. So most of the slower growth was in IoT. And most of it is still related to hangovers from COVID. So if we kind of look at what's happening on the sales front with IoT, I mean sales have improved year-over-year. They're still not back to where we want them to be. But in general, what we're seeing is a good quantity of deals but smaller deal sizes, which I just attribute really to conservatism around people doing IoT projects in factories and in general as they come back to speed following COVID. 
You might remember, too, that we mentioned clearly at the beginning of the year that we had a 2-point headwind to growth in our deferred, what we at the time called, backlog, but deferred ARR was a 2-point headwind. Well, a lot of that headwind landed in IoT because that's the place where our sales were softest last year. So some of that is now coming home to roost now. It's not just what did we sell in the quarter, but it's how much backlog did we also take advantage of maturing in the quarter. And that's another pressure that we'll work our way out of as we kind of round trip the COVID impacts of the first -- or the back half of fiscal '20 and the front half of fiscal '21, no, let's say, mostly in fiscal '20 for us."

So first of all, when I use the term enterprise, I was using it as defined by the Onshape team, which generally means an account that would take 15 seats or more. I guess, kind of a small definition of enterprise for the rest of us at PTC, but that's their definition. So I would say the definition of enterprise used by Onshape is a medium-sized company. And the commercial business is small companies. Now I would tell you that it's just a different buying market. And our Creo software and our Windchill software for that matter does not participate effectively in the market where Onshape and Arena are making hay right now. So it's all complementary. And in fact, honestly, we're borrowing a page from Dessau strategy of 20 years ago when they had SolidWorks in the mid-market and CATIA lenovia in the high end of the market. And those 2 products prospered side-by-side for 20-some years until they both grew a bit old and retired, but it's a strategy that works. It's market segmentation. And so I don't think that you're going to see Onshape and Arena put a dent into Creo and Windchill because amongst other things, Creo and Windchill are adopting the SaaS technology called Atlas that makes Onshape so special. So when Onshape's stealing larger accounts, it's basically, by and large, doing them from SolidWorks and then cherry picking a few others here and there. But they're starting to get some accounts whose brands you recognize. You might remember, we had Garrett, Turbo present at an Investor Day, I believe it was, that's a pretty large company who went from CATIA to Onshape and really went for all the qualities of SaaS that they love and, of course, ease of use and other things of Onshape. So I think Onshape is an attractive product. It needs to mature more before it really could be a viable replacement for the high-end products, generally speaking. But I think it will start to pick off a lot of medium-sized accounts and an occasional larger account who maybe is overserved by the more expensive, more complicated technology they're otherwise using."

And we have many other resellers, but they're largely in CAD and PLM. So Rockwell has become an important reseller for sure, of IoT and AR. And I don't see that ending. When I talk to Blake, about how this fits in with his strategy, even post Plex. Blake says, ""Hey, I need an IoT platform, I need an AR platform, I even want to have a CAD and PLM platform available to me when required because his competitor, Siemens has that stuff, not all of IoT and AR, but some IoT and lots of CAD and PLM. So we remain important to Blake, and there's nothing he acquired in the Plex acquisition that supplants any of the capabilities that PTC brought in the FactoryTalk Innovation Suite. So I think it's Blake and Rockwell's strategy, as I understand it, to add Plex to what they're already doing with PTC. And I don't have any issue that whatsoever because I think it's complementary. And like I said, maybe even some upside opportunities. I just noted that we're going to be sharing some mind share with Rockwell, who now has kind of another child in the family, let's say, that's going to need some attention to. So I don't think it's going to materially change our partnership."

So first of all, we're very pleased with the performance of Arena. It has, in fact, accelerated since we acquired it. Now there are several things we're doing that I feel like aren't fully in the game yet. One of them is a link to Onshape. And in fact, we've built some technical integration between the 2 products, which is easy to do because they're both SaaS based. And that technical integration has generated some rave reviews from customers. And if you think about it, any customer who wants SaaS for PLM, why not, they have the religion and they really want SaaS for everything, including CAD and vice versa. So we do think there will be some cross-selling there. That might -- that benefit might accrue more to Onshape in the near term because Arena accounts tend to be a little bigger, like 1- and 2-seat CAD accounts that might not need PLM, but Arena accounts could generate a fair number of CAD seats, 15 or more. So I think there will be some benefit in both directions that might help Onshape first. But then the thing we can really do for Arena is to globalize the sales force because Arena really is a U.S.-based business, a tiny bit of business in Europe and essentially not in Asia other than sometimes an American company might have some users in Asia, but they're not Asian companies. So we, PTC, of course, are much more globally balanced, and we have the capabilities to help them kind of spread their operation around the world pretty quickly. And that's underway, and I mentioned we opened the European sales operation. 
By the way, Arena and Onshape both have basically inside sales go-to-market operations, they don't have sales reps all over the place. You still need a European operation and the right time zones and all that, but it's a cost-effective, go-to-market model as opposed to kind of the PTC larger accounts where we have outside reps living in all the different countries around the world next to the customers and so forth. So I think we're going to be able to generate some acceleration for Arena to even higher levels next year, but we still need to plan all that out, but we certainly have something to work with."

I certainly expect that based on the forecast in the pipeline. And I think we're in a better position going forward into next year. Bookings certainly are up year-over-year.

And then in the end, we'll have it all replatform, but if you look at what we did with the generative design extension. That's a good model to explain what we're trying to do. And that is we want to be able to take key subsystems from Creo and Windchill, in particular, and build them on Atlas and deliver better value, more capabilities, better cost profile to customers through SaaS and then take another module. And so a customer might incrementally by more and more SaaS from us over time, and we envision this taking a few years. And then at some point, just flip the switch and say, I'll just take it all to SaaS. So again, don't think of it as a big bang. Think of it as incremental. Yes, it's a big  development effort. The good news is we're not trying to invent the platform we're replatforming until that platform has been under development for 7 or 8 years by the Onshape guys, -- That's Atlas. And it's a fantastic platform. I mean, really great. So I feel like time will tell. But in the end, with Onshape, we're going to get a really great SaaS-based CAD system, but we're actually probably going to get something even bigger, which is the singular platform that powers PTC's next generation of software that's going to breathe another decade or so of growth into our Creo and Windchill product lines."

Well, there's an interesting -- it's a good question, and an interesting survey we do, where we reach out to our Creo and Windchill customers and test their receptivity towards SaaS. And that receptivity expanded dramatically over the last year",778,"Yes, Matt. Well, there's an interesting -- it's a good question, and an interesting survey we do, where we reach out to our Creo and Windchill customers and test their receptivity towards SaaS. And that receptivity expanded dramatically over the last year. I mean, like from a minority to a very strong majority of them are saying, ""I want SaaS."" Now if you think about it, Creo and Windchill are very sticky products. So they're saying like, ""I want SaaS, but I don't want to switch because switching CAD systems, especially when you're a big user of a high-end CAD system and you've got years and years worth of data, I mean, that's a project. But if I could, within Creo go to SaaS, that would be wonderful. If within windshield, I could go to SaaS, that would be wonderful. Now why do they want to go to SaaS? Well, they realize, first of all, a mobile workforce. And everybody has some hybrid working office strategy going forward. The thing is if the software, if you're a CAD software, for example, runs on a big desktop computer in the office, well, then how do you work from home? You set up another big desktop computer at home and then how do you shuffle the files back and forth. I mean it's just hard. It'd be better if all this data was never on the desktop, it was always in the cloud, same with the application. So for example, during the COVID initial shutdowns, Windchill worked great because Windchill is web-based and the data actually is in some web server somewhere. So you just go home and you jump on whatever computer you have there or even a phone or a tablet and you log in through your web browser and you're doing Windchill stuff. Creo, and everything like Creo in the market, it's a different story. That's a big, what we call, a fat client executable, typically, with a whole bunch of modules installed, typically integrated to other software on that same computer or might be simulation, might be CAM software or whatever. So there's a whole ecosystem of software set up on that computer, how do you recreate that at home? It's hard and there's licensing obstacles and whatnot. So what a lot of people did is they used a virtual desktop infrastructure. That is from a computer at home, you logged into the computer at work, ran the software and the computer at work and pipe the user interface on to the computer at home. If you did that, it really makes for a pretty crappy workday. This is not really the way to do things like CAD. CAD is optimized for graphics performance and so forth. And all that optimization is completely lost when you're piping the display across the Internet. So you really want something that's designed to never put the data and ideally don't put the application on the desktop computer in the first place because if it's not there, that means you can move around. 
So with Windchill, you can move around, but people like to offload more of the cost. These are complex systems. So mobility is 1 thing they want, work from anywhere, anytime, work from the office 3 days of a week, work from home 2 days a week. But the second real thing is cost. They'd like to get rid of the system administrators, they'd like to get rid of the servers, file servers. There's a lot of costs tied up in that stuff. And they're saying, if you guys could just let me pay for the value I get for the software and not for an infrastructure and the care and feeding of it, it would be great. A third thing we talk about is real-time collaboration. Again, CAD systems are kind of based on the premise of checking and checkout. That means I'll take the file, lock it. So you can look at it, but you can't change it until I'd be clear, I'm done changing it. Well, there's a lot of IP in 1 file. And a lot of times, people are saying, ""Well, I get any other kind of software I'm used to, we're working in the same stuff at the same time. How come I can't do that with CAD."" Again, you can with SaaS. So I can go on, there are more qualities that are important to people, but let's just say what Creo and Windchill customers really want is all the benefits of Onshape and Arena without switching from Creo and Windchill. And that's what we're trying to bring to them."

So PLM in an industrial company, it's absolutely as important as your CRM system, which is the system of record for your customers or your HR system for employees or whatever. So when companies think I really want these processes to be digitized and mobile, you become mobile and global and all that, you realize we need a reliable source of product data that everybody in engineering, manufacturing, service, marketing sales, whatever, can transact against. So we need 1 single system, and we all need access to it. And so we're starting to hear that more and more that it's not about making the engineers more efficient, which was kind of the first generation of PLM. This is more about making sure that everybody across the company has access to the right product data because everybody is making decisions about products, pricing them, selling them, supporting them, manufacturing them. And we need to have accurate data and it needs to be 2 clicks away. And that's what PLM is now being recognized as the system of record for products. And industrial companies can't get very far down the journey of digital transformation without saying, ""Hey, shouldn't we have a system of record for our products. I mean, honestly, they're product companies. So I think PLM is really emerging into something different. A quick example would be that Navy contract we won. It's about product support. It's about everybody supporting ships, having access to data about ships in the systems they contain, support data. And so we're using PLM concepts to support the operation of ship, not the engineering and manufacturing, but actually the operation of ships that were engineered manufactured years ago, and it's kind of a good example of digital transformation versus engineering productivity."

The question I have about the Creo and Onshape strategies is that's a fairly good list of executable. So how do you think about the ones that are perhaps most important on those lists for you to achieve or perhaps the most difficult to achieve, which aren't necessarily the same thing? 
And then secondly, you referred to Microsoft a number of times. They're on the cusp of launching their manufacturing cloud. And I'm wondering how you're thinking about the opportunity for you in terms of drafting along with what they do with Manufacturing Cloud."

In the case of Creo, 400-plus people working on it. In the case of Onshape, not near that many because it's a smaller, tighter product yet younger product. But there's room with the level of resources we have on these products, they have 4 or 5 priorities. That's down from 20 or 30 that they would otherwise do. They're trying to narrow down and focus on the key ones. So I think we have the capacity to execute 4 or 5 initiatives at a time in both of these products. We can't execute 10 or 20, but certainly 4 or 5 big ones, and I guess you were wearing your hat as a partner that day on that conference. But we're just trying to share with our partners where we're going, what we think is important and frankly, where we think the money is. 
So that's what's going on there. With respect to Microsoft and their manufacturing cloud, there's a lot of conversations going on between PTC and Microsoft about how to align PTC with that manufacturing cloud, they want us to, we want to. It's just a question now of figuring out what to do to make that happen. The fact that our former Chief Strategy Officer, Kathleen Mitford, just went over there. It is actually quite helpful because Kathleen and I are quite close, and we've had some conversations since she's gone over there, and she's now able to help me, let's say, coach me and I'm able to coach her and make the companies better aligned together. So there's a lot of good stuff happening with Microsoft, again, 3 Partner of the Year awards. I think the Manufacturing Cloud will be good for us, but there's some work to figure out once they put it out there, how do we tightly align with it."

Moving to Slide 5. Q4 was an outstanding quarter for PTC, and it capped off another strong year. We came in at the high end of our guidance for ARR growth, and we exceeded our free cash flow guidance. Despite the pandemic, every part of the business performed well in fiscal '21, with growth in every product line and in every geography. Fiscal '21 was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit organic ARR growth, and we're guiding for fiscal '22 to be the fifth. Furthermore, by continuing our strong focus on operational discipline, we've been able to translate our top line growth into strong bottom line free cash flow performance. Kristian will take you through free cash flow in more detail later in the call. 
Taking a look at the key factors driving our top line performance and turning to Slide 6. Our Q4 bookings results were outstanding. Bookings were up mid-teens organically and high teens overall from the blockbuster Q4 we had a year ago. Remember that in Q4 of fiscal '20, bookings bounced back sharply, following a downturn in Q2 and Q3 during the depths of the pandemic. Surpassing last year's strong Q4 number is a great accomplishment. 
Bookings were strong across all product lines and geographies. Because Q4 of fiscal '20 had been such an outlier, our planned targeted Q4 '21 organic bookings to be roughly flat to last year's number. Creo was slightly above plan, while everything else was well above. FSG and Onshape led the way with bookings growth of more than 90% and 70%, respectively. 
IoT and AR bookings were both up mid-teens year-over-year to record levels for each, with IoT bookings growing more than 120% sequentially, while AR bookings grew more than 60% sequentially. PLM bookings were up high single digits year-over-year. Keep in mind that a good percentage of our Q4 bookings, especially those done later in the quarter, don't start until October or later. So they end up in what we used to call backlog, but now called deferred ARR. Deferred ARR ended the year at $20 million above the original plan we had for fiscal '21. So in summary, not only did we hit the high end of our fiscal '21 ARR guidance range by delivering 12 points of organic ARR growth, we also booked about 1.5 points more growth in the deferred AR, which will benefit future periods. 
Turning to ARR on Slide 7. On a top line basis, fiscal '21 was a big success. In Q4, we came in at 12% organic ARR, excluding Arena, and 16% ARR growth overall. 
Looking at our core products in Q4, we continued to deliver market-leading growth. Creo came in at low double-digit growth, while Windchill grew mid-teens. According to data published by Jay [indiscernible], Creo and Windchill have significantly outperformed Siemens and Dessau's CAD and PLM businesses lately, as they are relatively flat with 2019, while we're up more than 20%. We've been seeing the solid growth trend in our core CAD and PLM business for years now, and we expect this to continue. I'll come back to this important point during the second part of my prepared remarks. 
Next, looking at our growth products, IoT grew mid-teens coming in below our target. However, bookings were strong in Q4, and we expect stronger ARR growth in fiscal '22, following bookings momentum and the launch of our new Digital Performance Management Solution. Vuforia AR, before augmented reality, grew mid-teens, which is better than it sounds when you factor in that this growth came on top of very strong 77% growth in our previous Q4 that we're comparing against. I'm happy with the roughly 40% CAGR over the past 2 years. In fiscal '22, we are positioned to continue good growth in AR based on our bookings momentum. 
Onshape grew over 50%. It's now been 2 years since we acquired Onshape, and we're very pleased with the acquisition and the progress made by the Onshape team. Arena grew over 20%. This represents good acceleration from mid-teens preacquisition growth rates, driven by go-to-market investments we made, coupled with synergies gained by being part of PTC. 
Turning to FSG. Growth was 6%, primarily driven by strong performance of our systems and software engineering offerings where we benefited from several large deals. 
Turning to Slide 8. While Creo and Windchill are powerful independently, these products generate even more value when leverage together. A great example of this integrated story can be found in our recent announcement that the entire Volvo Group will adopt PTC's Creo product as their primary CAD solution, mirroring what they did several years ago with our Windchill PLM solution. This is a big competitive displacement for Creo. 
In addition, our ANSYS-powered Creo simulation live technology, together with Creo ANSYS simulation, continues to drive customer interest in simulation. I've been saying for some time that as the product system of record, PLM is a critical element of any manufacturing company's digital transformation strategy. This is exactly what led to our largest ever PLM order in Q4 of '21, a multiyear committed ramp deal coming from a large global medical device company. This too was a competitive displacement for Windchill. In PLM, we saw average deal sizes increasing with numerous expansions in the quarter. 
In IoT, this past week, we launched our Digital Performance Management, or DPM solution, at our manufacturing levanta. If you missed the event, by the way, you can find the replay on our Investor website. DPM is our new solution designed to be a comprehensive turnkey out-of-the-box solution that addresses our customers' biggest IoT value creation opportunities. It will be the perfect antidote to the so-called pilot purgatory problem the IoT industry has been discussing. 
You may have also noted separately the press release announcing that PTC is the only industrial IoT player recognized as a leader by all 4 major industry analyst firms. Also in the IoT space, Microsoft yesterday officially launched its cloud for manufacturing, and we're thrilled to be a lead partner. Our alliance with Microsoft continues to go well with Q4 being our best quarter to date in terms of co-selling with Microsoft. 
Before we had delivered a healthy mix of expansions, cross-sell and net new logos, we landed our largest ever AR order from a large pharmaceutical company, which will use Vuforia Instruct to deliver augmented digital work instructions to improve the speed and quality of production on changeovers. 
Also, with all the buzz you hear about Metaverse these days, you might enjoy watching the amazing live industrial metaverse demonstration that our CTO, Steve Dertien, and I delivered as part of our manufacturing live keynote using our Vuforia Spatial Toolbox technology. 
If you look carefully at the graphic on the right side of Slide 8, that is Steve and I standing in front of our anonymized digital representations whose movement in activity is being measured and analyzed in real time. This is a peak into our concept of digital tailors named after the famous work of Frederick Taylor, who is the father of industrial engineering more than 100 years ago. 
Turning now to Onshape and Arena on Slide 9. Onshape performance has been driven by strong win rates against competitors, coupled with solid expansion rates. Onshape captured nearly 1,000 new logos in fiscal '21. 
During the year, churn improved by 10 points while net retention improved by 15 points, and these metrics now look quite strong compared to similar-sized SaaS peers of all types. Naturally, smaller companies have been drawn to Onshape because its lightweight SaaS footprint enables agile hardware development processes. But thanks to 17 more product releases during the past year, Onshape's maturing functionality also led to several significant orders in Q4 from larger companies in the robotics and medical device fields who love the product for similar reasons. The amazing adoption that Onshape experienced in the education market in fiscal '21 is icing on the cake. It contributed little to the financials, but sets the stage for mass adoption by the next-generation workforce in future years. 
Arena saw numerous expansions driving larger deal sizes, too. Arena is also proving to be a great acquisition. Like Onshape, Arena is the cloud-native market leader in PLM with particular strength in tech-centric markets such as electronics and medical devices. We're on track with the integration plan that we laid out for the acquisition of Arena with new sales capacity coming online in the U.S. and Europe. The combination of Onshape and Arena makes PTC the clear market leader in cloud-native PLM and CAD solutions, and these offerings make a great pairing for fast-moving high-tech manufacturers who want to develop hardware using the same agile process methodology as software. 
Next, Slide 10 shows our geographic ARR performance. Americas was up 19%, led by double-digit growth in core products and Arena; Europe was up 13%, led by high single digit in core products; low 40s growth in growth products and double-digit growth in FSG; and APAC was up 17%, led by mid-teens growth in core products and low 30s growth in growth products. 
There are thousands of people at PTC that contributed to our outstanding fiscal '21, and I'd like to say thank you to all of them. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Kristian to complete the portion of today's call, focused on Q4 and fiscal '21."

Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance later in the discussion, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency.

Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance later in the discussion, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. 
So turning to Slide 12. We delivered ARR growth at the high end of our guidance range. Fiscal '21 ARR of $1.47 billion increased 16% year-over-year. Excluding Arena, ARR growth was 12%. FX was a small $4 million headwind in fiscal '21 for us. 
As Jim highlighted earlier, our bookings were very strong in Q4. With this, we had an uptick -- within this, we had an uptick in ramp deals, and that's why our bookings performance did not result in even stronger ARR growth. Instead, the vast majority of our bookings upside went into deferred ARR that will benefit future periods, primarily fiscal '23 [indiscernible]. 
Organic churn improved approximately 130 basis points year-over-year, slightly ahead of our guidance for approximately 100 basis points of improvement, primarily driven by strong execution in CAD, PLM, FSG as well as modest continued improvement in both IoT and AR. 
Fiscal '21 free cash flow of $344 million grew 61% year-over-year and was slightly above our guidance. Note that our free cash flow for the year included an unforecasted $18 million outflow related to a foreign tax dispute, $15 million in acquisition-related fees and $15 million in restructuring payments. These onetime headwinds were offset by other onetime tailwinds, including some onetime tax benefits, arena working capital versus original expectations, improvements in AR aging also helped drive a onetime uptick in free cash flow in '21. 
Fiscal '21 revenue of $1.81 billion increased to 24% year-over-year, as reported, or 20% in constant currency and was above guidance. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606. So in Q4 and throughout fiscal '21longer-than-anticipated contract durations and support to subscription conversions positively impacted the amount of upfront subscription revenue recognized in the quarter and in the year. 
I'd like to remind you that over the long term, ARR and recurring revenue growth rates should be approximately the same. However, in any period, revenue is subject to much more volatility due to ASC 606, which is why we feel that ARR, our annual run rate, which is also a very close proxy for subscription billings, is the true and better indicator of PTC's growth. 
In fiscal '21, non-GAAP operating margins were 35% and increased to approximately 610 basis points over fiscal '20. This was due to the strong revenue performance I just mentioned as well as maintaining good discipline on our operating expense structure. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $3.97 increased to 58% year-over-year and was above guidance. I'd like to point out that our GAAP results reflect a gain of $69 million related to our investment in Matterport, which we mark-to-market. And as you may recall, Matterport went public and began trading on July 23. In addition, our GAAP results also included the release of $137 million valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and a tax benefit of $42 million related to the Arena acquisition. 
Moving to the next slide. Another way to think about PTC's performance is using the cash flow model we often share. And as you can see here on Slide 13, ARR plus perpetual revenue plus professional services revenue equaled our cash generation, which was $1.455 billion, which is up about $200 million over fiscal '20. 
You can also see the total expenses of $1.173 billion. This was up about [ 138 ], a  margin of $473 million with an increase of about $62 million. Or if you think about cash contribution margin as a proxy for cash EBITDA [Audio Gap], and this was up about 100 basis points compared to fiscal '20. Headwinds and   and tailwinds I discussed in terms of cash tax headwinds, which actually resulted in net positive working capital in fiscal '20 in a growing business. 
Moving to Slide [Audio Gap] fiscal '21, with [Audio Gap]. In the digitation we had medium-term investments, Our gross debt was $1.45 billion with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.2%. During Q4, we paid down $40 million on our revolving credit facility, and we also made our $19 million semiannual bond interest payment. With our leverage ratio now less than 3x, which we told you was our goal. We resumed our share repurchase program. The $30 million of cash we used to repurchase shares in Q4 was approximately equal to our free cash flow generation in the quarter. All in all, wrapped up a solid year for PTC from both an ARR and a free cash flow perspective. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

PTC is at an exciting point in our history. Despite bumpy macro conditions, we have established a 4-year track record of double-digit top line organic growth based on a recurring revenue model and driven by widely recognized technology leadership positions in an industry increasingly motivated by digital transformation. In parallel, our decade-long track record of strong operational discipline has driven our margins up, enabling us to benefit significantly from leverage as we scale. You see that in the 61% free cash flow growth I highlighted at the start of the call. .
Given the strength of our financial performance in fiscal '21, the restructuring we announced today might come as a surprise to some of you, but sit tight because I think you will like what we're doing. For some time now, I've been telling investors about our plans to leverage the Atlas platform that we acquired with Onshape to pivot the whole company toward a SaaS future. As I had previously discussed it, much of the upside benefits of the SaaS pivot would come in fiscal '24 and beyond. 
Many of you have asked, why wouldn't we invest more to get to that SaaS upside more quickly? Frankly, that was a good question and 1 that we thought long and hard about. We even hired McKinsey to help us think through it and develop a strategy. Today, I will explain how, thanks to the changes we're making, we will invest substantially more in our SaaS initiatives while actually decreasing our overall run rate spending projection significantly. 
Let me hit the financial summary first on Slide 16, and then explain the strategy and operational changes behind it. In terms of the financial view of the restructuring, we are reducing our spending run rate by approximately $60 million compared to fiscal '21 as we improve the efficiency of our organizational structure. 
We've also eliminated about $30 million of previously contemplated new spending run rate from our fiscal '22 plans. So compared to the plan for fiscal '22 that existed prior to the restructuring, we now have -- we now expect to reduce our planned fiscal '22 run rate spending by approximately $9 million. And then reinvest about half of that into initiatives that accelerate our transition to SaaS, with the other half falling to the bottom line. 
Key SaaS investments will be used to increase capacity on Atlas, to accelerate work to adopt Atlas into our core products and to operate those products at SaaS, and into Onshape and Arena product development and sales capacity. Despite what will be a very significant investment, we expect to expand cash margins by approximately 400 basis points in FY '22. So we are accelerating both growth and margin expansion at the same time. 
Restructuring-related cash outflows are expected to be approximately $50 million to $55 million, with about 2/3 occurring in the first half of '22, and the majority of the remaining payments to be made in Q3. In other words, the restructuring will obscure the great cash flow progress for the next 2 or 3 quarters, but the benefits will start shining through after that. Already by Q4 of fiscal '22, we should be seeing a net free cash flow tailwind as a consequence of the restructuring. Then as Kristian will outline, fiscal '23 and beyond will look great. 
Let's go to Slide 17, and I'll start by explaining why SaaS pivot is so interesting to PTC. There are 3 reasons why we think now is the time for PTC to align with and invest more in the SaaS transition. First, the industrial software market wants to go to SaaS. COVID has greatly amplified the interest in SaaS. PTC is already the recognized SaaS leader in our industry. Onshape and Arena have proven what's possible, and they've dramatically elevated PTC's credibility. We are far ahead of competitors in terms of understanding what SaaS is and what it is not. Customers are looking for PTC to lead the whole industry through a transition to SaaS. 
Second, based on growing customer demand, we see the need to accelerate SaaS initiatives while better aligning with SaaS best practices in order to meet the needs of the market. The investments we're making now will allow us to play offense to capture the market demand. 
Third, we believe our new SaaS strategy will accelerate a major growth driver for PTC, giving us more pathways to mid-teens growth in the midterm and helping to derisk our growth ambitions. Meanwhile, cost savings from the restructuring itself are expected to derisk our free cash flow growth targets, even if the growth should prove slower to materialize than I expect. 
Turning to Slide 18. Owning the industry's only cloud native CAD and PLM combo has been a big advantage. By comparing how our Onshape and Arena businesses work, as compared to the balance of BTC, we can see that certain ways in which PTC has been organized are quite inefficient. At the same time, we see an opportunity to serve customers better, too, and that's why we're choosing to evolve our organization to be more SaaS like. 
I'd like to review several of the larger changes. Previously, in addition to working with sales, our customers would have more than a half dozen touch points across our broad customer success organization, including renewal sales, presales, post-sales consulting, customer success management, technical support, our cloud organization, a group called customer experience and others. 
In comparison, most SaaS companies have a 2 in-the-box model, where each customer has just 1 sales and 1 customer success contact. Not only is PTC's current model inefficient, perhaps more importantly, customers hate being repeatedly passed from 1 contact to another as they proceed through their journey with PTC. So we are reconfiguring to deploy the same two-in-a-box model that SaaS companies utilize. 
This reconfiguration has no impact on the sales side of the equation. In fact, we're adding direct quota-carrying capacity into the current model. Aside from where we expand coverage, the vast majority of customers will retain the same sales contacts they know and love today. The bigger change for the customer will be that they now have 1 customer success contact rather than many. There's nothing but goodness here for everybody. Customers prefer this model, and it will save PTC a lot of money as it is much more scalable. 
The other major change is on the product development, delivery and support side. With Onshape and Arena or any true SaaS company, this is all done by a single organization using modern DevOps practices. But within the core PTC product lines, the development cloud delivery and technical support organizations have been entirely separate with the latter to belonging to the field organization. You simply can't get to SaaS that way. 
As part of our reorganization, we have merged our cloud delivery and technical support groups into the product organization to mirror the Maven SaaS practices deployed by Onshape and Arena and everybody else in the SaaS world. This, too, will create significant operating efficiencies and a much improved customer experience at the same time. Nothing but goodness here, too. 
To better understand the demand drivers, let's take a look at an illustrative value proposition on Slide 19, typical of what customers see in the transition from on-premise to SaaS. For every dollar a customer pays PTC or any other vendor for on-prem PLM, they have an estimated additional $2 to $3 in cost of ownership associated with on-premise servers and storage system administrators plus SIs who help with on-site installations and upgrades and all that. Their total cost of ownership can be $3 to $4. When the deployment, maintenance and delivery responsibility for the software is shifted back to PTC, we can leverage significant efficiencies to serve that same functionality back to the customer for roughly an incremental dollar at margins that are attractive to us. Therefore, each dollar of on-premise software ARR today represents potentially $2 of future SaaS ARR for PTC plus a savings of $1 or $2 for the customer. 
The customer also gets to enjoy the many other benefits of SaaS. It is device agnostic, it's ideal for a hybrid work environment, data shared with employees and suppliers in real time, plus no more upgrades to do as everyone is always on the latest version. This value proposition for SaaS is not really new news to any of you, it's what Marc Benioff at Salesforce.com has been espousing for 2 decades now. More than half of the overall commercial software industry has already made this pivot. But that's not yet the case in our world of industrial software, where SaaS has low single-digit penetration. 
As Salesforce did in CRM, some company will have to lead the way to SaaS in the CAD and PLM industry. We think the time is right for industrial companies to move to SaaS, and PTC is best positioned to lead that transition. 
Turning to Slide 20. We've been delivering more and more new PLM projects as SaaS in recent years, as customer preference has shifted there. But going forward, we'll make SaaS our primary delivery model and deliver on-premise only when required by the customer. But we also have a large existing customer base with on-premise systems. In order for existing customers to get to SaaS, each customer has to go through a lift and shift process. This process entails lifting the on-premise deployment, upgrading and decustomizing it as necessary to eliminate technical debt, and then shifting it into the PTC cloud from where we can serve it back to the customer as a service. We plan to focus the lift and ship program first in Windchill where the biggest opportunity lies and bring Creo and other products into the fold in subsequent phases over time. 
So you may be wondering, well, how will this help to accelerate growth? The answer is that our organizational changes and the associated wave of investment enable us to scale up to make SaaS the default for new sales and to start the lift and shift process now here in fiscal '22. Though the value proposition for transitioning to SaaS is sound, we still have to go through a sales cycle with each customer. Returning the sales teams lows now with this proposition, and we expect the first projects to begin showing up in the back half of fiscal '22. 
The Windchill SaaS capability will be deployed into Azure and into the manufacturing cloud at that. So Microsoft is eager to help us sell this proposition. I'd like to think of this project as the last upgrade for each customer because when the lift and shift project is done, then PTC will take it forward father. Therefore, a good time to sell this program is whenever customers start planning their next upgrade. Customers tend to upgrade Windchill systems once every 2 or 3 years, so we get a shot at a good portion of the base each year and expect success to accelerate in fiscal '23 and beyond. 
There are thousands of Windchill deployments out there, so I anticipate this process will take numerous years, perhaps a decade, and we won't get them all. Naturally, we'll focus first on the most ready customers and work on the long tail further out. In the end, I expect we'll ultimately get about 75% of the customers to transition, and we'll continue to offer on-premise variance of the product, born of the same code stream on an indefinite basis for those who do not want SaaS. 
PTC is all in on SaaS. The program we're launching is a major cross-sale effort on par with the highly successful program. We executed the move from perpetual to where we are today with 98% of our software revenue now being subscription. Like that subscription program, the SaaS transition program involves numerous changes to our offerings, to our pricing and packaging, to compensation and more. 
We have the same program leader driving it. An important difference though, is that the SaaS transition program is all about growth acceleration within the recurring software business model we currently have in place, which means we will not have the same so-called valley of death effect that our cash flow went back -- went through back then. Now we'll have all of the gain, but none of that pain. Taking you deeper into the elements of this program will be a key agenda topic at our December Investor Day. 
One last related change we're making is to organize into 2 main business units, as shown on Slide 21. With plans to leverage SaaS now in place and underway across the entire company, it no longer makes sense to have a SaaS business unit per se. Therefore, we plan to reunite Vuforia AR with the CAD PLM and IoT product lines into a business unit designed to promote higher levels of cross-selling across this integrated product portfolio. This new business unit, which focuses on the digital transformation driver, will be all about growing the base and leading them to SaaS. It will be called the Digital Thread business unit to reflect the highly integrated nature of its portfolio of products. 
Troy Richardson, who's been our Chief Operating Officer for the past year, is being promoted to become President of this business unit. Troy has already been managing the go-to-market side of these businesses, but now the product development arm will report to him as well to drive title liman. Naturally, I'll stay involved in the technology road map, because as you probably know, that's where my passing lies. You'll get more time with Troy Richardson at the upcoming Investor Day. 
Onshape and Arena will remain together under their current President, Mike DiTullio. This will be called the Velocity business unit to reflect that the cloud-native pure SaaS value proposition of Onshape and Arena, it's most attractive to companies who want to deploy agile product development processes and move fast. This business unit is all about disrupting the competition and landing new logos, which, in many cases, are SME customers. But we're seeing larger companies being drawn to Onshape and Arena solutions too because their existing vendor simply doesn't have anything that compares. Companies like Garrett Motion, for example, the $4 billion automotive turbocharger company we profiled at our fiscal '20 Investor Day last year, who switched to Onshape from a high-end CAD competitor to gain increased business velocity. You'll have more time with Mike DiTullio, too, at the Investor Day. Both business units Presidents report to me. I'll help drive their respective strategies, while Troy and Mike preside over the operating cadence of each business unit. 
A related change is that the Atlas platform will move under our very capable CTO, Steve Dertien, who will develop the shared platform to meet the needs of both units. Steve will continue to report to me. 
I know that was a lot of information to take in. Turning to Slide 22. Let me summarize, and then I'll hand it back to Kristian for more specific go-forward guidance. First, from a top line perspective, our SaaS acceleration pivot unlocks another powerful multiyear growth catalyst for PTC and our shareholders. Exiting fiscal '21, Creo and Windchill together represent more than $1 billion of ARR, growing double digits organically. This growth pattern has been in place for 4 years now, right through the pandemic with the strong performance driven by the role both products play in the digital transformation strategies of industrial companies. 
With the SaaS program that we're launching, we're layering an additional growth driver into this core business that we expect could last a decade. Therefore, in our core business, we see double-digit ARR growth being sustainable well into the future. Together with the growth drivers in IoT and AR, plus Onshape and Arena, we're creating more pathways to drive ARR growth to the mid-teens. In my view, PTC's growth story is alive and well. 
Second, from a bottom line perspective, the strategic improvements we're making will drive up our cash contribution margins considerably and help derisk our cash flow targets under a broader range of ARR growth scenarios. Kristian will expand on this. 
Given our confidence in growth, coupled with the higher margins, we remain committed to the midterm free cash flow targets that we set at our Investor Day last year. Recall that our guidance was for midterm free cash flow growth of approximately 25% to 30%. After we get beyond the restructuring payments, we expect to perform in that range, perhaps earlier than you might have expected. 
Our guidance for fiscal '22 assumes we'll get a small positive impact from the SaaS transition in the back half of the fiscal year, which is counterbalanced by slower assumed growth rates in FSG and somewhat conservative assumptions we have around Rockwell's contribution as they work their way through the Flex integration. Let me be clear that our commitment to the partnership with Rockwell remains as strong as ever, and that we're energized to work together because of the great potential we see ahead. In particular, we see tremendous potential for the DPM [Audio Gap]"

Jim did a good job outlining many of the pathways we have to getting to these targets with the SaaS opportunity in both the velocity and core businesses; with the addition of solutions to the portfolio, starting with DPM; coupled with the general strength of the existing portfolio. More specifically, for fiscal '22, we expect ARR of $1.615 billion to $1.66 billion. That's a growth rate of 10% to 13% on a constant currency basis, following 4 consecutive years of double-digit ARR growth. It's also worth mentioning that we expect continued churn improvement in fiscal '22 and are targeting another 100 basis point improvement. 
From a linearity perspective, we would again expect flattish ARR growth throughout the year on a constant currency basis. So using the midpoint of guidance, that would imply about 11.5% ARR growth each quarter. Obviously, this can fluctuate given bookings performance, start dates, et cetera, but we believe we provided for that within the range outlined. 
The one thing worth pointing out is that ARR growth in Q1 of '22 is expected to be approximately 15% since Q1 '21 did not include ARR for Arena. In order to help with the modeling, we've provided historical constant currency performance in the data tables on the website, and I'll touch more on this in a little bit. 
Turning to cash flow. We also continue to target approximately 25% to 30% annual free cash flow growth over the midterm. For fiscal '22, specifically, we're guiding for free cash flow of approximately $400 million. As a consequence of the restructuring, we're expecting cash outflows of approximately $50 million to $55 million with approximately 2/3 occurring in the first half and the majority of the remaining payments to be made in Q3. Excluding restructuring, our expected free cash flow in fiscal '22 would be approximately $450 million, representing 25% growth compared to the $359 million we generated in fiscal '21 on the same basis. So doing some directional math and using round numbers on the midterm targets, this means we would expect free cash flow in the $550 million to $600 million range in fiscal '23 and would expect $700 million to $750 million of free cash flow in fiscal '24. 
Regarding the linearity of free cash flow in fiscal '22, excluding restructuring, we expect to see a similar pattern as in fiscal '21 with more than 60% of free cash flow generation in the first half of the year. Collections are stronger in the first half, and we expect expenses to increase as we ramp hiring and our SaaS investments throughout the year. 
As Jim discussed, the restructuring not only creates strategic improvements in how we're organized, but also enhances our profitability profile. So we believe we'll be able to deliver strong free cash flow growth, even if we don't accelerate the ARR. I'll come back to this point on the next slide. 
And finally, turning to revenue guidance. For fiscal '22, we're expecting revenue of $1.85 billion to $1.98 billion, which corresponds to a growth rate of 2% to 9% on an as-reported basis or 4% to 11% on a constant currency basis. 
ASC 606 makes revenue fairly difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range. Note that revenue has no impact on ARR or free cash flow as we continue to primarily bill customers annually upfront. And again, over the longer term, we expect recurring revenue growth to align with ARR growth, particularly as we transition the company to SaaS and evolve towards increasingly ratable revenue recognition. 
So moving on to Slide 25. Using the same free cash flow model we showed earlier, so this slide illustrates a directional view of what fiscal '22 could look like, assuming the approximate midpoint of our ARR guidance range. ARR here grows at approximately 11.5%. Cash generation is up $170 million. We see continued growth in expenses. But given the new operating model, as Jim pointed out earlier, our cash contribution margin expands almost 400 basis points. Said differently, the new operating model is expected to add more than $120 million of cash contribution margin versus the $60 million plus we added last year on similar to slightly less ARR growth. 
On the expense front, as Jim mentioned, we're reducing spending in certain areas to fund investments to accelerate our SaaS transition. Additionally, there are some other items that will impact OpEx this year, such as the accounting for commissions, which is impacted by ASC 606, increased travel, merit and so on. 
So as far as the P&L is concerned, the net result is that we're guiding for fiscal '22 non-GAAP operating expense to grow by approximately 3% at the midpoint of guidance, which is certainly lower than the 50% of our targeted ARR growth for the year, even though we're significantly increasing our SaaS-related spending. 
On an organic basis, factoring in the Arena acquisition, which closed in Q2 of fiscal '21, we actually expect non-GAAP OpEx growth to be closer to 2% at the midpoint of the ARR range. 
We also have a modest $5 million uptick in CapEx this year. OIE cash taxes remain approximately flat, and we see some expansion in the other category which is really the restructuring charge and change in working capital as the business grows. 
Moving to Slide 26. As you know, we currently present our ARR and revenue in 3 product categories: core, FSG and growth. Going forward, as Jim explained, we'll have 2 business units, digital thread and Velocity. So to align our reporting with how we look at the business, we'll be changing our ARR and revenue reporting buckets accordingly.  
Digital thread will consist of core FSG and also IoT and AR from the current growth products. And when we report digital thread going forward, we'll provide the detailed split 1 level below. On the slide, the categories in bold text on the left represent our current disclosure. The categories on the right in bold green text represent our go-forward disclosure. And Velocity will consist of Onshape and Arena from the current growth products. 
Slide 27 shows what the recast ARR data looks like. I won't spend a lot of time on this as we published 3 years of historical ARR and revenue data in our new format within the financial data tables filed on the IR website. There are a couple of points I would make. First, please note that all of the historical constant currency ARR figures have been calculated using our fiscal '22 plan FX rates. Second, in addition to the digital thread and velocity recast, we did a small recast of a portion of our Vuforia AR business, which removes approximately $6 million of ARR in both fiscal '21 and fiscal '20 and $5 million in fiscal '19. 
We made this change because we've come to realize there are certain buyers with marketing-oriented use cases who purchased Vuforia engine for short-term promotions without a true intention to use it on a recurring basis. The bulk of the Vuforia suite is unaffected and will continue to be sold on a recurring basis. We adjusted the historical amounts to enable go-forward comparability. 
And then lastly, just in terms of expectations for fiscal '22, starting with the digital thread core, we are targeting fiscal '22 ARR growth of 10% to 12%. This is consistent with our historical performance for digital thread growth. We're targeting fiscal '22 ARR growth accelerating back into the 20%-plus range for digital thread FSG. We target fiscal '22 ARR growth of approximately flattish, again, consistent with historical performance and expectations. So in total, for digital thread, we're targeting ARR growth of 10% to 12%. For Velocity, we're targeting fiscal '22 ARR growth in the 20-plus percent range, given the strength of both Arena and Onshape. 
Moving on to Slide 28 and to provide some additional context. We highlight some of our guidance assumptions. They are all listed in our press release, and I've covered a few of them already, so I won't cover them all here. One point worth calling out is that we target to return approximately 50% of our cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases. In fiscal '22, we will also focus on delevering. Therefore, assuming $450 million of free cash flow, excluding restructuring, we would expect our buybacks to be about 25% of that amount with the rest going to delevering. 
So wrapping up, we had strong financial performance in fiscal '21, delivered on 4 quarters of meeting our ARR and free cash flow guidance, and this was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on the expense structure. Most importantly, of course, we believe we're well positioned to deliver on the midterm targets we provided at our Investor Day last November. We're unlocking a significant multiyear catalyst by accelerating our SaaS transition, and we're also optimizing how we go to market with our digital thread and Velocity business units. I'm encouraged by how PTC continues to rapidly evolve to meet the needs of our customers. 
Moving on to Slide 29. We look forward to discussing today's news during the Q&A session and follow-up calls. Also, we will host an investor meeting on December 15 to further discuss our strategy and targets. Please save that date on your calendars. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A."

Well, Jay, you've got a lot of points there that are interesting. So let me try to hit a few of them quickly. As it relates to readiness for PLM, several years ago, we tried an experiment and began selling our retail vertical solution, PLM solution, which we call Windchill Flex PLM as cloud-only. And we went to 100% cloud sales. And frankly, that's stuck, and we've been in that model for years now. And all the transactions we've done for years now have been in the cloud. That was an interesting proof point. 
Then if you look at, it's been creeping into our mainstream sales. And in fact, before we did the SaaS acceleration, we had planned that 25% of our PLM bookings in fiscal '22 would come in cloud form. So 25% would be software in the cloud and 75% would be software, not in the cloud. And that's before we put like any incentives or muscle into it. 
So that plus the success that Arena is having, so far as I can see, Arena is the fastest-growing major PLM system in the world, and it's pure SaaS, and windchill a second. So I love having that #1 and 2 growth position. And really, cloud is driving both of them. So I just think the market is telling us we're ready. 
And in fact, customers are literally telling us to our face. We're ready. But that doesn't mean the other stuff is not important. People aren't going to buy Windchill because it's in the cloud. They're going to buy Windchill because it's the best system for things like you talked about dialing material management, variation in configuration-driven digital mockups and service life cycle management and software and systems engineering. 
That functionality is highly differentiated, and then you bring in IoT and AR and wow. So we have a highly differentiated solution that's also in the cloud, and customers are saying, we want Windchill, and increasingly, we want it in the cloud. So that's kind of where we're at. We're just reading the signals and basically saying it's time to react."

Let me comment further and then also I want to hit a second related point related to your first question, Gal. I mean, frankly, if you look at it, Creo and Windchill, which are over $1 billion now of ARR, have churn rates much better than the company average. And the other businesses that are growing faster, generally are less than the higher churn rates than the company average, and you average those together and you get the company average. 
But the thing is all of these growth businesses are themselves improving their churn rates quarter by quarter, year by year. And that's why we keep averaging down toward Creo and Windchill. So there's more where this came from, for sure, as it relates to churn improvement, and we expect to see it continue to come. 
And then back on the growth assumptions, what I wanted to say, I used this phrase more pathways to mid-teens growth. I think in the past, like, let's say, at our Investor Day last year, our recipe for mid-teens growth sort of had FSG flat using the own categories, FSG flat. We needed growth to be kind of at least close to double digits -- I'm sorry, we need the core business to be close to double digits, and then we needed really a 3 handle on the growth business. 
And now you say, well, wait a minute, if the growth business, even if it had a 2 handle, if the core business remains in low double digits or even perhaps a couple of points higher than that, you don't really need a 3 handle on the growth business anymore. So sort of like if everything works, we can do even better. But now we have room for 1 or 2 things, not to work quite as well as we wanted and still get to respectable growth numbers. And even if we don't get to the mid-teens growth numbers with higher margins, we can still get to the cash flow number. So we feel like we've taken a more conservative posture. We still think all this stuff can work, but now it doesn't all have to work simultaneously for us to deliver some good numbers."

We need to launch everything. We need to start the sales cycles, then we need to close the orders. 
And if you put 6- to 9-month sales cycles on things, and we're not exactly sure how long it will take, but 6 to 9 months lands you in Q3 or Q4 already. And so we just not sure then when the start dates might be and all that type of stuff. So we're fairly conservative about the cloud impact to fiscal '22, but quite bullish about it to fiscal '23, '24, '25 and beyond. 
The other thing is, as we've said, we're a little bit conservative, more so than in past years as it relates to Rockwell.

The stuff that happens after the customer buys. And we're doing that not by this reducing capability, but by simply implementing a much more efficient model with many less silos, much less management involved and so forth. So that's all goodness. 
There are other places we'll have efficiencies, like -- let me give you an example. If you belong to a field organization, you work in technical support, your mission is to make the customer happy even if it means solving the same problem dozens or hundreds of times quickly. If you are the part of the product organization, your goal is to go back and talk to the product guys and tell them, make this product go away in the SaaS offering quickly so that no other customers are even aware that it ever did exist. So you can see there's like real efficiencies in terms of like how you solve customer problems? Are you trying to make them happy while they have the problem and repeat that hundreds and thousands of times? Or are you trying to make the problem go away so that the rest of the customers never knew it happened? Just to summarize. These are great efficiencies that we're going to go pursue."

I think if you look at the different classes of partners, it affects them differently. Let's start with Microsoft elated about this, as you might expect because it will bring a lot of business their way. If you look at Rockwell, Rockwell, too, is leaning into SaaS. And frankly, all of our SaaS products are easier for Rockwell to digest and to deliver on to their customers, then would be the on-premise variant. So I think Rockwell quite likes the strategy and maybe some of their own thinking about SaaS was born in our boardroom. I don't know. You'd have to ask Blake that, but I might speculate. 
And then I think like if you look at our resellers, it will change the world a little bit. They still need to go sell the software. They won't be as involved in delivering it, but then they're very much involved in the implementation of it at the customer side. So I don't want you to think as it relates to resellers or SIs that SaaS companies don't have SI partners. I mean, my God, Salesforce has a massive SI ecosystem. They just don't install software and perform upgrades at the customer site. They do system integration, they do adoption. They do business process transformation. They do all that stuff, which still has to happen. So that's kind of long term. 
I think SIs have to take the sort of posture they have relative to Salesforce and all those other SaaS companies, which we'll help them through, and the bigger ones like Accenture already know that play. 
And then for the smaller resellers, the other thing worth noting is that most of our resellers sell Creo and Kepware, and those products are sort of further out on the SaaS road map anyway. So that would be several years down the road before we even really come to that bridge."

But let me first kind of redefine pricing uplift, so we don't confuse anybody. We will deliver more value to the customer and they will pay us more for that value while saving money on their side above and beyond. So is that a pricing increase? I don't know. It's a value increase. And that could drive a tremendous amount of business. 
If Creo and Windchill are $1 billion, and you could double $750 million of that over a decade, with that $750 million of more value delivered to the customer base and monetized. However, what we're seeing with Arena and to a degree with Windchill is we have the cloudiest, SaaS solutions in the market, and that does help take share. Every piece of business that Arena is winning, they're taken from somebody else or it's a start-up company that they're winning at somebody else's expense. And Arena is the fastest-growing PLM solution in the market right now. 
So I do think it's both. And exactly what the balance will be, I don't know. I do think monetizing the customer base by delivering more value is a high probability, and it will drive a lot of growth by itself."

And we think that our products, Creo, Windchill, ThingWorx, Vuforia Instruct, work beautifully together, like voices in acquire. They make beautiful music together. And rather than selling these things separately, yes, we can use them all as entry points, but let's pursue entry points that then can be upsold and cross sold. 
And so I think Troy Richardson, was one of the first people to sort of ask, why don't you guys configure differently us guys now that he's here, but why don't we configure differently and go like pursue this harder, this cross-sell motion.

And think of it that they're coming in at one margin, and what our goal is, is to make improvements behind the scenes that take them to another margin even at the same cost to the customer. So whether it's single tenant, multi-tenant, I mean if you're the customer on the customer end, you don't even know. But we, on the PDC end, we see the efficiencies we're gaining or not gaining, we do know. And so a lot of our investment is aimed at making the product more efficient for PDC to deliver as opposed to different from the UC Gen at the customer side. 
Now that said, if you look what we did with the subscription program, we pulled every lever we could come up with. If you remember that program when we used to talk about it, we used to say, I don't know, Kristian Talvitie. Kristian actually was the program executive. We had like 28 work streams and 300 people working on it. We changed pricing and packaging to favor subscription over at the time, perpetual. We paid more commission on a perpetual deal. We had certain offerings that were only -- I'm sorry, we paid more commission. I said that wrong on a subscription deal. We paid -- we had certain offerings that were only available, certain attractive sexy offerings, including the ANSYS stuff, by the way, there was only available subscription. So we basically stacked the deck in every customer conversation in a way that everybody wanted it to go subscription. We got the band back together. We're putting the same program together.

There will be solutions that are more focused on digital performance management of a fleet of products out in the field at customer sites.

So yes, it's a very different sales motion. I mean, number one, we're selling to executives, not selling to developers. Number two, we're selling business value, not speeds and feeds, technical stuff. And I think it's really where we wanted to take this business for a while. So I'm very pleased with this solution. It took us a while to develop it, as I said, but it's a powerful piece of software, and it really gives us kind of a new platform to build on going forward with IoT. 
It makes IoT, if I could, a lot like how we sell PLM. We sell PLM to executives based on business value. We were selling IoT to developers as a toolkit. And now we'll sell PLM and DPM as business value to executives. Different executives, mind you, but executives.

So in closing, I mean, we're in a great place. I really like PTC setup going forward. The changes we announced are good for growth. They're good for profitability. They're going to put us in a stronger position to hit both the top line and bottom line targets that we have out there. So we're looking forward to continuing the discussion with you on follow-up calls at investor conferences. I'm going to be at the Berenberg conference, at least virtually next week or I guess it's 2 weeks out maybe. No, it's next week. And we look forward to seeing you at our investor meeting on December 15. 
So thanks, everybody, and have a good evening."

No doubt, there will be follow-up interest, so we've also scheduled our Annual Investor Day in mid-December, and we expect to be active on the IR circuit in the weeks ahead. 
Starting then with Slide 4. Given the news, we're going to follow a somewhat different agenda for today's call. I'm going to start with highlights of our Q4 and fiscal 2021 performance, then I'll take you through an abbreviated version of our product line results. Next, Kristian will complete our discussion of Q4 and fiscal '21 with his financial reviews. Then turning to the future, I'll address the changes we announced today, which are designed to accelerate our SaaS transition and margin expansion. Following that, Kristian will take you through our go-forward guidance and reporting structure. We've reserved extra time for your questions at the end. 
Moving to Slide 5. Q4 was an outstanding quarter for PTC, and it capped off another strong year. We came in at the high end of our guidance for ARR growth, and we exceeded our free cash flow guidance. Despite the pandemic, every part of the business performed well in fiscal '21, with growth in every product line and in every geography. Fiscal '21 was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit organic ARR growth, and we're guiding for fiscal '22 to be the fifth. Furthermore, by continuing our strong focus on operational discipline, we've been able to translate our top line growth into strong bottom line free cash flow performance. Kristian will take you through free cash flow in more detail later in the call. 
Taking a look at the key factors driving our top line performance and turning to Slide 6. Our Q4 bookings results were outstanding. Bookings were up mid-teens organically and high teens overall from the blockbuster Q4 we had a year ago. Remember that in Q4 of fiscal '20, bookings bounced back sharply, following a downturn in Q2 and Q3 during the depths of the pandemic. Surpassing last year's strong Q4 number is a great accomplishment. 
Bookings were strong across all product lines and geographies. Because Q4 of fiscal '20 had been such an outlier, our planned targeted Q4 '21 organic bookings to be roughly flat to last year's number. Creo was slightly above plan, while everything else was well above. FSG and Onshape led the way with bookings growth of more than 90% and 70%, respectively. 
IoT and AR bookings were both up mid-teens year-over-year to record levels for each, with IoT bookings growing more than 120% sequentially, while AR bookings grew more than 60% sequentially. PLM bookings were up high single digits year-over-year. Keep in mind that a good percentage of our Q4 bookings, especially those done later in the quarter, don't start until October or later. So they end up in what we used to call backlog, but now call deferred ARR. Deferred ARR ended the year at $20 million above the original plan we had for fiscal '21. So in summary, not only did we hit the high end of our fiscal '21 ARR guidance range by delivering 12 points of organic ARR growth, we also booked about 1.5 points more growth in the deferred ARR, which will benefit future periods. 
Turning to ARR on Slide 7. On a top line basis, fiscal '21 was a big success. In Q4, we came in at 12% organic ARR, excluding Arena, and 16% ARR growth overall. 
Looking at our core products in Q4, we continued to deliver market-leading growth. Creo came in at low double-digit growth, while Windchill grew mid-teens. According to data published by Jay Vleeschhouwer, Creo and Windchill have significantly outperformed Siemens' and Dassault's CAD and PLM businesses lately, as they are relatively flat with 2019, while we're up more than 20%. We've been seeing the solid growth trend in our core CAD and PLM business for years now, and we expect this to continue. I'll come back to this important point during the second part of my prepared remarks. 
Next, looking at our growth products. IoT grew mid-teens, coming in below our target. However, bookings were strong in Q4, and we expect stronger ARR growth in fiscal '22, following bookings momentum and the launch of our new Digital Performance Management Solution. Vuforia AR, Vuforia augmented reality, grew mid-teens, which is better than it sounds when you factor in that this growth came on top of very strong 77% growth in our previous Q4 that we're comparing against. I'm happy with the roughly 40% CAGR over the past 2 years. In fiscal '22, we are positioned to continue good growth in AR based on our bookings momentum. 
Onshape grew over 50%. It's now been 2 years since we acquired Onshape, and we're very pleased with the acquisition and the progress made by the Onshape team. Arena grew over 20%. This represents good acceleration from mid-teens preacquisition growth rates, driven by go-to-market investments we made, coupled with synergies gained by being part of PTC. 
Turning to FSG. Growth was 6%, primarily driven by strong performance of our systems and software engineering offerings where we benefited from several large deals. 
Turning to Slide 8. While Creo and Windchill are powerful independently, these products generate even more value when leveraged together. A great example of this integrated story can be found in our recent announcement that the entire Volvo Group will adopt PTC's Creo product as their primary CAD solution, mirroring what they did several years ago with our Windchill PLM solution. This is a big competitive displacement for Creo. 
In addition, our ANSYS-powered Creo Simulation Live technology, together with Creo ANSYS Simulation, continues to drive customer interest in simulation. I've been saying for some time that as the product system of record, PLM is a critical element of any manufacturing company's digital transformation strategy. This is exactly what led to our largest ever PLM order in Q4 of '21, a multiyear committed ramp deal coming from a large global medical device company. This too was a competitive displacement for Windchill. In PLM, we saw average deal sizes increasing with numerous expansions in the quarter. 
In IoT, this past week, we launched our Digital Performance Management, or DPM solution, at our manufacturing live event. If you missed the event, by the way, you can find the replay on our Investor website. DPM is our new solution designed to be a comprehensive turnkey out-of-the-box solution that addresses our customers' biggest IoT value creation opportunities. It will be the perfect antidote to the so-called pilot purgatory problem the IoT industry has been discussing. 
You may have also noted separately the press release announcing that PTC is the only industrial IoT player recognized as a leader by all 4 major industry analyst firms. Also in the IoT space, Microsoft yesterday officially launched its cloud for manufacturing, and we're thrilled to be a lead partner. Our alliance with Microsoft continues to go well with Q4 being our best quarter to date in terms of co-selling with Microsoft. 
Vuforia delivered a healthy mix of expansions, cross-sell and net new logos. We landed our largest ever AR order from a large pharmaceutical company, which will use Vuforia to deliver augmented digital work instructions to improve the speed and quality of production line changeovers. 
Also, with all the buzz you hear about metaverse these days, you might enjoy watching the amazing live industrial metaverse demonstration that our CTO, Steve Dertien, and I delivered as part of our manufacturing live keynote using our Vuforia Spatial Toolbox technology. 
If you look carefully at the graphic on the right side of Slide 8, that is Steve and I standing in front of our anonymized digital representations whose movement in activity is being measured and analyzed in real time. This is a peak into our concept of digital Taylorism, named after the famous work of Frederick Taylor, who was the father of industrial engineering more than 100 years ago. 
Turning now to Onshape and Arena on Slide 9. Onshape performance has been driven by strong win rates against competitors, coupled with solid expansion rates. Onshape captured nearly 1,000 new logos in fiscal '21. 
During the year, churn improved by 10 points while net retention improved by 15 points, and these metrics now look quite strong compared to similar-sized SaaS peers of all types. Naturally, smaller companies have been drawn to Onshape because its lightweight SaaS footprint enables agile hardware development processes. But thanks to 17 more product releases during the past year, Onshape's maturing functionality also led to several significant orders in Q4 from larger companies in the robotics and medical device fields who love the product for similar reasons. The amazing adoption that Onshape experienced in the education market in fiscal '21 is icing on the cake. It contributed little to the financials, but sets the stage for mass adoption by the next-generation workforce in future years. 
Arena saw numerous expansions driving larger deal sizes, too. Arena is also proving to be a great acquisition. Like Onshape, Arena is the cloud-native market leader in PLM with particular strength in tech-centric markets such as electronics and medical devices. We're on track with the integration plan that we laid out for the acquisition of Arena with new sales capacity coming online in the U.S. and Europe. The combination of Onshape and Arena makes PTC the clear market leader in cloud-native PLM and CAD solutions, and these offerings make a great pairing for fast-moving high-tech manufacturers who want to develop hardware using the same agile process methodology as software. 
Next, Slide 10 shows our geographic ARR performance. Americas was up 19%, led by double-digit growth in core products and Arena; Europe was up 13%, led by high single digit in core products; low 40s growth in growth products and double-digit growth in FSG; and APAC was up 17%, led by mid-teens growth in core products and low 30s growth in growth products. 
There are thousands of people at PTC that contributed to our outstanding fiscal '21, and I'd like to say thank you to all of them. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Kristian to complete the portion of today's call, focused on Q4 and fiscal '21."

Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance later in the discussion, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. So turning to Slide 12.",847,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance later in the discussion, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. 
So turning to Slide 12. We delivered ARR growth at the high end of our guidance range. Fiscal '21 ARR of $1.47 billion increased 16% year-over-year. Excluding Arena, ARR growth was 12%. FX was a small $4 million headwind in fiscal '21 for us. 
As Jim highlighted earlier, our bookings were very strong in Q4. With this, we had an uptick -- within this, we had an uptick in ramp deals, and that's why our bookings performance did not result in even stronger ARR growth. Instead, the vast majority of our bookings upside went into deferred ARR that will benefit future periods, primarily fiscal '23 and beyond. 
Organic churn improved approximately 130 basis points year-over-year, slightly ahead of our guidance for approximately 100 basis points of improvement, primarily driven by strong execution in CAD, PLM, FSG as well as modest continued improvement in both IoT and AR. 
Fiscal '21 free cash flow of $344 million grew 61% year-over-year and was slightly above our guidance. Note that our free cash flow for the year included an unforecasted $18 million outflow related to a foreign tax dispute, $15 million in acquisition-related fees and $15 million in restructuring payments. These onetime headwinds were offset by other onetime tailwinds, including some onetime tax benefits, Arena working capital versus original expectations. Improvements in AR aging also helped drive a onetime uptick in free cash flow in '21. 
Fiscal '21 revenue of $1.81 billion increased 24% year-over-year, as reported, or 20% in constant currency and was above guidance. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606. So in Q4 and throughout fiscal '21 longer-than-anticipated contract durations and support to subscription conversions positively impacted the amount of upfront subscription revenue recognized in the quarter and in the year. 
I'd like to remind you that over the long term, ARR and recurring revenue growth rates should be approximately the same. However, in any period, revenue is subject to much more volatility due to ASC 606, which is why we feel that ARR, our annual run rate, which is also a very close proxy for subscription billings, is the true and better indicator of PTC's growth. 
In fiscal '21, non-GAAP operating margins were 35% and increased approximately 610 basis points over fiscal '20. This was due to the strong revenue performance I just mentioned as well as maintaining good discipline on our operating expense structure. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $3.97 increased 58% year-over-year and was above guidance. I'd like to point out that our GAAP results reflect a gain of $69 million related to our investment in Matterport, which we mark-to-market. And as you may recall, Matterport went public and began trading on July 23. In addition, our GAAP results also included the release of $137 million valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and a tax benefit of $42 million related to the Arena acquisition. 
Moving to the next slide. Another way to think about PTC's performance is using the cash flow model we often share. And as you can see here on Slide 13, ARR plus perpetual revenue, plus professional services revenue equaled our cash generation, which was $1.455 billion, which is up about $200 million over fiscal '20. 
You can also see the total expenses of $1.173 billion. This was up about $138 million over fiscal '20, which leads to a net cash contribution margin of $473 million with an increase of about $62 million. Or if you think about cash contribution margin as a proxy for cash EBITDA, we delivered a 29% cash contribution margin, and this was up about 100 basis points compared to fiscal '20. In this format you can see most of the onetime headwinds and tailwinds I discussed earlier are below the line, in terms of cash tax headwinds and tailwinds, M&A-related expenses, improvements in aging, which actually resulted in net positive working capital in fiscal '21, which one would normally expect to be negative in a growing business. 
Moving to Slide 14. I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended with fiscal '21 with cash and cash equivalents of $327 million. In addition, we had medium-term investments of $78 million, primarily related to our investment in Matterport. Our gross debt was $1.45 billion with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.2%. During Q4, we paid down $40 million on our revolving credit facility, and we also made our $19 million semiannual bond interest payment. With our leverage ratio now less than 3x, which we told you was our goal, we resumed our share repurchase program. The $30 million of cash we used to repurchase shares in Q4 was approximately equal to our free cash flow generation in the quarter. All in all, Q4 wrapped up a solid year for PTC from both an ARR and a free cash flow perspective. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

PTC is at an exciting point in our history. Despite bumpy macro conditions, we have established a 4-year track record of double-digit top line organic growth based on a recurring revenue model and driven by widely recognized technology leadership positions in an industry increasingly motivated by digital transformation. In parallel, our decade-long track record of strong operational discipline has driven our margins up, enabling us to benefit significantly from leverage as we scale. You see that in the 61% free cash flow growth I highlighted at the start of the call.
Given the strength of our financial performance in fiscal '21, the restructuring we announced today might come as a surprise to some of you, but sit tight because I think you will like what we're doing. For some time now, I've been telling investors about our plans to leverage the Atlas platform that we acquired with Onshape to pivot the whole company toward a SaaS future. As I had previously discussed it, much of the upside benefits of the SaaS pivot would come in fiscal '24 and beyond. 
Many of you have asked, why wouldn't we invest more to get to that SaaS upside more quickly? Frankly, that was a good question and one that we thought long and hard about. We even hired McKinsey to help us think through it and develop a strategy. Today, I will explain how, thanks to the changes we're making, we will invest substantially more in our SaaS initiatives while actually decreasing our overall run rate spending projection significantly. 
Let me hit the financial summary first on Slide 16, and then explain the strategy and operational changes behind it. In terms of the financial view of the restructuring, we are reducing our spending run rate by approximately $60 million compared to fiscal '21 as we improve the efficiency of our organizational structure. 
We've also eliminated about $30 million of previously contemplated new spending run rate from our fiscal '22 plans. So compared to the plan for fiscal '22 that existed prior to the restructuring, we now have -- we now expect to reduce our planned fiscal '22 run rate spending by approximately $9 million. And then reinvest about half of that into initiatives that accelerate our transition to SaaS, with the other half falling to the bottom line. 
Key SaaS investments will be used to increase capacity on Atlas, to accelerate work to adopt Atlas into our core products and to operate those products as SaaS, and into Onshape and Arena product development and sales capacity. Despite what will be a very significant investment, we expect to expand cash margins by approximately 400 basis points in FY '22. So we are accelerating both growth and margin expansion at the same time. 
Restructuring-related cash outflows are expected to be approximately $50 million to $55 million, with about 2/3 occurring in the first half of '22, and the majority of the remaining payments to be made in Q3. In other words, the restructuring will obscure the great cash flow progress for the next 2 or 3 quarters, but the benefits will start shining through after that. Already by Q4 of fiscal '22, we should be seeing a net free cash flow tailwind as a consequence of the restructuring. Then, as Kristian will outline, fiscal '23 and beyond will look great. 
Let's go to Slide 17, and I'll start by explaining why a SaaS pivot is so interesting to PTC. There are 3 reasons why we think now is the time for PTC to align with and invest more in the SaaS transition. First, the industrial software market wants to go to SaaS. COVID has greatly amplified the interest in SaaS. PTC is already the recognized SaaS leader in our industry. Onshape and Arena have proven what's possible, and they've dramatically elevated PTC's credibility. We are far ahead of competitors in terms of understanding what SaaS is and what it is not. Customers are looking for PTC to lead the whole industry through a transition to SaaS. 
Second, based on growing customer demand, we see the need to accelerate SaaS initiatives while better aligning with SaaS best practices in order to meet the needs of the market. The investments we're making now will allow us to play offense to capture the market demand. 
Third, we believe our new SaaS strategy will accelerate a major growth driver for PTC, giving us more pathways to mid-teens growth in the midterm and helping to derisk our growth ambitions. Meanwhile, cost savings from the restructuring itself are expected to derisk our free cash flow growth targets, even if the growth should prove slower to materialize than I expect. 
Turning to Slide 18. Owning the industry's only cloud native CAD and PLM combo has been a big advantage. By comparing how our Onshape and Arena businesses work, as compared to the balance of PTC, we can see that certain ways in which PTC has been organized are quite inefficient. At the same time, we see an opportunity to serve customers better, too, and that's why we're choosing to evolve our organization to be more SaaS like. 
I'd like to review several of the larger changes. Previously, in addition to working with sales, our customers would have more than a half dozen touch points across our broad customer success organization, including renewal sales, presales, post-sales consulting, customer success management, technical support, our cloud organization, a group called customer experience and others. 
In comparison, most SaaS companies have a 2 in-the-box model, where each customer has just 1 sales and 1 customer success contact. Not only is PTC's current model inefficient, perhaps more importantly, customers hate being repeatedly passed from 1 contact to another as they proceed through their journey with PTC. So we are reconfiguring to deploy the same two-in-a-box model that SaaS companies utilize. 
This reconfiguration has no impact on the sales side of the equation. In fact, we're adding direct quota-carrying capacity into the current model. Aside from where we expand coverage, the vast majority of customers will retain the same sales contacts they know and love today. The bigger change for the customer will be that they now have 1 customer success contact rather than many. There's nothing but goodness here for everybody. Customers prefer this model, and it will save PTC a lot of money as it is much more scalable. 
The other major change is on the product development, delivery and support side. With Onshape and Arena, or any true SaaS company, this is all done by a single organization using modern DevOps practices. But within the core PTC product lines, the development, cloud delivery and technical support organizations have been entirely separate, with the latter 2 belonging to the field organization. You simply can't get to SaaS that way. 
As part of our reorganization, we have merged our cloud delivery and technical support groups into the product organization to mirror the modern SaaS practices deployed by Onshape and Arena and everybody else in the SaaS world. This, too, will create significant operating efficiencies and a much improved customer experience at the same time. Nothing but goodness here, too. 
To better understand the demand drivers, let's take a look at an illustrative value proposition on Slide 19, typical of what customers see in the transition from on-premise to SaaS. For every dollar a customer pays PTC or any other vendor for on-prem PLM, they have an estimated additional $2 to $3 in cost of ownership associated with on-premise servers and storage, system administrators plus SIs who help with on-site installations and upgrades and all that. Their total cost of ownership can be $3 to $4. When the deployment, maintenance and delivery responsibility for the software is shifted back to PTC, we can leverage significant efficiencies to serve that same functionality back to the customer for roughly an incremental dollar at margins that are attractive to us. Therefore, each dollar of on-premise software, ARR today represents potentially $2 of future SaaS ARR for PTC plus a savings of $1 or $2 for the customer. 
The customer also gets to enjoy the many other benefits of SaaS. It is device agnostic. It's ideal for a hybrid work environment, data shared with employees and suppliers in real time, plus no more upgrades to do as everyone is always on the latest version. This value proposition for SaaS is not really new news to any of you, it's what Marc Benioff at Salesforce.com has been espousing for 2 decades now. More than half of the overall commercial software industry has already made this pivot. But that's not yet the case in our world of industrial software, where SaaS has low single-digit penetration. 
As Salesforce did in CRM, some company will have to lead the way to SaaS in the CAD and PLM industry. We think the time is right for industrial companies to move to SaaS, and PTC is best positioned to lead that transition. 
Turning to Slide 20. We've been delivering more and more new PLM projects as SaaS in recent years, as customer preference has shifted there. But going forward, we'll make SaaS our primary delivery model and deliver on-premise only when required by the customer. But we also have a large existing customer base with on-premise systems. In order for existing customers to get to SaaS, each customer has to go through a lift and shift process. This process entails lifting the on-premise deployment, upgrading and decustomizing it as necessary to eliminate technical debt, and then shifting it into the PTC cloud from where we can serve it back to the customer as a service. We plan to focus the lift and shift program first in Windchill, where the biggest opportunity lies, and bring Creo and other products into the fold in subsequent phases over time. 
So you may be wondering, well, how will this help to accelerate growth? The answer is that our organizational changes and the associated wave of investment enable us to scale up to make SaaS the default for new sales and to start the lift and shift process now here in fiscal '22. Though the value proposition for transitioning to SaaS is sound, we still have to go through a sales cycle with each customer. Returning the sales teams [ flows ] now with this proposition, and we expect the first projects to begin showing up in the back half of fiscal '22. 
The Windchill SaaS capability will be deployed into Azure and into the manufacturing cloud at that. So Microsoft is eager to help us sell this proposition. I'd like to think of this project as the last upgrade for each customer because when the lift and shift project is done, then PTC will take it forward further. Therefore, a good time to sell this program is whenever customers start planning their next upgrade. Customers tend to upgrade Windchill systems once every 2 or 3 years, so we get a shot at a good portion of the base each year and expect success to accelerate in fiscal '23 and beyond. 
There are thousands of Windchill deployments out there, so I anticipate this process will take numerous years, perhaps a decade, and we won't get them all. Naturally, we'll focus first on the most ready customers and work on the long tail further out. In the end, I expect we'll ultimately get about 75% of the customers to transition, and we'll continue to offer on-premise variance of the product, born of the same code stream on an indefinite basis for those who do not want SaaS. 
PTC is all in on SaaS. The program we're launching is a major cross-sale effort on par with the highly successful [ subscription ] program. We executed the move from perpetual to where we are today with 98% of our software revenue now being subscription. Like that subscription program, the SaaS transition program involves numerous changes to our offerings, to our pricing and packaging, to compensation and more. 
We have the same program leader driving it. An important difference though is that the SaaS transition program is all about growth acceleration within the recurring software business model we currently have in place, which means we will not have the same so-called valley of death effect that our cash flow went back -- went through back then. Now we'll have all of the gain, but none of that pain. Taking you deeper into the elements of this program will be a key agenda topic at our December Investor Day. 
One last related change we're making is to organize into 2 main business units, as shown on Slide 21. With plans to leverage SaaS now in place and underway across the entire company, it no longer makes sense to have a SaaS business unit per se. Therefore, we plan to reunite Vuforia AR with the CAD PLM and IoT product lines into a business unit designed to promote higher levels of cross-selling across this integrated product portfolio. This new business unit, which focuses on the digital transformation driver, will be all about growing the base and leading them to SaaS. It will be called the Digital Thread business unit to reflect the highly integrated nature of its portfolio of products. 
Troy Richardson, who's been our Chief Operating Officer for the past year, is being promoted to become President of this business unit. Troy has already been managing the go-to-market side of these businesses, but now the product development arm will report to him as well to drive [ title liman ]. Naturally, I'll stay involved in the technology road map, because as you probably know, that's where my passion lies. You'll get more time with Troy Richardson at the upcoming Investor Day. 
Onshape and Arena will remain together under their current President, Mike DiTullio. This will be called the Velocity business unit to reflect that the cloud-native pure SaaS value proposition of Onshape and Arena, it's most attractive to companies who want to deploy agile product development processes and move fast. This business unit is all about disrupting the competition and landing new logos, which, in many cases, are SME customers. But we're seeing larger companies being drawn to Onshape and Arena solutions too, because their existing vendor simply doesn't have anything that compares. Companies like Garrett Motion, for example, the $4 billion automotive turbocharger company we profiled at our fiscal '20 Investor Day last year, who switched to Onshape from a high-end CAD competitor to gain increased business velocity. You'll have more time with Mike DiTullio, too, at the Investor Day. Both business unit Presidents report to me. I'll help drive their respective strategies, while Troy and Mike preside over the operating cadence of each business unit. 
A related change is that the Atlas platform will move under our very capable CTO, Steve Dertien, who will develop the shared platform to meet the needs of both units. Steve will continue to report to me. 
I know that was a lot of information to take in. Turning to Slide 22. Let me summarize, and then I'll hand it back to Kristian for more specific go-forward guidance. First, from a top line perspective, our SaaS acceleration pivot unlocks another powerful multiyear growth catalyst for PTC and our shareholders. Exiting fiscal '21, Creo and Windchill together represent more than $1 billion of ARR, growing double digits organically. This growth pattern has been in place for 4 years now, right through the pandemic with the strong performance driven by the role both products play in the digital transformation strategies of industrial companies. 
With the SaaS program that we're launching, we're layering an additional growth driver into this core business that we expect could last a decade. Therefore, in our core business, we see double-digit ARR growth being sustainable well into the future. Together with the growth drivers in IoT and AR, plus Onshape and Arena, we're creating more pathways to drive ARR growth to the mid-teens. In my view, PTC's growth story is alive and well. 
Second, from a bottom line perspective, the strategic improvements we're making will drive up our cash contribution margins considerably and help derisk our cash flow targets under a broader range of ARR growth scenarios. Kristian will expand on this. 
Given our confidence in growth, coupled with the higher margins, we remain committed to the midterm free cash flow targets that we set at our Investor Day last year. Recall that our guidance was for midterm free cash flow growth of approximately 25% to 30%. After we get beyond the restructuring payments, we expect to perform in that range, perhaps earlier than you might have expected. 
Our guidance for fiscal '22 assumes we'll get a small positive impact from the SaaS transition in the back half of the fiscal year, which is counterbalanced by slower assumed growth rates in FSG and somewhat conservative assumptions we have around Rockwell's contribution as they work their way through the Flex integration. Let me be clear that our commitment to the partnership with Rockwell remains as strong as ever, and that we're energized to work together because of the great potential we see ahead. In particular, we see tremendous potential for the DPM [Audio Gap]"

Jim did a good job of outlining the many pathways we have to getting to these targets with the SaaS opportunity in both the Velocity and core businesses with the addition of solutions to the portfolio, starting with DPM, coupled with the general strength of the existing portfolio.

So back to the financial guidance and go-forward reporting structure. First, let me reiterate how exciting a time this is for PTC. The restructuring we're going through right now is really the single biggest thematic investment PTC has made that I can remember. This reorganization is designed to better align PTC to our SaaS future and as an interesting consequence, it should also derisk our path to delivering on the midterm ARR and cash flow growth targets we discussed at our Investor Day last November. 
So starting with guidance on Slide 24. We continue to target getting to mid-teens ARR growth in the midterm. Jim did a good job outlining many of the pathways we have to getting to these targets with the SaaS opportunity in both the Velocity and core businesses; with the addition of solutions to the portfolio, starting with DPM; coupled with the general strength of the existing portfolio. More specifically, for fiscal '22, we expect ARR of $1.615 billion to $1.66 billion. That's a growth rate of 10% to 13% on a constant currency basis, following 4 consecutive years of double-digit ARR growth. It's also worth mentioning that we expect continued churn improvement in fiscal '22 and are targeting another 100 basis point improvement. 
From a linearity perspective, we would again expect flattish ARR growth throughout the year on a constant currency basis. So using the midpoint of guidance, that would imply about 11.5% ARR growth each quarter. Obviously, this can fluctuate given bookings performance, start dates, et cetera, but we believe we provided for that within the range outlined. 
The one thing worth pointing out is that ARR growth in Q1 of '22 is expected to be approximately 15%, since Q1 '21 did not include ARR for Arena. In order to help with the modeling, we've provided historical constant currency performance in the data tables on the website, and I'll touch more on this in a little bit. 
Turning to cash flow. We also continue to target approximately 25% to 30% annual free cash flow growth over the midterm. For fiscal '22, specifically, we're guiding for free cash flow of approximately $400 million. As a consequence of the restructuring, we're expecting cash outflows of approximately $50 million to $55 million with approximately 2/3 occurring in the first half and the majority of the remaining payments to be made in Q3. Excluding restructuring, our expected free cash flow in fiscal '22 would be approximately $450 million, representing 25% growth compared to the $359 million we generated in fiscal '21 on the same basis. So doing some directional math and using round numbers on the midterm targets, this means we would expect free cash flow in the $550 million to $600 million range in fiscal '23 and would expect $700 million to $750 million of free cash flow in fiscal '24. 
Regarding the linearity of free cash flow in fiscal '22, excluding restructuring, we expect to see a similar pattern as in fiscal '21 with more than 60% of free cash flow generation in the first half of the year. Collections are stronger in the first half, and we expect expenses to increase as we ramp hiring and our SaaS investments throughout the year. 
As Jim discussed, the restructuring not only creates strategic improvements in how we're organized, but also enhances our profitability profile. So we believe we'll be able to deliver strong free cash flow growth, even if we don't accelerate the ARR. I'll come back to this point on the next slide. 
And finally, turning to revenue guidance. For fiscal '22, we're expecting revenue of $1.85 billion to $1.98 billion, which corresponds to a growth rate of 2% to 9% on an as-reported basis or 4% to 11% on a constant currency basis. 
ASC 606 makes revenue fairly difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range. Note that revenue has no impact on ARR or free cash flow as we continue to primarily bill customers annually upfront. And again, over the longer term, we expect recurring revenue growth to align with ARR growth, particularly as we transition the company to SaaS and evolve towards increasingly ratable revenue recognition. 
So moving on to Slide 25. Using the same free cash flow model we showed earlier, so this slide illustrates a directional view of what fiscal '22 could look like, assuming the approximate midpoint of our ARR guidance range. ARR here grows at approximately 11.5%. Cash generation is up $170 million. We see continued growth in expenses. But given the new operating model, as Jim pointed out earlier, our cash contribution margin expands almost 400 basis points. Said differently, the new operating model is expected to add more than $120 million of cash contribution margin versus the $60 million plus we added last year on similar to slightly less ARR growth. 
On the expense front, as Jim mentioned, we're reducing spending in certain areas to fund investments to accelerate our SaaS transition. Additionally, there are some other items that will impact OpEx this year, such as the accounting for commissions, which is impacted by ASC 606, increased travel, merit and so on. 
So as far as the P&L is concerned, the net result is that we're guiding for fiscal '22 non-GAAP operating expense to grow by approximately 3% at the midpoint of guidance, which is certainly lower than the 50% of our targeted ARR growth for the year, even though we're significantly increasing our SaaS-related spending. 
On an organic basis, factoring in the Arena acquisition, which closed in Q2 of fiscal '21, we actually expect non-GAAP OpEx growth to be closer to 2% at the midpoint of the ARR range. 
We also have a modest $5 million uptick in CapEx this year. OIE cash taxes remain approximately flat, and we see some expansion in the other category which is really the restructuring charge and change in working capital as the business grows. 
Moving to Slide 26. As you know, we currently present our ARR and revenue in 3 product categories: core, FSG and growth. Going forward, as Jim explained, we'll have 2 business units, Digital Thread and Velocity. So to align our reporting with how we look at the business, we'll be changing our ARR and revenue reporting buckets accordingly.  
Digital Thread will consist of core FSG and also IoT and AR from the current growth products. And when we report Digital Thread going forward, we'll provide the detailed split 1 level below. On the slide, the categories in bold text on the left represent our current disclosure. The categories on the right in bold green text represent our go-forward disclosure. And Velocity will consist of Onshape and Arena from the current growth products. 
Slide 27 shows what the recast ARR data looks like. I won't spend a lot of time on this as we published 3 years of historical ARR and revenue data in our new format within the financial data tables filed on the IR website. There are a couple of points I would make. First, please note that all of the historical constant currency ARR figures have been calculated using our fiscal '22 plan FX rates. Second, in addition to the Digital Thread and Velocity recast, we did a small recast of a portion of our Vuforia AR business, which removes approximately $6 million of ARR in both fiscal '21 and fiscal '20 and $5 million in fiscal '19. 
We made this change because we've come to realize there are certain buyers with marketing-oriented use cases who purchased Vuforia engine for short-term promotions without a true intention to use it on a recurring basis. The bulk of the Vuforia suite is unaffected and will continue to be sold on a recurring basis. We adjusted the historical amounts to enable go-forward comparability. 
And then lastly, just in terms of expectations for fiscal '22, starting with the Digital Thread core, we are targeting fiscal '22 ARR growth of 10% to 12%. This is consistent with our historical performance for Digital Thread growth. We're targeting fiscal '22 ARR growth accelerating back into the 20%-plus range. For Digital Thread FSG, we target fiscal '22 ARR growth of approximately flattish, again, consistent with historical performance and expectations. So in total, for Digital Thread, we're targeting ARR growth of 10% to 12%. For Velocity, we're targeting fiscal '22 ARR growth in the 20-plus percent range, given the strength of both Arena and Onshape. 
Moving on to Slide 28 and to provide some additional context. We highlight some of our guidance assumptions. They are all listed in our press release, and I've covered a few of them already, so I won't cover them all here. One point worth calling out is that we target to return approximately 50% of our cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases. In fiscal '22, we will also focus on delevering. Therefore, assuming $450 million of free cash flow, excluding restructuring, we would expect our buybacks to be about 25% of that amount with the rest going to delevering. 
So wrapping up, we had strong financial performance in fiscal '21, delivered on 4 quarters of meeting our ARR and free cash flow guidance, and this was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on the expense structure. Most importantly, of course, we believe we're well positioned to deliver on the midterm targets we provided at our Investor Day last November. We're unlocking a significant multiyear catalyst by accelerating our SaaS transition, and we're also optimizing how we go to market with our Digital Thread and Velocity business units. I'm encouraged by how PTC continues to rapidly evolve to meet the needs of our customers. 
Moving on to Slide 29. We look forward to discussing today's news during the Q&A session and follow-up calls. Also, we will host an investor meeting on December 15 to further discuss our strategy and targets. Please save that date on your calendars. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A."

But if I look across many of the larger deals, a lot of them are expansions. Companies who used engineering -- or used PLM in engineering, but now want it across the enterprise.

So let me try to hit a few of them quickly. As it relates to readiness for PLM, several years ago, we tried an experiment and began selling our retail vertical solution, PLM solution,",353,"Yes. Well, Jay, you've got a lot of points there that are interesting. So let me try to hit a few of them quickly. As it relates to readiness for PLM, several years ago, we tried an experiment and began selling our retail vertical solution, PLM solution, which we call Windchill Flex PLM as cloud-only. And we went to 100% cloud sales. And frankly, that's stuck, and we've been in that model for years now. And all the transactions we've done for years now have been in the cloud. That was an interesting proof point. 
Then if you look at, it's been creeping into our mainstream sales. And in fact, before we did the SaaS acceleration, we had planned that 25% of our PLM bookings in fiscal '22 would come in cloud form. So 25% would be software in the cloud and 75% would be software not in the cloud. And that's before we put like any incentives or muscle into it. 
So that plus the success that Arena is having, so far as I can see, Arena is the fastest-growing major PLM system in the world, and it's pure SaaS, and Windchill a second. So I love having that #1 and 2 growth position. And really, cloud is driving both of them. So I just think the market is telling us we're ready. 
And in fact, customers are literally telling us to our face, we're ready. But that doesn't mean the other stuff is not important. People aren't going to buy Windchill because it's in the cloud. They're going to buy Windchill because it's the best system for things like you talked about, billing material management, variation in configuration-driven digital mockups and service life cycle management and software and systems engineering. 
That functionality is highly differentiated, and then you bring in IoT and AR and wow. So we have a highly differentiated solution that's also in the cloud, and customers are saying, we want Windchill, and increasingly, we want it in the cloud. So that's kind of where we're at. We're just reading the signals and basically saying it's time to react."

One, the product lines that have the highest churn rates for us, our IoT and AR, obviously, those products continue to mature, we expect that as they continue to mature, we'll continue to see the stickiness of those products improve, resulting in lower churn. 
I think the whole organizational model evolution that we spent a fair amount of time talking about here today will also help with our level of customer engagement and that should, I think, help churn as well. And I think there are some other just execution issues on our side that we can continue to drive as well, which should provide opportunity to get there. I think those would probably be the main—"

Let me comment further and then also I want to hit a second related point related to your first question, Gal. I mean, frankly, if you look at it, Creo and Windchill, which are over $1 billion now of ARR, have churn rates much better than the company",372,"Yes. Let me comment further and then also I want to hit a second related point related to your first question, Gal. I mean, frankly, if you look at it, Creo and Windchill, which are over $1 billion now of ARR, have churn rates much better than the company average. And the other businesses that are growing faster, generally are less than the higher churn rates than the company average, and you average those together and you get the company average. 
But the thing is all of these growth businesses are themselves improving their churn rates quarter by quarter, year by year. And that's why we keep averaging down toward Creo and Windchill. So there's more where this came from, for sure, as it relates to churn improvement, and we expect to see it continue to come. 
And then back on the growth assumptions, what I wanted to say, I used this phrase more pathways to mid-teens growth. I think in the past, like, let's say, at our Investor Day last year, our recipe for mid-teens growth sort of had FSG flat using the old categories, FSG flat. We needed growth to be kind of at least close to double digits -- I'm sorry, we need the core business to be close to double digits, and then we needed really a 3 handle on the growth business. 
And now you say, well, wait a minute, if the growth business, even if it had a 2 handle, if the core business remains in low double digits or even perhaps a couple of points higher than that, you don't really need a 3 handle on the growth business anymore. So sort of like if everything works, we can do even better. But now we have room for 1 or 2 things not to work quite as well as we wanted and still get to respectable growth numbers. And even if we don't get to the mid-teens growth numbers with higher margins, we can still get to the cash flow number. So we feel like we've taken a more conservative posture. We still think all this stuff can work, but now it doesn't all have to work simultaneously for us to deliver some good numbers."

We need to launch everything. We need to start the sales cycles, then we need to close the orders.

It's really in customer success, where we used to have many organizations that took turns talking to the customer. They all had management change.

And we're doing that not by just reducing capability, but by simply implementing a much more efficient model with many less silos, much less management involved and so forth. So that's all goodness. 
There are other places we'll have efficiencies, like -- let me give you an example. If you belong to a field organization, you work in technical support, your mission is to make the customer happy even if it means solving the same problem dozens or hundreds of times quickly. If you are part of the product organization, your goal is to go back and talk to the product guys and tell them, make this product go away in the SaaS offering quickly so that no other customers are even aware that it ever did exist. So you can see there's like real efficiencies in terms of like how you solve customer problems. Are you trying to make them happy while they have the problem and repeat that hundreds and thousands of times? Or are you trying to make the problem go away so that the rest of the customers never knew it happened? Just to summarize. These are great efficiencies that we're going to go pursue."

I think if you look at the different classes of partners, it affects them differently. Let's start with Microsoft elated about this, as you might expect because it will bring a lot of business their way. If you look at Rockwell, Rockwell, too, is leaning into SaaS. And frankly, all of our SaaS products are easier for Rockwell to digest and to deliver on to their customers, than would be the on-premise variant. So I think Rockwell quite likes the strategy and maybe some of their own thinking about SaaS was born in our boardroom. I don't know. You'd have to ask Blake that, but I might speculate. 
And then I think like if you look at our resellers, it will change their world a little bit. They still need to go sell the software. They won't be as involved in delivering it, but then they're very much involved in the implementation of it at the customer side. So I don't want you to think as it relates to resellers or SIs that SaaS companies don't have SI partners. I mean, my God, Salesforce has a massive SI ecosystem. They just don't install software and perform upgrades at the customer site. They do system integration, they do adoption. They do business process transformation. They do all that stuff, which still has to happen. So that's kind of long term. 
I think SIs have to take the sort of posture they have relative to Salesforce and all those other SaaS companies, which we'll help them through, and the bigger ones like Accenture already know that play. 
And then for the smaller resellers, the other thing worth noting is that most of our resellers sell Creo and Kepware, and those products are sort of further out on the SaaS road map anyway. So that would be several years down the road before we even really come to that bridge."

We will deliver more value to the customer and they will pay us more for that value while saving money on their side above and beyond. So is that a pricing increase? I don't know. It's a value increase. And that could drive a tremendous amount of business. 
If Creo and Windchill are $1 billion, and you could double $750 million of that over a decade, well that's $750 million of more value delivered to the customer base and monetized. However, what we're seeing with Arena and to a degree with Windchill is we have the cloudiest, SaaS-y-est solutions in the market, and that does help take share. Every piece of business that Arena is winning, they're taken from somebody else or it's a start-up company that they're winning at somebody else's expense. And Arena is the fastest-growing PLM solution in the market right now. 
So I do think it's both. And exactly what the balance will be, I don't know. I do think monetizing the customer base by delivering more value is a high probability, and it will drive a lot of growth by itself."

Now that said, if you look what we did with the subscription program, we pulled every lever we could come up with.

We had like 28 work streams and 300 people working on it. We changed pricing and packaging to favor subscription over at the time, perpetual. We paid more commission on a perpetual deal. We had certain offerings that were only -- I'm sorry, we paid more commission. I said that wrong on a subscription deal. We paid -- we had certain offerings that were only available, certain attractive sexy offerings, including the ANSYS stuff, by the way, that was only available subscription. So we basically stacked the deck in every customer conversation in a way that everybody wanted it to go subscription. We got the band back together. We're putting the same program together. We're going to stack the deck again in favor of SaaS this time."

And frankly, we've said we wanted to have a 2 handle. 
Now bookings in every quarter of fiscal '21 were higher than the previous year quarter in fiscal '20. So there is some bookings momentum happening. And then another thing is we launched this DPM solution that, frankly, we've been working on for 2 years. It's a major piece of software that we launched and already has quite some customer interest. 
So we sort of feel like the combination of the bookings momentum we have, including and especially in Q4 and then the launch of DPM and the trends we're seeing, they bode well for what should happen next year.

I think what you should think, first of all, is that DPM will become a category of solutions. And what we're launching first is DPM for factory, digital performance management of what happens in a factory. There will be solutions that are more focused on digital performance management of a fleet of products out in the field at customer sites. But fundamentally, what we're trying to do is move from selling a toolkit where the customer does the solutioning themselves to selling a turnkey solution with a very strong value proposition, sold to executives, not to developers, sold on the basis of the business value it will generate and then implement it quickly into production. 
So yes, it's a very different sales motion. I mean, number one, we're selling to executives, not selling to developers. Number two, we're selling business value, not speeds and feeds, technical stuff. And I think it's really where we wanted to take this business for a while. So I'm very pleased with this solution. It took us a while to develop it, as I said, but it's a powerful piece of software, and it really gives us kind of a new platform to build on going forward with IoT. 
It makes IoT, if I could, a lot like how we sell PLM. We sell PLM to executives based on business value. We were selling IoT to developers as a toolkit. And now we'll sell PLM and DPM as business value to executives. Different executives, mind you, but executives.  
Okay. So great. Thank you. Well, operator, maybe I'll just take it from here. So first, again, my apologies, this is like the strangest earnings call I've had again, and it's the 44th one as CEO. So it's a bit odd. But nonetheless, I think we got a lot of good information out there, and you guys had some great questions, and I appreciate it. 
So in closing, I mean, we're in a great place. I really like PTC setup going forward. The changes we announced are good for growth. They're good for profitability. They're going to put us in a stronger position to hit both the top line and bottom line targets that we have out there. So we're looking forward to continuing the discussion with you on follow-up calls at investor conferences. I'm going to be at the Berenberg conference, at least virtually next week or I guess it's 2 weeks out maybe. No, it's next week.

No doubt, there will be follow-up interest, so we've also scheduled our Annual Investor Day in mid-December, and we expect to be active on the IR circuit in the weeks ahead. 
Starting then with Slide 4. Given the news, we're going to follow a somewhat different agenda for today's call. I'm going to start with highlights of our Q4 and fiscal 2021 performance, then I'll take you through an abbreviated version of our product line results. Next, Kristian will complete our discussion of Q4 and fiscal '21 with his financial reviews. Then turning to the future, I'll address the changes we announced today, which are designed to accelerate our SaaS transition and margin expansion. Following that, Kristian will take you through our go-forward guidance and reporting structure. We've reserved extra time for your questions at the end. 
Moving to Slide 5. Q4 was an outstanding quarter for PTC, and it capped off another strong year. We came in at the high end of our guidance for ARR growth, and we exceeded our free cash flow guidance. Despite the pandemic, every part of the business performed well in fiscal '21, with growth in every product line and in every geography. Fiscal '21 was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit organic ARR growth, and we're guiding for fiscal '22 to be the fifth. Furthermore, by continuing our strong focus on operational discipline, we've been able to translate our top line growth into strong bottom line free cash flow performance. Kristian will take you through free cash flow in more detail later in the call. 
Taking a look at the key factors driving our top line performance and turning to Slide 6. Our Q4 bookings results were outstanding. Bookings were up mid-teens organically and high teens overall from the blockbuster Q4 we had a year ago. Remember that in Q4 of fiscal '20, bookings bounced back sharply, following a downturn in Q2 and Q3 during the depths of the pandemic. Surpassing last year's strong Q4 number is a great accomplishment. 
Bookings were strong across all product lines and geographies. Because Q4 of fiscal '20 had been such an outlier, our planned targeted Q4 '21 organic bookings to be roughly flat to last year's number. Creo was slightly above plan, while everything else was well above. FSG and Onshape led the way with bookings growth of more than 90% and 70%, respectively. 
IoT and AR bookings were both up mid-teens year-over-year to record levels for each, with IoT bookings growing more than 120% sequentially, while AR bookings grew more than 60% sequentially. PLM bookings were up high single digits year-over-year. Keep in mind that a good percentage of our Q4 bookings, especially those done later in the quarter, don't start until October or later. So they end up in what we used to call backlog, but now call deferred ARR. Deferred ARR ended the year at $20 million above the original plan we had for fiscal '21. So in summary, not only did we hit the high end of our fiscal '21 ARR guidance range by delivering 12 points of organic ARR growth, we also booked about 1.5 points more growth in the deferred ARR, which will benefit future periods. 
Turning to ARR on Slide 7. On a top line basis, fiscal '21 was a big success. In Q4, we came in at 12% organic ARR, excluding Arena, and 16% ARR growth overall. 
Looking at our core products in Q4, we continued to deliver market-leading growth. Creo came in at low double-digit growth, while Windchill grew mid-teens. According to data published by Jay Vleeschhouwer, Creo and Windchill have significantly outperformed Siemens' and Dassault's CAD and PLM businesses lately, as they are relatively flat with 2019, while we're up more than 20%. We've been seeing the solid growth trend in our core CAD and PLM business for years now, and we expect this to continue. I'll come back to this important point during the second part of my prepared remarks. 
Next, looking at our growth products. IoT grew mid-teens, coming in below our target. However, bookings were strong in Q4, and we expect stronger ARR growth in fiscal '22, following bookings momentum and the launch of our new Digital Performance Management Solution. Vuforia AR, Vuforia augmented reality, grew mid-teens, which is better than it sounds when you factor in that this growth came on top of very strong 77% growth in our previous Q4 that we're comparing against. I'm happy with the roughly 40% CAGR over the past 2 years. In fiscal '22, we are positioned to continue good growth in AR based on our bookings momentum. 
Onshape grew over 50%. It's now been 2 years since we acquired Onshape, and we're very pleased with the acquisition and the progress made by the Onshape team. Arena grew over 20%. This represents good acceleration from mid-teens preacquisition growth rates, driven by go-to-market investments we made, coupled with synergies gained by being part of PTC. 
Turning to FSG. Growth was 6%, primarily driven by strong performance of our systems and software engineering offerings where we benefited from several large deals. 
Turning to Slide 8. While Creo and Windchill are powerful independently, these products generate even more value when leveraged together. A great example of this integrated story can be found in our recent announcement that the entire Volvo Group will adopt PTC's Creo product as their primary CAD solution, mirroring what they did several years ago with our Windchill PLM solution. This is a big competitive displacement for Creo. 
In addition, our ANSYS-powered Creo Simulation Live technology, together with Creo ANSYS Simulation, continues to drive customer interest in simulation. I've been saying for some time that as the product system of record, PLM is a critical element of any manufacturing company's digital transformation strategy. This is exactly what led to our largest ever PLM order in Q4 of '21, a multiyear committed ramp deal coming from a large global medical device company. This too was a competitive displacement for Windchill. In PLM, we saw average deal sizes increasing with numerous expansions in the quarter. 
In IoT, this past week, we launched our Digital Performance Management, or DPM solution, at our manufacturing live event. If you missed the event, by the way, you can find the replay on our Investor website. DPM is our new solution designed to be a comprehensive turnkey out-of-the-box solution that addresses our customers' biggest IoT value creation opportunities. It will be the perfect antidote to the so-called pilot purgatory problem the IoT industry has been discussing. 
You may have also noted separately the press release announcing that PTC is the only industrial IoT player recognized as a leader by all 4 major industry analyst firms. Also in the IoT space, Microsoft yesterday officially launched its cloud for manufacturing, and we're thrilled to be a lead partner. Our alliance with Microsoft continues to go well with Q4 being our best quarter to date in terms of co-selling with Microsoft. 
Vuforia delivered a healthy mix of expansions, cross-sell and net new logos. We landed our largest ever AR order from a large pharmaceutical company, which will use Vuforia to deliver augmented digital work instructions to improve the speed and quality of production line changeovers. 
Also, with all the buzz you hear about metaverse these days, you might enjoy watching the amazing live industrial metaverse demonstration that our CTO, Steve Dertien, and I delivered as part of our manufacturing live keynote using our Vuforia Spatial Toolbox technology. 
If you look carefully at the graphic on the right side of Slide 8, that is Steve and I standing in front of our anonymized digital representations whose movement in activity is being measured and analyzed in real time. This is a peak into our concept of digital Taylorism, named after the famous work of Frederick Taylor, who was the father of industrial engineering more than 100 years ago. 
Turning now to Onshape and Arena on Slide 9. Onshape performance has been driven by strong win rates against competitors, coupled with solid expansion rates. Onshape captured nearly 1,000 new logos in fiscal '21. 
During the year, churn improved by 10 points while net retention improved by 15 points, and these metrics now look quite strong compared to similar-sized SaaS peers of all types. Naturally, smaller companies have been drawn to Onshape because its lightweight SaaS footprint enables agile hardware development processes. But thanks to 17 more product releases during the past year, Onshape's maturing functionality also led to several significant orders in Q4 from larger companies in the robotics and medical device fields who love the product for similar reasons. The amazing adoption that Onshape experienced in the education market in fiscal '21 is icing on the cake. It contributed little to the financials, but sets the stage for mass adoption by the next-generation workforce in future years. 
Arena saw numerous expansions driving larger deal sizes, too. Arena is also proving to be a great acquisition. Like Onshape, Arena is the cloud-native market leader in PLM with particular strength in tech-centric markets such as electronics and medical devices. We're on track with the integration plan that we laid out for the acquisition of Arena with new sales capacity coming online in the U.S. and Europe. The combination of Onshape and Arena makes PTC the clear market leader in cloud-native PLM and CAD solutions, and these offerings make a great pairing for fast-moving high-tech manufacturers who want to develop hardware using the same agile process methodology as software. 
Next, Slide 10 shows our geographic ARR performance. Americas was up 19%, led by double-digit growth in core products and Arena; Europe was up 13%, led by high single digit in core products; low 40s growth in growth products and double-digit growth in FSG; and APAC was up 17%, led by mid-teens growth in core products and low 30s growth in growth products. 
There are thousands of people at PTC that contributed to our outstanding fiscal '21, and I'd like to say thank you to all of them. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Kristian to complete the portion of today's call, focused on Q4 and fiscal '21."

Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance later in the discussion, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. So turning to Slide 12.",847,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance later in the discussion, and all growth rate references will be in constant currency. 
So turning to Slide 12. We delivered ARR growth at the high end of our guidance range. Fiscal '21 ARR of $1.47 billion increased 16% year-over-year. Excluding Arena, ARR growth was 12%. FX was a small $4 million headwind in fiscal '21 for us. 
As Jim highlighted earlier, our bookings were very strong in Q4. With this, we had an uptick -- within this, we had an uptick in ramp deals, and that's why our bookings performance did not result in even stronger ARR growth. Instead, the vast majority of our bookings upside went into deferred ARR that will benefit future periods, primarily fiscal '23 and beyond. 
Organic churn improved approximately 130 basis points year-over-year, slightly ahead of our guidance for approximately 100 basis points of improvement, primarily driven by strong execution in CAD, PLM, FSG as well as modest continued improvement in both IoT and AR. 
Fiscal '21 free cash flow of $344 million grew 61% year-over-year and was slightly above our guidance. Note that our free cash flow for the year included an unforecasted $18 million outflow related to a foreign tax dispute, $15 million in acquisition-related fees and $15 million in restructuring payments. These onetime headwinds were offset by other onetime tailwinds, including some onetime tax benefits, Arena working capital versus original expectations. Improvements in AR aging also helped drive a onetime uptick in free cash flow in '21. 
Fiscal '21 revenue of $1.81 billion increased 24% year-over-year, as reported, or 20% in constant currency and was above guidance. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606. So in Q4 and throughout fiscal '21 longer-than-anticipated contract durations and support to subscription conversions positively impacted the amount of upfront subscription revenue recognized in the quarter and in the year. 
I'd like to remind you that over the long term, ARR and recurring revenue growth rates should be approximately the same. However, in any period, revenue is subject to much more volatility due to ASC 606, which is why we feel that ARR, our annual run rate, which is also a very close proxy for subscription billings, is the true and better indicator of PTC's growth. 
In fiscal '21, non-GAAP operating margins were 35% and increased approximately 610 basis points over fiscal '20. This was due to the strong revenue performance I just mentioned as well as maintaining good discipline on our operating expense structure. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $3.97 increased 58% year-over-year and was above guidance. I'd like to point out that our GAAP results reflect a gain of $69 million related to our investment in Matterport, which we mark-to-market. And as you may recall, Matterport went public and began trading on July 23. In addition, our GAAP results also included the release of $137 million valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and a tax benefit of $42 million related to the Arena acquisition. 
Moving to the next slide. Another way to think about PTC's performance is using the cash flow model we often share. And as you can see here on Slide 13, ARR plus perpetual revenue, plus professional services revenue equaled our cash generation, which was $1.455 billion, which is up about $200 million over fiscal '20. 
You can also see the total expenses of $1.173 billion. This was up about $138 million over fiscal '20, which leads to a net cash contribution margin of $473 million with an increase of about $62 million. Or if you think about cash contribution margin as a proxy for cash EBITDA, we delivered a 29% cash contribution margin, and this was up about 100 basis points compared to fiscal '20. In this format you can see most of the onetime headwinds and tailwinds I discussed earlier are below the line, in terms of cash tax headwinds and tailwinds, M&A-related expenses, improvements in aging, which actually resulted in net positive working capital in fiscal '21, which one would normally expect to be negative in a growing business. 
Moving to Slide 14. I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended with fiscal '21 with cash and cash equivalents of $327 million. In addition, we had medium-term investments of $78 million, primarily related to our investment in Matterport. Our gross debt was $1.45 billion with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.2%. During Q4, we paid down $40 million on our revolving credit facility, and we also made our $19 million semiannual bond interest payment. With our leverage ratio now less than 3x, which we told you was our goal, we resumed our share repurchase program. The $30 million of cash we used to repurchase shares in Q4 was approximately equal to our free cash flow generation in the quarter. All in all, Q4 wrapped up a solid year for PTC from both an ARR and a free cash flow perspective. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim."

Despite bumpy macro conditions, we have established a 4-year track record of double-digit top line organic growth based on a recurring revenue model and driven by widely recognized technology l",2888,"Thanks, Kristian. PTC is at an exciting point in our history. Despite bumpy macro conditions, we have established a 4-year track record of double-digit top line organic growth based on a recurring revenue model and driven by widely recognized technology leadership positions in an industry increasingly motivated by digital transformation. In parallel, our decade-long track record of strong operational discipline has driven our margins up, enabling us to benefit significantly from leverage as we scale. You see that in the 61% free cash flow growth I highlighted at the start of the call.
Given the strength of our financial performance in fiscal '21, the restructuring we announced today might come as a surprise to some of you, but sit tight because I think you will like what we're doing. For some time now, I've been telling investors about our plans to leverage the Atlas platform that we acquired with Onshape to pivot the whole company toward a SaaS future. As I had previously discussed it, much of the upside benefits of the SaaS pivot would come in fiscal '24 and beyond. 
Many of you have asked, why wouldn't we invest more to get to that SaaS upside more quickly? Frankly, that was a good question and one that we thought long and hard about. We even hired McKinsey to help us think through it and develop a strategy. Today, I will explain how, thanks to the changes we're making, we will invest substantially more in our SaaS initiatives while actually decreasing our overall run rate spending projection significantly. 
Let me hit the financial summary first on Slide 16, and then explain the strategy and operational changes behind it. In terms of the financial view of the restructuring, we are reducing our spending run rate by approximately $60 million compared to fiscal '21 as we improve the efficiency of our organizational structure. 
We've also eliminated about $30 million of previously contemplated new spending run rate from our fiscal '22 plans. So compared to the plan for fiscal '22 that existed prior to the restructuring, we now have -- we now expect to reduce our planned fiscal '22 run rate spending by approximately $9 million. And then reinvest about half of that into initiatives that accelerate our transition to SaaS, with the other half falling to the bottom line. 
Key SaaS investments will be used to increase capacity on Atlas, to accelerate work to adopt Atlas into our core products and to operate those products as SaaS, and into Onshape and Arena product development and sales capacity. Despite what will be a very significant investment, we expect to expand cash margins by approximately 400 basis points in FY '22. So we are accelerating both growth and margin expansion at the same time. 
Restructuring-related cash outflows are expected to be approximately $50 million to $55 million, with about 2/3 occurring in the first half of '22, and the majority of the remaining payments to be made in Q3. In other words, the restructuring will obscure the great cash flow progress for the next 2 or 3 quarters, but the benefits will start shining through after that. Already by Q4 of fiscal '22, we should be seeing a net free cash flow tailwind as a consequence of the restructuring. Then, as Kristian will outline, fiscal '23 and beyond will look great. 
Let's go to Slide 17, and I'll start by explaining why a SaaS pivot is so interesting to PTC. There are 3 reasons why we think now is the time for PTC to align with and invest more in the SaaS transition. First, the industrial software market wants to go to SaaS. COVID has greatly amplified the interest in SaaS. PTC is already the recognized SaaS leader in our industry. Onshape and Arena have proven what's possible, and they've dramatically elevated PTC's credibility. We are far ahead of competitors in terms of understanding what SaaS is and what it is not. Customers are looking for PTC to lead the whole industry through a transition to SaaS. 
Second, based on growing customer demand, we see the need to accelerate SaaS initiatives while better aligning with SaaS best practices in order to meet the needs of the market. The investments we're making now will allow us to play offense to capture the market demand. 
Third, we believe our new SaaS strategy will accelerate a major growth driver for PTC, giving us more pathways to mid-teens growth in the midterm and helping to derisk our growth ambitions. Meanwhile, cost savings from the restructuring itself are expected to derisk our free cash flow growth targets, even if the growth should prove slower to materialize than I expect. 
Turning to Slide 18. Owning the industry's only cloud native CAD and PLM combo has been a big advantage. By comparing how our Onshape and Arena businesses work, as compared to the balance of PTC, we can see that certain ways in which PTC has been organized are quite inefficient. At the same time, we see an opportunity to serve customers better, too, and that's why we're choosing to evolve our organization to be more SaaS like. 
I'd like to review several of the larger changes. Previously, in addition to working with sales, our customers would have more than a half dozen touch points across our broad customer success organization, including renewal sales, presales, post-sales consulting, customer success management, technical support, our cloud organization, a group called customer experience and others. 
In comparison, most SaaS companies have a 2 in-the-box model, where each customer has just 1 sales and 1 customer success contact. Not only is PTC's current model inefficient, perhaps more importantly, customers hate being repeatedly passed from 1 contact to another as they proceed through their journey with PTC. So we are reconfiguring to deploy the same two-in-a-box model that SaaS companies utilize. 
This reconfiguration has no impact on the sales side of the equation. In fact, we're adding direct quota-carrying capacity into the current model. Aside from where we expand coverage, the vast majority of customers will retain the same sales contacts they know and love today. The bigger change for the customer will be that they now have 1 customer success contact rather than many. There's nothing but goodness here for everybody. Customers prefer this model, and it will save PTC a lot of money as it is much more scalable. 
The other major change is on the product development, delivery and support side. With Onshape and Arena, or any true SaaS company, this is all done by a single organization using modern DevOps practices. But within the core PTC product lines, the development, cloud delivery and technical support organizations have been entirely separate, with the latter 2 belonging to the field organization. You simply can't get to SaaS that way. 
As part of our reorganization, we have merged our cloud delivery and technical support groups into the product organization to mirror the modern SaaS practices deployed by Onshape and Arena and everybody else in the SaaS world. This, too, will create significant operating efficiencies and a much improved customer experience at the same time. Nothing but goodness here, too. 
To better understand the demand drivers, let's take a look at an illustrative value proposition on Slide 19, typical of what customers see in the transition from on-premise to SaaS. For every dollar a customer pays PTC or any other vendor for on-prem PLM, they have an estimated additional $2 to $3 in cost of ownership associated with on-premise servers and storage, system administrators plus SIs who help with on-site installations and upgrades and all that. Their total cost of ownership can be $3 to $4. When the deployment, maintenance and delivery responsibility for the software is shifted back to PTC, we can leverage significant efficiencies to serve that same functionality back to the customer for roughly an incremental dollar at margins that are attractive to us. Therefore, each dollar of on-premise software, ARR today represents potentially $2 of future SaaS ARR for PTC plus a savings of $1 or $2 for the customer. 
The customer also gets to enjoy the many other benefits of SaaS. It is device agnostic. It's ideal for a hybrid work environment, data shared with employees and suppliers in real time, plus no more upgrades to do as everyone is always on the latest version. This value proposition for SaaS is not really new news to any of you, it's what Marc Benioff at Salesforce.com has been espousing for 2 decades now. More than half of the overall commercial software industry has already made this pivot. But that's not yet the case in our world of industrial software, where SaaS has low single-digit penetration. 
As Salesforce did in CRM, some company will have to lead the way to SaaS in the CAD and PLM industry. We think the time is right for industrial companies to move to SaaS, and PTC is best positioned to lead that transition. 
Turning to Slide 20. We've been delivering more and more new PLM projects as SaaS in recent years, as customer preference has shifted there. But going forward, we'll make SaaS our primary delivery model and deliver on-premise only when required by the customer. But we also have a large existing customer base with on-premise systems. In order for existing customers to get to SaaS, each customer has to go through a lift and shift process. This process entails lifting the on-premise deployment, upgrading and decustomizing it as necessary to eliminate technical debt, and then shifting it into the PTC cloud from where we can serve it back to the customer as a service. We plan to focus the lift and shift program first in Windchill, where the biggest opportunity lies, and bring Creo and other products into the fold in subsequent phases over time. 
So you may be wondering, well, how will this help to accelerate growth? The answer is that our organizational changes and the associated wave of investment enable us to scale up to make SaaS the default for new sales and to start the lift and shift process now here in fiscal '22. Though the value proposition for transitioning to SaaS is sound, we still have to go through a sales cycle with each customer. Returning the sales teams [ flows ] now with this proposition, and we expect the first projects to begin showing up in the back half of fiscal '22. 
The Windchill SaaS capability will be deployed into Azure and into the manufacturing cloud at that. So Microsoft is eager to help us sell this proposition. I'd like to think of this project as the last upgrade for each customer because when the lift and shift project is done, then PTC will take it forward further. Therefore, a good time to sell this program is whenever customers start planning their next upgrade. Customers tend to upgrade Windchill systems once every 2 or 3 years, so we get a shot at a good portion of the base each year and expect success to accelerate in fiscal '23 and beyond. 
There are thousands of Windchill deployments out there, so I anticipate this process will take numerous years, perhaps a decade, and we won't get them all. Naturally, we'll focus first on the most ready customers and work on the long tail further out. In the end, I expect we'll ultimately get about 75% of the customers to transition, and we'll continue to offer on-premise variance of the product, born of the same code stream on an indefinite basis for those who do not want SaaS. 
PTC is all in on SaaS. The program we're launching is a major cross-sale effort on par with the highly successful [ subscription ] program. We executed the move from perpetual to where we are today with 98% of our software revenue now being subscription. Like that subscription program, the SaaS transition program involves numerous changes to our offerings, to our pricing and packaging, to compensation and more. 
We have the same program leader driving it. An important difference though is that the SaaS transition program is all about growth acceleration within the recurring software business model we currently have in place, which means we will not have the same so-called valley of death effect that our cash flow went back -- went through back then. Now we'll have all of the gain, but none of that pain. Taking you deeper into the elements of this program will be a key agenda topic at our December Investor Day. 
One last related change we're making is to organize into 2 main business units, as shown on Slide 21. With plans to leverage SaaS now in place and underway across the entire company, it no longer makes sense to have a SaaS business unit per se. Therefore, we plan to reunite Vuforia AR with the CAD PLM and IoT product lines into a business unit designed to promote higher levels of cross-selling across this integrated product portfolio. This new business unit, which focuses on the digital transformation driver, will be all about growing the base and leading them to SaaS. It will be called the Digital Thread business unit to reflect the highly integrated nature of its portfolio of products. 
Troy Richardson, who's been our Chief Operating Officer for the past year, is being promoted to become President of this business unit. Troy has already been managing the go-to-market side of these businesses, but now the product development arm will report to him as well to drive [ title liman ]. Naturally, I'll stay involved in the technology road map, because as you probably know, that's where my passion lies. You'll get more time with Troy Richardson at the upcoming Investor Day. 
Onshape and Arena will remain together under their current President, Mike DiTullio. This will be called the Velocity business unit to reflect that the cloud-native pure SaaS value proposition of Onshape and Arena, it's most attractive to companies who want to deploy agile product development processes and move fast. This business unit is all about disrupting the competition and landing new logos, which, in many cases, are SME customers. But we're seeing larger companies being drawn to Onshape and Arena solutions too, because their existing vendor simply doesn't have anything that compares. Companies like Garrett Motion, for example, the $4 billion automotive turbocharger company we profiled at our fiscal '20 Investor Day last year, who switched to Onshape from a high-end CAD competitor to gain increased business velocity. You'll have more time with Mike DiTullio, too, at the Investor Day. Both business unit Presidents report to me. I'll help drive their respective strategies, while Troy and Mike preside over the operating cadence of each business unit. 
A related change is that the Atlas platform will move under our very capable CTO, Steve Dertien, who will develop the shared platform to meet the needs of both units. Steve will continue to report to me. 
I know that was a lot of information to take in. Turning to Slide 22. Let me summarize, and then I'll hand it back to Kristian for more specific go-forward guidance. First, from a top line perspective, our SaaS acceleration pivot unlocks another powerful multiyear growth catalyst for PTC and our shareholders. Exiting fiscal '21, Creo and Windchill together represent more than $1 billion of ARR, growing double digits organically. This growth pattern has been in place for 4 years now, right through the pandemic with the strong performance driven by the role both products play in the digital transformation strategies of industrial companies. 
With the SaaS program that we're launching, we're layering an additional growth driver into this core business that we expect could last a decade. Therefore, in our core business, we see double-digit ARR growth being sustainable well into the future. Together with the growth drivers in IoT and AR, plus Onshape and Arena, we're creating more pathways to drive ARR growth to the mid-teens. In my view, PTC's growth story is alive and well. 
Second, from a bottom line perspective, the strategic improvements we're making will drive up our cash contribution margins considerably and help derisk our cash flow targets under a broader range of ARR growth scenarios. Kristian will expand on this. 
Given our confidence in growth, coupled with the higher margins, we remain committed to the midterm free cash flow targets that we set at our Investor Day last year. Recall that our guidance was for midterm free cash flow growth of approximately 25% to 30%. After we get beyond the restructuring payments, we expect to perform in that range, perhaps earlier than you might have expected. 
Our guidance for fiscal '22 assumes we'll get a small positive impact from the SaaS transition in the back half of the fiscal year, which is counterbalanced by slower assumed growth rates in FSG and somewhat conservative assumptions we have around Rockwell's contribution as they work their way through the Flex integration. Let me be clear that our commitment to the partnership with Rockwell remains as strong as ever, and that we're energized to work together because of the great potential we see ahead. In particular, we see tremendous potential for the DPM offering sold through Rockwell and their [indiscernible] consulting arm. Kristian, back over to you."

So back to the financial guidance and go-forward reporting structure. First, let me reiterate how exciting a time this is for PTC. The restructuring we're going through right now is really the single biggest thematic investment PTC has made that I can remember. This reorganization is designed to better align PTC to our SaaS future and as an interesting consequence, it should also derisk our path to delivering on the midterm ARR and cash flow growth targets we discussed at our Investor Day last November. 
So starting with guidance on Slide 24. We continue to target getting to mid-teens ARR growth in the midterm. Jim did a good job outlining many of the pathways we have to getting to these targets with the SaaS opportunity in both the Velocity and core businesses; with the addition of solutions to the portfolio, starting with DPM; coupled with the general strength of the existing portfolio. More specifically, for fiscal '22, we expect ARR of $1.615 billion to $1.66 billion. That's a growth rate of 10% to 13% on a constant currency basis, following 4 consecutive years of double-digit ARR growth. It's also worth mentioning that we expect continued churn improvement in fiscal '22 and are targeting another 100 basis point improvement. 
From a linearity perspective, we would again expect flattish ARR growth throughout the year on a constant currency basis. So using the midpoint of guidance, that would imply about 11.5% ARR growth each quarter. Obviously, this can fluctuate given bookings performance, start dates, et cetera, but we believe we provided for that within the range outlined. 
The one thing worth pointing out is that ARR growth in Q1 of '22 is expected to be approximately 15%, since Q1 '21 did not include ARR for Arena. In order to help with the modeling, we've provided historical constant currency performance in the data tables on the website, and I'll touch more on this in a little bit. 
Turning to cash flow. We also continue to target approximately 25% to 30% annual free cash flow growth over the midterm. For fiscal '22, specifically, we're guiding for free cash flow of approximately $400 million. As a consequence of the restructuring, we're expecting cash outflows of approximately $50 million to $55 million with approximately 2/3 occurring in the first half and the majority of the remaining payments to be made in Q3. Excluding restructuring, our expected free cash flow in fiscal '22 would be approximately $450 million, representing 25% growth compared to the $359 million we generated in fiscal '21 on the same basis. So doing some directional math and using round numbers on the midterm targets, this means we would expect free cash flow in the $550 million to $600 million range in fiscal '23 and would expect $700 million to $750 million of free cash flow in fiscal '24. 
Regarding the linearity of free cash flow in fiscal '22, excluding restructuring, we expect to see a similar pattern as in fiscal '21 with more than 60% of free cash flow generation in the first half of the year. Collections are stronger in the first half, and we expect expenses to increase as we ramp hiring and our SaaS investments throughout the year. 
As Jim discussed, the restructuring not only creates strategic improvements in how we're organized, but also enhances our profitability profile. So we believe we'll be able to deliver strong free cash flow growth, even if we don't accelerate the ARR. I'll come back to this point on the next slide. 
And finally, turning to revenue guidance. For fiscal '22, we're expecting revenue of $1.85 billion to $1.98 billion, which corresponds to a growth rate of 2% to 9% on an as-reported basis or 4% to 11% on a constant currency basis. 
ASC 606 makes revenue fairly difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range. Note that revenue has no impact on ARR or free cash flow as we continue to primarily bill customers annually upfront. And again, over the longer term, we expect recurring revenue growth to align with ARR growth, particularly as we transition the company to SaaS and evolve towards increasingly ratable revenue recognition. 
So moving on to Slide 25. Using the same free cash flow model we showed earlier, so this slide illustrates a directional view of what fiscal '22 could look like, assuming the approximate midpoint of our ARR guidance range. ARR here grows at approximately 11.5%. Cash generation is up $170 million. We see continued growth in expenses. But given the new operating model, as Jim pointed out earlier, our cash contribution margin expands almost 400 basis points. Said differently, the new operating model is expected to add more than $120 million of cash contribution margin versus the $60 million plus we added last year on similar to slightly less ARR growth. 
On the expense front, as Jim mentioned, we're reducing spending in certain areas to fund investments to accelerate our SaaS transition. Additionally, there are some other items that will impact OpEx this year, such as the accounting for commissions, which is impacted by ASC 606, increased travel, merit and so on. 
So as far as the P&L is concerned, the net result is that we're guiding for fiscal '22 non-GAAP operating expense to grow by approximately 3% at the midpoint of guidance, which is certainly lower than the 50% of our targeted ARR growth for the year, even though we're significantly increasing our SaaS-related spending. 
On an organic basis, factoring in the Arena acquisition, which closed in Q2 of fiscal '21, we actually expect non-GAAP OpEx growth to be closer to 2% at the midpoint of the ARR range. 
We also have a modest $5 million uptick in CapEx this year. OIE cash taxes remain approximately flat, and we see some expansion in the other category which is really the restructuring charge and change in working capital as the business grows. 
Moving to Slide 26. As you know, we currently present our ARR and revenue in 3 product categories: core, FSG and growth. Going forward, as Jim explained, we'll have 2 business units, Digital Thread and Velocity. So to align our reporting with how we look at the business, we'll be changing our ARR and revenue reporting buckets accordingly.  
Digital Thread will consist of core FSG and also IoT and AR from the current growth products. And when we report Digital Thread going forward, we'll provide the detailed split 1 level below. On the slide, the categories in bold text on the left represent our current disclosure. The categories on the right in bold green text represent our go-forward disclosure. And Velocity will consist of Onshape and Arena from the current growth products. 
Slide 27 shows what the recast ARR data looks like. I won't spend a lot of time on this as we published 3 years of historical ARR and revenue data in our new format within the financial data tables filed on the IR website. There are a couple of points I would make. First, please note that all of the historical constant currency ARR figures have been calculated using our fiscal '22 plan FX rates. Second, in addition to the Digital Thread and Velocity recast, we did a small recast of a portion of our Vuforia AR business, which removes approximately $6 million of ARR in both fiscal '21 and fiscal '20 and $5 million in fiscal '19. 
We made this change because we've come to realize there are certain buyers with marketing-oriented use cases who purchased Vuforia engine for short-term promotions without a true intention to use it on a recurring basis. The bulk of the Vuforia suite is unaffected and will continue to be sold on a recurring basis. We adjusted the historical amounts to enable go-forward comparability. 
And then lastly, just in terms of expectations for fiscal '22, starting with the Digital Thread core, we are targeting fiscal '22 ARR growth of 10% to 12%. This is consistent with our historical performance for Digital Thread growth. We're targeting fiscal '22 ARR growth accelerating back into the 20%-plus range. For Digital Thread FSG, we target fiscal '22 ARR growth of approximately flattish, again, consistent with historical performance and expectations. So in total, for Digital Thread, we're targeting ARR growth of 10% to 12%. For Velocity, we're targeting fiscal '22 ARR growth in the 20-plus percent range, given the strength of both Arena and Onshape. 
Moving on to Slide 28 and to provide some additional context. We highlight some of our guidance assumptions. They are all listed in our press release, and I've covered a few of them already, so I won't cover them all here. One point worth calling out is that we target to return approximately 50% of our cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases. In fiscal '22, we will also focus on delevering. Therefore, assuming $450 million of free cash flow, excluding restructuring, we would expect our buybacks to be about 25% of that amount with the rest going to delevering. 
So wrapping up, we had strong financial performance in fiscal '21, delivered on 4 quarters of meeting our ARR and free cash flow guidance, and this was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth while maintaining discipline on the expense structure. Most importantly, of course, we believe we're well positioned to deliver on the midterm targets we provided at our Investor Day last November. We're unlocking a significant multiyear catalyst by accelerating our SaaS transition, and we're also optimizing how we go to market with our Digital Thread and Velocity business units. I'm encouraged by how PTC continues to rapidly evolve to meet the needs of our customers. 
Moving on to Slide 29. We look forward to discussing today's news during the Q&A session and follow-up calls. Also, we will host an investor meeting on December 15 to further discuss our strategy and targets. Please save that date on your calendars. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A."

So let me try to hit a few of them quickly. As it relates to readiness for PLM, several years ago, we tried an experiment and began selling our retail vertical solution, PLM solution,",353,"Yes. Well, Jay, you've got a lot of points there that are interesting. So let me try to hit a few of them quickly. As it relates to readiness for PLM, several years ago, we tried an experiment and began selling our retail vertical solution, PLM solution, which we call Windchill Flex PLM as cloud-only. And we went to 100% cloud sales. And frankly, that's stuck, and we've been in that model for years now. And all the transactions we've done for years now have been in the cloud. That was an interesting proof point. 
Then if you look at, it's been creeping into our mainstream sales. And in fact, before we did the SaaS acceleration, we had planned that 25% of our PLM bookings in fiscal '22 would come in cloud form. So 25% would be software in the cloud and 75% would be software not in the cloud. And that's before we put like any incentives or muscle into it. 
So that plus the success that Arena is having, so far as I can see, Arena is the fastest-growing major PLM system in the world, and it's pure SaaS, and Windchill a second. So I love having that #1 and 2 growth position. And really, cloud is driving both of them. So I just think the market is telling us we're ready. 
And in fact, customers are literally telling us to our face, we're ready. But that doesn't mean the other stuff is not important. People aren't going to buy Windchill because it's in the cloud. They're going to buy Windchill because it's the best system for things like you talked about, billing material management, variation in configuration-driven digital mockups and service life cycle management and software and systems engineering. 
That functionality is highly differentiated, and then you bring in IoT and AR and wow. So we have a highly differentiated solution that's also in the cloud, and customers are saying, we want Windchill, and increasingly, we want it in the cloud. So that's kind of where we're at. We're just reading the signals and basically saying it's time to react."

Let me comment further and then also I want to hit a second related point related to your first question, Gal. I mean, frankly, if you look at it, Creo and Windchill, which are over $1 billion now of ARR, have churn rates much better than the company",372,"Yes. Let me comment further and then also I want to hit a second related point related to your first question, Gal. I mean, frankly, if you look at it, Creo and Windchill, which are over $1 billion now of ARR, have churn rates much better than the company average. And the other businesses that are growing faster, generally are less than the higher churn rates than the company average, and you average those together and you get the company average. 
But the thing is all of these growth businesses are themselves improving their churn rates quarter by quarter, year by year. And that's why we keep averaging down toward Creo and Windchill. So there's more where this came from, for sure, as it relates to churn improvement, and we expect to see it continue to come. 
And then back on the growth assumptions, what I wanted to say, I used this phrase more pathways to mid-teens growth. I think in the past, like, let's say, at our Investor Day last year, our recipe for mid-teens growth sort of had FSG flat using the old categories, FSG flat. We needed growth to be kind of at least close to double digits -- I'm sorry, we need the core business to be close to double digits, and then we needed really a 3 handle on the growth business. 
And now you say, well, wait a minute, if the growth business, even if it had a 2 handle, if the core business remains in low double digits or even perhaps a couple of points higher than that, you don't really need a 3 handle on the growth business anymore. So sort of like if everything works, we can do even better. But now we have room for 1 or 2 things not to work quite as well as we wanted and still get to respectable growth numbers. And even if we don't get to the mid-teens growth numbers with higher margins, we can still get to the cash flow number. So we feel like we've taken a more conservative posture. We still think all this stuff can work, but now it doesn't all have to work simultaneously for us to deliver some good numbers."

We need to launch everything. We need to start the sales cycles, then we need to close the orders. 
And if you put 6- to 9-month sales cycles on things, and we're not exactly sure how long it will take, but 6 to 9 months lands you in Q3 or Q4 already.

And we're doing that not by just reducing capability, but by simply implementing a much more efficient model with many less silos, much less management involved and so forth. So that's all goodness. 
There are other places we'll have efficiencies, like -- let me give you an example. If you belong to a field organization, you work in technical support, your mission is to make the customer happy even if it means solving the same problem dozens or hundreds of times quickly. If you are part of the product organization, your goal is to go back and talk to the product guys and tell them, make this product go away in the SaaS offering quickly so that no other customers are even aware that it ever did exist. So you can see there's like real efficiencies in terms of like how you solve customer problems. Are you trying to make them happy while they have the problem and repeat that hundreds and thousands of times? Or are you trying to make the problem go away so that the rest of the customers never knew it happened? Just to summarize. These are great efficiencies that we're going to go pursue."

I think if you look at the different classes of partners, it affects them differently. Let's start with Microsoft elated about this, as you might expect because it will bring a lot of business their way. If you look at Rockwell, Rockwell, too, is leaning into SaaS. And frankly, all of our SaaS products are easier for Rockwell to digest and to deliver on to their customers, than would be the on-premise variant. So I think Rockwell quite likes the strategy and maybe some of their own thinking about SaaS was born in our boardroom. I don't know. You'd have to ask Blake that, but I might speculate. 
And then I think like if you look at our resellers, it will change their world a little bit. They still need to go sell the software. They won't be as involved in delivering it, but then they're very much involved in the implementation of it at the customer side. So I don't want you to think as it relates to resellers or SIs that SaaS companies don't have SI partners. I mean, my God, Salesforce has a massive SI ecosystem. They just don't install software and perform upgrades at the customer site. They do system integration, they do adoption. They do business process transformation. They do all that stuff, which still has to happen. So that's kind of long term. 
I think SIs have to take the sort of posture they have relative to Salesforce and all those other SaaS companies, which we'll help them through, and the bigger ones like Accenture already know that play. 
And then for the smaller resellers, the other thing worth noting is that most of our resellers sell Creo and Kepware, and those products are sort of further out on the SaaS road map anyway. So that would be several years down the road before we even really come to that bridge."

However, what we're seeing with Arena and to a degree with Windchill is we have the cloudiest, SaaS-y-est solutions in the market, and that does help take share. Every piece of business that Arena is winning, they're taken from somebody else or it's a start-up company that they're winning at somebody else's expense. And Arena is the fastest-growing PLM solution in the market right now. 
So I do think it's both. And exactly what the balance will be, I don't know. I do think monetizing the customer base by delivering more value is a high probability, and it will drive a lot of growth by itself."

It maybe seems like there is rising interest in full platform deals. If I just think about the way Rockwell expanded the scope of the partnership to loop in more products or even Volvo, I think, when they were talking about the big CAD PLM deal, they spoke about this better pairing with existing IoT they have set up in their plants. So I'm just wondering, a, am I characterizing the demand environment correctly? And then, b, does the new business unit actually allow you to maybe better execute on cross-sells than has been the case?"

The new business unit is fundamentally formed to help us better execute on cross-sells because we do see that platform deal structure happening more and more. The example you gave with Volvo, I could repeat a dozen more examples of that of customers who started with 1 product and pretty soon, they have 2 and then 3 and they're trying out the fourth one and so forth. And we think that our products, Creo, Windchill, ThingWorx, Vuforia, work beautifully together, like voices in a choir. They make beautiful music together. And rather than selling these things separately, yes, we can use them all as entry points, but let's pursue entry points that then can be upsold and cross sold. 
And so I think Troy Richardson, was one of the first people to sort of ask, why don't you guys configure differently -- us guys now that he's here, but why don't we configure differently and go like pursue this harder, this cross-sell motion. So that's exactly what we're doing. And that's a little bit how the name Digital Thread came to be."

So again, we've been onboarding customers as SaaS for a while with PLM. And think of it that they're coming in at one margin, and what our goal is, is to make improvements behind the scenes that take them to another margin even at the same cost to the customer. So whether it's single tenant, multi-tenant, I mean if you're the customer on the customer end, you don't even know. But we, on the PTC end, we see the efficiencies we're gaining or not gaining, we do know. And so a lot of our investment is aimed at making the product more efficient for PTC to deliver as opposed to different from the UC Gen at the customer side. 
Now that said, if you look what we did with the subscription program, we pulled every lever we could come up with. If you remember that program when we used to talk about it, we used to say, I don't know, Kristian -- Kristian actually was the program executive. We had like 28 work streams and 300 people working on it. We changed pricing and packaging to favor subscription over at the time, perpetual. We paid more commission on a perpetual deal. We had certain offerings that were only -- I'm sorry, we paid more commission. I said that wrong on a subscription deal. We paid -- we had certain offerings that were only available, certain attractive sexy offerings, including the ANSYS stuff, by the way, that was only available subscription. So we basically stacked the deck in every customer conversation in a way that everybody wanted it to go subscription. We got the band back together. We're putting the same program together. We're going to stack the deck again in favor of SaaS this time."

However, much of the bookings in a Q4 does not land in ARR in the Q4. It's back to that start date discussion. So what I said is that ARR was less than we wanted it to be. It was mid-teens. And frankly, we've said we wanted to have a 2 handle. 
Now bookings in every quarter of fiscal '21 were higher than the previous year quarter in fiscal '20. So there is some bookings momentum happening. And then another thing is we launched this DPM solution that, frankly, we've been working on for 2 years. It's a major piece of software that we launched and already has quite some customer interest. 
So we sort of feel like the combination of the bookings momentum we have, including and especially in Q4 and then the launch of DPM and the trends we're seeing, they bode well for what should happen next year. 
Okay. Operator, I think we have time for maybe 1 more question."

I think what you should think, first of all, is that DPM will become a category of solutions. And what we're launching first is DPM for factory, digital performance management of what happens in a factory. There will be solutions that are more focused on digital performance management of a fleet of products out in the field at customer sites. But fundamentally, what we're trying to do is move from selling a toolkit where the customer does the solutioning themselves to selling a turnkey solution with a very strong value proposition, sold to executives, not to developers, sold on the basis of the business value it will generate and then implement it quickly into production. 
So yes, it's a very different sales motion. I mean, number one, we're selling to executives, not selling to developers. Number two, we're selling business value, not speeds and feeds, technical stuff. And I think it's really where we wanted to take this business for a while. So I'm very pleased with this solution. It took us a while to develop it, as I said, but it's a powerful piece of software, and it really gives us kind of a new platform to build on going forward with IoT. 
It makes IoT, if I could, a lot like how we sell PLM. We sell PLM to executives based on business value. We were selling IoT to developers as a toolkit. And now we'll sell PLM and DPM as business value to executives. Different executives, mind you, but executives.  
Okay. So great. Thank you. Well, operator, maybe I'll just take it from here. So first, again, my apologies, this is like the strangest earnings call I've had again, and it's the 44th one as CEO. So it's a bit odd. But nonetheless, I think we got a lot of good information out there, and you guys had some great questions, and I appreciate it. 
So in closing, I mean, we're in a great place. I really like PTC setup going forward. The changes we announced are good for growth. They're good for profitability. They're going to put us in a stronger position to hit both the top line and bottom line targets that we have out there. So we're looking forward to continuing the discussion with you on follow-up calls at investor conferences. I'm going to be at the Berenberg conference, at least virtually next week or I guess it's 2 weeks out maybe. No, it's next week. And we look forward to seeing you at our investor meeting on December 15. 
So thanks, everybody, and have a good evening."
